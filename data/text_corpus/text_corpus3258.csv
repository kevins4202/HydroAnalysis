16290,methylmercury mehg can be bioaccumulated through food chains and adversely affect human health reservoirs are reported to stimulate mehg production however the characteristics of mehg dynamics in cascade reservoirs and the associated relations to sedimentation as well as reservoir properties remained unclear here we investigated sediment mehg dynamics in eight cascade reservoirs in the upper mekong river we found significant differences in sediment mehg concentration between the reservoirs showing an increase with fluctuations along the reservoirs cascade however a novel relationship was found between sediment mehg mehg hg and the ratio of reservoir hydraulic residence time hrt to reservoir age this relationship is formed by the joint effects of the original deposit of hg and organic carbon oc before impoundment and the subsequent sedimentation of hg and oc after impoundment the original deposit is continuously transformed as the reservoir ages whereas the latter is driven by the annual hydrological cycle and hrt of which the hrt is dominant this finding cannot be easily revealed in a single reservoir or by comparing multiple reservoirs in different rivers the discovery is of great significance to understand hg geochemical cycling in reservoirs which is quickly increasing in rivers worldwide graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methylmercury

threaten human health gao et al 2018 human exposure to mehg results in long term neurocognitive deficits in children and persists till adulthood which cost more than us 20 billion per year globally bellanger et al 2013 this health risk may get severe in the future because of the continuous increase in mehg schartup et al 2019 inland waters are a suitable environment for mehg production and have gained considerable attentions worldwide bravo et al 2017 kim et al 2013 hg methylation is influenced by various environmental factors bravo et al 2018 seelen et al 2021 cossa et al 2014 established a strong positive correlation between mehg and hg in aquatic sediment bravo et al 2017 found that organic carbon oc derived from phytoplankton can enhance mehg production in boreal lake sediments through an overall stimulation of bacterial activity ma et al 2018 pointed out that hg methylation is related to hgcab anaerobic gene distribution in the sediment of the three gorges reservoir rivers are important pathways for hg transport and methylation liu et al 2019b zhang et al 2015 in the past few decades many large rivers have been heavily dammed until now over 1 million dams have been constructed currently planned or are under construction worldwide best 2019 gernaat et al 2017 dam construction significantly modifies the hydrological regime of natural rivers by weakening hydrodynamic conditions and increasing hydraulic residence time hrt resulting in the accumulation of sediment and the retention of hg and oc liu et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 as well as the potential enhancement of hg methylation kasper et al 2014 the change of water depth caused by the reservoir can also enhance the sediment hg methylation by changing the level of dissolved oxygen do eckley et al 2015 with reservoir operation the continuous decomposition and consumption of oc changes the environment of hg methylation louis et al 2004 this was also confirmed by rolfhus et al 2015 wherein mehg production in a reservoir decreases with the reservoir age overall reservoir properties hrt water depth age etc play important roles in the mehg dynamics of a reservoir however current studies on a single reservoir cannot provide sufficient understanding on the dynamics of mehg in relation to reservoir hydrological and physical properties which brings challenges to the risk management of mehg in reservoirs nowadays reservoir cascades i e a series of reservoir along one river become increasingly common in hydropower development especially in large rivers chen et al 2020 the spatial order either from upstream to downstream or vice versa of the cascade dams are usually not constructed in a time sequence it is usually difficult to obtain spatial patterns of substance e g nitrogen phosphorus heavy metals etc distribution along a cascade as new dam construction within an existing cascade disrupts the established features chen et al 2020 besides the storages are different between reservoirs resulting in differences in hrt of cascade reservoirs however the diverse properties of cascade reservoirs in a river provide a great opportunity to unveil how reservoir sedimentation and physical properties affect mehg dynamics in dammed rivers here we studied the variations of hg mehg and mehg mehg hg in the sediment of a reservoir cascade system in the mainstream of the upper mekong river a trans boundary river in southeast asia with great disputes concerning the eco environmental impacts of hydropower developments we aimed to understand the characteristics of reservoir mehg dynamics in relation to reservoir sedimentation and physicals properties by using the data from the cascade reservoirs in one river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the transboundary mekong river originates from the tibetan plateau and discharges into the south china sea it flows through 6 countries including china myanmar thailand laos cambodia and vietnam with a total length of 4909 km and drains an area of 795 000 km2 with a mean annual discharge of 15 000 m3 s 1 liu et al 2020 in china the upper mekong river flows in a narrow valley with the altitude dropping from 5200 0 m to 550 0 m the climate along the way shifts gradually from the plateau climate to tropical climate with the main runoff supply source changing from glacier snowmelt to rainfall by 2018 nine hydropower dams have been built in the upper mekong river forming a reservoir cascade of huangdeng hd dahua dh miaowei mv gongguoqiao ggq xiaowan xw manwan mw dachaoshan dcs nuozhadu nzd and jinghong jh as shown in fig 1 and table s1 supporting information 2 2 sediment sampling we conducted a field survey in the 8 reservoirs over a 1020 km length of the upper mekong river fig 1 the jh reservoir was not considered due to administrative reasons all samples were collected in october 2018 the collection of samples was started dedicatedly after a relatively long non rainy period no rainfall for 20 days and avoided rainy days during the sampling the field sampling was conducted one time because the study area has no distinct seasonality with respect to hydrometeorological regime chen et al 2020 besides changes in sediment environment are much slower than water body and are usually investigated at an annual scale hauer et al 2018 considering the spatial variations in sedimentation surface sediment samples were collected from 3 sites in the lacustrine zone of each reservoir fig 1 red circles to investigate the spatial patterns of hg and mehg in a single reservoir surface sediment samples were intensively collected at 10 sites s1 s10 with an interval of 25 km from the reservoir tail to the dam front in the xw reservoir fig 1 yellow circles the biggest one in the cascade at each sampling site surface sediments depth about 8 cm were collected in triplicate using an ekman grab sampler and homogenized table s2 supporting information then 200 g surface sediment samples were stored in 50 ml tubes corning usa and kept frozen additionally approximately 20 g surface sediment samples were kept in sterile polyethylene cryotubes sealed and stored in the dark at 80 c until further microbial analysis during the surface sediment sampling and analysis field blank milli q water was introduced to ensure that sampling and analytical processes are not contaminated sediment cores were taken using an uwitec gravity corer φ120 mm 600 mm table s2 supporting information at the reservoir tail s2 reservoir middle s6 and dam front s9 of the xw reservoir in april 2019 the sediment cores were sealed to avoid interference by air and immediately transported to the laboratory for 24 h of vertical standing the top of the sediment core was covered with the in situ overlying water with a height of approximately 5 cm flat diffusive gradient in thin films dgt was applied to obtain the labile hg and mehg contents at different depths in sediment cores bratkič et al 2019 roulier et al 2010 before use the dgt probes were deoxygenated with pure n2 in milli q water for 24 h dgt probes for hg and mehg were pushed into each sediment core gently at a depth of 60 mm then the dgt probes were deployed for 24 h by monitoring every 2 h the overlying water ph was between 8 81 and 8 97 and the temperature was stable at 17 32 c 0 56 c indicating a steady environmental condition after 24 h the probes were rinsed with milli q water each resin gel was segmented into 2 mm vertical 6 mm horizontal slices and soaked with 5 ml 1 mol l 1 hno3 for 24 h in a 10 ml tube then 5 ml milli q water was added after removing the pure gel for laboratory analysis blank resin gels were detected simultaneously to ensure that the process of dgt extract preparation and analysis was not contaminated do ph and temperature of overlying water were monitored by the ysi exo2 usa at each sampling site the cross sectional mean flow velocity was calculated for the sample sites text s1 in

matrix spikes and duplicates blank spikes were performed in five sample intervals standard solutions for hg gbw07423 gss 9 and mehg erm cc580 were made covering the full range of sample concentrations detection limits were estimated by the standard deviation of the blanks and were 0 002 and 0 001 ng g 1 for hg and mehg respectively recoveries for blank spikes were in the range of 90 102 and 92 109 for hg and mehg analysis respectively recoveries for matrix spikes were in the range of 84 97 and 86 102 for hg and mehg analysis respectively the average relative standard deviations for the duplicate analysis of hg and mehg for samples were from 1 6 to 5 9 and from 0 8 to 6 3 respectively the labile hg and mehg in dgt extracts were analyzed through cvafs tekran 2600 tekran inc canada

analysis respectively recoveries for matrix spikes were in the range of 89 96 and 91 99 for hg and mehg analysis respectively the ratio of mghg to hg mehg was calculated surface sediment oc was analyzed using an elemental analyzer vario macro cube elementar inc germany the surface sediment grain size in fresh samples was analyzed using a mastersizer 2000 laser grain size meter clay 4 μm silt

china dna extraction was performed using powersoil dna isolation kits sybr premix ex taq toyobo japan quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr was used to quantify the hgcab for hg methylation in sediments the hgcab abundance was quantified using the degenerate primer pairs ornl delta hgca and ornl archaea hgca for the deltaproteobacterial and archaeal methylators respectively liu et al 2018b parks et al 2013 however most of the hgcab abundance from archaea was below the detection limit while using the primers of ornl archaea hgca f and ornl archaea hgca r hence the hgcab in deltaproteobacteria was selected for qpcr analysis all reactions were completed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 10 μl sybr premix ex taq toyobo japan 0 8 μl 0 5 μm of each primer bsa 3 mg ml 1

2019 the standard curve was established by serial dilution 10 2 10 8 of known concentration plasmid dna with the target fragment three negative controls without dna template were included for each pcr run in the process of analysis we made standards using the same batch of environmental samples and calibrated the qpcr program through the standard concentration gradient and primers 2 4 data processing and analyses the dgt hg and dgt mehg concentrations at different depths of sediment cores in the xw reservoir were calculated as follows c dgt m δ g d a t where m is the mass of accumulated labile hg and mehg on the resin gel δg is the thickness of diffusive layer d is the diffusion coefficient of hg in the gel a is the area of exposed surface and t is the exposure time wavelet analysis can be used to decompose a signal into multiple components with different scales in this study the data of dgt hg and dgt mehg at different depths of sediment cores was decomposed by wavelet analysis to characterize the sedimentation processes of hg and mehg in reservoirs morlet function was selected as the mother wavelet function which has been widely used to identify periods of oscillated signals wu et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 before wavelet analyses the vertical distributions of dgt hg and dgt mehg concentrations at different depths in sediment cores were associated with the historical sedimentation time by calculating the sedimentation rate for each time series of cumulative depth xn t 0 n yr 1 the wavelet coefficient was calculated as follows w n a b a 1 2 x t φ t b a d t where wn a b is the wavelet coefficient that denotes the characteristics of the signal change at different timescales a is a scaling parameter that denotes the degree of compression or scale b is the time shift or translation parameter that denotes the time location of the wavelet φ t is the morlet wavelet function and φ t is the complex conjugate of φ t the statistical significance for difference between reservoirs was analyzed by one way analysis of variance the post hoc multiple comparisons of different sampling sites were analyzed using tukey s least significant difference procedure before variance analysis a normality test using variance homogeneity test was conducted all statistical analyses were performed using spss v22 0 spss inc north chicago il usa a p value less than 0 10 was considered as statistically significant wavelet toolbox in matlab 2018b mathworks inc massachusetts usa provided functions for analyzing the historical sedimentation of dgt hg and dgt mehg in sediment cores 3 results 3 1 hg and mehg in surface sediment of the cascade reservoirs surface sediment mehg concentration in cascade reservoirs exhibited non monotonic increase along the river while hg concentration had little change fig 2 a although mehg was affected by both mehg and hg its variations showed a similar behavior to mehg correlation analyses fig 2b c indicated that mehg in surface sediment was positively correlated with hrt r 2 0 45 p 0 10 and negatively correlated with reservoir age r 2 0 80 p 0 10 furthermore an interesting relationship was found between mehg y and the ratio x of hrt to reservoir age y 0 82x 0 20 r 2 0 85 p 0 10 fig 2d based on the established relationship above mehg level could be well zonated according to the hrt and age of reservoirs fig 3 newly constructed reservoirs with a large hrt tend to have high mehg level in contrast old reservoirs with small hrt were featured by low mehg level 3 2 hg and mehg in surface sediment of a single reservoir after dam construction the cross sectional mean flow velocity gradually decreased from reservoir tail to dam front fig 4 a surface sediment grain size d 50 decreased along the flow direction but slightly increased in front of the dam the trend of d 50 was opposite with that of surface sediment hg fig 4a c whereas it had no obvious correlation with sediment oc fig 4a table s1 supporting information correlation analyses showed that hg in surface sediment was positively correlated to the clay proportion but negatively correlated or irrelevant to the proportions of silt and sand fig 4b the hgcab abundance in surface sediment decreased from reservoir tail to s3 site fig 4d and increased from s3 site to dam front the opposite changes in surface sediment hgcab abundance and oc reflect the consumption of oc by the microorganism fig 4a d the mehg in surface sediment from reservoir tail to dam front showed a similar pattern to hgcab abundance fig 4d overall mehg concentration in surface sediment showed gradual increasing and then decreasing pattern from the reservoir tail to reservoir middle and then to the dam front fig 4c 3 3 dgt hg and mehg in sediment cores of a single reservoir in the xw reservoir the vertical profile of dgt hg concentrations at reservoir tail reservoir middle and dam front fluctuated with the mean values of 29 14 33 87 and 29 66 ng l 1 respectively fig 5 a vertically resolved mean concentrations of dgt mehg were 0 25 ng l 1 at the reservoir tail 0 59 ng l 1 at the reservoir middle and 0 20 ng l 1 at the dam front respectively fig 5b both dgt hg and mehg concentrations were higher at the reservoir middle site than the reservoir tail and dam front an observation similar to surface sediment fig 4c in contrast vertical profile of dgt mehg and mehg exhibited relatively stronger fluctuations than dgt hg fig 5 in general dgt hg dgt mehg and mehg the ratio of dgt hg dgt mehg significantly fluctuated at the reservoir middle which corresponded to the large concentration of fine sediment fig 4a the sedimentation rate in the xw reservoir was estimated to be 29 89 mm yr 1 text s3 supporting information through wavelet analyses the real part contour graphs and wavelet coefficients of dgt hg dgt mehg and mehg accumulation features were obtained fig 6 the time series of dgt hg dgt mehg and mehg accumulation contained strong bi oscillation signals the periods of the first signal of dgt hg dgt mehg and mehg were 2 07 2 27 years 2 13 2 27 years and 2 13 2 27 years respectively the periods of the second signal were 1 00 1 07 years 1 07 years and 1 00 1 07 years respectively 4 discussion 4 1 spatially irregular variations of hg and mehg along cascade reservoirs in natural river systems hg methylation is weak because of a short hrt and limited hg and oc eiriksdottir et al 2017 sun et al 2017 in the upper mekong river however the construction of cascade reservoirs has resulted in the inundation of a certain amount of land the construction of dams has also extended the hrt from 0 07 to 6 30 years resulting in the sedimentation of hg and oc as well as the enhancement of anoxic environment in sediment table s1 supporting information haynes et al 2017 shi et al 2017 the accumulation of hg and oc as well as the changes of hydro environment in reservoirs potentially alter mehg dynamics in river systems accordingly mehg concentration in the cascade reservoirs of the upper mekong river showed an increasing trend with fluctuations fig 2a however the mehg concentration was not significantly correlated to the concentration of sediment hg or environmental factors such as oc and water temperature table s1 and fig s1 in supporting information oc could not well explain the patterns of sediment mehg in the reservoirs which is because the bioavailable carbon is the one with an actual role in hg methylation bravo et al 2017 mazrui et al 2016 the decomposition of oc to bioavailable carbon is largely affected by reservoir hrt table s1 supporting information evans et al 2017 indicating the important roles of reservoirs properties in mehg dynamics the fluctuation of mehg was basically consistent with that of mehg fig 2a which further confirmed the important roles of reservoir properties in mehg dynamics demethylation is not considered since its probability is marginal in sediment klapstein and o driscoll 2018 the timing of construction of the cascade reservoirs is not in an order either from upstream to downstream or vice versa so there are no spatially regular features observed in mehg and mehg while the regulation capacities were significantly different leading to difference in hrt as well as reservoir age along the way table s1 supporting information thus holistic analyses on the cascaded reservoirs were conducted to explore the effects of reservoir properties on mehg the data of five reservoirs whose operation periods are over one year were used for the analyses the reservoirs with an age less than one year were excluded because sediment dynamics in a reservoir is primarily affected by annually hydrological cycles feng et al 2009 gosnell et al 2016 therefore only the reservoirs with an age of at least one year could be used to establish the relationship fig 2 the results showed that mehg in surface sediment was positively correlated with hrt fig 2b and negatively correlated with reservoir age fig 2c this explained the low mehg in reservoirs of ggq and mw fig 2a as the two reservoirs have small hrt and large reservoir age respectively table s1 supporting information fig 3 furthermore a relationship was found that mehg showed a strong positive correlation to the ratio of hrt to reservoir age fig 2d which confirmed that mehg dynamics in reservoirs was jointly regulated by hrt and reservoir age but not by spatial sequence since only the reservoirs with operation time for at least one full hydrological year could be included for the analysis only five reservoirs meeting the criteria this could be the reason that the significance was not high p value however the available data could to some extent demonstrate the relationship between mehg and the ratio of hrt to reservoir age in future more reservoirs in the upper mekong river will have their operation time over one year and then more data could be available to further verify this finding 4 2 effects of surface sediment grain size on hg and mehg variations within a reservoir river damming weakens the hydrodynamic conditions and causes sediment deposition best 2019 when the sediment settles coarse and fine particles are separated along the way the former deposits first while the latter travels farther kelly and rudd 2018 in the xiaowan reservoir the sediment grain size d 50 declined along with the decrease of flow velocity fig 4a however it slightly increased near the dam front due to the increased bottom flow velocity incurred by the water intake for hydropower production and the flood dispatch thereby flushing out the fine sediment chen et al 2021 guertault et al 2017 fine sediment has a strong sorption ability because of the larger surface area per unit mass kelly and rudd 2018 correlation analyses revealed that surface sediment hg was positively correlated with clay proportion fig 4b indicating that hg was mainly attached to clay and showed a similar variation behavior with clay along the way hg methylation is a microbially mediated process liu et al 2018b this study showed that the change of mehg along the way was in line with that of hgcab fig 4c d sediment is a carrier of methylation microbes and an active site for hg methylation feng et al 2009 yang et al 2016 the decrease in the hgcab at the reservoir tail s1 to s3 could be attributed to the release from the upstream reservoir fig 4d methylation microbes are anaerobic blum et al 2013 mccord et al 2016 the overall decrease of hgcab s4 to s10 was mainly due to the decrease in the level of do fig s2 hence as the carrier of hg oc and methylation microbes the variation of sediment settlement along the way played the core role in hg sedimentation and methylation during reservoir storing and discharging 4 3 joint effects of hrt and reservoir age on mehg dynamics within a reservoir sediment cores record the historical sedimentation features of particles lintern et al 2016 the sedimentation process in a reservoir is affected by the input from drainage area and water exchange which has significant impacts on the vertical accumulations of hg and mehg liu et al 2018a lintern et al 2016 in the dgt samplings and wavelet analyses results fig 6 fig s3 the variations of dgt hg dgt mehg and mehg with a period of about one year were driven by the annual hydrological cycle and for the period of about 2 19 years it was close to the hrt of the xw reservoir table s1 supporting information these indicated that the oscillation of dgt hg dgt mehg and mehg in sediment cores were jointly regulated by the annual hydrological cycle and hrt the effect of the annual hydrological cycle on the vertical distributions of sediment dgt hg and dgt mehg was attributed to the runoffs which carry hg and mehg into the reservoir gosnell et al 2016 zheng et al 2016 fig 6a b fig s4 supporting information compared with the annual hydrological cycle the variations of dgt hg dgt mehg and mehg were more strongly driven by the hrt fig 6 fig s3 this is because the upper mekong river is a canyon river with small intermediate input of hg and oc shi et al 2017 meanwhile with the hg methylation the interannual variations of dgt mehg and mehg in a reservoir were stronger than that of dgt hg fig 5c fig 6c dgt mehg and mehg dynamics were affected in many ways with the extension of hrt due to river damming bravo et al 2018 cha et al 2017 evans et al 2017 firstly the weakening of hydrodynamic condition enhances the retention of hg and oc secondly more time for hg methylation is provided thirdly the produced mehg is less released downstream evans et al 2017 nogueira et al 2002 shi et al 2017 besides the annual sedimentation after reservoir construction the original deposit is also an important factor affecting mehg dynamics dam construction inundates a certain amount of land and intercepts the sediment in runoff leading to an upsurge of hg and oc in a reservoir at the beginning of impoundment bodaly et al 2007 parks and baker 1997 for a canyon river the subsequent sedimentation from the basin is limited fan et al 2015 thus the reservoir is forced to continuously use the originally stored oc as the reservoir ages the original deposit is gradually exhausted resulting in an attenuation of hg methylation this has been observed in studies that continuously monitor some single reservoirs louis et al 2004 rolfhus et al 2015 the relatively high mehg in the dcs reservoir with older age fig 3 might due to the input of extra oc brought by regional floods this could be partially supported by the sudden increases in sediment d 50 and hg concentration in the reservoir table s1 supporting information fig 2a however our further investigations are needed it should be pointed out that strictly speaking the contents of hg and mehg in sediment should be measured because labile hg and mehg concentrations obtained by dgt cannot be equivalent to the sediment hg and mehg contents li et al 2021 liu et al 2019a however they could to some extent reflect the contents of labile hg and mehg in sediment meanwhile labile fractions of hg and mehg receive more attentions in risk management because they are more easily released to surrounding environment and cause toxic effects 5 conclusion by analyzing sediment hg mehg and mehg in the cascade reservoirs along one large river the study reached the following findings 1 the sediment mehg in a reservoir had a positive correlation with the ratio of the reservoir hrt to age 2 the size separated sedimentation along the flow direction was the key factor affecting the spatial patterns of sediment hg mehg and mehg within a reservoir 3 the dynamics of sediment mehg in a reservoir were jointly regulated by the original deposit of hg and oc during initial impoundment and the subsequent sedimentation of hg and oc after operation the former is used continuously as the reservoir ages whereas the latter are driven by the annual hydrological cycle and reservoir hrt of which the hrt is dominant in line with these findings newly constructed reservoirs with large hrt in the most upstream area could be hotspots of mehg pollution thus deserves more attentions to risk management in addition due to the sedimentation in almost stagnant water in reservoirs the concentration of suspended particle matter is very low and thus the mehg dynamics in water body were not investigated in this study however it could be incorporated in future work author contributions q chen and j zhang designed and supervised the study

sediment samples were collected from 3 sites in the lacustrine zone of each reservoir fig 1 red circles to investigate the spatial patterns of hg and mehg in a single reservoir surface sediment samples were intensively collected at 10 sites s1 s10 with an interval of 25 km from the reservoir tail to the dam front in the xw reservoir fig 1 yellow circles the biggest one in the cascade at each sampling site surface sediments depth about 8 cm were collected in triplicate using an ekman grab sampler and homogenized table s2 supporting information then 200 g surface sediment samples were stored in 50 ml tubes corning usa and kept frozen additionally approximately 20 g surface sediment samples were kept in sterile polyethylene cryotubes sealed and stored in the dark at 80 c until further microbial analysis during the surface sediment sampling and analysis field blank milli q water was introduced to ensure that sampling and analytical processes are not contaminated sediment cores were taken using an uwitec gravity corer φ120 mm 600 mm table s2 supporting information at the reservoir tail s2 reservoir middle s6 and dam front s9 of the xw reservoir in april 2019 the sediment cores were sealed to avoid interference by air and immediately transported to the laboratory for 24 h of vertical standing the top of the sediment core was covered with the in situ overlying water with a height of approximately 5 cm flat diffusive gradient in thin films dgt was applied to obtain the labile hg and mehg contents at different depths in sediment cores bratkič et al 2019 roulier et al 2010 before use the dgt probes were deoxygenated with pure n2 in milli q water for 24 h dgt probes for hg and mehg were pushed into each sediment core gently at a depth of 60 mm then the dgt probes were deployed for 24 h by monitoring every 2 h the overlying water ph was between 8 81 and 8 97 and the temperature was stable at 17 32 c 0 56 c indicating a steady environmental condition after 24 h the probes were rinsed with milli q water each resin gel was segmented into 2 mm vertical 6 mm horizontal slices and soaked with 5 ml 1 mol l 1 hno3 for 24 h in a 10 ml tube then 5 ml milli q water was added after removing the pure gel for laboratory analysis blank resin gels were detected simultaneously to ensure that the process of dgt extract preparation and analysis was not contaminated do ph and temperature of overlying water were monitored by the ysi exo2 usa at each sampling site the cross sectional mean flow velocity was calculated for the sample sites text s1 in

randomly selected from the homogenized surface sediment sample for testing the hg and mehg in sediment were analyzed using a cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometer cvafs tekran 2600 tekran inc canada detailed process is recorded in text s2 of supporting information for the analysis of hg and mehg quality assurance of analytical processes was conducted by use of method blanks blank spikes matrix spikes and duplicates blank spikes were performed in five sample intervals standard solutions for hg gbw07423 gss 9 and mehg erm cc580 were made covering the full range of sample concentrations detection limits were estimated by the standard deviation of the blanks and were 0 002 and 0 001 ng g 1 for hg and mehg respectively recoveries for blank spikes were in the range of 90 102 and 92 109 for hg and mehg analysis respectively recoveries for matrix spikes were in the range of 84 97 and 86 102 for hg and mehg analysis respectively the average relative standard deviations for the duplicate analysis of hg and mehg for samples were from 1 6 to 5 9 and from 0 8 to 6 3 respectively the labile hg and mehg in dgt extracts were analyzed through cvafs tekran 2600 tekran inc canada text s2 quality assurance was conducted by using method blanks blank spikes and matrix spikes given that no specific standard solutions are available for dgt standard solutions were made by hg gbw07423 gss 9 and mehg erm cc580 for blank resin gels a known amount of hg or mehg solution was added to resin gels recoveries for blank spikes were in the range of 94 101 and 93 109 for hg and mehg analysis respectively recoveries for matrix spikes were in the range of 89 96 and 91 99 for hg and mehg analysis respectively the ratio of mghg to hg mehg was calculated surface sediment oc was analyzed using an elemental analyzer vario macro cube elementar inc germany the surface sediment grain size in fresh samples was analyzed using a mastersizer 2000 laser grain size meter clay 4 μm silt 4 64 μm and sand 64 μm bing et al 2016 prior to grain size analysis the surface sediment sample was dispersed using an ultrasonic oscillator ps 60a shenzhen shenghuatai ultrasonic equipment co ltd china dna extraction was performed using powersoil dna isolation kits sybr premix ex taq toyobo japan quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr was used to quantify the hgcab for hg methylation in sediments the hgcab abundance was quantified using the degenerate primer pairs ornl delta hgca and ornl archaea hgca for the deltaproteobacterial and archaeal methylators respectively liu et al 2018b parks et al 2013 however most of the hgcab abundance from archaea was below the detection limit while using the primers of ornl archaea hgca f and ornl archaea hgca r hence the hgcab in deltaproteobacteria was selected for qpcr analysis all reactions were completed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 10 μl sybr premix ex taq toyobo japan 0 8 μl 0 5 μm of each primer bsa 3 mg ml 1

2019 the standard curve was established by serial dilution 10 2 10 8 of known concentration plasmid dna with the target fragment three negative controls without dna template were included for each pcr run in the process of analysis we made standards using the same batch of environmental samples and calibrated the qpcr program through the standard concentration gradient and primers 2 4 data processing and analyses the dgt hg and dgt mehg concentrations at different depths of sediment cores in the xw reservoir were calculated as follows c dgt m δ g d a t where m is the mass of accumulated labile hg and mehg on the resin gel δg is the thickness of diffusive layer d is the diffusion coefficient of hg in the gel a is the area of exposed surface and t is the exposure time wavelet analysis can be used to decompose a signal into multiple components with different scales in this study the data of dgt hg and dgt mehg at different depths of sediment cores was decomposed by wavelet analysis to characterize the sedimentation processes of hg and mehg in reservoirs morlet function was selected as the mother wavelet function which has been widely used to identify periods of oscillated signals wu et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 before wavelet analyses the vertical distributions of dgt hg and dgt mehg concentrations at different depths in sediment cores were associated with the historical sedimentation time by calculating the sedimentation rate for each time series of cumulative depth xn t 0 n yr 1 the wavelet coefficient was calculated as follows w n a b a 1 2 x t φ t b a d t where wn a b is the wavelet coefficient that denotes the characteristics of the signal change at different timescales a is a scaling parameter that denotes the degree of compression or scale b is the time shift or translation parameter that denotes the time location of the wavelet φ t is the morlet wavelet function and φ t is the complex conjugate of φ t the statistical significance for difference between reservoirs was analyzed by one way analysis of variance the post hoc multiple comparisons of different sampling sites were analyzed using tukey s least significant difference procedure before variance analysis a normality test using variance homogeneity test was conducted all statistical analyses were performed using spss v22 0 spss inc north chicago il usa a p value less than 0 10 was considered as statistically significant wavelet toolbox in matlab 2018b mathworks inc massachusetts usa provided functions for analyzing the historical sedimentation of dgt hg and dgt mehg in sediment cores 3 results 3 1 hg and mehg in surface sediment of the cascade reservoirs surface sediment mehg concentration in cascade reservoirs exhibited non monotonic increase along the river while hg concentration had little change fig 2 a although mehg was affected by both mehg and hg its variations showed a similar behavior to mehg correlation analyses fig 2b c indicated that mehg in surface sediment was positively correlated with hrt r 2 0 45 p 0 10 and negatively correlated with reservoir age r 2 0 80 p 0 10 furthermore an interesting relationship was found between mehg y and the ratio x of hrt to reservoir age y 0 82x 0 20 r 2 0 85 p 0 10 fig 2d based on the established relationship above mehg level could be well zonated according to the hrt and age of reservoirs fig 3 newly constructed reservoirs with a large hrt tend to have high mehg level in contrast old reservoirs with small hrt were featured by low mehg level 3 2 hg and mehg in surface sediment of a single reservoir after dam construction the cross sectional mean flow velocity gradually decreased from reservoir tail to dam front fig 4 a surface sediment grain size d 50 decreased along the flow direction but slightly increased in front of the dam the trend of d 50 was opposite with that of surface sediment hg fig 4a c whereas it had no obvious correlation with sediment oc fig 4a table s1 supporting information correlation analyses showed that hg in surface sediment was positively correlated to the clay proportion but negatively correlated or irrelevant to the proportions of silt and sand fig 4b the hgcab abundance in surface sediment decreased from reservoir tail to s3 site fig 4d and increased from s3 site to dam front the opposite changes in surface sediment hgcab abundance and oc reflect the consumption of oc by the microorganism fig 4a d the mehg in surface sediment from reservoir tail to dam front showed a similar pattern to hgcab abundance fig 4d overall mehg concentration in surface sediment showed gradual increasing and then decreasing pattern from the reservoir tail to reservoir middle and then to the dam front fig 4c 3 3 dgt hg and mehg in sediment cores of a single reservoir in the xw reservoir the vertical profile of dgt hg concentrations at reservoir tail reservoir middle and dam front fluctuated with the mean values of 29 14 33 87 and 29 66 ng l 1 respectively fig 5 a vertically resolved mean concentrations of dgt mehg were 0 25 ng l 1 at the reservoir tail 0 59 ng l 1 at the reservoir middle and 0 20 ng l 1 at the dam front respectively fig 5b both dgt hg and mehg concentrations were higher at the reservoir middle site than the reservoir tail and dam front an observation similar to surface sediment fig 4c in contrast vertical profile of dgt mehg and mehg exhibited relatively stronger fluctuations than dgt hg fig 5 in general dgt hg dgt mehg and mehg the ratio of dgt hg dgt mehg significantly fluctuated at the reservoir middle which corresponded to the large concentration of fine sediment fig 4a the sedimentation rate in the xw reservoir was estimated to be 29 89 mm yr 1 text s3 supporting information through wavelet analyses the real part contour graphs and wavelet coefficients of dgt hg dgt mehg and mehg accumulation features were obtained fig 6 the time series of dgt hg dgt mehg and mehg accumulation contained strong bi oscillation signals the periods of the first signal of dgt hg dgt mehg and mehg were 2 07 2 27 years 2 13 2 27 years and 2 13 2 27 years respectively the periods of the second signal were 1 00 1 07 years 1 07 years and 1 00 1 07 years respectively 4 discussion 4 1 spatially irregular variations of hg and mehg along cascade reservoirs in natural river systems hg methylation is weak because of a short hrt and limited hg and oc eiriksdottir et al 2017 sun et al 2017 in the upper mekong river however the construction of cascade reservoirs has resulted in the inundation of a certain amount of land the construction of dams has also extended the hrt from 0 07 to 6 30 years resulting in the sedimentation of hg and oc as well as the enhancement of anoxic environment in sediment table s1 supporting information haynes et al 2017 shi et al 2017 the accumulation of hg and oc as well as the changes of hydro environment in reservoirs potentially alter mehg dynamics in river systems accordingly mehg concentration in the cascade reservoirs of the upper mekong river showed an increasing trend with fluctuations fig 2a however the mehg concentration was not significantly correlated to the concentration of sediment hg or environmental factors such as oc and water temperature table s1 and fig s1 in supporting information oc could not well explain the patterns of sediment mehg in the reservoirs which is because the bioavailable carbon is the one with an actual role in hg methylation bravo et al 2017 mazrui et al 2016 the decomposition of oc to bioavailable carbon is largely affected by reservoir hrt table s1 supporting information evans et al 2017 indicating the important roles of reservoirs properties in mehg dynamics the fluctuation of mehg was basically consistent with that of mehg fig 2a which further confirmed the important roles of reservoir properties in mehg dynamics demethylation is not considered since its probability is marginal in sediment klapstein and o driscoll 2018 the timing of construction of the cascade reservoirs is not in an order either from upstream to downstream or vice versa so there are no spatially regular features observed in mehg and mehg while the regulation capacities were significantly different leading to difference in hrt as well as reservoir age along the way table s1 supporting information thus holistic analyses on the cascaded reservoirs were conducted to explore the effects of reservoir properties on mehg the data of five reservoirs whose operation periods are over one year were used for the analyses the reservoirs with an age less than one year were excluded because sediment dynamics in a reservoir is primarily affected by annually hydrological cycles feng et al 2009 gosnell et al 2016 therefore only the reservoirs with an age of at least one year could be used to establish the relationship fig 2 the results showed that mehg in surface sediment was positively correlated with hrt fig 2b and negatively correlated with reservoir age fig 2c this explained the low mehg in reservoirs of ggq and mw fig 2a as the two reservoirs have small hrt and large reservoir age respectively table s1 supporting information fig 3 furthermore a relationship was found that mehg showed a strong positive correlation to the ratio of hrt to reservoir age fig 2d which confirmed that mehg dynamics in reservoirs was jointly regulated by hrt and reservoir age but not by spatial sequence since only the reservoirs with operation time for at least one full hydrological year could be included for the analysis only five reservoirs meeting the criteria this could be the reason that the significance was not high p value however the available data could to some extent demonstrate the relationship between mehg and the ratio of hrt to reservoir age in future more reservoirs in the upper mekong river will have their operation time over one year and then more data could be available to further verify this finding 4 2 effects of surface sediment grain size on hg and mehg variations within a reservoir river damming weakens the hydrodynamic conditions and causes sediment deposition best 2019 when the sediment settles coarse and fine particles are separated along the way the former deposits first while the latter travels farther kelly and rudd 2018 in the xiaowan reservoir the sediment grain size d 50 declined along with the decrease of flow velocity fig 4a however it slightly increased near the dam front due to the increased bottom flow velocity incurred by the water intake for hydropower production and the flood dispatch thereby flushing out the fine sediment chen et al 2021 guertault et al 2017 fine sediment has a strong sorption ability because of the larger surface area per unit mass kelly and rudd 2018 correlation analyses revealed that surface sediment hg was positively correlated with clay proportion fig 4b indicating that hg was mainly attached to clay and showed a similar variation behavior with clay along the way hg methylation is a microbially mediated process liu et al 2018b this study showed that the change of mehg along the way was in line with that of hgcab fig 4c d sediment is a carrier of methylation microbes and an active site for hg methylation feng et al 2009 yang et al 2016 the decrease in the hgcab at the reservoir tail s1 to s3 could be attributed to the release from the upstream reservoir fig 4d methylation microbes are anaerobic blum et al 2013 mccord et al 2016 the overall decrease of hgcab s4 to s10 was mainly due to the decrease in the level of do fig s2 hence as the carrier of hg oc and methylation microbes the variation of sediment settlement along the way played the core role in hg sedimentation and methylation during reservoir storing and discharging 4 3 joint effects of hrt and reservoir age on mehg dynamics within a reservoir sediment cores record the historical sedimentation features of particles lintern et al 2016 the sedimentation process in a reservoir is affected by the input from drainage area and water exchange which has significant impacts on the vertical accumulations of hg and mehg liu et al 2018a lintern et al 2016 in the dgt samplings and wavelet analyses results fig 6 fig s3 the variations of dgt hg dgt mehg and mehg with a period of about one year were driven by the annual hydrological cycle and for the period of about 2 19 years it was close to the hrt of the xw reservoir table s1 supporting information these indicated that the oscillation of dgt hg dgt mehg and mehg in sediment cores were jointly regulated by the annual hydrological cycle and hrt the effect of the annual hydrological cycle on the vertical distributions of sediment dgt hg and dgt mehg was attributed to the runoffs which carry hg and mehg into the reservoir gosnell et al 2016 zheng et al 2016 fig 6a b fig s4 supporting information compared with the annual hydrological cycle the variations of dgt hg dgt mehg and mehg were more strongly driven by the hrt fig 6 fig s3 this is because the upper mekong river is a canyon river with small intermediate input of hg and oc shi et al 2017 meanwhile with the hg methylation the interannual variations of dgt mehg and mehg in a reservoir were stronger than that of dgt hg fig 5c fig 6c dgt mehg and mehg dynamics were affected in many ways with the extension of hrt due to river damming bravo et al 2018 cha et al 2017 evans et al 2017 firstly the weakening of hydrodynamic condition enhances the retention of hg and oc secondly more time for hg methylation is provided thirdly the produced mehg is less released downstream evans et al 2017 nogueira et al 2002 shi et al 2017 besides the annual sedimentation after reservoir construction the original deposit is also an important factor affecting mehg dynamics dam construction inundates a certain amount of land and intercepts the sediment in runoff leading to an upsurge of hg and oc in a reservoir at the beginning of impoundment bodaly et al 2007 parks and baker 1997 for a canyon river the subsequent sedimentation from the basin is limited fan et al 2015 thus the reservoir is forced to continuously use the originally stored oc as the reservoir ages the original deposit is gradually exhausted resulting in an attenuation of hg methylation this has been observed in studies that continuously monitor some single reservoirs louis et al 2004 rolfhus et al 2015 the relatively high mehg in the dcs reservoir with older age fig 3 might due to the input of extra oc brought by regional floods this could be partially supported by the sudden increases in sediment d 50 and hg concentration in the reservoir table s1 supporting information fig 2a however our further investigations are needed it should be pointed out that strictly speaking the contents of hg and mehg in sediment should be measured because labile hg and mehg concentrations obtained by dgt cannot be equivalent to the sediment hg and mehg contents li et al 2021 liu et al 2019a however they could to some extent reflect the contents of labile hg and mehg in sediment meanwhile labile fractions of hg and mehg receive more attentions in risk management because they are more easily released to surrounding environment and cause toxic effects 5 conclusion by analyzing sediment hg mehg and mehg in the cascade reservoirs along one large river the study reached the following findings 1 the sediment mehg in a reservoir had a positive correlation with the ratio of the reservoir hrt to age 2 the size separated sedimentation along the flow direction was the key factor affecting the spatial patterns of sediment hg mehg and mehg within a reservoir 3 the dynamics of sediment mehg in a reservoir were jointly regulated by the original deposit of hg and oc during initial impoundment and the subsequent sedimentation of hg and oc after operation the former is used continuously as the reservoir ages whereas the latter are driven by the annual hydrological cycle and reservoir hrt of which the hrt is dominant in line with these findings newly constructed reservoirs with large hrt in the most upstream area could be hotspots of mehg pollution thus deserves more attentions to risk management in addition due to the sedimentation in almost stagnant water in reservoirs the concentration of suspended particle matter is very low and thus the mehg dynamics in water body were not investigated in this study however it could be incorporated in future work author contributions q chen and j zhang designed and supervised the study

16291,in recent years drinking water associated pathogens that can cause infections in immunocompromised or otherwise susceptible individuals henceforth referred to as dwpi sometimes referred to as opportunistic pathogens or opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens have received considerable attention dwpi research has largely been conducted by experts focusing on specific microorganisms or within silos of expertise the resulting mitigation approaches optimized for a single microorganism may have unintended consequences and trade offs for other dwpi or other interests e g energy costs and conservation for example the ecological and epidemiological issues characteristic of legionella pneumophila diverge from those relevant for mycobacterium avium and other nontuberculous mycobacteria recent advances in understanding dwpi as part of a complex microbial ecosystem inhabiting drinking water systems continues to reveal additional challenges namely how can all microorganisms of concern be managed simultaneously in order to protect public health we must take a more holistic approach in all aspects of the field including basic research monitoring methods risk based mitigation techniques and policy a holistic approach will i target multiple microorganisms simultaneously ii involve experts across several disciplines and iii communicate results across

water associated pathogens that predominantly cause infections in immunocompromised individuals dwpi has exploded new dwpi continue to be identified e g a 2018 balamuthia mandrillaria infection tentatively linked to tap water piper et al 2018 at the same time that our understanding of the diverse ecological system within pipes is expanding douterelo et al 2019 hull et al 2019 today infections associated with dwpi are estimated to cost the us economy 2 39 billion annually collier et al 2021 and the incidence of several dwpi continues to increase adjemian et al 2012 billinger et al 2009 cdc 2011 collier et al 2021 marras et al 2007 prevots et al 2010 prussin et al 2017 many microorganisms could be considered dwpi while there is no perfect term for these organisms there are several criteria for grouping them under this umbrella here we focus on bacteria and amoebae that are 1 adapted to grow in drinking water systems particularly within building water systems and water fixtures e g cold and hot water lines heaters faucets fountains and 2 frequently cause disease in susceptible populations e g at risk individuals older people people with immune compromise and or lung disease we consider that the characteristics of susceptible populations vary and that infections sometimes occur in individuals that appear to be healthy while present naturally in the environment surface water soil dwpi typically are not present in high concentrations in finished water leaving the drinking water treatment plant but multiply within the distribution network and especially in building water systems often within biofilms while all dwpi are capable of causing disease the risk of becoming infected is influenced by various factors including the microorganism s virulence exposure dose and the susceptibility of the exposed population here we focus on dwpi that typically pose a lesser threat to healthy individuals compared to those with underlying health conditions or susceptibilities moreover common routes of exposure to dwpi are typically through non ingestion e g aspiration or inhalation of aerosols generated from showering or other exposures rather than ingestion drinking routes although fecal pathogens are occasionally found in drinking water systems we exclude traditional fecal oral pathogens which cause gastrointestinal disease after ingestion as these microorganisms tend not to proliferate or regrow in municipally treated drinking water ashbolt 2015 some so called true or frank pathogens can also grow within drinking water systems and cause disease through non ingestion routes of exposure e g naegleria fowleri although this is less common the entire list of organisms we consider to be dwpi can be found in table 1 much of our discussion focuses on three exemplary bacterial groups that represent a significant disease burden collier et al 2021 have distinct physiologies and have the most research available legionella pneumophila mycobacterium avium and other nontuberculous mycobacteria ntm and pseudomonas aeruginosa fig 1 to combat dwpi disease emerging guidance documents attempt to synthesize research knowledge into risk management strategies julien et al 2020a singh et al 2020 in 2015 the first industry standard for drinking water system management in buildings was released ashrae 2015 rhoads et al 2014 and many resources are now available to help develop what are generally known as water safety plans ashrae 2020a 2018 cdc 2021a mitigation efforts are often targeted at healthcare facilities as many dwpi infections are nosocomial healthcare or hospital acquired due in part to the high density of vulnerable individuals the veterans affairs office first issued a directive concerning legionella spp prevention in healthcare facilities in 2014 vha 2014 updated in 2021 vha 2021 and all hospitals receiving medicare medicaid funding are now required to have building water management plans cms 2017 updated in 2018 cms 2018 unfortunately the content of these plans is not specifically mandated ambrose et al 2021 regulations are a step in the right direction but have shortcomings bope et al 2018 and vary globally as illustrated by l pneumophila standards and guidelines nasem 2019 van kenhove et al 2019b for example although the ashrae standard was a substantial forward in taking some action it does not address residential home systems despite the epidemiological link between building drinking water systems and infection by dwpi lande et al 2019 pedro botet et al 2002 stout et al 1992 yu et al 2004 in fact 96 of legionnaires disease cases in the u s are of unknown etiology and it is suspected that sporadic residential exposure is a substantial source cdc 2011 it is difficult to measure the success of interventions especially given the consistent increase in incidence of legionnaires disease i e 5 5 times increase in incidence of reported cases in the u s from 2000 to 2017 cdc 2018 with reporting potentially due to factors such as increased awareness and testing in addition to an actual increase in disease incidence or prevalence moreover environmental testing data i e water samples are not mandated to be centrally reported in the u s cdc 2019a even for legionella spp while the maximum contaminant level goal mclg for legionella spp has long been zero us epa 2015 regular direct monitoring in drinking water systems is not required in the u s in contrast other countries e g germany have required environmental monitoring for both l pneumophila and p aeruginosa nasem 2019 perhaps because legionella spp is associated with the most reported data and strictest regulations available guidance has focused on legionella spp but guidance may be at the expense of other dwpi in certain situations for example ntm is thought to be at least as important to the us disease burden as legionella spp collier et al 2021 daley and salfinger 2016 a complicating factor but also a potential motivation for holistic approaches is that clinically meaningful antibiotic resistance ar often complicates treatment for infections by dwpi such as legionella spp de giglio et al 2015 shadoud et al 2015 ntm van ingen et al 2012 and p aeruginosa smith et al 2016 1 1 justification and scope in considering the fifty plus years of research progress and mitigation efforts for dwpis it has become clear that a more holistic approach is needed to unite and strengthen efforts taking place across numerous fields and disciplines fig 1 holistic in this context can be defined as considering multiple parts as interconnected and part of a whole rather than as disconnected components the current approach can be segmented both by discipline and by specific microorganism of interest moreover decision processes must balance many interests including other health outcomes cost and energy additional local considerations and boundaries of water jurisdictions further segment approaches to manage dwpi first while experts trained in various disciplines are making advances to understanding dwpi behavior there is a lack of means to efficiently and effectively share findings across disciplines in part due to terminology unique to each field table 2 often literature reviews focus on either clinical disease johnson and odell 2014 microorganism fate and transport falkinham 2018 or persistence in drinking water systems dowdell et al 2019 dwpi research from these disciplines often occurs in parallel fields without sufficient connection and tends to neglect translational work that bridges research and practice for example due to limited resources epidemiological outbreak investigations may not aim to link clinical and environmental samples e g the majority or patients diagnosed with legionellosis in 2016 2017 in the us did not have an exposure source healthcare setting travel history or senior living facility identified cdc 2020a noting that person to person spread is considered negligible correia et al 2016 both research and field investigations will benefit from increased communication second and perhaps more importantly disciplinary teams often focus on one microorganism due to logistical limitations and available methods as reflected in literature reviews that focus on one microorganism bédard et al 2016 falkinham 2018 2009 nasem 2019 coinfections or polymicrobial infections with dwpis are possible naito et al 2020 dev and ashbolt 2020 but data regarding co infection within the same species of dwpi or with multiple dwpis as well as regarding the ability for a dwpi infection to serve as a pre disposing factor for other infectious agents is a data gap some reviews of microbial ecology berry et al 2006 proctor and hammes 2015a or broad scoping reviews falkinham et al 2015 can take multiple pathogens into consideration but this does not necessarily translate to specific interventions designed for practitioners with most guidance directed at individual dwpi we have noted examples of incompatible recommendations for instance adding free chlorine at the building level can be effective in reducing concentrations of l pneumophila but might increase ntm occurrence in building water system moore et al 2006 rhoads et al 2017b similarly the use of monochloramines may offer enhanced diffusion into biofilms for pathogen inactivation but as a weaker oxidant will prove less effective against ntm revetta et al 2013 the authors have noted a lack of studies that simultaneously tackle the full suite of dwpi even clinical or plumbing management recommendations targeted at a single microorganism type may fail to take into account host micro eukaryotes thomas et al 2010 that may be critical for pathogen recovery dey et al 2019a and strain variability within specific groups such as that exemplified by the wide variation in virulence and health outcomes as a result of infection with different species within the mycobacterium genus tortoli 2014 future recommendations should consider the impact on the full suite of dwpi in this paper we outline similarities and differences among dwpi that can lead to conflicting guidance and present research needs that could help with the development of a necessary consensus across disciplines we consider these similarities and differences across three main categories clinical and public health microbial ecology and engineering controls we highlight several opportunities to encourage research to be more cross disciplinary and to increase the translation of research findings into practice we present this commentary to advocate for a more holistic approach to dwpi research legislative action building codes monitoring efforts and professional practice to reduce the burden of disease associated with dwpi the authors represent a diverse background of primary disciplines and organisms of interest supplementary table s1 to emphasize the importance of cross disciplinary cooperation 2 clinical medicine public health while clinical medicine focuses on the treatment and outcomes of individual patients the field of public health addresses the prevention of disease and promotion of health at the population level we have chosen to discuss them together here as both focus on human health the overlap in research and practice dwpi have long been the focus of both clinical and public health research however in some cases disparate goals have resulted in a lack of alignment among disease surveillance and reporting clinical diagnosis and assessment of dwpi risks multiple dwpi hazards exist and the ability to detect dwpi associated diseases and to predict their impacts varies holistically assessing these factors and impacts is nontrivial especially as exposures may relate to episodic and complex phenomena at play in plumbing systems 2 1 reporting in the u s legionellosis is currently the only nationally notifiable group of diseases caused by dwpis to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc cdc 2019b ntm infections and positive isolates are required to be reported in some states table 1 the wide variation among ntm reporting requirements has resulted in calls for a national reporting requirement for ntm daley and salfinger 2016 donohue 2018 winthrop et al 2017 certain infections with dwpi may meet criteria for reporting in the cdc national healthcare safety network for healthcare associated infections such as pseudomonas related blood stream infections drug resistant p aeruginosa infections are tracked by cdc through its antibiotic resistance ar laboratory network however the ar lab network is not a surveillance network and does not represent testing of every isolate in every state cdc 2019c certain states such as minnesota and wisconsin require reporting of free living amoebic infections including acanthamoeba spp n fowleri balamuthia spp and sappinia spp minnesota department of health 2019a wisconsin department of health services 2018 and primary amoebic encephalitis caused by n fowleri is state reportable in florida texas and louisiana cdc 2017 this patchwork of surveillance and notification requirements often motivated by high profile outbreaks highlights the need for unified dwpi associated disease reporting to fully assess disease burdens even so mild infections often go undiagnosed or untreated while healthcare associated infections are also likely underestimated perkins et al 2019 spagnolo et al 2016 overall reported cases are the tip of the iceberg who europe 2019 yang et al 2012 2 2 diagnosis and epidemiologic case definitions an epidemiological case definition is a set of standard criteria for classifying whether a person has a particular disease syndrome or other health conditions cdc 2012a some of these definitions have been developed into national standards that are comparable across clinical settings and locations a standardized case definition is an important step toward making large scale comparisons of dwpi case definition criteria can be more limited during an outbreak investigation and the strictness of the definition depends on the purposes for classifying the occurrence of a disease cdc 2012a a case definition is not the same as a clinical diagnostic criterion where the former is used to aid an epidemiologic investigation and the latter is used to make treatment decisions for individual patients lamorte 2016 clinicians ability to diagnose dwpi diseases vary but most approaches are based on culture or molecular analysis of the pathogen in bodily fluids or observation of antibodies to a particular infection with regard to standardized case definitions legionnaires disease has a clear case definition cdc 2021b but a standard case definition for pontiac fever which is generally considered to be a milder form of legionellosis without pneumonia has only recently been established cste 2019 2010 2005 tossa et al 2006 similarly case definitions have only recently been standardized for free living amoebae cdc 2012b and ntm cste 2017 oregon health authority 2018 infections while p aeruginosa infections are diagnosed via bacterial culture as a primary or secondary bloodstream infection secondary bloodstream infections are not reportable as laboratory confirmed bloodstream infections to the cdc national healthcare safety network cdc 2020b other case definition criteria are used for antibiotic resistant p aeruginosa infections minnesota department of health 2019b walters et al 2019 for m avium and other ntm the american thoracic society infectious disease society of america and the british thoracic society define a confirmed case as one with ntm grown from two separate sputum samples or a single positive sample from a broncoalveolar lavage or a lung biopsy griffith et al 2007 haworth et al 2017 in addition the council of state and territorial epidemiologists cste has recently published a case definition for extrapulmonary ntm cste 2017 oregon health authority 2018 granulomatous amoebic encephalitis gae i e amoebic infection of the central nervous system is often diagnosable but rarely before it becomes fatal reed et al 1997 sell et al 1997 factors including i extended disease progression especially for ntm which may have a progression over years field et al 2004 lewis et al 1960 ii lack of identification needed to reach a diagnosis or treatment e g otitis externa or swimmer s ear can be treated without identifying the causative organism as p aeruginosa and iii lack of clinical awareness alaga et al 2018 can obscure connections between environmental exposure and disease johnson and odell 2014 provoost et al 2018 the use of medical decision trees tools with visual descriptions of a series of diagnostic tools and subsequent outcomes and downstream decisions to aid in arriving at a diagnosis have been long employed in the medical literature detsky et al 1997 such tools would be beneficial in the dwpi context for codifying information that could distinguish between different dwpi disease outcomes as well as to highlight gaps where additional information could be collected to clinicians in differentiating between dwpi infections and elucidating causal pathways detsky et al 1997 testing is critical for diagnosis but convenience reproducibility and accuracy sensitivity or the probability of correctly identifying a positive case of disease and specificity the probability of correctly testing negative in the absence of disease of available testing technologies varies by dwpi and the compatibility of environmental and clinical tests varies due to conflicting goals as discussed below taken together these challenges for diagnosis amplify the underreporting of dwpi disease accurate reporting will require 1 rapid reproducible and precise testing methodologies for dwpi diseases 2 diagnostic protocols that include clear decision trees for routine inclusion of dwpi in clinical workups and 3 national reporting requirements and databases for dwpi epidemiological investigations offer a clear opportunity for cross disciplinary work clinical medicine can identify disease and report it while public health specialists will look for environmental sources of exposure to link to the outcome this requires timely cooperation and communication so that environments can be sampled close to the exposure window linkage typically requires work at the sub species level and should look for co infections with other dwpi engineers can also contribute to epidemiological studies by identifying key exposure points that can be added to epidemiological surveys of exposure history e g do you live near a water feature successful quantification of both exposure and outcomes can help validate risk models 2 3 an example of holistic thinking risk assessment and management in assessing risks from dwpi a traditional approach may focus on risks of a single pathogen epidemiological observations and studies or even costs associated with treating a single disease however a combination of metrics would be needed to holistically evaluate and prioritize the impacts costs and tradeoffs of dwpi in different contexts and substantial value judgements would be necessary when communicating these types of analyses for legislative and preventative efforts further complexity is added when competing objectives of many stakeholders e g energy costs liabilities and management objectives unrelated to dwpi must be considered in this section we describe how the current approach to risk assessment includes aspects of a holistic approach and can be further improved to incorporate metrics from other disciplines the prevalence of infections by dwpi varies table 1 although some rank order differences have been estimated ntm up to 41 3 per 100 000 legionnaires disease up to 1 36 per 100 000 p aeruginosa acanthamoeba n fowleri falkinham et al 2015 strollo et al 2015 furthermore disease prognoses vary greatly for example n fowleri associated meningoencephalitis has a 95 case fatality rate wang et al 2018 while the case fatality rate for healthcare associated legionnaires disease is up to 25 in some susceptible populations cdc 2021c quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra may be useful for prioritization as it aims to understand underlying mechanisms relative contributions of processes and modeling rare outcomes among other attributes bridging environmental concentrations to outcomes of interest via dose response models haas et al 2014 world health organization 2016 qmra is especially useful as a companion tool to traditional epidemiological methods which can necessitate large studies in order to observe potentially small effect size dose response models used in qmra are available for quantifying relationships between exposure and the probability of an outcome for dwpi supplementary table s2 a growing body of qmra literature addresses legionella spp hamilton and haas 2016 ntm hamilton et al 2017 rice et al 2005 p aeruginosa dean and mitchell 2020a rasheduzzaman et al 2019 and n fowleri dean et al 2019 rasheduzzaman et al 2019 but important limitations remain as many variables must be considered for example the likelihood of infection for a dwpi is not only dependent on the species strain of microorganism the virulence of the microorganism at a given time and host characteristics e g immune status age demographics but also on the fate and transport of the microorganism in the environment and exposure route and dose for example men over 55 years of age are at higher risk for l pneumophila while ntm tends to disproportionately infect slender taller post menopausal women chalmers et al 2018 kartalija et al 2013 new dose response models will be useful for microbial ecologists water quality engineers and ultimately legislators seeking to identify risk based monitoring targets for environmental control of these organisms such efforts to derive risk based concentration monitoring targets have already begun for acanthamoeba spp dean and mitchell 2020b p aeruginosa and n fowleri rasheduzzaman et al 2019 and l pneumophila hamilton et al 2019 risk prioritization could also be assigned based on cost but tracking disease and quantifying costs of illness are challenging adam et al 2017 multiple approaches are available in the economic risk decision analysis and policy analysis literature to inform decisions that take into account multiple pathogen considerations e g mitchell blackwood et al 2011 these approaches not only consider the direct losses e g hospitalization costs table 1 collier et al 2021 but also secondary considerations such as non hospitalized infections i e missed work lowered productivity and mortality when allocating scarce resources institute of medicine 2009 national research council 1990 for example corso et al 2003 identified healthcare costs and productivity losses from the 1993 cryptosporidiosis outbreak in milwaukee wisconsin using costs from categories of people with mild moderate and severe illness using a retrospective analysis arriving at an estimate of 96 2 million in losses 2003 us dollars corso et al 2003 in addition to direct costs disease has many indirect costs including loss of trust in the safety of municipal drinking water in considering costs the expense of trade offs including alternative risks and costs of preventative measures should be considered for example raising the temperature of a water heater can decrease risk of dwpi infection but will increase the risk of scalding and energy costs such analyses would improve if all dwpi were reportable noting that cryptosporidiosis did not become a nationally notifiable disease until 1995 after the catastrophic milwaukee outbreak cdc 1995 the level of acceptable risk is typically dependent upon the hazard consequences and ability to control exposure nasem 2019 drinking water efforts for policy standardization have typically relied on health risk based target benchmarks such as one in 10 000 infections per person per year lim and jiang 2013 regli et al 1991 per exposure versus annual risks are often chosen as a decision basis depending on whether exposures are continuous or short term leading to different monitoring approaches with annual based approaches focusing less on short term hazardous event variations nasem 2019 signor and ashbolt 2009 the choice of an acceptable risk value like one in 10 000 is a policy decision and may be too stringent in certain situations haas 1996 lim and jiang 2013 other endpoint metrics are available such as the disability adjusted life year daly to measure the health impacts of a disease incorporating both fatal and non fatal outcomes a 10 6 daly per person per year is often used as a reference point sinclair et al 2015 who 2015 a daly value is available for legionellosis van lier et al 2016 however this value is location and context specific regardless of the quantification method used there is no such thing as zero risk de keuckelaere et al 2015 research needs for dwpi risk assessment and prioritization can be summarized as follows 1 an increased understanding of infectivity including new dose response models for emerging dwpi for various exposure routes e g aspiration endpoints susceptibilities 2 the impact of underlying human characteristics and behavioral factors e g smoking use of tap water for non recommended uses such as neti pots contact lenses and medical uses occupational co exposures of host populations and impact on risk 3 knowledge of virulent types amongst each of the dwpi species to aid monitoring 4 improved exposure information for aerosol exposures as well as non potable uses such as cooling towers healthcare equipment dental equipment and other known sources of infection 5 consideration of multiple costs and risk tradeoffs e g increasing water heater temperatures to inactivate legionella spp results in higher energy costs and 6 careful consideration of risk benchmark metrics in various decision making processes the insurance industry section 4 5 may provide an opportunity to address risks and consider costs across multiple sectors 2 4 proposed approach clinicians public health practitioners and other health researchers who wish to participate in a holistic approach to dwpi can embrace several strategies recognizing that these proposed approaches are not always easy to implement they are ordered from most to least readily achievable educate at risk individuals about their personal risk factors and provide them with the resources to protect their water systems and modify behavior to minimize personal risk timely studies across public health and medicine that link exposures and disease outcomes outbreaks improving linkages among professionals in the medical and environmental space for this purpose following a case investigation communicate with water providers and building managers about potential risks and strategies for future disease prevention regardless of whether positive environmental samples were collected in order to increase awareness of potential problems report every instance of dwpi to a centralized database box 1 make reporting of all dwpi mandatory rather than just some pathogens and to the extent possible match clinical cases with environmental samples within linked reporting databases using risk assessment to systematically identify and prioritize research gaps understand tradeoffs and improve modeling efforts toward predicting and preventing rather than reacting to dwpi illness rapid more granular public health data collection for dwpi associated illnesses and expansion beyond legionella spp which also considers people presenting with symptoms associated with dwpi for further testing and diagnosis 3 microbiology and microbial ecology each dwpi has a unique set of ideal environmental conditions for proliferation these conditions generally overlap to allow for growth within the environment drinking water systems and the human body but clear differences in niches have emerged in studying microorganisms in isolated laboratory conditions important discoveries are made but studies can also be designed to emulate realistic conditions to inform complex cross species interactions as well as actionable engineering strategies and policies 3 1 key microbial physiological considerations fundamental microbiology studies have revealed several innate physiological and structural traits that might predict where dwpi are likely to be found in the environment hydrophobicity and surface charge are important factors in determining the partitioning of cells aggregates in a drinking water system e g planktonic vs surface microlayer vs biofilm and the likelihood of aerosolization falkinham 2018 parker et al 1983 many dwpi are hydrophobic and prefer to grow on surfaces in biofilms falkinham 2009 ntm are especially notable given their waxy acid fast cell walls which make them particularly hydrophobic and readily aerosolized falkinham 2018 parker et al 1983 surface charge may also dictate ecological distribution and infectivity steed and falkinham 2006 stormer and falkinham 1989 van oss et al 1975 for example differences in the electrophoretic mobility among l pneumophila serogroups likely contributed to differences in serogroup behaviors buse et al 2018 in contrast several m avium complex species exhibited less variability in electrophoretic mobility lytle et al 2004 it is also important to recognize the way dwpi may be presented in exposure scenarios such as packaged within amoebal vesicles trophozoites or cysts shaheen and ashbolt 2018 further understanding of these differences is critical to identifying likely hotspots and explaining disease patterns dwpi growth rates vary considerably impacting incubation periods between exposure and symptom onset preferred growth location and ideal culture detection methods while doubling times and growth conditions can vary within a species generally the growth rates for m avium and pseudomonas spp are generally low sharaby et al 2017 van der kooij et al 1982 these growth rates are lower in the drinking water environment than in clinical or laboratory settings due to oligotrophic conditions this can mean that culture based recovery of environmental dwpi isolates can require 10 days lalancette et al 2017 in this field growth is considered rapid if organisms are detectable in less than 7 days specific strains and species also exhibit wide variation for example mycobacterium malmoense requires 8 12 weeks for culture detection while m abscessus and other rapidly growing ntm can be detected in 7 days bartlett et al 2000 caution should be taken in extrapolating conclusions regarding growth rates as a slow growth rate does not necessarily imply slow metabolism mycobacterial increase in numbers is slow because a great deal of energy is expended in synthesizing the long chain c60 c80 lipids that comprise the outer membrane brennan and nikaido 1995 it is critical to understand these basic pure culture behaviors in order to 1 understand microbial incubation periods and colonization patterns across ecosystems 2 develop robust cost effective methods box 2 and 3 design engineering solutions e g intermittent flush heat shock for multiple dwpi simultaneously many dwpi survive stress due to harsh conditions in potable water e g low nutrients temperature and exposure to chlorine residuals by resorting to a dormant or protective state this includes the poorly understood viable but nonculturable vbnc state alleron et al 2008 dopp et al 2017 li et al 2014 and survival within protozoa which has been observed for many bacterial dwpi thomas et al 2010 these survival mechanisms can result in false non detects for culture based methods and sometimes molecular methods e g when amoebae are not lysed effectively importantly these seemingly non active microorganisms are still capable of infection dey et al 2019b with several studies showing the reactivation of dwpi after they are exposed to a less stressful environment dietersdorfer et al 2018 such as within the human body the importance of detecting viability varies across stakeholders section 3 5 but improved methods to quickly detect and differentiate between different physiological states would be widely beneficial across disciplines 3 2 environmental conditions dwpi respond to a variety of physio chemical factors including temperature disinfectant residual type and concentration oxygen levels and other water chemistry characteristics many of these factors have been studied with direct implications for engineering solutions indicating cooperation between these disciplines care must be taken in interpreting results from different scales of experiments that can range from pure culture to studies of full scale buildings as studies often focus on only one dwpi or limited environmental factors it is difficult to determine the applicability of findings 1 across dwpi 2 in different systems or 3 at different scales of study still some differences in niche seem to emerge amongst dwpi ideal temperatures for most dwpi are similar 28 35 c but growth can occur outside this range for example p aeruginosa can grow between 10 and 42 c brown 1957 while most dwpi are considered inactive at temperatures greater than 55 to 60 c their recovery after exposure to higher temperatures e g 63 c for l pneumophila borella et al 2004 and 65 c for ntm merkal and crawford 1979 may indicate they are present in the vbnc state i e vbnc l pneumophila after exposure to 70 c allegra et al 2008 or exhibit other survival mechanisms under such conditions conclusions about responses to temperature extremes are especially difficult to scale up to engineered water systems because in situ temperatures are difficult to measure at various scales e g within a biofilm or at a pipe wall versus at the center of the water column and survival may further be aided by biofilms protozoa and areas not exposed to maximum or minimum system temperatures as temperature may allow for niche differentiation this presents an opportunity for further multi dwpi studies the chemical characteristics of drinking water vary based on source e g groundwater vs surface water residual disinfectant type i e chloramine vs free chlorine and specific building parameters i e pipe material all of which individually and collectively influence the growth and survival of dwpi and their hosts as all of these water chemistry factors can differ across studies it is difficult to 1 isolate factors of concern and 2 compare results for different dwpi comparison of disinfectant efficacy is especially difficult even for a single organism ct disinfection concentration c x time t mg min l inactivation values can vary based on strain material type presence of biofilm ph and or temperature buse et al 2019 dowdell et al 2019 still each dwpi also appears to demonstrate slightly different tolerances towards chloramine and free chlorine chloramine has a strong effect on l pneumophila and p aeruginosa but is less effective towards inactivating ntm dowdell et al 2019 lytle et al 2021 moore et al 2006 rhoads et al 2017b m avium complex and p aeruginosa typically exhibit high resistance to both disinfectants grobe et al 2001 taylor et al 2000 to allow more accurate conclusions regarding disinfectants effects on dwpi it is critical to 1 fully report all water chemistry variables 2 study multiple dwpis within the same experimental framework the concentrations of metal ions can also impact growth and survival of dwpi but are not always considered in studies at multiple scales iron typically originating from iron pipes may be a critical nutrient for legionella spp ntm and p aeruginosa growth although in different quantities copper originating from copper silver ionization systems or from copper pipes is generally considered to have antimicrobial properties cachafeiro et al 2007 landeen et al 1989 lin et al 1996 liu et al 1994 furthermore copper has also been linked to vbnc induction in p aeruginosa bédard et al 2014 dopp et al 2017 dwidjosiswojo et al 2011 still these results are difficult to scale to engineering solutions especially considering the variability of metal concentrations both spatially and temporally within building water systems and changes in metal chemistry throughout the lifetime of a building brazeau and edwards 2013 rhoads et al 2017b salehi et al 2020 for example while the use of copper pipes has been suggested as a control mechanism for l pneumophila learbuch et al 2019 rogers et al 1994 the effects on l pneumophila and other dwpi might be short lived ph dependent and modified in the presence of biofilm buse et al 2017 elguindi et al 2009 proctor et al 2017 rhoads et al 2017b under certain conditions the presence of copper may even selectively encourage the growth of l pneumophila proctor et al 2017 rhoads et al 2017b by changing the pipe microbiome buse et al 2014 elucidating the impact of metals on the broader microbiome under varied water chemistry conditions will allow better understanding of conflicting findings in full scale systems each dwpi also has a unique set of nutrient and oxygen requirements with some dwpi surviving under extreme conditions that may provide competitive advantages the m avium complex is considered microaerobic growing in as little as 6 oxygen and surviving in anaerobic conditions lewis and falkinham 2015 p aeruginosa is generally considered aerobic but can grow anaerobically utilizing nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor palmer et al 2007 l pneumophila on the other hand is an obligate aerobe requires amino acids produced by other microorganisms and can grow necrotrophically temmerman et al 2006 amoebae similarly rely on other microorganisms digesting them via phagocytosis samba louaka et al 2019 better understanding of this niche differentiation will assist in finding mitigation strategies that are effective for mitigating the full suite of dwpi 3 3 dwpi interactions when dwpi are studied together relationships parasitic symbiotic and competitive are uncovered that would not be seen in monoculture studies many dwpi including legionella spp and ntm can be phagocytized by free living protozoa and amoebae delafont et al 2018 which facilitates replication offers protection and enhances virulence buse and ashbolt 2011 cateau et al 2011 cirillo et al 1997 amoebic relationships may account for the preference of l pneumophila in biofilms with high cell densities van der kooij et al 2017 versus the preference of pseudomonas spp and mycobacterium spp in biofilms with low cell densities proctor et al 2018 2016 some of these protozoan hosts are also dwpi themselves e g acanthamoeba p aeruginosa can suppress the growth of l pneumophila kimura et al 2009 and may prevent their attachment to simple biofilms stewart et al 2012 likely through the production of bacteriocin like substances that suppress competitors guerrieri et al 2008 also there appears to be preference by amoeba for prey that are not amoeba resisting shaheen and ashbolt 2021 in continuously chlorinated cooling towers legionella spp and pseudomonas spp had negative associations due to direct or indirect relationships with hosts paranjape et al 2020 in addition dwpi can compete with one another and other drinking water bacteria for uptake by amoebic hosts potentially affecting inactivation and virulence berry et al 2010 cirillo et al 1997 declerck et al 2005 thomas and ashbolt 2011 it may be possible to leverage these findings to eliminate dwpi from water systems 3 4 an example of holistic thinking antibiotic resistance the differentiation of niches amongst dwpi is especially well exemplified with respect to antibiotic resistance ar box 1 the resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics has been widely studied across multiple disciplines and multiple dwpi embodying key aspects of the proposed holistic approach epidemiologists and clinicians traditionally study ar with respect to identifying sources limiting their spread and determining the best treatment approaches ecologists study environmental niches conducive to growth of ar organisms conditions that select for resistant strains and microenvironments favorable to the transfer of ar genes via cell to cell via horizontal gene transfer concerns regarding ar are emerging for engineers who have studies how engineered systems can serve as barriers to the spread of ar or conversely can inadvertently promote dissemination of ar identifying solutions to these pressing and unconventional challenges necessitates collaboration among researchers across disciplines but holistic solutions are needed given that each organism presents unique challenges holistic consideration of these challenges by engineers ecologists and epidemiologists working in collaboration is necessary for parallel control of these disparate ar dwpis in water systems 3 5 an example of holistic thinking method development the methods used to measure dwpi by different disciplines often create a barrier because each field has different goals table 3 a public health specialist or epidemiologist requires in depth identification e g serotyping sequence typing to trace outbreaks while a physician focuses on information pertinent to diagnosis and treatment e g symptoms may be enough for some diseases organisms while complete typing is needed for others thus positive diagnostic tests e g urinary antigen tests may not be paired with more in depth analysis e g sputum culturing water testing on a routine basis environmental monitoring may also use culture based techniques but clinical culture media are often not suitable to recover nutrient starved dwpi cells typically found in drinking water a microbial ecologist may only be interested in the presence of a microorganism and thus dna based molecular methods may be adequate i e composite capture of viable vbnc and dead cells the meaning of the unit gene copy per volume is not immediately relatable to quantities reported from traditional culture methods i e colony forming units cfu per unit volume and relative abundance e g percent abundance from amplicon sequencing data does not directly translate into the absolute concentrations needed for risk assessment a monitoring program requires relatively quick and easy methods for live or revivable vbnc pathogen detection and emerging methods for achieving this report often rely on non traditional units of measurement e g most probable number mpn per unit volume other engineers need immediate indicators for a change in physicochemical nutrient or total bacterial conditions and may be particularly interested in methods designed to denote hydraulic changes rather than direct correlations with human pathogens even if these do not relate directly to dwpi growth or survival they could indicate a failure in treatment or hydraulic issues and need for corrective action building owners may not be interested in finding definitive evidence of dwpi because of legal liability and may prefer more general water quality metrics that could be indicative of conditions conducive to dwpi growth e g temperature chlorine concentration all available methods have benefits and drawbacks and a single method cannot address all questions at the same time financial time and expertise limitations will not typically allow for application of all methods in all circumstances better understanding of the differences and relative benefits of information provided by these methods can allow for i communication between disciplines and ii better design of studies that will translate more effectively across disciplines similarly convenient environmental sampling methods could be designed with compatibility for downstream processing like sequence based typing mercante and winchell 2015 scaturro et al 2005 or whole genome sequencing haworth et al 2017 to allow for links with healthcare cases using select methods in concert can substantially increase the value of studies e g allowing interpretation of various units of measurement but requires pooling of resources the investment in test method development and availability varies considerably by dwpi culture based and culture independent methods have been developed for the detection and quantification of most dwpi but their convenience and standardization vary easy to use environmental detection tests like pseudalert and legiolert target single pathogen types for l pneumophila a simple urinary antigen test is available for clinical testing albeit only for the detection of serogroup 1 while convenient the urinary antigen test results in the underestimation of other disease causing serogroups or species e g l longbeachae mercante and winchell 2015 and does not produce isolates for disease tracking more rapid serologic tests based on enzyme immunoassays are under development for ntm but are not commonly employed aksamit et al 2014 haworth et al 2017 while culture based methods generally require specialized expertise the cdc administers a control program for l pneumophila the elite program environmental legionella isolation techniques evaluation development of easier faster methods is needed across to address all dwpi as is the development of quality control programs as it is believed that amoeba and protozoa may play important roles in dwpi persistence in drinking water systems a method to identify dwpis that have been resident in those protists e g dna modification would be valuable moreover faster standardized methods would allow for the testing of multiple organisms at once especially in environmental samples currently measuring all dwpi in a sample can be burdensome even for research projects a possible workflow for an ideal universal method which considers multiple dwpis multiple field specific interests as well as the real world constraints of time and cost is proposed in box 2 3 6 proposed approach microbial ecologists who primarily participate in research on the bench scale can embrace several strategies to make their research more useful from a holistic perspective rapid and well documented well quality controlled clearly reporting sampling strategies that are deliberately designed to answer research questions relevant to cross cutting objectives in health microbiology and engineering identify methods to distinguish virulent from avirulent dwpi species to allow monitoring of dwpis that are of greatest public health significance given the need for ct values for dwpi for informing engineering interventions and complexities of comparing values derived from piecemeal experimental studies a systematic review and meta analysis of kinetic parameters e g inactivation and growth under different temperature disinfectant residual water chemistry and temporal conditions for dwpis is needed for identifying research gaps and data needs include and measure multiple dwpis in research projects so that the potential effect of altered environmental conditions e g temperature disinfectant residual levels can be understood for all dwpi within comparable conditions comparison of conditions across existing published studies is difficult conduct mixed community experiments under conditions representative of real systems alongside studying full scale drinking water systems which are more difficult to control complementary pure culture mixed culture and full scale experiments will allows the field to build on basic understanding and move towards applicable engineering solutions work with other scientific fields to elucidate transmission dynamics of multiple dwpi between media it would be useful to understand the fluxes from biofilm to water water to aerosol aerosol to inhalation and inhalation to infection under multiple water physio chemical scenarios this would require accurate and comparable quantification of organisms in multiple media see methods below develop methods that can i easily be used for multiple dwpi detection and quantification and ii be used on multiple media bodily fluids water biofilm with a single understandable metric box 2 and iii move toward near real time dwpi detection harmonize environmental measurements with clinical approaches for understanding source to receptor exposures along the full exposure continuum track the development of dwpi ar within studies by routinely incorporating ar tracking methods e g qpcr box 1 this is done in some studies e g cocuzza et al 2021 sikora et al 2017 vaz moreira et al 2012 already but efforts can be expanded 4 engineering other building practitioners since dwpi were first identified water quality engineers have made efforts to reduce their proliferation and eliminate them from water systems with many interventions focused on legionella pneumophila alone initial interventions adapted methods used at the treatment plant i e adding traditional disinfectants and could only be applied by trained operators and building managers the field has since expanded to an examination of building and plumbing system design itself with maintenance free strategies introduced at the design stage by architects and engineers borrowing from the field of industrial hygiene hazard removal or employment of maintenance free engineering controls is preferable to relying upon building operation habits or having individuals responsible for reducing their own exposure cdc and niosh 2015 nonetheless implementation of many engineering strategies for pathogen control will involve multiple professions e g architects plumbers building code officials and building managers requiring effective communication 4 1 applying disinfectant since loss of disinfectant residual is associated with microbial growth berry et al 2006 proctor and hammes 2015b boosting the concentrations of disinfectants either in the distribution system or in the plumbing of large buildings is a promising dwpi engineering control while there are many reported successes of on site disinfectant systems there are trade offs between disinfectant types e g efficacy discussed above disinfection byproducts and corrosion of materials giovanardi et al 2020 and differential selection of one dwpi over another chloramine residuals persist longer and have greater effect on biofilms than chlorine in distribution systems but their relative efficacies can be reversed in building water system under conditions that accelerate chloramine decay zhang et al 2009 in comparing samples from buildings where either chlorine or chloramine were applied in the supply s distribution system l pneumophila was detected with similar frequency with both disinfectants while certain ntm were detected more often in chloraminated systems donohue et al 2019 in the distribution system the choice of disinfectant type is often driven by concerns other than dwpi including disinfectant byproduct formation applying disinfectant at the building level can provide additional control but an important nuance is how disinfectant is applied chloramine addition at the building level is able to control legionella spp p aeruginosa and ntm when applied correctly duda et al 2014 lytle et al 2021 however in cooling towers continuous chlorine treatment appeared to suppress legionella spp while promoting pseudomonas spp paranjape et al 2020 the choice of oxidant e g chloramine chlorine or chlorine dioxide can also influence the specific species or strains in a system marchesi et al 2016 therefore the choice of residual disinfectant and delivery mechanism may select for certain dwpi species or strains the choice of disinfectant type at this level is often driven by cost experience and maintenance concerns additionally adding on site disinfectant still may not protect all distal ends can be expensive and may result in a regulatory burden additional testing and permits sdwa 1996 deterring some building owners from preventative action ultimately an effective disinfectant based solution if achievable will rely heavily on building design features upstream water quality and importantly competent operators which may not be feasible in all buildings non traditional disinfection approaches like ultraviolet uv irradiation ozonation and copper silver ionization have been applied in buildings lin et al 2011 neither uv nor ozone provide a strong residual and mycobacterium spp and legionella spp have been shown to survive in full scale ozone contactors kotlarz et al 2018 copper silver ionization generally is effective for reducing culturable l pneumophila lin et al 2011 however its effectiveness is highly dependent on chemical water quality characteristics lin et al 2002 and resistance can develop over time june and dziewulski 2018 thus vigilant maintenance is required office of inspector general 2013 copper silver ionization has not been tested extensively for other dwpi and may be less effective against ntm huang et al 2008 june and dziewulski 2018 kusnetsov et al 2001 overall the effectiveness of non traditional disinfection approaches against all dwpi as well as the skill and capability of system operators must be taken into consideration for long term successful treatment different types of filters and devices uv uv led installed at the point of use are available commercially and can be installed at faucets and showerheads to prevent exposure to bacteria and dwpi nasem 2019 water quality e g turbidity will affect their efficacy and the duration of their use before breakthrough manufacturers test products using iso 22 196 2011 which involves incubation of pure cultures of bacteria on the antimicrobial surface found inside the showerhead iso 2011 and may not represent realistic conditions nonetheless successful implementation of such devices has been observed since dwpi can also grow in point of use filters chaidez and gerba 2004 rodgers et al 1999 frequent replacement is often recommended requiring vigilant building operators recent product improvements incorporate biocides and include inactivation technologies that extend the life of these devices other filters like granular activated carbon filters may create an ideal niche for l pneumophila and ntm dai et al 2018 rodgers et al 1999 wu et al 2017 to ensure public safety validation of these devices under varied realistic scenarios with multiple dwpi is needed 4 2 temperature control in applying findings about temperature discussed above to full scale systems there are several strategies to keep water out of ideal growth ranges in large hot water systems recirculation helps maintain elevated temperatures capable of inactivating dwpi throughout the system maintaining temperatures 60 c in the water heater and 55 c at distal points of the system is recommended for prevention of l pneumophila growth bédard et al 2015a darelid et al 2002 nasem 2019 however some studies indicate that recirculation at improper i e too low temperatures can increase l pneumophila densities presumably due to heat losses prolonging the time within the optimal growth conditions rhoads et al 2015 similarly increasing pipe insulation seems beneficial in that hot water can stay hotter but sometimes adding insulation can increase the time of ideal legionella spp growth temperatures during stagnation in hot water lines bédard et al 2015a van kenhove et al 2019a while cold water systems are not typically the focus for legionella spp research toilets can also transmit l pneumophila couturier et al 2020 and ideal growth temperature can be achieved in cold water systems with co location of hot cold pipes or where warm ambient temperatures are consistently present other dwpi including p aeruginosa bédard et al 2015b are more often studied in cold water systems studies are needed regarding efficacy of optimizing temperature designs against non legionella dwpis and the prevalence of all dwpis in cold water systems one time or periodic treatment can also be applied to remediate potential problems e g recommissioning of buildings after long stagnation or disuse proctor et al 2020 heat shock methods have found some success for l pneumophila control but recovery recolonization and development of resistance or acclimation are common allegra et al 2011 farhat et al 2010 ji et al 2018 temmerman et al 2006 likely attributable to dissipation of temperature in distal ends vbnc protective states or even the ability of l pneumophila to subsist necrotrophically on other cells killed by the intervention biofilm cleaning methods e g ice slurry are also available commercially but without independent verification hyperchlorination or shock chlorination i e temporarily increasing disinfectant concentrations has also been employed but mitigation has been short lived and damage to pipe materials is a concern lin et al 2011 proctor et al 2020 the recommended strength i e dose of chlorine temperature duration and frequency of these treatments must consider the varied dwpi growth rates physiology and resistance to treatment as well as specific characteristics of treated buildings 4 3 building design features many aspects of plumbing design are dictated in building code but most codes were not developed with microbial quality or dwpi growth in mind especially with changing trends in water conservation an update to these building codes is warranted for example despite lower water flows pipe diameter requirements remain unchanged since 1940 hunter design codes hunter 1940 resulting in over sized pipes long stagnation times and low linear flowrates which are hypothesized to influence biofilm and water quality julien et al 2020b on the other hand smaller pipes increase surface area to volume ratios increasing the influence of biofilm on bulk water microbial quality competing objectives will make it challenging to achieve consensus for updated codes decisions made during the design and construction of a building can have consequences for water flow patterns temperature and residence time of water in that building for its entire lifetime in particular buildings are not designed with microbially informed parameters in mind in germany the length of distal ends is restricted to 3 m to limit legionella spp growth nasem 2019 furthermore by placing the toilet at the end of a trunk and branch line water flow can be maximized through the pipes even the orientation of pipes up or down from the pipe to the fixture has implications on temperature and hence dwpi growth due to induction of convective mixing rhoads et al 2015 minimizing the water system footprint by reducing the length of distal pipes reducing the number of fixtures and installing water fixtures close together i e minimizing wet walls would help simplify investigations of dwpi colonization remove de facto dead ends lower construction costs and decrease energy needs for hot water but achieving these collective goals requires communication between many silos of expertise in most plumbing designs distal ends still present a challenge since water treatment will only affect the distal fixture by opening that particular fixture during treatment to address this some new plumbing designs and management protocols either automatically drain pipes or direct manual draining of pipes to dryness between uses as ntm p aeruginosa and fungi thrive in such semi moist environments e g such as showerheads gebert et al 2018 hageskal et al 2009 novak babič et al 2017 tap aerators and sink drains walker and moore 2015 these changes have the potential to alter microbial ecology within plumbing ntm are particularly resistant to desiccation archuleta et al 2002 electronic non touch faucets were designed in part to reduce microbial contamination problems from faucets functioning as fomites yet are associated with colonization and growth of many dwpi bédard et al 2016 kotsanas et al 2008 livni et al 2008 sydnor et al 2012 due to these unintended consequences new plumbing designs should be thoroughly tested for risk of colonization internally by multiple dwpi as well as for their ability to serve as fomites on external facing surfaces the propensity of pipe material to support dwpi survival persistence and growth are often studied iron or copper can have positive iron negative copper silver or mixed copper effects on dwpi growth buse et al 2014 haig et al 2020 lin et al 2002 1996 corrosion can also accelerate decay of disinfectant residual nguyen et al 2012 rhoads et al 2017a reducing stress on all dwpi many plastic pipes leach assimilable organic carbon bucheli witschel et al 2012 van der kooij 1992 a nutrient for growth of many dwpis as they are heterotrophs the type and amount of carbon leaching varies considerably amongst plastics and can affect microbial communities and dwpi proctor et al 2016 one limitation in pipe material research is the duration of studies as most are limited to a few days weeks or months of pipe use the hydrophobicity of pipe materials may have an influence on initial attachment simões et al 2007 and copper may have anti microbial effects learbuch et al 2019 rogers et al 1994 but the long term effects are questionable buse et al 2014 gião et al 2015 proctor et al 2017 rhoads et al 2017b case studies can offer insights into long term effects of plumbing design but interpretation must consider multiple confounding variables consensus on which pipe material to use when or where will require rigorous long term controlled and field validation studies commissioning the final stage of building construction can also impact water quality for the lifetime of the building careful hydraulic balancing i e calibrating pressures helps maintain proper temperatures in both hot and cold water systems if done properly nasem 2019 while some standards for the commissioning process exist they do not necessarily consider water quality often water is allowed to stagnate in pipes for weeks before buildings are occupied inkinen et al 2014 allowing time for biofilm formation ashrae suggests considering shock chlorination after four weeks of stagnation ashrae 2018 according to a survey of the many professional groups involved professional responsibility for the commissioning phase is unclear often resulting in missed steps and minimal review potts and wall 2002 while the building owner is responsible for water quality many people influence it before they take possession of the property 4 4 building maintenance day to day decisions regarding building water system can drastically affect dwpi growth some of these such as local stagnation at a fixture are difficult to control but others like water heater settings are being incorporated into building water management plans aimed at curbing dwpi long stagnation times are generally thought to permit dwpi growth e g due to reduced chlorine residual studies of green buildings with water saving devices that elevate water age often find dwpi rhoads et al 2016 and samples taken after longer stagnation have higher microbial densities haig et al 2020 2018 lautenschlager et al 2010 increased water age is also associated with a change in microbial community composition ji et al 2017 ling et al 2018 proctor et al 2018 and even the type of ntm found haig et al 2018 the community shift may indicate the importance of biofilm interactions with the water phase the speed of biofilm water interactions may account for the need for high frequency flushes to protect against l pneumophila in some buildings e g every 2 h totaro et al 2018 however flushing will not remove biofilms and evidence suggests that increasing the flushing frequency may even cause greater net biofilm growth due to the delivery of fresh nutrients rhoads et al 2015 it should be stressed that flushing after abnormally long stagnation times e g upon return to a second home may remove the immediate exposure threat from dwpi proctor et al 2020 even so it is difficult to reach consensus amongst experts regarding best flushing practices proctor et al 2020 and the direct relationship between stagnation and legionella spp growth is questioned rhoads and hammes 2021 depending on the system size and responsiveness changing water heater settings is a relatively simple way to control dwpi however scalding concerns and energy conservation efforts have resulted in low recommended temperatures e g 48 c 120 f such settings put hot water delivery pipes within the ideal temperature range of dwpi thermostatic mixing valves can be installed close to the point of use to allow higher temperatures and are recommended nasem 2019 but they also have potential issues and require maintenance proctor et al 2020 instantaneous tankless water heaters may also allow temperature control while alleviating energy concerns brazeau and edwards 2013 most research on water heater settings have focused on l pneumophila nasem 2019 research considering the use of temperature to control other dwpis is needed moreover cost benefit analysis to weigh health scalding and energy concerns are needed from multidisciplinary teams water management plans vary widely but are all aimed at understanding and improving water quality plans should identify potential hazards e g aerosol producing water features low use fixtures and characterize the water system e g water heater operation connections to other systems which may be beyond the scope of information routinely available to building operators or feasible to collect on a routine basis control measures might be suggested including physical controls temperature management disinfectant control and pathogen testing to date plans sporadically include best practices like cleaning showerheads and aerators flushing hot water tanks and minimizing aerosol exposure through increased ventilation in bathrooms masters et al 2018 while success of water management plans is challenging to measure simply having a water management plan may not be sufficient to improve water quality van der lugt et al 2019 moving forward creators of water management plans likely require more guidance training site specific information and access to specific expertise to develop and execute an effective document conflicting advice and interests e g liability with testing also influence the effectiveness of water management plans most water management plans are targeted at l pneumophila prevention including those required by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 2018 such a focus may be promoting practices that unintentionally create ideal conditions for other dwpi as was shown following the substitution of monochloramine for chlorine and the disappearance of legionella spp but an increase in mycobacterium spp numbers pryor et al 2004 moreover maintenance of other water systems e g cooling towers might be overlooked in these plans but likely have a strong effect on disease 4 5 an example of holistic thinking creating proactive incentives implementation of engineering solutions and legislation after the discovery of a problem in the field is typically reactive rather than proactive and may not consider multiple hazards or unintended consequences of action for example legislation was enacted nationwide for drinking water in response to the 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak gostin et al 2000 and for cooling towers in new york city response to a 2015 legionnaire s outbreak bassett and balter 2017 even in communication of risk there is a clear lack of multi hazard consideration communication materials are available to inform the public on steps they can take to make decisions e g individual risk factors and behaviors in order to manage dwpi emphasizing that this is a shared responsibility between utilities facilities managers and individuals masters et al 2018 however most of the guidance available is for preventing risks of legionella spp at the exclusion of other water quality issues singh et al 2020 the benefits of awareness and having a water management plan are not entirely conclusive clopper et al 2021 van der lugt et al 2019 perhaps due to a variety in plan content and follow through however a recent study suggested that 81 of l pneumophila fatalities occurred in facilities without a water management plan clopper et al 2021 in a survey of minnesota hospitals the majority of building managers expressed interest in getting assistance to set up a water management plan danila et al 2018 more research to target the effective elements of water management plans will assist in creating effective plans a potential solution to raise awareness and move towards more effective proactive solutions like building water management plans could be to incorporate building water maintenance into health and building insurance programs this approach would take into consideration potential future savings on health care costs due to lowered infection rates and building owners legal fees due to lowered liability in case of infection these plans can incentivize preventative actions and even offset the energy institutional or testing costs associated with those preventative actions 4 6 proposed approach dwpi can be considered over the entire lifetime of the building from design through everyday maintenance the implementation of engineering solutions requires many non engineering strategies encourage microbially informed design of buildings through mechanisms such as leed or national organizations incorporate education about all dwpi into implementation of engineering solutions such that architects construction professionals building owners managers and maintenance personnel have greater understanding of the significance of the work this can include educating building tenants about personal risk factors for dwpi improving communication education across disciplines e g regarding plumbing operation codes fixture designs among non engineering communities and consideration of public health concerns by engineering community at the design phase encourage building owners and renters insurance to include partial coverage of building water quality to incentivize preventative actions include previously developed water management plans in the sale of buildings and require water testing as an inspection element so that new tenants are aware of potential issues and address them if testing isn t required disclosure of previous water issues and testing if conducted should be required create a database of building testing data for all dwpi to collect existing data and encourage greater investigations into large data trends this can include a more standardized reporting procedure for building size sample type and engineering solutions currently in place incorporate ar tracing into studies of real buildings including epidemiological investigations of outbreaks to better understand how widespread ar is within engineered drinking water systems box 1 investigations of engineering controls for ar can also be scaled up and tested in the field 5 conclusions clearly key similarities exist among dwpis exposure routes are similar and various niches in plumbing systems provide ideal growth conditions often with similar temperature ranges for growth slow growth and preference for the biofilm phase however differences in dwpi physiology and response to the culmination of various conditions in building water system e g resistance factors competition can result in different susceptibilities to each dwpi among individuals and populations while mitigation efforts are also not universally effective against each dwpi the most well studied dwpi across many fields is undoubtedly l pneumophila while awareness and treatment of this microorganism is a positive step towards improving plumbing design and operation and better protecting public health and safer plumbing ignoring other dwpis could result in unintended consequences and increase the burden on the healthcare system strategies to reduce l pneumophila tend to reduce overall biofilm concentration and increase disinfectant residual and thus may create conditions ideal for ntm pryor et al 2004 proliferation the attention placed on l pneumophila has supported development of rapid and easy diagnostic and environmental measuring techniques which in turn has led to substantial advancement of understanding of l pneumophila in both clinical and environmental realms our understanding of other microorganisms would benefit from similar development of rapid tests which can be motivated with financial and legislative incentives ultimately strategies to holistically protect the public from pathogens capable of growth in drinking water will involve the consideration of all dwpis together and across all disciplines for example more dwpi associated diseases should be reportable and microorganisms should be studied concurrently in buildings to better inform risk models while a single solution that creates a zero risk plumbing system is not possible increased cooperation and multiple dwpi consideration will allow for informed balancing of risk and consequences box 1 various groups are responsible for water safety regarding drinking water

16291,in recent years drinking water associated pathogens that can cause infections in immunocompromised or otherwise susceptible individuals henceforth referred to as dwpi sometimes referred to as opportunistic pathogens or opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens have received considerable attention dwpi research has largely been conducted by experts focusing on specific microorganisms or within silos of expertise the resulting mitigation approaches optimized for a single microorganism may have unintended consequences and trade offs for other dwpi or other interests e g energy costs and conservation for example the ecological and epidemiological issues characteristic of legionella pneumophila diverge from those relevant for mycobacterium avium and other nontuberculous mycobacteria recent advances in understanding dwpi as part of a complex microbial ecosystem inhabiting drinking water systems continues to reveal additional challenges namely how can all microorganisms of concern be managed simultaneously in order to protect public health we must take a more holistic approach in all aspects of the field including basic research monitoring methods risk based mitigation techniques and policy a holistic approach will i target multiple microorganisms simultaneously ii involve experts across several disciplines and iii communicate results across

water associated pathogens that predominantly cause infections in immunocompromised individuals dwpi has exploded new dwpi continue to be identified e g a 2018 balamuthia mandrillaria infection tentatively linked to tap water piper et al 2018 at the same time that our understanding of the diverse ecological system within pipes is expanding douterelo et al 2019 hull et al 2019 today infections associated with dwpi are estimated to cost the us economy 2 39 billion annually collier et al 2021 and the incidence of several dwpi continues to increase adjemian et al 2012 billinger et al 2009 cdc 2011 collier et al 2021 marras et al 2007 prevots et al 2010 prussin et al 2017 many microorganisms could be considered dwpi while there is no perfect term for these organisms there are several criteria for grouping them under this umbrella here we focus on bacteria and amoebae that are 1 adapted to grow in drinking water systems particularly within building water systems and water fixtures e g cold and hot water lines heaters faucets fountains and 2 frequently cause disease in susceptible populations e g at risk individuals older people people with immune compromise and or lung disease we consider that the characteristics of susceptible populations vary and that infections sometimes occur in individuals that appear to be healthy while present naturally in the environment surface water soil dwpi typically are not present in high concentrations in finished water leaving the drinking water treatment plant but multiply within the distribution network and especially in building water systems often within biofilms while all dwpi are capable of causing disease the risk of becoming infected is influenced by various factors including the microorganism s virulence exposure dose and the susceptibility of the exposed population here we focus on dwpi that typically pose a lesser threat to healthy individuals compared to those with underlying health conditions or susceptibilities moreover common routes of exposure to dwpi are typically through non ingestion e g aspiration or inhalation of aerosols generated from showering or other exposures rather than ingestion drinking routes although fecal pathogens are occasionally found in drinking water systems we exclude traditional fecal oral pathogens which cause gastrointestinal disease after ingestion as these microorganisms tend not to proliferate or regrow in municipally treated drinking water ashbolt 2015 some so called true or frank pathogens can also grow within drinking water systems and cause disease through non ingestion routes of exposure e g naegleria fowleri although this is less common the entire list of organisms we consider to be dwpi can be found in table 1 much of our discussion focuses on three exemplary bacterial groups that represent a significant disease burden collier et al 2021 have distinct physiologies and have the most research available legionella pneumophila mycobacterium avium and other nontuberculous mycobacteria ntm and pseudomonas aeruginosa fig 1 to combat dwpi disease emerging guidance documents attempt to synthesize research knowledge into risk management strategies julien et al 2020a singh et al 2020 in 2015 the first industry standard for drinking water system management in buildings was released ashrae 2015 rhoads et al 2014 and many resources are now available to help develop what are generally known as water safety plans ashrae 2020a 2018 cdc 2021a mitigation efforts are often targeted at healthcare facilities as many dwpi infections are nosocomial healthcare or hospital acquired due in part to the high density of vulnerable individuals the veterans affairs office first issued a directive concerning legionella spp prevention in healthcare facilities in 2014 vha 2014 updated in 2021 vha 2021 and all hospitals receiving medicare medicaid funding are now required to have building water management plans cms 2017 updated in 2018 cms 2018 unfortunately the content of these plans is not specifically mandated ambrose et al 2021 regulations are a step in the right direction but have shortcomings bope et al 2018 and vary globally as illustrated by l pneumophila standards and guidelines nasem 2019 van kenhove et al 2019b for example although the ashrae standard was a substantial forward in taking some action it does not address residential home systems despite the epidemiological link between building drinking water systems and infection by dwpi lande et al 2019 pedro botet et al 2002 stout et al 1992 yu et al 2004 in fact 96 of legionnaires disease cases in the u s are of unknown etiology and it is suspected that sporadic residential exposure is a substantial source cdc 2011 it is difficult to measure the success of interventions especially given the consistent increase in incidence of legionnaires disease i e 5 5 times increase in incidence of reported cases in the u s from 2000 to 2017 cdc 2018 with reporting potentially due to factors such as increased awareness and testing in addition to an actual increase in disease incidence or prevalence moreover environmental testing data i e water samples are not mandated to be centrally reported in the u s cdc 2019a even for legionella spp while the maximum contaminant level goal mclg for legionella spp has long been zero us epa 2015 regular direct monitoring in drinking water systems is not required in the u s in contrast other countries e g germany have required environmental monitoring for both l pneumophila and p aeruginosa nasem 2019 perhaps because legionella spp is associated with the most reported data and strictest regulations available guidance has focused on legionella spp but guidance may be at the expense of other dwpi in certain situations for example ntm is thought to be at least as important to the us disease burden as legionella spp collier et al 2021 daley and salfinger 2016 a complicating factor but also a potential motivation for holistic approaches is that clinically meaningful antibiotic resistance ar often complicates treatment for infections by dwpi such as legionella spp de giglio et al 2015 shadoud et al 2015 ntm van ingen et al 2012 and p aeruginosa smith et al 2016 1 1 justification and scope in considering the fifty plus years of research progress and mitigation efforts for dwpis it has become clear that a more holistic approach is needed to unite and strengthen efforts taking place across numerous fields and disciplines fig 1 holistic in this context can be defined as considering multiple parts as interconnected and part of a whole rather than as disconnected components the current approach can be segmented both by discipline and by specific microorganism of interest moreover decision processes must balance many interests including other health outcomes cost and energy additional local considerations and boundaries of water jurisdictions further segment approaches to manage dwpi first while experts trained in various disciplines are making advances to understanding dwpi behavior there is a lack of means to efficiently and effectively share findings across disciplines in part due to terminology unique to each field table 2 often literature reviews focus on either clinical disease johnson and odell 2014 microorganism fate and transport falkinham 2018 or persistence in drinking water systems dowdell et al 2019 dwpi research from these disciplines often occurs in parallel fields without sufficient connection and tends to neglect translational work that bridges research and practice for example due to limited resources epidemiological outbreak investigations may not aim to link clinical and environmental samples e g the majority or patients diagnosed with legionellosis in 2016 2017 in the us did not have an exposure source healthcare setting travel history or senior living facility identified cdc 2020a noting that person to person spread is considered negligible correia et al 2016 both research and field investigations will benefit from increased communication second and perhaps more importantly disciplinary teams often focus on one microorganism due to logistical limitations and available methods as reflected in literature reviews that focus on one microorganism bédard et al 2016 falkinham 2018 2009 nasem 2019 coinfections or polymicrobial infections with dwpis are possible naito et al 2020 dev and ashbolt 2020 but data regarding co infection within the same species of dwpi or with multiple dwpis as well as regarding the ability for a dwpi infection to serve as a pre disposing factor for other infectious agents is a data gap some reviews of microbial ecology berry et al 2006 proctor and hammes 2015a or broad scoping reviews falkinham et al 2015 can take multiple pathogens into consideration but this does not necessarily translate to specific interventions designed for practitioners with most guidance directed at individual dwpi we have noted examples of incompatible recommendations for instance adding free chlorine at the building level can be effective in reducing concentrations of l pneumophila but might increase ntm occurrence in building water system moore et al 2006 rhoads et al 2017b similarly the use of monochloramines may offer enhanced diffusion into biofilms for pathogen inactivation but as a weaker oxidant will prove less effective against ntm revetta et al 2013 the authors have noted a lack of studies that simultaneously tackle the full suite of dwpi even clinical or plumbing management recommendations targeted at a single microorganism type may fail to take into account host micro eukaryotes thomas et al 2010 that may be critical for pathogen recovery dey et al 2019a and strain variability within specific groups such as that exemplified by the wide variation in virulence and health outcomes as a result of infection with different species within the mycobacterium genus tortoli 2014 future recommendations should consider the impact on the full suite of dwpi in this paper we outline similarities and differences among dwpi that can lead to conflicting guidance and present research needs that could help with the development of a necessary consensus across disciplines we consider these similarities and differences across three main categories clinical and public health microbial ecology and engineering controls we highlight several opportunities to encourage research to be more cross disciplinary and to increase the translation of research findings into practice we present this commentary to advocate for a more holistic approach to dwpi research legislative action building codes monitoring efforts and professional practice to reduce the burden of disease associated with dwpi the authors represent a diverse background of primary disciplines and organisms of interest supplementary table s1 to emphasize the importance of cross disciplinary cooperation 2 clinical medicine public health while clinical medicine focuses on the treatment and outcomes of individual patients the field of public health addresses the prevention of disease and promotion of health at the population level we have chosen to discuss them together here as both focus on human health the overlap in research and practice dwpi have long been the focus of both clinical and public health research however in some cases disparate goals have resulted in a lack of alignment among disease surveillance and reporting clinical diagnosis and assessment of dwpi risks multiple dwpi hazards exist and the ability to detect dwpi associated diseases and to predict their impacts varies holistically assessing these factors and impacts is nontrivial especially as exposures may relate to episodic and complex phenomena at play in plumbing systems 2 1 reporting in the u s legionellosis is currently the only nationally notifiable group of diseases caused by dwpis to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc cdc 2019b ntm infections and positive isolates are required to be reported in some states table 1 the wide variation among ntm reporting requirements has resulted in calls for a national reporting requirement for ntm daley and salfinger 2016 donohue 2018 winthrop et al 2017 certain infections with dwpi may meet criteria for reporting in the cdc national healthcare safety network for healthcare associated infections such as pseudomonas related blood stream infections drug resistant p aeruginosa infections are tracked by cdc through its antibiotic resistance ar laboratory network however the ar lab network is not a surveillance network and does not represent testing of every isolate in every state cdc 2019c certain states such as minnesota and wisconsin require reporting of free living amoebic infections including acanthamoeba spp n fowleri balamuthia spp and sappinia spp minnesota department of health 2019a wisconsin department of health services 2018 and primary amoebic encephalitis caused by n fowleri is state reportable in florida texas and louisiana cdc 2017 this patchwork of surveillance and notification requirements often motivated by high profile outbreaks highlights the need for unified dwpi associated disease reporting to fully assess disease burdens even so mild infections often go undiagnosed or untreated while healthcare associated infections are also likely underestimated perkins et al 2019 spagnolo et al 2016 overall reported cases are the tip of the iceberg who europe 2019 yang et al 2012 2 2 diagnosis and epidemiologic case definitions an epidemiological case definition is a set of standard criteria for classifying whether a person has a particular disease syndrome or other health conditions cdc 2012a some of these definitions have been developed into national standards that are comparable across clinical settings and locations a standardized case definition is an important step toward making large scale comparisons of dwpi case definition criteria can be more limited during an outbreak investigation and the strictness of the definition depends on the purposes for classifying the occurrence of a disease cdc 2012a a case definition is not the same as a clinical diagnostic criterion where the former is used to aid an epidemiologic investigation and the latter is used to make treatment decisions for individual patients lamorte 2016 clinicians ability to diagnose dwpi diseases vary but most approaches are based on culture or molecular analysis of the pathogen in bodily fluids or observation of antibodies to a particular infection with regard to standardized case definitions legionnaires disease has a clear case definition cdc 2021b but a standard case definition for pontiac fever which is generally considered to be a milder form of legionellosis without pneumonia has only recently been established cste 2019 2010 2005 tossa et al 2006 similarly case definitions have only recently been standardized for free living amoebae cdc 2012b and ntm cste 2017 oregon health authority 2018 infections while p aeruginosa infections are diagnosed via bacterial culture as a primary or secondary bloodstream infection secondary bloodstream infections are not reportable as laboratory confirmed bloodstream infections to the cdc national healthcare safety network cdc 2020b other case definition criteria are used for antibiotic resistant p aeruginosa infections minnesota department of health 2019b walters et al 2019 for m avium and other ntm the american thoracic society infectious disease society of america and the british thoracic society define a confirmed case as one with ntm grown from two separate sputum samples or a single positive sample from a broncoalveolar lavage or a lung biopsy griffith et al 2007 haworth et al 2017 in addition the council of state and territorial epidemiologists cste has recently published a case definition for extrapulmonary ntm cste 2017 oregon health authority 2018 granulomatous amoebic encephalitis gae i e amoebic infection of the central nervous system is often diagnosable but rarely before it becomes fatal reed et al 1997 sell et al 1997 factors including i extended disease progression especially for ntm which may have a progression over years field et al 2004 lewis et al 1960 ii lack of identification needed to reach a diagnosis or treatment e g otitis externa or swimmer s ear can be treated without identifying the causative organism as p aeruginosa and iii lack of clinical awareness alaga et al 2018 can obscure connections between environmental exposure and disease johnson and odell 2014 provoost et al 2018 the use of medical decision trees tools with visual descriptions of a series of diagnostic tools and subsequent outcomes and downstream decisions to aid in arriving at a diagnosis have been long employed in the medical literature detsky et al 1997 such tools would be beneficial in the dwpi context for codifying information that could distinguish between different dwpi disease outcomes as well as to highlight gaps where additional information could be collected to clinicians in differentiating between dwpi infections and elucidating causal pathways detsky et al 1997 testing is critical for diagnosis but convenience reproducibility and accuracy sensitivity or the probability of correctly identifying a positive case of disease and specificity the probability of correctly testing negative in the absence of disease of available testing technologies varies by dwpi and the compatibility of environmental and clinical tests varies due to conflicting goals as discussed below taken together these challenges for diagnosis amplify the underreporting of dwpi disease accurate reporting will require 1 rapid reproducible and precise testing methodologies for dwpi diseases 2 diagnostic protocols that include clear decision trees for routine inclusion of dwpi in clinical workups and 3 national reporting requirements and databases for dwpi epidemiological investigations offer a clear opportunity for cross disciplinary work clinical medicine can identify disease and report it while public health specialists will look for environmental sources of exposure to link to the outcome this requires timely cooperation and communication so that environments can be sampled close to the exposure window linkage typically requires work at the sub species level and should look for co infections with other dwpi engineers can also contribute to epidemiological studies by identifying key exposure points that can be added to epidemiological surveys of exposure history e g do you live near a water feature successful quantification of both exposure and outcomes can help validate risk models 2 3 an example of holistic thinking risk assessment and management in assessing risks from dwpi a traditional approach may focus on risks of a single pathogen epidemiological observations and studies or even costs associated with treating a single disease however a combination of metrics would be needed to holistically evaluate and prioritize the impacts costs and tradeoffs of dwpi in different contexts and substantial value judgements would be necessary when communicating these types of analyses for legislative and preventative efforts further complexity is added when competing objectives of many stakeholders e g energy costs liabilities and management objectives unrelated to dwpi must be considered in this section we describe how the current approach to risk assessment includes aspects of a holistic approach and can be further improved to incorporate metrics from other disciplines the prevalence of infections by dwpi varies table 1 although some rank order differences have been estimated ntm up to 41 3 per 100 000 legionnaires disease up to 1 36 per 100 000 p aeruginosa acanthamoeba n fowleri falkinham et al 2015 strollo et al 2015 furthermore disease prognoses vary greatly for example n fowleri associated meningoencephalitis has a 95 case fatality rate wang et al 2018 while the case fatality rate for healthcare associated legionnaires disease is up to 25 in some susceptible populations cdc 2021c quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra may be useful for prioritization as it aims to understand underlying mechanisms relative contributions of processes and modeling rare outcomes among other attributes bridging environmental concentrations to outcomes of interest via dose response models haas et al 2014 world health organization 2016 qmra is especially useful as a companion tool to traditional epidemiological methods which can necessitate large studies in order to observe potentially small effect size dose response models used in qmra are available for quantifying relationships between exposure and the probability of an outcome for dwpi supplementary table s2 a growing body of qmra literature addresses legionella spp hamilton and haas 2016 ntm hamilton et al 2017 rice et al 2005 p aeruginosa dean and mitchell 2020a rasheduzzaman et al 2019 and n fowleri dean et al 2019 rasheduzzaman et al 2019 but important limitations remain as many variables must be considered for example the likelihood of infection for a dwpi is not only dependent on the species strain of microorganism the virulence of the microorganism at a given time and host characteristics e g immune status age demographics but also on the fate and transport of the microorganism in the environment and exposure route and dose for example men over 55 years of age are at higher risk for l pneumophila while ntm tends to disproportionately infect slender taller post menopausal women chalmers et al 2018 kartalija et al 2013 new dose response models will be useful for microbial ecologists water quality engineers and ultimately legislators seeking to identify risk based monitoring targets for environmental control of these organisms such efforts to derive risk based concentration monitoring targets have already begun for acanthamoeba spp dean and mitchell 2020b p aeruginosa and n fowleri rasheduzzaman et al 2019 and l pneumophila hamilton et al 2019 risk prioritization could also be assigned based on cost but tracking disease and quantifying costs of illness are challenging adam et al 2017 multiple approaches are available in the economic risk decision analysis and policy analysis literature to inform decisions that take into account multiple pathogen considerations e g mitchell blackwood et al 2011 these approaches not only consider the direct losses e g hospitalization costs table 1 collier et al 2021 but also secondary considerations such as non hospitalized infections i e missed work lowered productivity and mortality when allocating scarce resources institute of medicine 2009 national research council 1990 for example corso et al 2003 identified healthcare costs and productivity losses from the 1993 cryptosporidiosis outbreak in milwaukee wisconsin using costs from categories of people with mild moderate and severe illness using a retrospective analysis arriving at an estimate of 96 2 million in losses 2003 us dollars corso et al 2003 in addition to direct costs disease has many indirect costs including loss of trust in the safety of municipal drinking water in considering costs the expense of trade offs including alternative risks and costs of preventative measures should be considered for example raising the temperature of a water heater can decrease risk of dwpi infection but will increase the risk of scalding and energy costs such analyses would improve if all dwpi were reportable noting that cryptosporidiosis did not become a nationally notifiable disease until 1995 after the catastrophic milwaukee outbreak cdc 1995 the level of acceptable risk is typically dependent upon the hazard consequences and ability to control exposure nasem 2019 drinking water efforts for policy standardization have typically relied on health risk based target benchmarks such as one in 10 000 infections per person per year lim and jiang 2013 regli et al 1991 per exposure versus annual risks are often chosen as a decision basis depending on whether exposures are continuous or short term leading to different monitoring approaches with annual based approaches focusing less on short term hazardous event variations nasem 2019 signor and ashbolt 2009 the choice of an acceptable risk value like one in 10 000 is a policy decision and may be too stringent in certain situations haas 1996 lim and jiang 2013 other endpoint metrics are available such as the disability adjusted life year daly to measure the health impacts of a disease incorporating both fatal and non fatal outcomes a 10 6 daly per person per year is often used as a reference point sinclair et al 2015 who 2015 a daly value is available for legionellosis van lier et al 2016 however this value is location and context specific regardless of the quantification method used there is no such thing as zero risk de keuckelaere et al 2015 research needs for dwpi risk assessment and prioritization can be summarized as follows 1 an increased understanding of infectivity including new dose response models for emerging dwpi for various exposure routes e g aspiration endpoints susceptibilities 2 the impact of underlying human characteristics and behavioral factors e g smoking use of tap water for non recommended uses such as neti pots contact lenses and medical uses occupational co exposures of host populations and impact on risk 3 knowledge of virulent types amongst each of the dwpi species to aid monitoring 4 improved exposure information for aerosol exposures as well as non potable uses such as cooling towers healthcare equipment dental equipment and other known sources of infection 5 consideration of multiple costs and risk tradeoffs e g increasing water heater temperatures to inactivate legionella spp results in higher energy costs and 6 careful consideration of risk benchmark metrics in various decision making processes the insurance industry section 4 5 may provide an opportunity to address risks and consider costs across multiple sectors 2 4 proposed approach clinicians public health practitioners and other health researchers who wish to participate in a holistic approach to dwpi can embrace several strategies recognizing that these proposed approaches are not always easy to implement they are ordered from most to least readily achievable educate at risk individuals about their personal risk factors and provide them with the resources to protect their water systems and modify behavior to minimize personal risk timely studies across public health and medicine that link exposures and disease outcomes outbreaks improving linkages among professionals in the medical and environmental space for this purpose following a case investigation communicate with water providers and building managers about potential risks and strategies for future disease prevention regardless of whether positive environmental samples were collected in order to increase awareness of potential problems report every instance of dwpi to a centralized database box 1 make reporting of all dwpi mandatory rather than just some pathogens and to the extent possible match clinical cases with environmental samples within linked reporting databases using risk assessment to systematically identify and prioritize research gaps understand tradeoffs and improve modeling efforts toward predicting and preventing rather than reacting to dwpi illness rapid more granular public health data collection for dwpi associated illnesses and expansion beyond legionella spp which also considers people presenting with symptoms associated with dwpi for further testing and diagnosis 3 microbiology and microbial ecology each dwpi has a unique set of ideal environmental conditions for proliferation these conditions generally overlap to allow for growth within the environment drinking water systems and the human body but clear differences in niches have emerged in studying microorganisms in isolated laboratory conditions important discoveries are made but studies can also be designed to emulate realistic conditions to inform complex cross species interactions as well as actionable engineering strategies and policies 3 1 key microbial physiological considerations fundamental microbiology studies have revealed several innate physiological and structural traits that might predict where dwpi are likely to be found in the environment hydrophobicity and surface charge are important factors in determining the partitioning of cells aggregates in a drinking water system e g planktonic vs surface microlayer vs biofilm and the likelihood of aerosolization falkinham 2018 parker et al 1983 many dwpi are hydrophobic and prefer to grow on surfaces in biofilms falkinham 2009 ntm are especially notable given their waxy acid fast cell walls which make them particularly hydrophobic and readily aerosolized falkinham 2018 parker et al 1983 surface charge may also dictate ecological distribution and infectivity steed and falkinham 2006 stormer and falkinham 1989 van oss et al 1975 for example differences in the electrophoretic mobility among l pneumophila serogroups likely contributed to differences in serogroup behaviors buse et al 2018 in contrast several m avium complex species exhibited less variability in electrophoretic mobility lytle et al 2004 it is also important to recognize the way dwpi may be presented in exposure scenarios such as packaged within amoebal vesicles trophozoites or cysts shaheen and ashbolt 2018 further understanding of these differences is critical to identifying likely hotspots and explaining disease patterns dwpi growth rates vary considerably impacting incubation periods between exposure and symptom onset preferred growth location and ideal culture detection methods while doubling times and growth conditions can vary within a species generally the growth rates for m avium and pseudomonas spp are generally low sharaby et al 2017 van der kooij et al 1982 these growth rates are lower in the drinking water environment than in clinical or laboratory settings due to oligotrophic conditions this can mean that culture based recovery of environmental dwpi isolates can require 10 days lalancette et al 2017 in this field growth is considered rapid if organisms are detectable in less than 7 days specific strains and species also exhibit wide variation for example mycobacterium malmoense requires 8 12 weeks for culture detection while m abscessus and other rapidly growing ntm can be detected in 7 days bartlett et al 2000 caution should be taken in extrapolating conclusions regarding growth rates as a slow growth rate does not necessarily imply slow metabolism mycobacterial increase in numbers is slow because a great deal of energy is expended in synthesizing the long chain c60 c80 lipids that comprise the outer membrane brennan and nikaido 1995 it is critical to understand these basic pure culture behaviors in order to 1 understand microbial incubation periods and colonization patterns across ecosystems 2 develop robust cost effective methods box 2 and 3 design engineering solutions e g intermittent flush heat shock for multiple dwpi simultaneously many dwpi survive stress due to harsh conditions in potable water e g low nutrients temperature and exposure to chlorine residuals by resorting to a dormant or protective state this includes the poorly understood viable but nonculturable vbnc state alleron et al 2008 dopp et al 2017 li et al 2014 and survival within protozoa which has been observed for many bacterial dwpi thomas et al 2010 these survival mechanisms can result in false non detects for culture based methods and sometimes molecular methods e g when amoebae are not lysed effectively importantly these seemingly non active microorganisms are still capable of infection dey et al 2019b with several studies showing the reactivation of dwpi after they are exposed to a less stressful environment dietersdorfer et al 2018 such as within the human body the importance of detecting viability varies across stakeholders section 3 5 but improved methods to quickly detect and differentiate between different physiological states would be widely beneficial across disciplines 3 2 environmental conditions dwpi respond to a variety of physio chemical factors including temperature disinfectant residual type and concentration oxygen levels and other water chemistry characteristics many of these factors have been studied with direct implications for engineering solutions indicating cooperation between these disciplines care must be taken in interpreting results from different scales of experiments that can range from pure culture to studies of full scale buildings as studies often focus on only one dwpi or limited environmental factors it is difficult to determine the applicability of findings 1 across dwpi 2 in different systems or 3 at different scales of study still some differences in niche seem to emerge amongst dwpi ideal temperatures for most dwpi are similar 28 35 c but growth can occur outside this range for example p aeruginosa can grow between 10 and 42 c brown 1957 while most dwpi are considered inactive at temperatures greater than 55 to 60 c their recovery after exposure to higher temperatures e g 63 c for l pneumophila borella et al 2004 and 65 c for ntm merkal and crawford 1979 may indicate they are present in the vbnc state i e vbnc l pneumophila after exposure to 70 c allegra et al 2008 or exhibit other survival mechanisms under such conditions conclusions about responses to temperature extremes are especially difficult to scale up to engineered water systems because in situ temperatures are difficult to measure at various scales e g within a biofilm or at a pipe wall versus at the center of the water column and survival may further be aided by biofilms protozoa and areas not exposed to maximum or minimum system temperatures as temperature may allow for niche differentiation this presents an opportunity for further multi dwpi studies the chemical characteristics of drinking water vary based on source e g groundwater vs surface water residual disinfectant type i e chloramine vs free chlorine and specific building parameters i e pipe material all of which individually and collectively influence the growth and survival of dwpi and their hosts as all of these water chemistry factors can differ across studies it is difficult to 1 isolate factors of concern and 2 compare results for different dwpi comparison of disinfectant efficacy is especially difficult even for a single organism ct disinfection concentration c x time t mg min l inactivation values can vary based on strain material type presence of biofilm ph and or temperature buse et al 2019 dowdell et al 2019 still each dwpi also appears to demonstrate slightly different tolerances towards chloramine and free chlorine chloramine has a strong effect on l pneumophila and p aeruginosa but is less effective towards inactivating ntm dowdell et al 2019 lytle et al 2021 moore et al 2006 rhoads et al 2017b m avium complex and p aeruginosa typically exhibit high resistance to both disinfectants grobe et al 2001 taylor et al 2000 to allow more accurate conclusions regarding disinfectants effects on dwpi it is critical to 1 fully report all water chemistry variables 2 study multiple dwpis within the same experimental framework the concentrations of metal ions can also impact growth and survival of dwpi but are not always considered in studies at multiple scales iron typically originating from iron pipes may be a critical nutrient for legionella spp ntm and p aeruginosa growth although in different quantities copper originating from copper silver ionization systems or from copper pipes is generally considered to have antimicrobial properties cachafeiro et al 2007 landeen et al 1989 lin et al 1996 liu et al 1994 furthermore copper has also been linked to vbnc induction in p aeruginosa bédard et al 2014 dopp et al 2017 dwidjosiswojo et al 2011 still these results are difficult to scale to engineering solutions especially considering the variability of metal concentrations both spatially and temporally within building water systems and changes in metal chemistry throughout the lifetime of a building brazeau and edwards 2013 rhoads et al 2017b salehi et al 2020 for example while the use of copper pipes has been suggested as a control mechanism for l pneumophila learbuch et al 2019 rogers et al 1994 the effects on l pneumophila and other dwpi might be short lived ph dependent and modified in the presence of biofilm buse et al 2017 elguindi et al 2009 proctor et al 2017 rhoads et al 2017b under certain conditions the presence of copper may even selectively encourage the growth of l pneumophila proctor et al 2017 rhoads et al 2017b by changing the pipe microbiome buse et al 2014 elucidating the impact of metals on the broader microbiome under varied water chemistry conditions will allow better understanding of conflicting findings in full scale systems each dwpi also has a unique set of nutrient and oxygen requirements with some dwpi surviving under extreme conditions that may provide competitive advantages the m avium complex is considered microaerobic growing in as little as 6 oxygen and surviving in anaerobic conditions lewis and falkinham 2015 p aeruginosa is generally considered aerobic but can grow anaerobically utilizing nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor palmer et al 2007 l pneumophila on the other hand is an obligate aerobe requires amino acids produced by other microorganisms and can grow necrotrophically temmerman et al 2006 amoebae similarly rely on other microorganisms digesting them via phagocytosis samba louaka et al 2019 better understanding of this niche differentiation will assist in finding mitigation strategies that are effective for mitigating the full suite of dwpi 3 3 dwpi interactions when dwpi are studied together relationships parasitic symbiotic and competitive are uncovered that would not be seen in monoculture studies many dwpi including legionella spp and ntm can be phagocytized by free living protozoa and amoebae delafont et al 2018 which facilitates replication offers protection and enhances virulence buse and ashbolt 2011 cateau et al 2011 cirillo et al 1997 amoebic relationships may account for the preference of l pneumophila in biofilms with high cell densities van der kooij et al 2017 versus the preference of pseudomonas spp and mycobacterium spp in biofilms with low cell densities proctor et al 2018 2016 some of these protozoan hosts are also dwpi themselves e g acanthamoeba p aeruginosa can suppress the growth of l pneumophila kimura et al 2009 and may prevent their attachment to simple biofilms stewart et al 2012 likely through the production of bacteriocin like substances that suppress competitors guerrieri et al 2008 also there appears to be preference by amoeba for prey that are not amoeba resisting shaheen and ashbolt 2021 in continuously chlorinated cooling towers legionella spp and pseudomonas spp had negative associations due to direct or indirect relationships with hosts paranjape et al 2020 in addition dwpi can compete with one another and other drinking water bacteria for uptake by amoebic hosts potentially affecting inactivation and virulence berry et al 2010 cirillo et al 1997 declerck et al 2005 thomas and ashbolt 2011 it may be possible to leverage these findings to eliminate dwpi from water systems 3 4 an example of holistic thinking antibiotic resistance the differentiation of niches amongst dwpi is especially well exemplified with respect to antibiotic resistance ar box 1 the resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics has been widely studied across multiple disciplines and multiple dwpi embodying key aspects of the proposed holistic approach epidemiologists and clinicians traditionally study ar with respect to identifying sources limiting their spread and determining the best treatment approaches ecologists study environmental niches conducive to growth of ar organisms conditions that select for resistant strains and microenvironments favorable to the transfer of ar genes via cell to cell via horizontal gene transfer concerns regarding ar are emerging for engineers who have studies how engineered systems can serve as barriers to the spread of ar or conversely can inadvertently promote dissemination of ar identifying solutions to these pressing and unconventional challenges necessitates collaboration among researchers across disciplines but holistic solutions are needed given that each organism presents unique challenges holistic consideration of these challenges by engineers ecologists and epidemiologists working in collaboration is necessary for parallel control of these disparate ar dwpis in water systems 3 5 an example of holistic thinking method development the methods used to measure dwpi by different disciplines often create a barrier because each field has different goals table 3 a public health specialist or epidemiologist requires in depth identification e g serotyping sequence typing to trace outbreaks while a physician focuses on information pertinent to diagnosis and treatment e g symptoms may be enough for some diseases organisms while complete typing is needed for others thus positive diagnostic tests e g urinary antigen tests may not be paired with more in depth analysis e g sputum culturing water testing on a routine basis environmental monitoring may also use culture based techniques but clinical culture media are often not suitable to recover nutrient starved dwpi cells typically found in drinking water a microbial ecologist may only be interested in the presence of a microorganism and thus dna based molecular methods may be adequate i e composite capture of viable vbnc and dead cells the meaning of the unit gene copy per volume is not immediately relatable to quantities reported from traditional culture methods i e colony forming units cfu per unit volume and relative abundance e g percent abundance from amplicon sequencing data does not directly translate into the absolute concentrations needed for risk assessment a monitoring program requires relatively quick and easy methods for live or revivable vbnc pathogen detection and emerging methods for achieving this report often rely on non traditional units of measurement e g most probable number mpn per unit volume other engineers need immediate indicators for a change in physicochemical nutrient or total bacterial conditions and may be particularly interested in methods designed to denote hydraulic changes rather than direct correlations with human pathogens even if these do not relate directly to dwpi growth or survival they could indicate a failure in treatment or hydraulic issues and need for corrective action building owners may not be interested in finding definitive evidence of dwpi because of legal liability and may prefer more general water quality metrics that could be indicative of conditions conducive to dwpi growth e g temperature chlorine concentration all available methods have benefits and drawbacks and a single method cannot address all questions at the same time financial time and expertise limitations will not typically allow for application of all methods in all circumstances better understanding of the differences and relative benefits of information provided by these methods can allow for i communication between disciplines and ii better design of studies that will translate more effectively across disciplines similarly convenient environmental sampling methods could be designed with compatibility for downstream processing like sequence based typing mercante and winchell 2015 scaturro et al 2005 or whole genome sequencing haworth et al 2017 to allow for links with healthcare cases using select methods in concert can substantially increase the value of studies e g allowing interpretation of various units of measurement but requires pooling of resources the investment in test method development and availability varies considerably by dwpi culture based and culture independent methods have been developed for the detection and quantification of most dwpi but their convenience and standardization vary easy to use environmental detection tests like pseudalert and legiolert target single pathogen types for l pneumophila a simple urinary antigen test is available for clinical testing albeit only for the detection of serogroup 1 while convenient the urinary antigen test results in the underestimation of other disease causing serogroups or species e g l longbeachae mercante and winchell 2015 and does not produce isolates for disease tracking more rapid serologic tests based on enzyme immunoassays are under development for ntm but are not commonly employed aksamit et al 2014 haworth et al 2017 while culture based methods generally require specialized expertise the cdc administers a control program for l pneumophila the elite program environmental legionella isolation techniques evaluation development of easier faster methods is needed across to address all dwpi as is the development of quality control programs as it is believed that amoeba and protozoa may play important roles in dwpi persistence in drinking water systems a method to identify dwpis that have been resident in those protists e g dna modification would be valuable moreover faster standardized methods would allow for the testing of multiple organisms at once especially in environmental samples currently measuring all dwpi in a sample can be burdensome even for research projects a possible workflow for an ideal universal method which considers multiple dwpis multiple field specific interests as well as the real world constraints of time and cost is proposed in box 2 3 6 proposed approach microbial ecologists who primarily participate in research on the bench scale can embrace several strategies to make their research more useful from a holistic perspective rapid and well documented well quality controlled clearly reporting sampling strategies that are deliberately designed to answer research questions relevant to cross cutting objectives in health microbiology and engineering identify methods to distinguish virulent from avirulent dwpi species to allow monitoring of dwpis that are of greatest public health significance given the need for ct values for dwpi for informing engineering interventions and complexities of comparing values derived from piecemeal experimental studies a systematic review and meta analysis of kinetic parameters e g inactivation and growth under different temperature disinfectant residual water chemistry and temporal conditions for dwpis is needed for identifying research gaps and data needs include and measure multiple dwpis in research projects so that the potential effect of altered environmental conditions e g temperature disinfectant residual levels can be understood for all dwpi within comparable conditions comparison of conditions across existing published studies is difficult conduct mixed community experiments under conditions representative of real systems alongside studying full scale drinking water systems which are more difficult to control complementary pure culture mixed culture and full scale experiments will allows the field to build on basic understanding and move towards applicable engineering solutions work with other scientific fields to elucidate transmission dynamics of multiple dwpi between media it would be useful to understand the fluxes from biofilm to water water to aerosol aerosol to inhalation and inhalation to infection under multiple water physio chemical scenarios this would require accurate and comparable quantification of organisms in multiple media see methods below develop methods that can i easily be used for multiple dwpi detection and quantification and ii be used on multiple media bodily fluids water biofilm with a single understandable metric box 2 and iii move toward near real time dwpi detection harmonize environmental measurements with clinical approaches for understanding source to receptor exposures along the full exposure continuum track the development of dwpi ar within studies by routinely incorporating ar tracking methods e g qpcr box 1 this is done in some studies e g cocuzza et al 2021 sikora et al 2017 vaz moreira et al 2012 already but efforts can be expanded 4 engineering other building practitioners since dwpi were first identified water quality engineers have made efforts to reduce their proliferation and eliminate them from water systems with many interventions focused on legionella pneumophila alone initial interventions adapted methods used at the treatment plant i e adding traditional disinfectants and could only be applied by trained operators and building managers the field has since expanded to an examination of building and plumbing system design itself with maintenance free strategies introduced at the design stage by architects and engineers borrowing from the field of industrial hygiene hazard removal or employment of maintenance free engineering controls is preferable to relying upon building operation habits or having individuals responsible for reducing their own exposure cdc and niosh 2015 nonetheless implementation of many engineering strategies for pathogen control will involve multiple professions e g architects plumbers building code officials and building managers requiring effective communication 4 1 applying disinfectant since loss of disinfectant residual is associated with microbial growth berry et al 2006 proctor and hammes 2015b boosting the concentrations of disinfectants either in the distribution system or in the plumbing of large buildings is a promising dwpi engineering control while there are many reported successes of on site disinfectant systems there are trade offs between disinfectant types e g efficacy discussed above disinfection byproducts and corrosion of materials giovanardi et al 2020 and differential selection of one dwpi over another chloramine residuals persist longer and have greater effect on biofilms than chlorine in distribution systems but their relative efficacies can be reversed in building water system under conditions that accelerate chloramine decay zhang et al 2009 in comparing samples from buildings where either chlorine or chloramine were applied in the supply s distribution system l pneumophila was detected with similar frequency with both disinfectants while certain ntm were detected more often in chloraminated systems donohue et al 2019 in the distribution system the choice of disinfectant type is often driven by concerns other than dwpi including disinfectant byproduct formation applying disinfectant at the building level can provide additional control but an important nuance is how disinfectant is applied chloramine addition at the building level is able to control legionella spp p aeruginosa and ntm when applied correctly duda et al 2014 lytle et al 2021 however in cooling towers continuous chlorine treatment appeared to suppress legionella spp while promoting pseudomonas spp paranjape et al 2020 the choice of oxidant e g chloramine chlorine or chlorine dioxide can also influence the specific species or strains in a system marchesi et al 2016 therefore the choice of residual disinfectant and delivery mechanism may select for certain dwpi species or strains the choice of disinfectant type at this level is often driven by cost experience and maintenance concerns additionally adding on site disinfectant still may not protect all distal ends can be expensive and may result in a regulatory burden additional testing and permits sdwa 1996 deterring some building owners from preventative action ultimately an effective disinfectant based solution if achievable will rely heavily on building design features upstream water quality and importantly competent operators which may not be feasible in all buildings non traditional disinfection approaches like ultraviolet uv irradiation ozonation and copper silver ionization have been applied in buildings lin et al 2011 neither uv nor ozone provide a strong residual and mycobacterium spp and legionella spp have been shown to survive in full scale ozone contactors kotlarz et al 2018 copper silver ionization generally is effective for reducing culturable l pneumophila lin et al 2011 however its effectiveness is highly dependent on chemical water quality characteristics lin et al 2002 and resistance can develop over time june and dziewulski 2018 thus vigilant maintenance is required office of inspector general 2013 copper silver ionization has not been tested extensively for other dwpi and may be less effective against ntm huang et al 2008 june and dziewulski 2018 kusnetsov et al 2001 overall the effectiveness of non traditional disinfection approaches against all dwpi as well as the skill and capability of system operators must be taken into consideration for long term successful treatment different types of filters and devices uv uv led installed at the point of use are available commercially and can be installed at faucets and showerheads to prevent exposure to bacteria and dwpi nasem 2019 water quality e g turbidity will affect their efficacy and the duration of their use before breakthrough manufacturers test products using iso 22 196 2011 which involves incubation of pure cultures of bacteria on the antimicrobial surface found inside the showerhead iso 2011 and may not represent realistic conditions nonetheless successful implementation of such devices has been observed since dwpi can also grow in point of use filters chaidez and gerba 2004 rodgers et al 1999 frequent replacement is often recommended requiring vigilant building operators recent product improvements incorporate biocides and include inactivation technologies that extend the life of these devices other filters like granular activated carbon filters may create an ideal niche for l pneumophila and ntm dai et al 2018 rodgers et al 1999 wu et al 2017 to ensure public safety validation of these devices under varied realistic scenarios with multiple dwpi is needed 4 2 temperature control in applying findings about temperature discussed above to full scale systems there are several strategies to keep water out of ideal growth ranges in large hot water systems recirculation helps maintain elevated temperatures capable of inactivating dwpi throughout the system maintaining temperatures 60 c in the water heater and 55 c at distal points of the system is recommended for prevention of l pneumophila growth bédard et al 2015a darelid et al 2002 nasem 2019 however some studies indicate that recirculation at improper i e too low temperatures can increase l pneumophila densities presumably due to heat losses prolonging the time within the optimal growth conditions rhoads et al 2015 similarly increasing pipe insulation seems beneficial in that hot water can stay hotter but sometimes adding insulation can increase the time of ideal legionella spp growth temperatures during stagnation in hot water lines bédard et al 2015a van kenhove et al 2019a while cold water systems are not typically the focus for legionella spp research toilets can also transmit l pneumophila couturier et al 2020 and ideal growth temperature can be achieved in cold water systems with co location of hot cold pipes or where warm ambient temperatures are consistently present other dwpi including p aeruginosa bédard et al 2015b are more often studied in cold water systems studies are needed regarding efficacy of optimizing temperature designs against non legionella dwpis and the prevalence of all dwpis in cold water systems one time or periodic treatment can also be applied to remediate potential problems e g recommissioning of buildings after long stagnation or disuse proctor et al 2020 heat shock methods have found some success for l pneumophila control but recovery recolonization and development of resistance or acclimation are common allegra et al 2011 farhat et al 2010 ji et al 2018 temmerman et al 2006 likely attributable to dissipation of temperature in distal ends vbnc protective states or even the ability of l pneumophila to subsist necrotrophically on other cells killed by the intervention biofilm cleaning methods e g ice slurry are also available commercially but without independent verification hyperchlorination or shock chlorination i e temporarily increasing disinfectant concentrations has also been employed but mitigation has been short lived and damage to pipe materials is a concern lin et al 2011 proctor et al 2020 the recommended strength i e dose of chlorine temperature duration and frequency of these treatments must consider the varied dwpi growth rates physiology and resistance to treatment as well as specific characteristics of treated buildings 4 3 building design features many aspects of plumbing design are dictated in building code but most codes were not developed with microbial quality or dwpi growth in mind especially with changing trends in water conservation an update to these building codes is warranted for example despite lower water flows pipe diameter requirements remain unchanged since 1940 hunter design codes hunter 1940 resulting in over sized pipes long stagnation times and low linear flowrates which are hypothesized to influence biofilm and water quality julien et al 2020b on the other hand smaller pipes increase surface area to volume ratios increasing the influence of biofilm on bulk water microbial quality competing objectives will make it challenging to achieve consensus for updated codes decisions made during the design and construction of a building can have consequences for water flow patterns temperature and residence time of water in that building for its entire lifetime in particular buildings are not designed with microbially informed parameters in mind in germany the length of distal ends is restricted to 3 m to limit legionella spp growth nasem 2019 furthermore by placing the toilet at the end of a trunk and branch line water flow can be maximized through the pipes even the orientation of pipes up or down from the pipe to the fixture has implications on temperature and hence dwpi growth due to induction of convective mixing rhoads et al 2015 minimizing the water system footprint by reducing the length of distal pipes reducing the number of fixtures and installing water fixtures close together i e minimizing wet walls would help simplify investigations of dwpi colonization remove de facto dead ends lower construction costs and decrease energy needs for hot water but achieving these collective goals requires communication between many silos of expertise in most plumbing designs distal ends still present a challenge since water treatment will only affect the distal fixture by opening that particular fixture during treatment to address this some new plumbing designs and management protocols either automatically drain pipes or direct manual draining of pipes to dryness between uses as ntm p aeruginosa and fungi thrive in such semi moist environments e g such as showerheads gebert et al 2018 hageskal et al 2009 novak babič et al 2017 tap aerators and sink drains walker and moore 2015 these changes have the potential to alter microbial ecology within plumbing ntm are particularly resistant to desiccation archuleta et al 2002 electronic non touch faucets were designed in part to reduce microbial contamination problems from faucets functioning as fomites yet are associated with colonization and growth of many dwpi bédard et al 2016 kotsanas et al 2008 livni et al 2008 sydnor et al 2012 due to these unintended consequences new plumbing designs should be thoroughly tested for risk of colonization internally by multiple dwpi as well as for their ability to serve as fomites on external facing surfaces the propensity of pipe material to support dwpi survival persistence and growth are often studied iron or copper can have positive iron negative copper silver or mixed copper effects on dwpi growth buse et al 2014 haig et al 2020 lin et al 2002 1996 corrosion can also accelerate decay of disinfectant residual nguyen et al 2012 rhoads et al 2017a reducing stress on all dwpi many plastic pipes leach assimilable organic carbon bucheli witschel et al 2012 van der kooij 1992 a nutrient for growth of many dwpis as they are heterotrophs the type and amount of carbon leaching varies considerably amongst plastics and can affect microbial communities and dwpi proctor et al 2016 one limitation in pipe material research is the duration of studies as most are limited to a few days weeks or months of pipe use the hydrophobicity of pipe materials may have an influence on initial attachment simões et al 2007 and copper may have anti microbial effects learbuch et al 2019 rogers et al 1994 but the long term effects are questionable buse et al 2014 gião et al 2015 proctor et al 2017 rhoads et al 2017b case studies can offer insights into long term effects of plumbing design but interpretation must consider multiple confounding variables consensus on which pipe material to use when or where will require rigorous long term controlled and field validation studies commissioning the final stage of building construction can also impact water quality for the lifetime of the building careful hydraulic balancing i e calibrating pressures helps maintain proper temperatures in both hot and cold water systems if done properly nasem 2019 while some standards for the commissioning process exist they do not necessarily consider water quality often water is allowed to stagnate in pipes for weeks before buildings are occupied inkinen et al 2014 allowing time for biofilm formation ashrae suggests considering shock chlorination after four weeks of stagnation ashrae 2018 according to a survey of the many professional groups involved professional responsibility for the commissioning phase is unclear often resulting in missed steps and minimal review potts and wall 2002 while the building owner is responsible for water quality many people influence it before they take possession of the property 4 4 building maintenance day to day decisions regarding building water system can drastically affect dwpi growth some of these such as local stagnation at a fixture are difficult to control but others like water heater settings are being incorporated into building water management plans aimed at curbing dwpi long stagnation times are generally thought to permit dwpi growth e g due to reduced chlorine residual studies of green buildings with water saving devices that elevate water age often find dwpi rhoads et al 2016 and samples taken after longer stagnation have higher microbial densities haig et al 2020 2018 lautenschlager et al 2010 increased water age is also associated with a change in microbial community composition ji et al 2017 ling et al 2018 proctor et al 2018 and even the type of ntm found haig et al 2018 the community shift may indicate the importance of biofilm interactions with the water phase the speed of biofilm water interactions may account for the need for high frequency flushes to protect against l pneumophila in some buildings e g every 2 h totaro et al 2018 however flushing will not remove biofilms and evidence suggests that increasing the flushing frequency may even cause greater net biofilm growth due to the delivery of fresh nutrients rhoads et al 2015 it should be stressed that flushing after abnormally long stagnation times e g upon return to a second home may remove the immediate exposure threat from dwpi proctor et al 2020 even so it is difficult to reach consensus amongst experts regarding best flushing practices proctor et al 2020 and the direct relationship between stagnation and legionella spp growth is questioned rhoads and hammes 2021 depending on the system size and responsiveness changing water heater settings is a relatively simple way to control dwpi however scalding concerns and energy conservation efforts have resulted in low recommended temperatures e g 48 c 120 f such settings put hot water delivery pipes within the ideal temperature range of dwpi thermostatic mixing valves can be installed close to the point of use to allow higher temperatures and are recommended nasem 2019 but they also have potential issues and require maintenance proctor et al 2020 instantaneous tankless water heaters may also allow temperature control while alleviating energy concerns brazeau and edwards 2013 most research on water heater settings have focused on l pneumophila nasem 2019 research considering the use of temperature to control other dwpis is needed moreover cost benefit analysis to weigh health scalding and energy concerns are needed from multidisciplinary teams water management plans vary widely but are all aimed at understanding and improving water quality plans should identify potential hazards e g aerosol producing water features low use fixtures and characterize the water system e g water heater operation connections to other systems which may be beyond the scope of information routinely available to building operators or feasible to collect on a routine basis control measures might be suggested including physical controls temperature management disinfectant control and pathogen testing to date plans sporadically include best practices like cleaning showerheads and aerators flushing hot water tanks and minimizing aerosol exposure through increased ventilation in bathrooms masters et al 2018 while success of water management plans is challenging to measure simply having a water management plan may not be sufficient to improve water quality van der lugt et al 2019 moving forward creators of water management plans likely require more guidance training site specific information and access to specific expertise to develop and execute an effective document conflicting advice and interests e g liability with testing also influence the effectiveness of water management plans most water management plans are targeted at l pneumophila prevention including those required by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 2018 such a focus may be promoting practices that unintentionally create ideal conditions for other dwpi as was shown following the substitution of monochloramine for chlorine and the disappearance of legionella spp but an increase in mycobacterium spp numbers pryor et al 2004 moreover maintenance of other water systems e g cooling towers might be overlooked in these plans but likely have a strong effect on disease 4 5 an example of holistic thinking creating proactive incentives implementation of engineering solutions and legislation after the discovery of a problem in the field is typically reactive rather than proactive and may not consider multiple hazards or unintended consequences of action for example legislation was enacted nationwide for drinking water in response to the 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak gostin et al 2000 and for cooling towers in new york city response to a 2015 legionnaire s outbreak bassett and balter 2017 even in communication of risk there is a clear lack of multi hazard consideration communication materials are available to inform the public on steps they can take to make decisions e g individual risk factors and behaviors in order to manage dwpi emphasizing that this is a shared responsibility between utilities facilities managers and individuals masters et al 2018 however most of the guidance available is for preventing risks of legionella spp at the exclusion of other water quality issues singh et al 2020 the benefits of awareness and having a water management plan are not entirely conclusive clopper et al 2021 van der lugt et al 2019 perhaps due to a variety in plan content and follow through however a recent study suggested that 81 of l pneumophila fatalities occurred in facilities without a water management plan clopper et al 2021 in a survey of minnesota hospitals the majority of building managers expressed interest in getting assistance to set up a water management plan danila et al 2018 more research to target the effective elements of water management plans will assist in creating effective plans a potential solution to raise awareness and move towards more effective proactive solutions like building water management plans could be to incorporate building water maintenance into health and building insurance programs this approach would take into consideration potential future savings on health care costs due to lowered infection rates and building owners legal fees due to lowered liability in case of infection these plans can incentivize preventative actions and even offset the energy institutional or testing costs associated with those preventative actions 4 6 proposed approach dwpi can be considered over the entire lifetime of the building from design through everyday maintenance the implementation of engineering solutions requires many non engineering strategies encourage microbially informed design of buildings through mechanisms such as leed or national organizations incorporate education about all dwpi into implementation of engineering solutions such that architects construction professionals building owners managers and maintenance personnel have greater understanding of the significance of the work this can include educating building tenants about personal risk factors for dwpi improving communication education across disciplines e g regarding plumbing operation codes fixture designs among non engineering communities and consideration of public health concerns by engineering community at the design phase encourage building owners and renters insurance to include partial coverage of building water quality to incentivize preventative actions include previously developed water management plans in the sale of buildings and require water testing as an inspection element so that new tenants are aware of potential issues and address them if testing isn t required disclosure of previous water issues and testing if conducted should be required create a database of building testing data for all dwpi to collect existing data and encourage greater investigations into large data trends this can include a more standardized reporting procedure for building size sample type and engineering solutions currently in place incorporate ar tracing into studies of real buildings including epidemiological investigations of outbreaks to better understand how widespread ar is within engineered drinking water systems box 1 investigations of engineering controls for ar can also be scaled up and tested in the field 5 conclusions clearly key similarities exist among dwpis exposure routes are similar and various niches in plumbing systems provide ideal growth conditions often with similar temperature ranges for growth slow growth and preference for the biofilm phase however differences in dwpi physiology and response to the culmination of various conditions in building water system e g resistance factors competition can result in different susceptibilities to each dwpi among individuals and populations while mitigation efforts are also not universally effective against each dwpi the most well studied dwpi across many fields is undoubtedly l pneumophila while awareness and treatment of this microorganism is a positive step towards improving plumbing design and operation and better protecting public health and safer plumbing ignoring other dwpis could result in unintended consequences and increase the burden on the healthcare system strategies to reduce l pneumophila tend to reduce overall biofilm concentration and increase disinfectant residual and thus may create conditions ideal for ntm pryor et al 2004 proliferation the attention placed on l pneumophila has supported development of rapid and easy diagnostic and environmental measuring techniques which in turn has led to substantial advancement of understanding of l pneumophila in both clinical and environmental realms our understanding of other microorganisms would benefit from similar development of rapid tests which can be motivated with financial and legislative incentives ultimately strategies to holistically protect the public from pathogens capable of growth in drinking water will involve the consideration of all dwpis together and across all disciplines for example more dwpi associated diseases should be reportable and microorganisms should be studied concurrently in buildings to better inform risk models while a single solution that creates a zero risk plumbing system is not possible increased cooperation and multiple dwpi consideration will allow for informed balancing of risk and consequences box 1 various groups are responsible for water safety regarding drinking water

16292,proper treatment of wastewater is one of the key issues to the sustainable development of human society and people have been searching for high efficiency and low cost methods for wastewater treatment this article reviews recent studies about pyrite mediated advanced oxidation processes aops in removing refractory organics from wastewater the basic information of pyrite and its characteristics for aops are first introduced then the performance and mechanisms of pyrite mediated fenton oxidation electro fenton oxidation and persulfate oxidation processes are carefully reviewed and presented natural pyrite is an abundant low cost heterogeneous catalyst for aops and the slow release of fe2 and the self regulation of solution ph are highlighted characteristics of pyrite mediated aops in aops the interaction between fe3 and pyrite facilitates the fe2 regeneration and the fe2 fe3 cycle making pyrite into nanoparticles assisting by ultrasound and light irradiation and adding exogenous fe3 organic chelating agents or biochar is effective to enhance the performance of pyrite mediated aops based on the analyses of those pyrite mediated aops and their enhancing strategies the future development directions are proposed in the aspects of toxicity research mechanism research and technological coupling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pyrite advanced oxidation process organic wastewater water treatment 1 introduction wastewater treatment is essential to pollutant discharge reduction and water use efficiency improvement the rapid development of petroleum chemical engineering textiles dyeing food pharmacy metallurgy and other industries in modern society has caused large production of organic wastewater which often contains refractory and highly toxic organics such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons halogenated hydrocarbons phthalic acid esters pharmaceuticals and insecticides cai et al 2021 if untreated the organic wastewater may cause severe damage to ecological environment and human health gwenzi and chaukura 2018 however conventional biological methods adopted by municipal sewage treatment plants are insufficient to completely eliminate refractory organics from industrial wastewater especially those with limited bioavailability grandclément et al 2017 considering the increasingly serious environmental pollution and water resource shortage today exploring innovative technologies for organic wastewater treatment and recycling is urgently needed advanced oxidation processes aops are typical effective methods to manage high concentration refractory organics in wastewater aops utilize electricity light irradiation ultrasound or catalysts to activate oxidants for producing active free radicals with extremely oxidizing capacity and then realize the degradation even direct mineralization of organic compounds via the attack of the free radicals ma et al 2021 for instance the hydroxyl radical oh generated in aops possesses a high oxidation potential of 2 80 v and the oxidizing capacity of oh far exceeds those of common chemical oxidants e g permanganate h2o2 and o3 sufficient to degrade most organic pollutants non selectively boczkaj and fernandes 2017 common aops include chemical catalytic oxidation electrochemical catalytic oxidation ozonation and photocatalytic oxidation transforming toxic organics into co2 and h2o by aops is environmentally friendly but the high costs of conventional aops involving power chemicals and sludge management limit their large scale practical applications mousset et al 2021 additionally it is difficult to control the optimal proportion of catalyst oxidant and maintain the solution ph during conventional aops zhang et al 2019a thus the researchers have been working on seeking high efficiency and low cost catalytic materials for aops pyrite is a plentiful sulfide mineral found in nature and it is the main raw material for producing sulfur and sulfuric acid oliveira et al 2012 in the past decades the geochemical characteristics mineral dressing and acid mine drainage of pyrite have been widely studied besides pyrite shows great potential in solving some environmental problems such as stabilization of hexavalent chromium li et al 2020c chemical adsorption of arsenic bulut et al 2014 abiotic dechlorination of chlorinated organics demiya et al 2018 hydrolytic removal of microcystins fang et al 2020 and denitrification removal of nitrate si et al 2021 in the aspect of aops pyrite is an attractive catalyst the oxidation of pyrite in aqueous solution generates many intermediate products such as fe2 s0 h2s and polysulfides which are active in advanced oxidation reactions feng et al 2019 in recent years many successful experimental studies about pyrite catalyst for aops have been reported especially for fenton oxidation and persulfate oxidation and the research enthusiasm continues however to our knowledge currently there is a lack of timely review on this topic to provide the basic understanding and guide the further research in this article recent studies about pyrite mediated aops are carefully reviewed the basic information of pyrite and its characteristics for aops are first introduced primary focus is placed on the performance and mechanisms of pyrite mediated fenton oxidation electro fenton oxidation and persulfate oxidation processes some enhancing strategies and future research needs for pyrite mediated aops are presented this review article is hoped to give basic information and reference on pyrite mediated aops and advance their further research and practical applications 2 pyrite and its characteristics for aops pyrite is a sulfide mineral which is widespread in hydrothermal veins polymetallic ore deposits metamorphic rocks and igneous rocks migaszewski and gałuszka 2019 the main composition of pyrite is disulphide of iron fes2 and it presents with a face centered cubic lattice in the crystal structure in natural pyrite partial substitution of iron by other metal elements e g nickel cobalt and copper may occur abraitis et al 2004 due to the characteristics of light brassy color and metallic luster pyrite is often mistaken for gold and thus also known as fool s gold gregory and kohn 2020 oxidation and dissolution characteristics of pyrite in aqueous solutions are research hotspot in the field of geochemistry and environment the dissolved fe2 from pyrite can serve as catalyst in aops to achieve effective degradation of refractory organic pollutants oxygen and fe3 are two important oxidizers for pyrite oxidation in aqueous solutions and the oxidation processes can be expressed as eqs 1 and 2 wang et al 2019 significantly fe3 was reported to be more aggressive and powerful than o2 for pyrite oxidation and oxidation rates by fe3 were nearly one and two orders of magnitude higher than that by o2 at high and low ph respectively chandra and gerson 2010 therefore taking full advantage of the oxidation characteristics of pyrite to offer fe2 for aops has become a hot topic 1 2 fe s 2 7 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e 2 4 so 4 2 4 h 2 fe s 2 14 f e 3 8 h 2 o 15 f e 2 2 so 4 2 16 h for catalytic applications in aops natural pyrite has excellent machinability many researchers used natural pyrite materials obtained from local mines mining companies and chemical reagent companies in their study of aops before being used as a catalyst for aops pyrite usually undergoes a pretreatment of grinding sieving removing impurities washing and drying he et al 2021 the typical processing steps are illustrated in fig 1 a in a typical pretreatment process pyrite ore is ground into fine powders by a ceramic or agate mortar and then sieved to smaller particles at a micron level subsequently the oxide impurities on pyrite surface are removed by acid pickling after being washed by deoxygenated deionized water the pyrite catalyst is dried in an oxygen free oven through simple processing and preparation high performance pyrite catalyst can be obtained from the natural mineral which provides a feasible recycling pathway of pyrite from mining tailings the customizability is another attractive characteristic of pyrite for aops apart from natural pyrite synthetic pyrite is used in some aop studies synthetic pyrite typically serves as the substitution of natural pyrite for particular research requirement such as specific size or purity high quality pyrite product can be obtained via simple hydrothermal reactions fig 1b generally ferrous sulfate feso4 sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 and sulfur s are used as the reactants for example in the fes2 synthesis process reported by wang et al 2020b sulfur powder was added after feso4 7h2o and na2s2o3 were dissolved in water and then the resulting suspension was fully stirred and transferred to an autoclave for conducting the hydrothermal reaction the overall reaction can be described as the eq 3 wu et al 2004 the artificially synthesized fes2 is similar to natural pyrite and it is convenient to adjust and control the properties besides the hydrothermal synthesis method many other methods such as hot injection method template directed synthesis and direct thermal sulfidation can also be used to synthesize fes2 trinh et al 2017 qin et al 2018 though these methods are all available the hydrothermal synthesis is recommended to prepare amounts of fes2 for large scale applications in aops due to its relatively simpler apparatus and technique compared with natural pyrite synthetic pyrite with high purity is more suitable for the research of related mechanisms 3 fes o 4 n a 2 s 2 o 3 s h 2 o fe s 2 n a 2 s o 4 h 2 s o 4 3 application of pyrite mediated aops for treating refractory organic pollutants pyrite has been shown to successfully function in various aops mainly including fenton oxidation electro fenton oxidation and persulfate oxidation processes in this section the performance of pyrite mediated aops in organic wastewater treatment is presented and the basic mechanisms are discussed and illustrated 3 1 pyrite mediated fenton oxidation processes fenton oxidation is a classical chemical reaction named with its discoverer henry john horstman fenton koppenol 1993 this reaction generates hydroxyl radical oh with strong oxidizing capacity from hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ferrous ion fe2 and the basic process is represented by the eq 4 zhu et al 2019 the redox potential of the strong oxidizer oh reaches up to 2 80 v which is next only to fluorine mousset et al 2017 therefore fenton oxidation is powerful in mineralizing various organic pollutants especially some refractory aromatic compounds and heterocyclic compounds significantly fenton reaction is generally effective in acidic condition as the precipitation of dissolved iron species will occur in the solution with a high ph value jung et al 2009 in the application of fenton reaction for degrading organic pollutants ferrous salts e g ferrous sulfate are often used as the iron source using pyrite to substitute ferrous salts can also trigger the fenton reaction and achieve effective removal of organic pollutants in wastewater table 1 for example zhang et al 2014b prepared natural pyrite catalyst by simple grinding method and used it to catalyze the fenton reaction for nitrobenzene degradation in the aqueous solution according to their results about 80 of the nitrobenzene was degraded within 300 min in the optimal conditions of 2 0 g l of the catalyst 250 mm of h2o2 20 mg l of initial nitrobenzene and a ph value of 3 0 while the classical fenton system with ferrous sulfate could only remove 30 of the pollutant the poor performance of classical fenton system might be attributed to the early termination of the nitrobenzene degradation due to the fe sludge formation which was overcome in pyrite fenton system on the one hand the release of fe2 from pyrite is slow and the resulting fe3 can be reduced back to fe2 for fenton reaction via its interaction with pyrite which achieves the recycle of ferric ions on the other hand the ph regulating ability of pyrite maintains an unfavorable acidic condition for fe sludge formation although pyrite showed high performance in fenton degradation of many organics the removal of total organic carbon toc which indicates the absolute mineralization of organics varied with the targeted pollutants kantar et al 2019b applied pyrite fenton system for removing chlorophenols and their results showed that a significant portion of toc still remained in the solution though all the chlorophenols were degraded within 40 min the remained toc mainly resulted from the formation of chlorinated organic intermediates and low molecular weight acids during the fenton degradation process mashayekh salehi et al 2021 used tetracycline as the targeted pollutant of their pyrite h2o2 oxidation process and the results suggested that the pollutant was completely degraded and over 85 could be mineralized within 60 min these examples show promising potential of pyrite as a heterogeneous catalyst in fenton oxidation for organic pollutant degradation similar to other heterogeneous catalysts pyrite catalyst needs be used with suitable chemical reactors for practical applications of pyrite mediated fenton oxidation processes 4 h 2 o 2 f e 2 oh f e 3 o h the proposed mechanisms of pyrite mediated fenton oxidation processes are depicted in fig 2 the whole process involves three main phases release of iron species from pyrite generation of oh by fenton reaction degradation of organic pollutants by oh attack the oxidative dissolution of pyrite by o2 releases ferrous ions eq 1 which subsequently participate in the fenton reaction besides ferrous ions ferric ions may be generated via the oxidation of pyrite by h2o2 in the fenton system eq 5 zhang et al 2018b the concomitant hydrogen ions during the release processes of iron species from pyrite effectively regulate the ph value of the fenton system ltaïef et al 2018 in the fenton process oh is generated from h2o2 while fe2 is oxidized to fe3 eq 4 the fe3 can be reduced back to fe2 fe2 fe3 cycle via the process shown by eq 6 a rate limiting step of fenton process nichela et al 2015 in the presence of pyrite the regeneration of fe2 can also be achieved through the process represented by eq 2 as described by the equation the interaction between pyrite and fe3 not only realizes the regeneration of fe2 from fe3 in the solution but also promotes the release of fe2 from pyrite therefore pyrite facilitates the fe2 fe3 cycle in the fenton process and thus promotes the production of oh for the following oxidation degradation of organics however the relevance of pyrite dissolution to free radical production needs further research and the sustainability of aforementioned mechanisms during the whole fenton process waits to be verified 5 2 fe s 2 15 h 2 o 2 2 f e 3 4 so 4 2 2 h 14 h 2 o 6 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h h o 2 3 2 pyrite mediated electro fenton oxidation processes based on the reaction mechanisms of classical fenton oxidation electro fenton oxidation utilizes electrochemically generated h2o2 instead of adscititious h2o2 reagent to produce oh he and zhou 2017 the generation of h2o2 occurs on the cathode via two electron reduction of o2 under acidic condition eq 7 casado 2019 the supply of o2 is generally made by aeration or o2 injection li et al 2020a additionally the regeneration of fe2 can also be achieved through the cathodic reduction of fe3 in the solution eq 8 casado 2019 compared with classical fenton oxidation the main advantages of electro fenton oxidation includes that 1 the electrochemical generation of h2o2 avoid the safety risk of h2o2 reagent during its transportation storage and use 2 the controllable degradation rate of pollutants favors the study of degradation process and mechanism and 3 the continuous regeneration of fe2 reduces the fe sludge formation using pyrite as the heterogeneous electro fenton catalyst shows excellent performance for removing organic pollutants in wastewater table 2 in the electro fenton systems pyrite mainly acts as the iron source in the electro fenton oxidation processes which avoids the use of soluble iron salts or the loss of metal electrode in traditional electro fenton oxidation ammar et al 2015 used natural pyrite to catalyze the electro fenton oxidation for removing tyrosol from wastewater and they found that 89 toc was reduced in 360 min under the conditions of 1 0 mg l of pyrite catalyst 300 ma of electric current and 0 3 mmol l of initial tyrosol additionally pyrite can function as ph regulator and fe3 reductor to maintain long time favorable reaction conditions a highlighted phenomenon during the electro fenton oxidation conducted by ammar et al 2015 was that pyrite could spontaneously regulate the solution ph to a suitable value of 2 8 3 7 similar results were also found in using pyrite mediated electro fenton oxidation to remove other organic pollutants such as levofloxacin sulfamethazine and diclofenac barhoumi et al 2015 barhoumi et al 2016 yu et al 2020 compared with direct use of pyrite as fenton catalyst the cases of using pyrite for electro fenton oxidation are less this gives greater research space for exploring electrochemical applications of pyrite 7 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 8 f e 3 e f e 2 the proposed mechanisms of pyrite mediated electro fenton oxidation processes are depicted in fig 3 the reduction of dissolved o2 at the cathode produces h2o2 eq 7 while the oxidative dissolution of pyrite releases iron species eq 1 and eq 5 the released fe2 can directly participate in the fenton reaction with h2o2 generated at the cathode the fe3 both released from pyrite via h2o2 oxidation and generated from fenton reaction can be reduced to fe2 via multiple pathways including pyrite reduction eq 2 and cathodic reduction eq 8 these processes facilitate the fe2 fe3 cycle and promote the oh generation in electro fenton system various production processes of hydrogen ions eq 1 eq 2 and eq 5 support the spontaneous ph regulation capacity of the pyrite electro fenton system additionally the water oxidation at a high oxygen overvoltage anode produces supplementary oh and h eq 9 nidheesh and gandhimathi 2012 continuous oh generation and its facilitating processes provide potent oxidizing capacity for the degradation of organic pollutants few studies focused on the electrochemical characteristics of pyrite and non radical degradation pathways of organics in pyrite mediated electro fenton system future studies on these aspects may help to go deep into the mechanisms 9 h 2 o oh h e 3 3 pyrite mediated persulfate oxidation processes conventional aops are based on the strong oxidizing capacity of oh while persulfate oxidation technology utilizes sulfate radical so4 a free radical with the strong oxidizing capacity close to oh as the main active species to degrade organic pollutants oh et al 2016 persulfate includes peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 and peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 and both of them contain peroxy bond o o in their molecular structure the cleaving of the peroxy bond in persulfate via energy and electron transfer reactions generates so4 with a high oxidation potential of 2 60 v tsitonaki et al 2010 compared with oh so4 offers many more advantages in aops including that 1 so4 possesses a longer half life time than that of oh 30 40 µs vs 1 µs which ensures it to attack the targeted pollutants more effectively 2 so4 can react with organic pollutants in a broad ph range of 2 0 8 0 and 3 persulfate is safer than h2o2 during its transportation storage and use zhao et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 various methods can be applied to activate persulfate for produce so4 such as thermal activation alkaline activation radiation activation transition metal activation and carbonaceous material activation wang and wang 2018 using pyrite to provide ferrous ions can effectively activate persulfate and produce strong oxidizer so4 for removing organic pollutants in wastewater table 3 and the activating processes can be expressed as eqs 10 and 11 zhang et al 2014a ali et al 2021 for example li et al 2021 used pyrite pms system for degrading propanil and they found that 91 9 of the propanil could be degraded within 15 min under the optimal conditions and so4 and oh are the dominant reactive species chen et al 2018 used ethylthionocarbamate as the targeted pollutant of their pyrite pds oxidation process and the results suggested that 96 64 of the pollutant was degraded within 180 min and so4 functioned as the predominant reactive species rahimi et al 2021 prepared pyrite nanoparticles with a ball mill by using mine waste as the raw material and applied them as the catalysts to activate pms and pds for tetracycline degradation according to their results the removal rate of tetracycline in pds and pms system was respectively 32 5 and 98 7 within 30 min under the conditions of 1 0 mg l of pyrite 1 0 g l of pds pms 50 mg l of initial tetracycline and an initial ph value of 4 1 compared with pds pms could be more effectively activated by pyrite which might be attributed to the asymmetric structure of pms molecular song et al 2020 10 f e 2 hso 5 f e 3 so 4 o h 11 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 so 4 so 4 2 the proposed mechanisms of pyrite mediated persulfate oxidation processes are depicted in fig 4 besides the oxidative dissolution of pyrite by o2 eq 1 pyrite releases iron ions via the oxidation effect of persulfate and the oxidation process by pms and pds can be expressed by eqs 12 and 13 liang et al 2010 feng et al 2018 the released fe2 activates the pms and pds to generate so4 by the pathways represented by eqs 10 and 11 in addition to the above pathways so4 may be generated via direct pyrite oxidation by pms and pds eqs 14 and 15 rahimi et al 2021 by the attack of so4 the targeted organics can be effectively degraded during the oxidation process the regeneration of fe2 from fe3 and the release of fe2 from pyrite can be promoted via the reaction between fe3 and pyrite eq 2 thus facilitating the fe2 fe3 cycle and the so4 production in the pyrite persulfate systems oh may generate via so4 and the processes are represented by eqs 16 and 17 ismail et al 2017 both so4 and the concomitant oh can function to degrade organic pollutants in the aqueous solution excessive fe2 will consume the functional so4 and oh eqs 18 and 19 shang et al 2019 the slow release of fe2 from pyrite avoids the unwanted consumption of these free radicals which ensures the high efficiency oxidation capacity of the pyrite mediated persulfate oxidation processes liang et al 2010 additionally sulfur species play an important role in the activated oxidation by pyrite different valence states of sulfur including monosulfide s2 disulfide s2 2 polysulfide sn 2 elemental sulfur s0 and sulfate so4 2 were present in pyrite oxidation systems and the reductive low valence sulfur importantly function in the fe2 fe3 cycle he et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 highlighted the role of sulfide as electron donors for pms activation and reported that although the fe2 on pyrite efficiently activated pms the fe2 regeneration and subsequent pms activation were crucially controlled by s2 2 more mechanism studies from the point of sulfur species are expected to improve the understanding of pyrite mediated persulfate oxidation as both pyrite and persulfate can release sulfur species into the solution during the oxidation process 12 fe s 2 7 hso 5 h 2 o f e 2

photocatalytic oxidation and ozone oxidation for degrading organic pollutants considering the safety risk and instability of liquid h2o2 reagent zhou et al 2020 used solid cao2 as the h2o2 source and applied the pyrite cao2 system to degrade diethyl phthalate based on the fenton oxidation mechanism their experimental results suggested that 10 mg l of diethyl phthalate could be completely degraded by the pyrite cao2 system within 5 0 min at a ph value of 3 5 diao et al 2015 applied natural pyrite as photocatalyst for degrading malachite green with ultraviolet irradiation in the photocatalytic experiment 1 0 g l of pyrite could degrade 96 7 of the malachite green within 120 min via a photo fenton like process wu et al 2016b used pyrite as an ozonation catalyst for degrading reactive black 5 and the mineralization efficiency increased by 17 39 compared with using ozone alone the oh generated by the reaction between ozone and pyrite surface was considered the main mechanism involving pyrite into other aop systems is now under active exploration and interesting and meaningful results will further expand the application scope and development prospect of pyrite in aop systems 4 enhancing strategies of pyrite mediated aops although many pyrite mediated aop systems have been successfully developed for organic wastewater treatment some strategies are proposed fig 5 as researchers always make perfection more perfect when developing new catalysts they are proposed to further enhance the performance or overcome the limitations such as insufficient surface reactivity of pyrite slow pyrite dissolution limited efficiency of heterogeneous reactions on the solid liquid interface and low catalytic activity of pyrite under high ph conditions these enhancing strategies are also suitable for some other activation systems and they were referred or adopted by the researchers for enhancing the performance of pyrite mediated aops in this section the introduced enhancing strategies were used and supported with at least one research paper 4 1 making pyrite into nanoparticles in order to overcome the insufficient surface reactivity of pyrite in some aop systems making pyrite into nanoparticles is proposed this strategy has the advantage of improving the catalytic activity of pyrite in aops nanoparticles are small particles with dimensions in a nanoscale range 1 100 nm compared with conventional materials nanoparticles typically have higher specific surface area and surface energy which offers greater chemical reactivity santos et al 2015 in laboratory experiments natural pyrite is generally ground into nanoparticles by a ball mill mashayekh salehi et al 2021 rahimi et al 2021 while synthetic pyrite nanoparticles can be obtained through the control of synthesis conditions qin et al 2018 gil lozano et al 2014 compared the efficacy of pyrite microparticles 1 4 µm and pyrite nanoparticles 20 nm in catalyzing fenton degradation of copper phthalocyanine and the two particles could remove 7 and 60 of the pollutant at the same low dosage of 0 08 mg l respectively however this strategy is too difficult to be practical at the present time innovations in the production equipment of pyrite nanoparticles and chemical reactor of nanomaterials are needed to achieve the practical application 4 2 assisting by ultrasound considering the limited efficiency of heterogeneous reactions on the solid liquid interface the combination of pyrite mediated aops and ultrasound has received interest from researchers to enhance the catalytic performance the advantages of ultrasound assistance in pyrite mediated aops mainly include refreshing the pyrite surface producing additional active free radicals and facilitating the mass transfer in the aqueous solution continuous ultrasonic wave can help to clean and refresh the pyrite surface by peeling off the oxide layer and pitting the pyrite surface gao et al 2018 additional active free radicals e g oh h ho2 and o2 may be produced during the ultrasonic treatment by triggering acoustic cavitation which involves the formation rapid growth and violent collapse of cavitation bubbles zhang et al 2018a additionally the strong mechanical effect generated by ultrasound can enhance the mass transfer at solid liquid interface guo et al 2017 diao et al 2020 coupled ultrasound with pyrite pms system for the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol and their results showed that the degradation efficiency increased from 71 3 to 97 9 with the assistance of ultrasonic treatment this result demonstrates the effectiveness of ultrasound for assisting the activation process of pyrite mediated aops 4 3 enhancing by light irradiation similar to the ultrasonic assistance light irradiation can help to enhance the performance of pyrite mediated aops by taking the advantage of the semiconductor characteristics of pyrite the suitable band gap direct 1 03 ev indirect 0 95 ev and high optical absorption coefficient 105 cm 1 for hν 1 3 ev enable pyrite to absorb light and generate electron e and hole h under light irradiation morales gallardo et al 2016 the photo induced carriers can react with the components such as pyrite fe3 h2o and o2 in aop systems thus facilitating the production of reactive oxidative species vorontsov 2019 using light irradiation for assistance can effectively improve the catalytic activity of pyrite in aops for example zeng et al 2019 used visible light to enhance the pyrite mediated fenton oxidation process for p nitrophenol degradation and the complete degradation time was shortened from 10 min to 4 min with the assistance of visible light irradiation however using light irradiation for assistance is technically difficult to achieve in practical applications as the effective optical path in current reactor for pyrite mediated advanced oxidation would be very small 4 4 adding exogenous ferric ions although pyrite mediated aops show excellent application prospects it suffers from low reaction rate and excessive h2o2 is usually needed to shorten reaction time the production of fe2 is the rate determining step in pyrite mediated aops considering that the generation of fe2 from oxidizing pyrite by fe3 is much faster than that from oxidizing pyrite by o2 exogenous fe3 can help to overcome the slow pyrite dissolution and accelerate the fe2 generation thereby enhancing the degradation performance of pyrite mediated aops wu et al 2015 investigated the effect of fe3 on pyrite oxidation in the fenton system and they found that the final solution ph decreased from 3 02 to 2 91 with the increasing concentration of added fe3 and the oxidative degradation efficiency of chloramphenicol by the system was significantly reduced from 100 to less than 30 by adding 0 5 mm of phosphate buffer as fe3 chelating agent 4 5 chelating iron ions by organic ligands under high ph condition the iron precipitation significantly inhibits the catalytic activity of pyrite in aop systems which limits the ph range of applications adding organic chelating agents is proposed to enhance the catalytic performance as organic chelating agents can inhibit the precipitation of iron ions especially at a relatively high ph condition by acting as a ligand to form chelate compounds with iron ions bai et al 2021 this is conducive to extending the application ph range of pyrite mediated aops additionally the chelating effects of organic ligands could help to induce the generation of fe2 from pyrite surface and facilitate the fe2 fe3 cycle wu et al 2016a used as a biodegradable chelating agent tetrasodium glutamate diacetate glda successfully enhanced the performance of pyrite mediated fenton oxidation for chloramphenicol degradation at a ph value of 8 0 and they found that glda increased the oh production and glda chelated fe3 accelerated the fe2 fe3 cycle similarly kantar et al 2019a used citrate to enhance the performance of treating pharmaceutical wastewater by a continuous flow pyrite h2o2 systems their results showed that the toc removal in the presence of citrate was much higher than that without citrate and the increased iron dissolution and reduced column clogging by citrate were considered the main causes 4 6 accelerating oxidation by biochar although pyrite can promote the fe2 fe3 cycle in aops the insufficient fe2 regeneration and low heterogeneous reaction rate may impeded the sustainability of high efficiency of pyrite mediated aops during the whole oxidation process recent research enthusiasm on biochar offers a new strategy to address this issue biochar is a porous pyrolysis products of biomass materials and it has been extensively applied in environmental remediation by reason of its high adsorption capacity for many pollutants positive role as electron transfer mediator and various persistent free radicals luo et al 2021 these characteristics are also favorable for organic pollutant degradation by pyrite mediated aops biochar can concentrate organic pollutants at solid liquid interface by adsorption which facilitates their catalytic degradation the electron transfer capacity and persistent free radicals benefit the free radical generation and the fe2 fe3 cycle zhu et al 2020 added biochar to the pyrite h2o2 system for accelerating the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the degradation rate constant was 1 98 2 39 times higher with the addition of 0 1 g l of biochar 5 summary of pyrite advantages for aops pyrite is an attractive catalyst for advanced oxidation reactions in recent studies as it has many advantages compared with other catalyst materials fig 6 and table 4 pyrite is a plentiful natural mineral on earth which offers a rich source for the catalyst materials for example the newly discovered reserves of pyrite in china reached 68 62 million tons in 2019 ministry of natural resources 2020 using pyrite as the catalyst is cost effective compared with metal catalysts especially noble metal pyrite is much cheaper and it can often be obtained from the recycling of mine tailings schellenbach and krekeler 2012 lü et al 2018 current market price of pyrite is reported as cheap as 100 300 ton li et al 2016 hu et al 2020 which shows competitive price advantage solid pyrite plays a positive role in heterogeneous catalysis the solid state of pyrite facilitates the catalyst separation from the reaction system the catalyst reuse in practical application and the control of possible pollution caused by metal ions yu et al 2020 the oxidative dissolution of pyrite in aqueous solution slowly releases ferrous ions constantin and chiriţă 2013 investigated the oxidative dissolution of pyrite in acidic media ph 2 5 and 25 c and found that the dissolution rates of pyrite by o2 saturated h2o2 0 1 m and fe3 0 01 m were 2 53 10 4 1 52 10 2 and 9 35 10 2 µmol m2 s respectively thus using pyrite as a sustainable iron source to drive advanced oxidation reactions can obviate using soluble iron salts and forming iron sludge peng et al 2017 reported that the iron sludge production of their electro fenton treatment could reach 1 19 to 3 23 kg m3 after 60 min the undesired iron sludge production can be inhibited or eliminated due to the fe2 fe3 cycle and the self regulated acidic condition in pyrite mediated electro fenton system yu et al 2020 apart from ferrous ions the oxidative dissolution of pyrite simultaneously produces hydrogen ions conducive to maintaining a favorable acidic condition for advanced oxidation reactions wu et al 2015 ltaïef et al 2018 both the structural ferrous ion and the reductive sulfide species in pyrite can participate in redox reactions via acting as electron donors these reductive species can support multiple functions at the same time such as activating persulfate and reducing pollutant he et al 2021 these characteristics of pyrite make it competitive as a multifunction catalyst because amounts of pollutants are hard to be oxidized by conventional wastewater treatments additionally the easy processing technologies and the environmentally friendly feature are also attractive points of pyrite catalyst fathinia et al 2015 these advantages encourage the use of pyrite as a low cost heterogeneous catalyst in aops however natural pyrite often serves as a sink for some toxic trace metals such as lead zinc cadmium arsenic and copper tabelin et al 2018 these accompanying elements may be released during pyrite oxidation although their concentrations are very small the risk of these toxic elements during wastewater treatment should be noted reasonable classification and management of pyrite raw materials based on the source and advance leaching test is recommended to ensure that the benefits of pyrite in aops outweigh the risks 6 conclusions and outlook in summary pyrite can be an excellent catalyst for aops including fenton oxidation electro fenton oxidation and persulfate oxidation processes and pyrite mediated aop systems show great application prospect in treating organic wastewater natural pyrite is an abundant low cost heterogeneous catalyst for aops and the slow release of fe2 and the self regulation of solution ph are highlighted characteristics of pyrite mediated aops synthetic pyrite typically serves as the substitution of natural pyrite for particular research requirement in aops pyrite slowly releases fe2 to trigger the advanced oxidation reactions the interaction between fe3 and pyrite facilitates the fe2 regeneration and the fe2 fe3 cycle in aops making pyrite into nanoparticles assisting by ultrasound and light irradiation and adding exogenous fe3 organic chelating agents or biochar is effective to further enhance the performance of pyrite mediated aops in the future the research priority on this topic should be given to the following issues the first is the potential risks of pyrite in aop systems besides the main component fes2 natural pyrite may contain some accompanying elements such as nickel cobalt copper arsenic selenium gold and silver whether these toxic trace elements cause toxic effects through the treating processes of pyrite mediated aops or not is worth exploring before the practical application confirming this point is necessary to avoid unintended consequences of pyrite mediated aops therefore toxicity research on pyrite and its oxidation solution is needed the second is the mechanisms of pyrite mediated aops the current research is mainly from the points of active oxidative species and pollutant degradation pathways further mechanism research may consider the synchronous changes of pyrite such as the surface oxidation during pyrite mediated aops illuminating the relationship between the oxidation degree of pyrite and its catalytic activity will help to optimize the technological processes of pyrite storage pretreatment and application the third is about the application research mainly including the technological coupling practical wastewater treatment and equipment development direct use of pyrite mediated aops for industrial wastewater treatment may be difficult and high cost thus coupling pyrite mediated aops with conventional biological methods might be more suitable for it to reach practical application applying pyrite mediated aops as a pretreatment step of conventional biological methods can enhance the biodegradability especially for refractory organics with less bioavailability the components of practical industrial wastewater are complicated and various factors e g high salinity high toc content and coexistence of multiple pollutants significantly affect the removal efficiency of targeted pollutants therefore the effectiveness of pyrite mediated aops for treating practical organic wastewater should be further confirmed according to the characteristics of wastewater from different industries additionally current studies on pyrite mediated aops are mostly at the stage of laboratory research the water treatment capacity is limited and the cost and corrosion problems of the equipment are often not considered in the future studies

strategies the future development directions are proposed in the aspects of toxicity research mechanism research and technological coupling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pyrite advanced oxidation process organic wastewater water treatment 1 introduction wastewater treatment is essential to pollutant discharge reduction and water use efficiency improvement the rapid development of petroleum chemical engineering textiles dyeing food pharmacy metallurgy and other industries in modern society has caused large production of organic wastewater which often contains refractory and highly toxic organics such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons halogenated hydrocarbons phthalic acid esters pharmaceuticals and insecticides cai et al 2021 if untreated the organic wastewater may cause severe damage to ecological environment and human health gwenzi and chaukura 2018 however conventional biological methods adopted by municipal sewage treatment plants are insufficient to completely eliminate refractory organics from industrial wastewater especially those with limited bioavailability grandclément et al 2017 considering the increasingly serious environmental pollution and water resource shortage today exploring innovative technologies for organic wastewater treatment and recycling is urgently needed advanced oxidation processes aops are typical effective methods to manage high concentration refractory organics in wastewater aops utilize electricity light irradiation ultrasound or catalysts to activate oxidants for producing active free radicals with extremely oxidizing capacity and then realize the degradation even direct mineralization of organic compounds via the attack of the free radicals ma et al 2021 for instance the hydroxyl radical oh generated in aops possesses a high oxidation potential of 2 80 v and the oxidizing capacity of oh far exceeds those of common chemical oxidants e g permanganate h2o2 and o3 sufficient to degrade most organic pollutants non selectively boczkaj and fernandes 2017 common aops include chemical catalytic oxidation electrochemical catalytic oxidation ozonation and photocatalytic oxidation transforming toxic organics into co2 and h2o by aops is environmentally friendly but the high costs of conventional aops involving power chemicals and sludge management limit their large scale practical applications mousset et al 2021 additionally it is difficult to control the optimal proportion of catalyst oxidant and maintain the solution ph during conventional aops zhang et al 2019a thus the researchers have been working on seeking high efficiency and low cost catalytic materials for aops pyrite is a plentiful sulfide mineral found in nature and it is the main raw material for producing sulfur and sulfuric acid oliveira et al 2012 in the past decades the geochemical characteristics mineral dressing and acid mine drainage of pyrite have been widely studied besides pyrite shows great potential in solving some environmental problems such as stabilization of hexavalent chromium li et al 2020c chemical adsorption of arsenic bulut et al 2014 abiotic dechlorination of chlorinated organics demiya et al 2018 hydrolytic removal of microcystins fang et al 2020 and denitrification removal of nitrate si et al 2021 in the aspect of aops pyrite is an attractive catalyst the oxidation of pyrite in aqueous solution generates many intermediate products such as fe2 s0 h2s and polysulfides which are active in advanced oxidation reactions feng et al 2019 in recent years many successful experimental studies about pyrite catalyst for aops have been reported especially for fenton oxidation and persulfate oxidation and the research enthusiasm continues however to our knowledge currently there is a lack of timely review on this topic to provide the basic understanding and guide the further research in this article recent studies about pyrite mediated aops are carefully reviewed the basic information of pyrite and its characteristics for aops are first introduced primary focus is placed on the performance and mechanisms of pyrite mediated fenton oxidation electro fenton oxidation and persulfate oxidation processes some enhancing strategies and future research needs for pyrite mediated aops are presented this review article is hoped to give basic information and reference on pyrite mediated aops and advance their further research and practical applications 2 pyrite and its characteristics for aops pyrite is a sulfide mineral which is widespread in hydrothermal veins polymetallic ore deposits metamorphic rocks and igneous rocks migaszewski and gałuszka 2019 the main composition of pyrite is disulphide of iron fes2 and it presents with a face centered cubic lattice in the crystal structure in natural pyrite partial substitution of iron by other metal elements e g nickel cobalt and copper may occur abraitis et al 2004 due to the characteristics of light brassy color and metallic luster pyrite is often mistaken for gold and thus also known as fool s gold gregory and kohn 2020 oxidation and dissolution characteristics of pyrite in aqueous solutions are research hotspot in the field of geochemistry and environment the dissolved fe2 from pyrite can serve as catalyst in aops to achieve effective degradation of refractory organic pollutants oxygen and fe3 are two important oxidizers for pyrite oxidation in aqueous solutions and the oxidation processes can be expressed as eqs 1 and 2 wang et al 2019 significantly fe3 was reported to be more aggressive and powerful than o2 for pyrite oxidation and oxidation rates by fe3 were nearly one and two orders of magnitude higher than that by o2 at high and low ph respectively chandra and gerson 2010 therefore taking full advantage of the oxidation characteristics of pyrite to offer fe2 for aops has become a hot topic 1 2 fe s 2 7 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e 2 4 so 4 2 4 h 2 fe s 2 14 f e 3 8 h 2 o 15 f e 2 2 so 4 2 16 h for catalytic applications in aops natural pyrite has excellent machinability many researchers used natural pyrite materials obtained from local mines mining companies and chemical reagent companies in their study of aops before being used as a catalyst for aops pyrite usually undergoes a pretreatment of grinding sieving removing impurities washing and drying he et al 2021 the typical processing steps are illustrated in fig 1 a in a typical pretreatment process pyrite ore is ground into fine powders by a ceramic or agate mortar and then sieved to smaller particles at a micron level subsequently the oxide impurities on pyrite surface are removed by acid pickling after being washed by deoxygenated deionized water the pyrite catalyst is dried in an oxygen free oven through simple processing and preparation high performance pyrite catalyst can be obtained from the natural mineral which provides a feasible recycling pathway of pyrite from mining tailings the customizability is another attractive characteristic of pyrite for aops apart from natural pyrite synthetic pyrite is used in some aop studies synthetic pyrite typically serves as the substitution of natural pyrite for particular research requirement such as specific size or purity high quality pyrite product can be obtained via simple hydrothermal reactions fig 1b generally ferrous sulfate feso4 sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 and sulfur s are used as the reactants for example in the fes2 synthesis process reported by wang et al 2020b sulfur powder was added after feso4 7h2o and na2s2o3 were dissolved in water and then the resulting suspension was fully stirred and transferred to an autoclave for conducting the hydrothermal reaction the overall reaction can be described as the eq 3 wu et al 2004 the artificially synthesized fes2 is similar to natural pyrite and it is convenient to adjust and control the properties besides the hydrothermal synthesis method many other methods such as hot injection method template directed synthesis and direct thermal sulfidation can also be used to synthesize fes2 trinh et al 2017 qin et al 2018 though these methods are all available the hydrothermal synthesis is recommended to prepare amounts of fes2 for large scale applications in aops due to its relatively simpler apparatus and technique compared with natural pyrite synthetic pyrite with high purity is more suitable for the research of related mechanisms 3 fes o 4 n a 2 s 2 o 3 s h 2 o fe s 2 n a 2 s o 4 h 2 s o 4 3 application of pyrite mediated aops for treating refractory organic pollutants pyrite has been shown to successfully function in various aops mainly including fenton oxidation electro fenton oxidation and persulfate oxidation processes in this section the performance of pyrite mediated aops in organic wastewater treatment is presented and the basic mechanisms are discussed and illustrated 3 1 pyrite mediated fenton oxidation processes fenton oxidation is a classical chemical reaction named with its discoverer henry john horstman fenton koppenol 1993 this reaction generates hydroxyl radical oh with strong oxidizing capacity from hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ferrous ion fe2 and the basic process is represented by the eq 4 zhu et al 2019 the redox potential of the strong oxidizer oh reaches up to 2 80 v which is next only to fluorine mousset et al 2017 therefore fenton oxidation is powerful in mineralizing various organic pollutants especially some refractory aromatic compounds and heterocyclic compounds significantly fenton reaction is generally effective in acidic condition as the precipitation of dissolved iron species will occur in the solution with a high ph value jung et al 2009 in the application of fenton reaction for degrading organic pollutants ferrous salts e g ferrous sulfate are often used as the iron source using pyrite to substitute ferrous salts can also trigger the fenton reaction and achieve effective removal of organic pollutants in wastewater table 1 for example zhang et al 2014b prepared natural pyrite catalyst by simple grinding method and used it to catalyze the fenton reaction for nitrobenzene degradation in the aqueous solution according to their results about 80 of the nitrobenzene was degraded within 300 min in the optimal conditions of 2 0 g l of the catalyst 250 mm of h2o2 20 mg l of initial nitrobenzene and a ph value of 3 0 while the classical fenton system with ferrous sulfate could only remove 30 of the pollutant the poor performance of classical fenton system might be attributed to the early termination of the nitrobenzene degradation due to the fe sludge formation which was overcome in pyrite fenton system on the one hand the release of fe2 from pyrite is slow and the resulting fe3 can be reduced back to fe2 for fenton reaction via its interaction with pyrite which achieves the recycle of ferric ions on the other hand the ph regulating ability of pyrite maintains an unfavorable acidic condition for fe sludge formation although pyrite showed high performance in fenton degradation of many organics the removal of total organic carbon toc which indicates the absolute mineralization of organics varied with the targeted pollutants kantar et al 2019b applied pyrite fenton system for removing chlorophenols and their results showed that a significant portion of toc still remained in the solution though all the chlorophenols were degraded within 40 min the remained toc mainly resulted from the formation of chlorinated organic intermediates and low molecular weight acids during the fenton degradation process mashayekh salehi et al 2021 used tetracycline as the targeted pollutant of their pyrite h2o2 oxidation process and the results suggested that the pollutant was completely degraded and over 85 could be mineralized within 60 min these examples show promising potential of pyrite as a heterogeneous catalyst in fenton oxidation for organic pollutant degradation similar to other heterogeneous catalysts pyrite catalyst needs be used with suitable chemical reactors for practical applications of pyrite mediated fenton oxidation processes 4 h 2 o 2 f e 2 oh f e 3 o h the proposed mechanisms of pyrite mediated fenton oxidation processes are depicted in fig 2 the whole process involves three main phases release of iron species from pyrite generation of oh by fenton reaction degradation of organic pollutants by oh attack the oxidative dissolution of pyrite by o2 releases ferrous ions eq 1 which subsequently participate in the fenton reaction besides ferrous ions ferric ions may be generated via the oxidation of pyrite by h2o2 in the fenton system eq 5 zhang et al 2018b the concomitant hydrogen ions during the release processes of iron species from pyrite effectively regulate the ph value of the fenton system ltaïef et al 2018 in the fenton process oh is generated from h2o2 while fe2 is oxidized to fe3 eq 4 the fe3 can be reduced back to fe2 fe2 fe3 cycle via the process shown by eq 6 a rate limiting step of fenton process nichela et al 2015 in the presence of pyrite the regeneration of fe2 can also be achieved through the process represented by eq 2 as described by the equation the interaction between pyrite and fe3 not only realizes the regeneration of fe2 from fe3 in the solution but also promotes the release of fe2 from pyrite therefore pyrite facilitates the fe2 fe3 cycle in the fenton process and thus promotes the production of oh for the following oxidation degradation of organics however the relevance of pyrite dissolution to free radical production needs further research and the sustainability of aforementioned mechanisms during the whole fenton process waits to be verified 5 2 fe s 2 15 h 2 o 2 2 f e 3 4 so 4 2 2 h 14 h 2 o 6 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h h o 2 3 2 pyrite mediated electro fenton oxidation processes based on the reaction mechanisms of classical fenton oxidation electro fenton oxidation utilizes electrochemically generated h2o2 instead of adscititious h2o2 reagent to produce oh he and zhou 2017 the generation of h2o2 occurs on the cathode via two electron reduction of o2 under acidic condition eq 7 casado 2019 the supply of o2 is generally made by aeration or o2 injection li et al 2020a additionally the regeneration of fe2 can also be achieved through the cathodic reduction of fe3 in the solution eq 8 casado 2019 compared with classical fenton oxidation the main advantages of electro fenton oxidation includes that 1 the electrochemical generation of h2o2 avoid the safety risk of h2o2 reagent during its transportation storage and use 2 the controllable degradation rate of pollutants favors the study of degradation process and mechanism and 3 the continuous regeneration of fe2 reduces the fe sludge formation using pyrite as the heterogeneous electro fenton catalyst shows excellent performance for removing organic pollutants in wastewater table 2 in the electro fenton systems pyrite mainly acts as the iron source in the electro fenton oxidation processes which avoids the use of soluble iron salts or the loss of metal electrode in traditional electro fenton oxidation ammar et al 2015 used natural pyrite to catalyze the electro fenton oxidation for removing tyrosol from wastewater and they found that 89 toc was reduced in 360 min under the conditions of 1 0 mg l of pyrite catalyst 300 ma of electric current and 0 3 mmol l of initial tyrosol additionally pyrite can function as ph regulator and fe3 reductor to maintain long time favorable reaction conditions a highlighted phenomenon during the electro fenton oxidation conducted by ammar et al 2015 was that pyrite could spontaneously regulate the solution ph to a suitable value of 2 8 3 7 similar results were also found in using pyrite mediated electro fenton oxidation to remove other organic pollutants such as levofloxacin sulfamethazine and diclofenac barhoumi et al 2015 barhoumi et al 2016 yu et al 2020 compared with direct use of pyrite as fenton catalyst the cases of using pyrite for electro fenton oxidation are less this gives greater research space for exploring electrochemical applications of pyrite 7 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 8 f e 3 e f e 2 the proposed mechanisms of pyrite mediated electro fenton oxidation processes are depicted in fig 3 the reduction of dissolved o2 at the cathode produces h2o2 eq 7 while the oxidative dissolution of pyrite releases iron species eq 1 and eq 5 the released fe2 can directly participate in the fenton reaction with h2o2 generated at the cathode the fe3 both released from pyrite via h2o2 oxidation and generated from fenton reaction can be reduced to fe2 via multiple pathways including pyrite reduction eq 2 and cathodic reduction eq 8 these processes facilitate the fe2 fe3 cycle and promote the oh generation in electro fenton system various production processes of hydrogen ions eq 1 eq 2 and eq 5 support the spontaneous ph regulation capacity of the pyrite electro fenton system additionally the water oxidation at a high oxygen overvoltage anode produces supplementary oh and h eq 9 nidheesh and gandhimathi 2012 continuous oh generation and its facilitating processes provide potent oxidizing capacity for the degradation of organic pollutants few studies focused on the electrochemical characteristics of pyrite and non radical degradation pathways of organics in pyrite mediated electro fenton system future studies on these aspects may help to go deep into the mechanisms 9 h 2 o oh h e 3 3 pyrite mediated persulfate oxidation processes conventional aops are based on the strong oxidizing capacity of oh while persulfate oxidation technology utilizes sulfate radical so4 a free radical with the strong oxidizing capacity close to oh as the main active species to degrade organic pollutants oh et al 2016 persulfate includes peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 and peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 and both of them contain peroxy bond o o in their molecular structure the cleaving of the peroxy bond in persulfate via energy and electron transfer reactions generates so4 with a high oxidation potential of 2 60 v tsitonaki et al 2010 compared with oh so4 offers many more advantages in aops including that 1 so4 possesses a longer half life time than that of oh 30 40 µs vs 1 µs which ensures it to attack the targeted pollutants more effectively 2 so4 can react with organic pollutants in a broad ph range of 2 0 8 0 and 3 persulfate is safer than h2o2 during its transportation storage and use zhao et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 various methods can be applied to activate persulfate for produce so4 such as thermal activation alkaline activation radiation activation transition metal activation and carbonaceous material activation wang and wang 2018 using pyrite to provide ferrous ions can effectively activate persulfate and produce strong oxidizer so4 for removing organic pollutants in wastewater table 3 and the activating processes can be expressed as eqs 10 and 11 zhang et al 2014a ali et al 2021 for example li et al 2021 used pyrite pms system for degrading propanil and they found that 91 9 of the propanil could be degraded within 15 min under the optimal conditions and so4 and oh are the dominant reactive species chen et al 2018 used ethylthionocarbamate as the targeted pollutant of their pyrite pds oxidation process and the results suggested that 96 64 of the pollutant was degraded within 180 min and so4 functioned as the predominant reactive species rahimi et al 2021 prepared pyrite nanoparticles with a ball mill by using mine waste as the raw material and applied them as the catalysts to activate pms and pds for tetracycline degradation according to their results the removal rate of tetracycline in pds and pms system was respectively 32 5 and 98 7 within 30 min under the conditions of 1 0 mg l of pyrite 1 0 g l of pds pms 50 mg l of initial tetracycline and an initial ph value of 4 1 compared with pds pms could be more effectively activated by pyrite which might be attributed to the asymmetric structure of pms molecular song et al 2020 10 f e 2 hso 5 f e 3 so 4 o h 11 f e 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 3 so 4 so 4 2 the proposed mechanisms of pyrite mediated persulfate oxidation processes are depicted in fig 4 besides the oxidative dissolution of pyrite by o2 eq 1 pyrite releases iron ions via the oxidation effect of persulfate and the oxidation process by pms and pds can be expressed by eqs 12 and 13 liang et al 2010 feng et al 2018 the released fe2 activates the pms and pds to generate so4 by the pathways represented by eqs 10 and 11 in addition to the above pathways so4 may be generated via direct pyrite oxidation by pms and pds eqs 14 and 15 rahimi et al 2021 by the attack of so4 the targeted organics can be effectively degraded during the oxidation process the regeneration of fe2 from fe3 and the release of fe2 from pyrite can be promoted via the reaction between fe3 and pyrite eq 2 thus facilitating the fe2 fe3 cycle and the so4 production in the pyrite persulfate systems oh may generate via so4 and the processes are represented by eqs 16 and 17 ismail et al 2017 both so4 and the concomitant oh can function to degrade organic pollutants in the aqueous solution excessive fe2 will consume the functional so4 and oh eqs 18 and 19 shang et al 2019 the slow release of fe2 from pyrite avoids the unwanted consumption of these free radicals which ensures the high efficiency oxidation capacity of the pyrite mediated persulfate oxidation processes liang et al 2010 additionally sulfur species play an important role in the activated oxidation by pyrite different valence states of sulfur including monosulfide s2 disulfide s2 2 polysulfide sn 2 elemental sulfur s0 and sulfate so4 2 were present in pyrite oxidation systems and the reductive low valence sulfur importantly function in the fe2 fe3 cycle he et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 highlighted the role of sulfide as electron donors for pms activation and reported that although the fe2 on pyrite efficiently activated pms the fe2 regeneration and subsequent pms activation were crucially controlled by s2 2 more mechanism studies from the point of sulfur species are expected to improve the understanding of pyrite mediated persulfate oxidation as both pyrite and persulfate can release sulfur species into the solution during the oxidation process 12 fe s 2 7 hso 5 h 2 o f e 2

photocatalytic oxidation and ozone oxidation for degrading organic pollutants considering the safety risk and instability of liquid h2o2 reagent zhou et al 2020 used solid cao2 as the h2o2 source and applied the pyrite cao2 system to degrade diethyl phthalate based on the fenton oxidation mechanism their experimental results suggested that 10 mg l of diethyl phthalate could be completely degraded by the pyrite cao2 system within 5 0 min at a ph value of 3 5 diao et al 2015 applied natural pyrite as photocatalyst for degrading malachite green with ultraviolet irradiation in the photocatalytic experiment 1 0 g l of pyrite could degrade 96 7 of the malachite green within 120 min via a photo fenton like process wu et al 2016b used pyrite as an ozonation catalyst for degrading reactive black 5 and the mineralization efficiency increased by 17 39 compared with using ozone alone the oh generated by the reaction between ozone and pyrite surface was considered the main mechanism involving pyrite into other aop systems is now under active exploration and interesting and meaningful results will further expand the application scope and development prospect of pyrite in aop systems 4 enhancing strategies of pyrite mediated aops although many pyrite mediated aop systems have been successfully developed for organic wastewater treatment some strategies are proposed fig 5 as researchers always make perfection more perfect when developing new catalysts they are proposed to further enhance the performance or overcome the limitations such as insufficient surface reactivity of pyrite slow pyrite dissolution limited efficiency of heterogeneous reactions on the solid liquid interface and low catalytic activity of pyrite under high ph conditions these enhancing strategies are also suitable for some other activation systems and they were referred or adopted by the researchers for enhancing the performance of pyrite mediated aops in this section the introduced enhancing strategies were used and supported with at least one research paper 4 1 making pyrite into nanoparticles in order to overcome the insufficient surface reactivity of pyrite in some aop systems making pyrite into nanoparticles is proposed this strategy has the advantage of improving the catalytic activity of pyrite in aops nanoparticles are small particles with dimensions in a nanoscale range 1 100 nm compared with conventional materials nanoparticles typically have higher specific surface area and surface energy which offers greater chemical reactivity santos et al 2015 in laboratory experiments natural pyrite is generally ground into nanoparticles by a ball mill mashayekh salehi et al 2021 rahimi et al 2021 while synthetic pyrite nanoparticles can be obtained through the control of synthesis conditions qin et al 2018 gil lozano et al 2014 compared the efficacy of pyrite microparticles 1 4 µm and pyrite nanoparticles 20 nm in catalyzing fenton degradation of copper phthalocyanine and the two particles could remove 7 and 60 of the pollutant at the same low dosage of 0 08 mg l respectively however this strategy is too difficult to be practical at the present time innovations in the production equipment of pyrite nanoparticles and chemical reactor of nanomaterials are needed to achieve the practical application 4 2 assisting by ultrasound considering the limited efficiency of heterogeneous reactions on the solid liquid interface the combination of pyrite mediated aops and ultrasound has received interest from researchers to enhance the catalytic performance the advantages of ultrasound assistance in pyrite mediated aops mainly include refreshing the pyrite surface producing additional active free radicals and facilitating the mass transfer in the aqueous solution continuous ultrasonic wave can help to clean and refresh the pyrite surface by peeling off the oxide layer and pitting the pyrite surface gao et al 2018 additional active free radicals e g oh h ho2 and o2 may be produced during the ultrasonic treatment by triggering acoustic cavitation which involves the formation rapid growth and violent collapse of cavitation bubbles zhang et al 2018a additionally the strong mechanical effect generated by ultrasound can enhance the mass transfer at solid liquid interface guo et al 2017 diao et al 2020 coupled ultrasound with pyrite pms system for the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol and their results showed that the degradation efficiency increased from 71 3 to 97 9 with the assistance of ultrasonic treatment this result demonstrates the effectiveness of ultrasound for assisting the activation process of pyrite mediated aops 4 3 enhancing by light irradiation similar to the ultrasonic assistance light irradiation can help to enhance the performance of pyrite mediated aops by taking the advantage of the semiconductor characteristics of pyrite the suitable band gap direct 1 03 ev indirect 0 95 ev and high optical absorption coefficient 105 cm 1 for hν 1 3 ev enable pyrite to absorb light and generate electron e and hole h under light irradiation morales gallardo et al 2016 the photo induced carriers can react with the components such as pyrite fe3 h2o and o2 in aop systems thus facilitating the production of reactive oxidative species vorontsov 2019 using light irradiation for assistance can effectively improve the catalytic activity of pyrite in aops for example zeng et al 2019 used visible light to enhance the pyrite mediated fenton oxidation process for p nitrophenol degradation and the complete degradation time was shortened from 10 min to 4 min with the assistance of visible light irradiation however using light irradiation for assistance is technically difficult to achieve in practical applications as the effective optical path in current reactor for pyrite mediated advanced oxidation would be very small 4 4 adding exogenous ferric ions although pyrite mediated aops show excellent application prospects it suffers from low reaction rate and excessive h2o2 is usually needed to shorten reaction time the production of fe2 is the rate determining step in pyrite mediated aops considering that the generation of fe2 from oxidizing pyrite by fe3 is much faster than that from oxidizing pyrite by o2 exogenous fe3 can help to overcome the slow pyrite dissolution and accelerate the fe2 generation thereby enhancing the degradation performance of pyrite mediated aops wu et al 2015 investigated the effect of fe3 on pyrite oxidation in the fenton system and they found that the final solution ph decreased from 3 02 to 2 91 with the increasing concentration of added fe3 and the oxidative degradation efficiency of chloramphenicol by the system was significantly reduced from 100 to less than 30 by adding 0 5 mm of phosphate buffer as fe3 chelating agent 4 5 chelating iron ions by organic ligands under high ph condition the iron precipitation significantly inhibits the catalytic activity of pyrite in aop systems which limits the ph range of applications adding organic chelating agents is proposed to enhance the catalytic performance as organic chelating agents can inhibit the precipitation of iron ions especially at a relatively high ph condition by acting as a ligand to form chelate compounds with iron ions bai et al 2021 this is conducive to extending the application ph range of pyrite mediated aops additionally the chelating effects of organic ligands could help to induce the generation of fe2 from pyrite surface and facilitate the fe2 fe3 cycle wu et al 2016a used as a biodegradable chelating agent tetrasodium glutamate diacetate glda successfully enhanced the performance of pyrite mediated fenton oxidation for chloramphenicol degradation at a ph value of 8 0 and they found that glda increased the oh production and glda chelated fe3 accelerated the fe2 fe3 cycle similarly kantar et al 2019a used citrate to enhance the performance of treating pharmaceutical wastewater by a continuous flow pyrite h2o2 systems their results showed that the toc removal in the presence of citrate was much higher than that without citrate and the increased iron dissolution and reduced column clogging by citrate were considered the main causes 4 6 accelerating oxidation by biochar although pyrite can promote the fe2 fe3 cycle in aops the insufficient fe2 regeneration and low heterogeneous reaction rate may impeded the sustainability of high efficiency of pyrite mediated aops during the whole oxidation process recent research enthusiasm on biochar offers a new strategy to address this issue biochar is a porous pyrolysis products of biomass materials and it has been extensively applied in environmental remediation by reason of its high adsorption capacity for many pollutants positive role as electron transfer mediator and various persistent free radicals luo et al 2021 these characteristics are also favorable for organic pollutant degradation by pyrite mediated aops biochar can concentrate organic pollutants at solid liquid interface by adsorption which facilitates their catalytic degradation the electron transfer capacity and persistent free radicals benefit the free radical generation and the fe2 fe3 cycle zhu et al 2020 added biochar to the pyrite h2o2 system for accelerating the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the degradation rate constant was 1 98 2 39 times higher with the addition of 0 1 g l of biochar 5 summary of pyrite advantages for aops pyrite is an attractive catalyst for advanced oxidation reactions in recent studies as it has many advantages compared with other catalyst materials fig 6 and table 4 pyrite is a plentiful natural mineral on earth which offers a rich source for the catalyst materials for example the newly discovered reserves of pyrite in china reached 68 62 million tons in 2019 ministry of natural resources 2020 using pyrite as the catalyst is cost effective compared with metal catalysts especially noble metal pyrite is much cheaper and it can often be obtained from the recycling of mine tailings schellenbach and krekeler 2012 lü et al 2018 current market price of pyrite is reported as cheap as 100 300 ton li et al 2016 hu et al 2020 which shows competitive price advantage solid pyrite plays a positive role in heterogeneous catalysis the solid state of pyrite facilitates the catalyst separation from the reaction system the catalyst reuse in practical application and the control of possible pollution caused by metal ions yu et al 2020 the oxidative dissolution of pyrite in aqueous solution slowly releases ferrous ions constantin and chiriţă 2013 investigated the oxidative dissolution of pyrite in acidic media ph 2 5 and 25 c and found that the dissolution rates of pyrite by o2 saturated h2o2 0 1 m and fe3 0 01 m were 2 53 10 4 1 52 10 2 and 9 35 10 2 µmol m2 s respectively thus using pyrite as a sustainable iron source to drive advanced oxidation reactions can obviate using soluble iron salts and forming iron sludge peng et al 2017 reported that the iron sludge production of their electro fenton treatment could reach 1 19 to 3 23 kg m3 after 60 min the undesired iron sludge production can be inhibited or eliminated due to the fe2 fe3 cycle and the self regulated acidic condition in pyrite mediated electro fenton system yu et al 2020 apart from ferrous ions the oxidative dissolution of pyrite simultaneously produces hydrogen ions conducive to maintaining a favorable acidic condition for advanced oxidation reactions wu et al 2015 ltaïef et al 2018 both the structural ferrous ion and the reductive sulfide species in pyrite can participate in redox reactions via acting as electron donors these reductive species can support multiple functions at the same time such as activating persulfate and reducing pollutant he et al 2021 these characteristics of pyrite make it competitive as a multifunction catalyst because amounts of pollutants are hard to be oxidized by conventional wastewater treatments additionally the easy processing technologies and the environmentally friendly feature are also attractive points of pyrite catalyst fathinia et al 2015 these advantages encourage the use of pyrite as a low cost heterogeneous catalyst in aops however natural pyrite often serves as a sink for some toxic trace metals such as lead zinc cadmium arsenic and copper tabelin et al 2018 these accompanying elements may be released during pyrite oxidation although their concentrations are very small the risk of these toxic elements during wastewater treatment should be noted reasonable classification and management of pyrite raw materials based on the source and advance leaching test is recommended to ensure that the benefits of pyrite in aops outweigh the risks 6 conclusions and outlook in summary pyrite can be an excellent catalyst for aops including fenton oxidation electro fenton oxidation and persulfate oxidation processes and pyrite mediated aop systems show great application prospect in treating organic wastewater natural pyrite is an abundant low cost heterogeneous catalyst for aops and the slow release of fe2 and the self regulation of solution ph are highlighted characteristics of pyrite mediated aops synthetic pyrite typically serves as the substitution of natural pyrite for particular research requirement in aops pyrite slowly releases fe2 to trigger the advanced oxidation reactions the interaction between fe3 and pyrite facilitates the fe2 regeneration and the fe2 fe3 cycle in aops making pyrite into nanoparticles assisting by ultrasound and light irradiation and adding exogenous fe3 organic chelating agents or biochar is effective to further enhance the performance of pyrite mediated aops in the future the research priority on this topic should be given to the following issues the first is the potential risks of pyrite in aop systems besides the main component fes2 natural pyrite may contain some accompanying elements such as nickel cobalt copper arsenic selenium gold and silver whether these toxic trace elements cause toxic effects through the treating processes of pyrite mediated aops or not is worth exploring before the practical application confirming this point is necessary to avoid unintended consequences of pyrite mediated aops therefore toxicity research on pyrite and its oxidation solution is needed the second is the mechanisms of pyrite mediated aops the current research is mainly from the points of active oxidative species and pollutant degradation pathways further mechanism research may consider the synchronous changes of pyrite such as the surface oxidation during pyrite mediated aops illuminating the relationship between the oxidation degree of pyrite and its catalytic activity will help to optimize the technological processes of pyrite storage pretreatment and application the third is about the application research mainly including the technological coupling practical wastewater treatment and equipment development direct use of pyrite mediated aops for industrial wastewater treatment may be difficult and high cost thus coupling pyrite mediated aops with conventional biological methods might be more suitable for it to reach practical application applying pyrite mediated aops as a pretreatment step of conventional biological methods can enhance the biodegradability especially for refractory organics with less bioavailability the components of practical industrial wastewater are complicated and various factors e g high salinity high toc content and coexistence of multiple pollutants significantly affect the removal efficiency of targeted pollutants therefore the effectiveness of pyrite mediated aops for treating practical organic wastewater should be further confirmed according to the characteristics of wastewater from different industries additionally current studies on pyrite mediated aops are mostly at the stage of laboratory research the water treatment capacity is limited and the cost and corrosion problems of the equipment are often not considered in the future studies designing simple high efficiency and reliable reactors for practical application of pyrite mediated aops is recommended declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16293,constantly changing and evolving social economic political and environmental landscapes create new uncertainties in urban water supplies these uncertainties surrounding urban water management have been captured using various scenario analysis techniques which have been developed to envision plausible futures although past review papers have conducted broad reviews on water related issues and water management generally there has been a lack of attention to urban water management specifically the growing uncertainty surrounding urban water management systems necessitates a focused review specifically aimed at the use of scenarios in urban water management using a comprehensive typology a systematic review is presented to empirically investigate the necessary dimensions of urban water management scenario assessment urban water management scenario studies that exclusively employ qualitative methods as well as urban water management studies that employ qualitative methods with quantitative techniques are reviewed against the comprehensive typology by aligning the reviewed scenarios with the dimensions in the typology some important gaps in the current literature were identified the need for i transparency in scenario development and analysis processes ii inclusion of surprises and extreme events iii validation efforts and iv considering the impact phase of a

currently faces a range of diverse challenges these include population growth urbanisation climate change volatile global economies increasing energy prices heightened environmental awareness and complex regulatory and social circumstances marlow et al 2010 romano and akhmouch 2019 werbeloff and brown 2011a 2011b the ability of cities to manage these challenges is limited by a range of factors which include the growing uncertainty with respect to operational environmental social and economic constraints blackmore and plant 2008 pearson et al 2009 in circumstances where future uncertainties are high scenario analysis has been applied as a key method for enabling appropriate planning to achieve future objectives kok et al 2011b these techniques aid in exploring a range of diverse and plausible futures reflecting the state of the world at some point in the future and the pathways to move from the present to that projected future börjeson et al 2006 scenario analysis has been widely

haasnoot and middelkoop 2012 another key finding was the explicit quantification of uncertainties should be addressed in water scenarios to provide information for more robust decision making dong et al 2013 furthermore an interpretative framework was created to synthesize the use of scenario analysis in water issues march et al 2012 although the studies described above have conducted broad reviews on water related issues and water management generally there has been a lack of attention to urban water management uwm specifically these studies reviewed water scenario literature using a traditional literature review approach dong et al 2013 haasnoot and middelkoop 2012 based on personal and expert experience haasnoot and middelkoop 2012 as well as had the authors develop an analytical framework which they used for their review march et al 2012 in this study however we used both a systematic literature review with an existing theoretical framework and a comprehensive scenario intervention csi typology that sits in broader scenario literature to explore the necessary dimensions of urban water scenario assessment a theoretical framework is the use of a theory in a study that conveys the deepest values of the researcher s and provides a clearly articulated signpost or lens for how the study will process new knowledge theoretical frameworks provide focus and organization to the study connect the study to existing scholarship and terms and identify strengths and weaknesses collins and stockton 2018 by using the csi typology as the theoretical framework for this systematic literature review we were able organise the uwm scenario literature identify the strengths search for negative or discrepant cases in relation to the theory the csi typology in this case engage in discussions that returned to the research questions and finally arrive at reasonable conclusions therefore this study explores the necessary dimensions of uwm scenario assessment particularly focusing on studies that employ qualitative methods as well as studies that employ qualitative methods with quantitative techniques we use a theoretical framework with a systematic review approach to highlight the limitations in existing practices and present suggestions to improve the application of uwm scenarios this paper will be beneficial for those engaged in planning for future urban water development particularly when considering options analysis this review attempts to answer the following research questions 1 what aspects of the scenario process have previous uwm studies incorporated 2 what are the components that have been broadly overlooked and what has been addressed clearly 3 what are the components of the scenario process that have not been described clearly but rather included in a non systematic way 4 what are the gaps identified and how can they be bridged 2 research methods a systematic literature review was performed based on the protocol developed by the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analyses prisma fig 1 moher et al 2009 the final list of 33 studies were then included and characterised using the csi typology developed by crawford 2019 2 1 systematic literature review the search was restricted to peer reviewed english language papers and grey literature including academic theses and unpublished scenario analyses by professional consultants dated between 2000 and 2020 studies that employed purely quantitative methods for scenarios were ineligible since the focus of this study is uwm studies that employ qualitative methods as well as uwm studies that employ qualitative methods with quantitative techniques studies that only included a single driving force for example climate change population growth economic development were ineligible since such studies become a simple factorial analysis rather than a true scenario analysis the analysis and the discussion presented in this paper will strictly follow the csi typology other factors that are not part of the typology but can influence scenarios such as asset management of ageing water infrastructures for example are out of scope for this review the complete selection process was performed independently by one reviewer the first author of this review paper peer reviewed studies were identified by searching compendex engineering village with the search run from 14 september 2020 to 4 november 2020 in addition grey literature was searched on google scholar which involved reading the abstract and introduction section of the documents an advanced topic search was used to identify the studies using the following boolean search string urban water management or urban water resource management or management of urban water resources or water management or water resource management or management of water resources or water use or water demand or water demands or water scarcity or water supply or water supplies or water footprint or water footprints and water future or scenario or futures or story line or storylines or socio economic scenario the keywords used are as given in the string above uwm scenario studies did not explicitly specify the methods they used as qualitative or quantitative using these terms as keywords in the search string would have incorrectly excluded and or included specific studies hence an elaborate manual review of the abstracts was conducted by one reviewer the first author of this review paper to identify the relevant studies that fit the selection criteria a total of 15 159 papers were identified from compendex ten grey literature sources were identified from google scholar and an in depth google search the details of these studies including title and abstract information was downloaded into a ms excel spreadsheet these records were then screened for duplicates after duplicates were removed 8258 studies were screened studies whose primary focus was not relevant to uwm such as those that drafted scenarios for water management in rural areas wetlands etc were screened out following the screening process 175 studies were then assessed for eligibility an in depth review of these studies was conducted to determine their eligibility as stated previously studies with only quantitative scenario methods and those with only a single driving force were ineligible a final list of 33 studies from 49 publications as some studies were divided into more than one paper were identified for this review bibliographic information was imported into endnote x9 a bibliographic database software 2 2 typology used to characterise scenario studies in developing this review uwm scenario studies were characterised using the csi typology developed by crawford 2019 aligning scenarios with the dimensions in a typology produces more credible scenarios resilient to methodological criticisms ducot and lubben 1980 this creates unique scenario profiles while other typologies such as the wilkinson et al 2013 typology and the ducot and lubben 1980 typology offer between four to twenty seven potential profiles the csi typology has the ability to map out more than one million unique profiles crawford 2019 crawford 2019 categorised the csi typology as follows the csi typology is divided into a hierarchy of dimensions the broadest dimensions are sections each section is divided into characteristics each characteristic is further divided into categories some categories are divided into sub categories which are the most focused dimensions of the csi typology depending on the dimensions the relationships between them can be dependant independent interrelated mutually exclusive or unrelated the csi typology is divided into four broad sections with 22 characteristics 91 categories and 30 sub categories p 5 the results presented follow the csi typological dimensions to characterise uwm scenario studies 2 3 characterisation of uwm scenario studies using csi typology each of the selected uwm scenario study was aligned with the typology s dimensions only one coder was involved in coding each scenario study each section of the csi typology was expanded in an excel worksheet where the characteristics of each section were presented as columns and each of the scenario study presented in rows each uwm study was read and analysed in detail and assigned the relevant category and sub category it was possible to have overlap across dimensions all overlaps were considered independently and as part of the analysis studies were classified into all relevant sub categories this resulted in a unique scenario profile for each study an example of a scenario planning profile is given in appendix a using claassen et al 2013 3 results 3 1 project goals this section presents the elements that must be addressed to set the agenda for a scenario process crawford 2019 within project goals there are ten key characteristics for which brief definitions are provided table 1 3 1 1 epistemology cartesian uwm studies explored knowledge about drivers and uncertainties were process focused or learning focused looked at forecasting plausible futures and investigated impacts on urban water e g loubet et al 2016 van duuren et al 2019 walczykiewicz 2014 uwm studies that had a non cartesian approach developed scenarios that became part of government action plans or policy identified a perfect or ideal water future to work towards linked strategy formation with implementation and evaluated policy options e g colorado water conservation board 2015 dawson et al 2018 schütze et al 2019 for example schütze et al 2019 used a transdisciplinary approach for water management combining adaptation and application of methods from hydrology social sciences water engineering and modelling and included stakeholders in this process as a result of this process lima 2040 action plan was developed with specific goals and targets that the main institutions and organisations responsible for the water sector of lima commit themselves to 3 1 2 control most uwm scenario papers took a preactive or proactive approach for instance claassen et al 2013 was preactive as the purpose of the scenario exercise was to determine preferred future outcomes and navigate towards them it was forward looking and the organisation had some control to navigate the external forces without being an active player that can provoke change and design the future on the other hand atkins 2013 was proactive since the author identified no regret pathways strategies that are beneficial across all plausible planning scenarios and can be taken today to prepare for an uncertain tomorrow thereby taking an active role to provoke change and design their future only three scenario studies took a reflexive approach the scenarios developed for colorado water plan were reflexive as they were adaptive in nature and the aim was to constantly revise them according to changing circumstances in both external environment and the internal organisation moving into the future none of the uwm scenario studies took a passive or reactive perspective groves 2005 could not be classified since the scenarios were developed as part of the california water plan and the water plan 2005 update could not be found online 3 1 3 value reality the descriptive approach was the most common amongst uwm studies with both plausible e g claassen et al 2013 van duuren et al 2019 zhi et al 2016 and hypothetical futures e g gallopin and rijsberman 2000 lienert et al 2006 rulleau et al 2020 of these only means et al 2005 and gallopin and rijsberman 2000 had considered surprises within the scenarios ten of the uwm scenarios were normative with both active e g colorado water conservation board 2015 dawson et al 2018 schütze et al 2019 and passive approaches al jayyousi 2003 allouche et al 2008 qingxin et al 2009 for instance schütze et al 2019 had normative active scenarios since they had a clear aim the objective to develop robust plans and strategies for decision making that consider future risks and potentials normative passive scenarios were found in qingxin et al 2009 where different policy scenarios were developed three of the uwm scenarios were dynamic having both descriptive and normative elements for example kok et al 2011b explicitly focused on combining both normative backcasting and explorative scenario approaches the main objective of this paper was to analyse the combination of exploratory and backcasting scenarios 3 1 4 vantage point crawford 2019 states that one of the most common types of forward casting scenarios is likely futures however this was not the case with uwm studies with what if scenarios being the majority by combining quantitative scenario analyses with high impacting high uncertainty driving forces forward casting what if uwm scenarios were used to identify major drivers and uncertainties surrounding uwm systems and to develop strategies to improve resilience in an uncertain future e g choi and park 2001 groves 2005 iny 2017 on the other hand uwm studies with forward casting likely scenarios were drafted using predetermined factors past and current events where the basis for expert deliberations is the historical trends shaping particular internal and external factors affecting the scenario condition of water management was characterized by information on the trends walczykiewicz 2014 of the studies that took the bi directional approach two of them had bi directional hedging scenarios burek et al 2016 van vliet and kok 2015 for example proskuryakova et al 2018 had bi directional selective scenarios the study aimed to backcast necessary strategic steps to reach the visionary future and mitigate the consequences of undesired scenarios in doing so they developed four plausible futures for the russian water sector till 2030 forward casting and then backcast ways to reach the desired nearly perfect future scenario none of the reviewed uwm studies take a backcasting approach 3 1 5 motivation from the publications identified in this review uwm scenarios had both preserving and transforming motivations both quantitative and qualitative measures can be part of the preserving scenario process börjeson et al 2006 uwm preserving scenarios had both quantitative and qualitative approaches e g ercin and hoekstra 2014 qingxin et al 2009 zhi et al 2016 or purely qualitative measures e g al jayyousi 2003 colorado water conservation board 2015 shakweer and youssef 2007 both börjeson et al 2006 and wilkinson and eidinow 2008 consider transforming scenarios to have only backcasting efforts however there were a number of scenario processes that were forward casting with transforming elements e g atkins 2013 baki et al 2018 claassen et al 2013 transforming scenarios are typically qualitative with quantitative elements supporting them börjeson et al 2006 with uwm studies they were either purely qualitative e g arup 2015 means et al 2005 proskuryakova et al 2018 or had both qualitative and quantitative elements e g lienert et al 2015 rulleau et al 2020 since the focus of the review was uwm scenario studies that exclusively employ qualitative methods as well as studies that employ qualitative methods with quantitative techniques there are inherent biases in the reported quantitative measures in this section 3 1 6 application generic uwm scenarios could be used by a wide range of sectors stakeholders organisations countries future research or any of these combinations flörke and alcamo 2004 kamari et al 2008 makropoulos et al 2008 for example kamari et al 2008 developed the water scenarios with a generic use in mind that could be used by pan europe scale regional and pilot area scales alerts policymakers and stakeholders to emerging problems related to water use test their regional and local water plans against uncertainties and surprises on the other hand specific uwm scenarios were used for various purposes one was to test efforts such as the impact of new policies or focus on issues in policy and practice crawford 2019 while van duuren et al 2019 and rulleau et al 2020 tested the impact of new policies such as the impact of decentralised systems in a centralised water supply region in the netherlands and water infrastructure asset management in france scenarios developed for the colorado water plan colorado water conservation board 2015 for water privatisation in korea choi and park 2001 and for investigating the impacts of public private partnerships in jordan al jayyousi 2003 focused on issues in policy and practice other specific uwm scenarios were developed either for a specific region or country e g claassen et al 2013 proskuryakova et al 2018 zhi et al 2016 or for a specific organisation dawson et al 2018 general efforts could also be made initially as groundwork for specific paths later crawford 2019 an example of this can be seen in schütze et al 2019 where the focus was on developing a method for water management that could be adapted specifically to the challenges of other regions 3 1 7 subject the most common subject focus was cross based while others were exclusively issue based out of the cross based studies most were both issue and area based e g saraswat et al 2017 shakweer and youssef 2007 walczykiewicz 2014 while others were issue area and institution based al jayyousi 2003 colorado water conservation board 2015 dawson et al 2018 flörke and alcamo 2004 scenarios focused on concerns from institutions such as sydney water dawson et al 2018 colorado state government colorado water conservation board 2015 european environment agency eea flörke and alcamo 2004 and the water authority of jordan wea and lema al jayyousi 2003 the different geographic areas explored in the scenarios are elaborated in section 3 1 10 3 1 8 variable scale a wide variety of external factors were included in the reviewed uwm studies encompassing social and demographic factors technology environment economy political and water related factors such as organisation and operation of water supply services availability of water resources table 2 some of the common internal variables were staff turnover ability of water sector to attract investments and finances water supply service sector or the consumer experience and water utility or company management a couple of studies included policy variables such as efficient non revenue water control strategy social pressures against liberalisation of water services and water pricing policies an example of multi scale scenarios can be found in al jayyousi 2003 that considered all three variable types the study looked at determining the impact on society from public private partnership ppp policy policy variable in jordan with consideration of financial conditions of water utilities the role of governance in water management internal variable and technology and environmental factors external variables 3 1 9 horizon with uwm scenario studies most studies take a long term horizon approach twenty four studies with five studies with a congruent horizon and one study with a medium term horizon three studies did not clearly present the time horizon choi and park 2001 dawson et al 2018 iny 2017 additionally none of the uwm scenario studies took a short term approach table 3 a mixture of congruent target horizons short to long term were identified in some uwm studies for instance makropoulos et al 2008 considered realistic timelines to reach the final scenarios from the current situation in congruent time horizons of 10 25 and 50 year intervals more assumptions were made for the long term horizons 25 and 50 years than the short term horizons other publications considered a base year for modelling and examined the outputs from the modelling for congruent time horizons spanning from short and long term horizons hejazi et al 2014 loubet et al 2016 ouyang et al 2004 zhi et al 2016 3 1 10 geographic scope in this review a range of geographic scopes were identified these included studies that looked at regional local global national supranational and overlapping geographic scopes as summarised in table 4 3 2 process design the components of the active scenario process are divided into specific characteristics crawford 2019 within process design there are six key characteristics for which brief definitions are provided in table 5 3 2 1 practitioners a wide range of practitioners were engaged in uwm scenario studies while some studies that conducted workshops explicitly mentioned engaging facilitators others did not and so it was unclear if facilitators were engaged in these studies e g dawson et al 2018 gallopin and rijsberman 2000 proskuryakova et al 2018 rulleau et al 2020 few studies engaged problem owners and employees table 6 with regards to experts more remarkable people than in house experts are recruited remarkable people are especially important since they come from outside the organisation and can bring external perspectives to the process lindgren and bandhold 2003 challenging business as usual thinking crawford 2019 stakeholders engaged in uwm studies included government representatives ngos researchers and managers only a couple of studies recruited community members in the scenario process table 6 interestingly some uwm studies did not talk about the scenario process in detail with little to no detailed information about the practitioners recruited in some cases a generic list of participants was given with no details about them e g loubet et al 2016 tramberend et al 2015 the information was not available to the public groves 2005 rulleau et al 2020 or the practitioners only identified the driving forces but did not construct the scenarios al jayyousi 2003 gallopín 2012 it is possible that these studies had limitations on what could be legitimately reported back to the public and made accessible freely which led to little detail reported within the study 3 2 2 groups several uwm studies had a heterogenous group of practitioners with a mix of representatives from ngos municipalities and government institutions water utilities water professionals community members and researchers other studies had practitioner groups comprised only of experts in the water industry or the authors themselves created the scenarios and hence were classified as homogenous however eight studies reported little to no information about the scenario process so details about the practitioner groups involved were not given table 7 presents the breakdown of studies and the respective groups 3 2 3 data purely quantitative data was used by some studies these studies used system dynamics models baki et al 2018 ouyang et al 2004 qingxin et al 2009 a few used existing models such as gcam hejazi et al 2014 and watergap flörke and alcamo 2004 while others created their own models see section 3 2 4 for details qualitative approaches were used by other studies focusing on expert judgements stakeholder discussions workshops interviews and other techniques eleven uwm studies used complimenting approaches where qualitative information such as results from interviews workshops and discussions were used to create the story and these narratives were translated into quantitative inputs for models e g choi and park 2001 saraswat et al 2017 schütze et al 2019 few studies did not clearly discuss the data methods allouche et al 2008 simply stated that there were partners involved loubet et al 2016 had helpful discussions atkins 2013 engaged with senior members while makropoulos et al 2008 did not mention data methods at all 3 2 4 data collection data collection in uwm studies included participatory methods such as surveys interviews workshops roundtables and seminars a commonly used desk research approach was dynamic modelling where models produced a snapshot of current or future states other studies developed their own models ercin and hoekstra 2014 used the water footprint assessment manual hoekstra et al 2011 to develop a simplified model to calculate water footprints and groves 2005 developed a model to forecast future water demand in california existing models were modified and used by zhi et al 2016 and hejazi et al 2014 literature research was also used as a desk research method blended methods of data collection combined literature research with qualitative participatory methods dynamic modelling with participatory methods or combined modelling with literature research and participatory methods examples of blended methods of data collection where quantitative modelling is used along with creative narratives of plausible futures is illustrated in kamari et al 2008 the authors used desk research methods to assemble readily available information on drivers and policies with qualitative participatory scenario panels these scenarios were then fed into a quantitative water availability model see table 8 for data collection methods used by the different uwm scenario studies 3 2 5 resources extensive resources in uwm studies meant there were multiple rounds of participatory approaches along with a sustained number of practitioners over the sessions e g claassen et al 2013 lienert et al 2015 rulleau et al 2020 for instance rulleau et al 2020 had 22 people in their foresight group who attended four one day workshops over a four month period three studies had a complex profile of resources hejazi et al 2014 and flörke and alcamo 2004 had no participatory methods but had extensive model development efforts on the other hand means et al 2005 had multiple rounds of participatory approaches but lacked sustained number of practitioners over the sessions with 41 participants for the workshops but only eight participants for interviews however 19 studies provided little to no detailed information about the participatory methods the participants and or the modelling process used making it difficult to gauge the available resources the study had access to 3 2 6 institutional conditions open conditions could be found in the scenario process for the colorado water conservation board 2015 and lienert et al 2006 scenarios were developed as part of the colorado water plan colorado water conservation board 2015 where the colorado water conservation board reviewed and responded to over 30 000 comments from all interest groups for consideration in the final plan lienert et al 2006 conducted expert interviews in which they reported that the interviewees were allowed to speak as freely as possible structured conditions in uwm scenarios studies revolve around two key processes the first is when studies had an initial pre process with just the main scenario panel or the scenario panel and stakeholders and determined the uncertainties drivers and objectives that helped to later craft plausible future scenarios claassen et al 2013 means et al 2005 proskuryakova et al 2018 rulleau et al 2020 schütze et al 2019 shakweer and youssef 2007 the second process was to use an existing set of scenarios as a starting point and adapt the scenarios according to the study s objectives ercin and hoekstra 2014 kok et al 2011b walczykiewicz 2014 for example ercin and hoekstra 2014 used the 2 2 matrix system of intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc scenarios as a starting point and developed detailed assumptions specific for their study however there were no details regarding the institutional conditions in 21 uwm studies 3 3 scenario content this section looks at both the individual scenario as well as the relationship between multiple scenarios crawford 2019 within scenario content there are ten key characteristics for which brief definitions are provided in table 9 3 3 1 temporal nature chain scenarios in uwm studies presented continuous storylines that showed relationships and developments between the variables e g atkins 2013 shakweer and youssef 2007 walczykiewicz 2014 the scenario storyline in choi and park 2001 for example had one event follow the other therefore the existing water authorities be financially independent from the central government the central government will do is to establish regional water management committees a water management committee can be established as a regulatory organization uwm snapshot scenarios followed the general format of an in depth description of water stakes for example water footprint water infrastructure systems water sector in a specific geographic region at a specified horizon ercin and hoekstra 2014 groves 2005 hejazi et al 2014 for instance van duuren et al 2019 presented a comprehensive view of the impact of decentralised systems on centralised water supply regime at a single point in time in 2050 varied uwm scenarios either focused on the end state with some level of implicit discussion of the path to the end state e g lienert et al 2006 loubet et al 2016 schütze et al 2019 or had each of their scenarios occurring at different points in time e g makropoulos et al 2008 qingxin et al 2009 saraswat et al 2017 for instance makropoulos et al 2008 demonstrated a zoom in approach for their scenarios for 10 25 and 50 year intervals 3 3 2 complexity there was no explicit cut off number of variables beyond which a study was considered to be of high complexity instead studies were evaluated based on the complexity of the variable definition and interconnectedness low complexity uwm scenarios had fewer variables and simplistic storylines within the scenarios e g al jayyousi 2003 baki et al 2018 dawson et al 2018 for instance in the scenarios presented by dawson et al 2018 there were only five factors considered and the scenarios themselves were simplistic with minimal interplay between the variables on the other hand high complexity scenarios usually had elaborate development of relationships between variables across multiple disciplines atkins 2013 claassen et al 2013 proskuryakova et al 2018 for example claassen et al 2013 considered 27 variables and the scenarios were described in detail with high interconnectedness between these variables in a few uwm studies it was hard to determine the complexity since the storyline was not present in detail and hence was categorised as unclear additionally the choice of not having an explicit cut off number of variables for high complexity studies became apparent when we considered groves 2005 and arup 2015 the former discussed simple interactions between thirteen variables and hence was marked to be of low complexity while the latter had only eight variables but they were sophisticated and interconnected warranting the study to be of high complexity 3 3 3 integration with high integration scenarios there was clear interconnectedness within the storyline with the variables in the scenarios unified in an interdisciplinary manner across relevant social economic environmental and institutional domains van notten et al 2003 for example atkins 2013 explored the interconnectedness between interdisciplinary variables while elaborating a graphene era future scenario exposure to extreme weather events in the uk because of climate change environmental domain has led to increased water restrictions this in turn increased public awareness social domain of water consumption and reinforced the government s commitment political domain to protecting the environment government encourages investment economic domain in clean technologies technological domain on the other hand uwm studies with a low level of integration had little interconnectedness between the variables and within the storyline for instance within each scenario in van duuren et al 2019 the variables in different domains social environmental etc had little to no inter play between them changes in one variable did not produce an effect on the other variable and they were all independent of each other 3 3 4 theme a wide range and mix of future images were included in uwm scenario studies with studies often containing more than one future image growth collapse and discipline scenarios were the most common uwm growth scenarios had growing populations economic developments and technological advances e g gallopin and rijsberman 2000 lienert et al 2015 makropoulos et al 2008 they were also built on past trends that informed the scenario growth for instance all scenarios in choi and park 2001 were growth scenarios since they were formulated on the basis of the current situation of the korean water industry and foreign examples of privatization collapse scenarios looked at collapse across several systems increased water scarcity increased conflict amongst water uses waterborne disease increased water costs economic collapse political instability and extensive climate change impacts e g arup 2015 gallopín 2012 iny 2017 makropoulos et al 2008 uwm discipline scenarios often highlighted environmental and social values e g atkins 2013 baki et al 2018 walczykiewicz 2014 the graphene era scenario in atkins 2013 was disciplined around a future where society places a high value on resources and people are motivated to consume sustainably transformational scenarios anticipate and welcome fundamental changes even paradigmatic changes to the system crawford 2019 uwm transformational scenarios had fundamental or paradigm shifting changes within the scenarios claassen et al 2013 kok et al 2011b proskuryakova et al 2018 in kok et al 2011b both policy rules and sustainability eventuality scenarios were transformational since there was a new socio economic paradigm of public private partnerships and this transition is the result of a long term process that starts with strong top down measures kick started by a series of extreme events later accompanied by behavioural change and a new governance structure wild card scenarios were presented in only means et al 2005 and gallopin and rijsberman 2000 these studies had considered surprises within the scenarios see section 4 2 for details 3 3 5 dynamics few uwm studies included trend scenarios present surprise free storylines e g flörke and alcamo 2004 ouyang et al 2004 qingxin et al 2009 compound dynamics were the most common while there were no peripheral scenarios compound scenarios blended trend and peripheral elements e g gallopin and rijsberman 2000 groves et al 2005 lienert et al 2006 loubet et al 2016 in zhi et al 2016 for example the westernizing lifestyles and comprehensive water saving scenario represented the worst case and best case scenario respectively peripheral while the reference scenario represented business as usual trend 3 3 6 validation most uwm studies explicitly stated and used at least one validation technique table 10 plausibility was the most common validation method used wright and cairns 2011 warn that focusing on scenarios to be only plausible can limit exploratory thinking this is because plausibility often aligns with high probability events ramírez and selin 2014 and it is important to consider both normal and crazy events with plausibility schultz and burton 2015 interestingly enough out of the uwm studies that use plausibility as a validation method only means et al 2005 and gallopin and rijsberman 2000 consider both normal and crazy events incorporating shocks and surprises in their scenarios while others did not various methods were used to check for internal consistency methods based on intuitive logistics cross impact balance analysis mathematical simulation fuzzy cognitive mapping fcm were used additionally studies checked for internal consistency by coordinating their work with other on going scenario efforts for instance burek et al 2016 ensured consistent scenarios by coordinating their work with the ipcc 5th assessment report the representative concentration pathways rcps consistent with integrated assessment models iam community few uwm studies explicitly discussed the relevance criterion a quantitative method was described by groves 2005 to identify scenarios that are often more relevant to the decision making process only a couple of uwm studies clearly described novelty for example kok et al 2011b highlighted novel aspects of their methodology which included a broad mix of tools and methods to develop their scenarios transparency or the lack thereof in uwm studies is discussed in detail in 4 1 with regards to model level validation some studies used bootstrapping where the model was compared with real world data and adjusted schütze et al 2019 used out of sample validation techniques with regards to intuition makropoulos et al 2008 said our work is more intuitive in nature and is based on storylines developed from knowledge and expertise eight studies did not mention any validation techniques 3 3 7 variable mixture most uwm scenario studies encompassed interdisciplinary variable mixtures the variable mixtures spanned across multiple domains social demographic environmental economic political and technological as elaborated in section 3 1 8 few uwm studies al jayyousi 2003 allouche et al 2008 choi and park 2001 van duuren et al 2019 had intradisciplinary variables and all these studies explored the policy impact on a designated population and area for example al jayyousi 2003 investigated the experience of a private public partnership in the management of domestic water in amman jordan though limited in scope some intradisciplinary scenarios were highly elaborative allouche et al 2008 van duuren et al 2019 while others were comprised of no more than one or two paragraphs al jayyousi 2003 choi and park 2001 3 3 8 variable types a small proportion of uwm studies identified critical uncertainties table 11 some of the more common examples were uncertainties surrounding consumer behaviour water technology development political landscape development and water policies other studies did not classify uncertainties as critical or predetermined but applied different ranking methods with stakeholders to identify and rank uncertainties claassen et al 2013 lienert et al 2006 lienert et al 2015 for instance claassen et al 2013 asked stakeholders to rank the importance and uncertainty of identified driving forces through an online questionnaire on a scale of 1 5 on the other hand gallopin and rijsberman 2000 stated and identified a number of critical uncertainties and reported that some of the forces were invariant over all scenarios and to a large extent predetermined a majority of uwm studies are quite unclear in their discussion of uncertainties table 11 some studies simply stated the existence of uncertainties without elaboration of the types while others did not mention uncertainties at all in a few cases authors reported having undertaken assessment of uncertainties but that assessment was referenced to another document which could not be easily obtained kok et al 2011b rulleau et al 2020 3 3 9 deviation none of the uwm studies identified in this review were limited to purely conventional scenarios the scenarios were either alternative or a combination of conventional and alternative the alternative scenarios had different content and trajectories from each other with few aligning factors between them e g qingxin et al 2009 saraswat et al 2017 shakweer and youssef 2007 the scenarios that had both conventional and alternative characteristics had alternative scenarios with different trajectories but were not so different that they had no aligning factors the scenarios did have considerable overlap for example ercin and hoekstra 2014 presented four scenarios inspired by the ipcc scenarios though the trajectories of the scenarios were different there was considerable overlap between the factors two of them had the same population growth assumption and two others had the same bio energy demand assumption 3 3 10 quantity in terms of the number of scenarios uwm studies had a wide range table 12 many of the publications identified in this review developed three scenarios some had distinct storylines presenting plausible but unrelated futures e g burek et al 2016 lienert et al 2006 a few had one business as usual scenario with two other distinct scenarios gallopin and rijsberman 2000 shakweer and youssef 2007 and others presented a best case worst case and a business as usual scenario the development of four scenarios was also relatively common the most common methods used was the gbn matrix described in 3 3 5 used by several studies e g ercin and hoekstra 2014 iny 2017 and the sri method the sri method begins with a fixed number of scenarios identified as titles to columns in a matrix and the dimensions of the world are then listed in the rows the whole scenario is then elaborated in each column and the differences for a specific domain across the scenarios are elaborated in each row e g groves 2005 kok et al 2011b other methods were also used when developing four scenarios such as designing micro scenarios to generate macro scenarios rulleau et al 2020 cross impact balance analysis along with computer software schütze et al 2019 and developing an integrated model baki et al 2018 3 4 scenario impact this final section looks at the impact of the scenario process crawford 2019 within scenario impact there are four characteristics for which brief definitions are provided in table 13 3 4 1 decision makers in fifteen uwm studies all or some of the practitioners were the final decision makers and hence within the process e g claassen et al 2013 iny 2017 means et al 2005 scenario processes were sometimes attended by practitioners external to the process though ercin and hoekstra 2014 and flörke and alcamo 2004 used no participative methods to create the scenarios practitioners outside the scenario process were the final decision makers similarly choi and park 2001 and baki et al 2018 created the scenarios themselves so the decision makers specified were outside the scenario process a compromise to the two extreme options is a collaboration of representatives from both groups this was the process applied by three uwm studies al jayyousi 2003 arup 2015 shakweer and youssef 2007 in arup 2015 for example the practitioners were primarily experts and employees while the results of the scenario study was aimed towards water sector utilities governments cities communities and any other individuals or organisations interested in the future of urban water in several studies the decision makers were not clearly identified many studies did not explicitly list the practitioners involved in the scenario creation phase see section 3 2 1 which made it difficult to determine the nature of the decision makers e g allouche et al 2008 loubet et al 2016 walczykiewicz 2014 some just stated that the results could be used for future research gallopín 2012 hejazi et al 2014 zhi et al 2016 while others did not identify any decision makers at all groves 2005 ouyang et al 2004 qingxin et al 2009 3 4 2 organisational capacity the capacity for full engagement was present in some studies e g colorado water conservation board 2015 schütze et al 2019 shakweer and youssef 2007 these studies developed scenarios that were later integrated into the organisation s action plan where the stakeholders integrated the information developed during the scenario process into their long term planning in one major project van vliet and kok 2015 the authors acknowledged that because of time constraints in the workshops the scenarios did not reach the level of detail needed to inform water management decision processes thereby in an implicit sense abandoning it however they recommended that for ensuring the implementation of results in policy processes the scenario projects should be linked to on going policy processes in another project burek et al 2016 phase 2 considered supply and demand side measures which the authors stated will be the focus of future reports since there is reference to future implementation at the next stage the efforts are not abandoned but rather selectively adopted however in a majority of uwm studies the organisational capacity was quite unclear either there was no discussion about the level of adoption or recommendations and strategies were suggested without any plan for integration and implementation e g lienert et al 2006 means et al 2005 ouyang et al 2004 studies also did not discuss the organisational capacity when the focus was on the process or on the learning e g allouche et al 2008 gallopín 2012 makropoulos et al 2008 3 4 3 uncertainty strategy the adaptive strategy was used by some uwm studies to deal with dynamic uncertainty claassen et al 2013 proskuryakova and sivaev 2020 for example proskuryakova and sivaev 2020 acknowledged an inability to capture the full range of existing trends and uncertainties concluding that these needed to be reviewed at certain time intervals to maintain currency for static uncertainties different studies approached them differently iny 2017 and atkins 2013 both took the flexibility strategy iny 2017 stated that there were actions that could be taken in the present to be best prepared for all eventualities while atkins 2013 identified no regret pathways that would be beneficial across all plausible planning scenarios on the other hand means iii et al 2005 while identifying the uncertainty in the trends looked at strategies that involved exploring and diversifying their risk response i e hedging some uwm studies used a combination of strategies to mitigate various identified uncertainties for example dawson et al 2018 used an adaptive planning approach to accommodate the uncertainties surrounding changing land use as well as climate change at the same time the authors recognised that they cannot necessarily predict the customer of the future population growth and how technology will be used so they needed to wait and see what happened before deciding i e signposting though kok et al 2011b did not discuss an uncertainty strategy they acknowledged that stakeholders suggested to include signposts in the exploratory scenarios however a majority of uwm studies did not discuss or mention any uncertainty strategy 3 4 4 implementation amongst the uwm studies dawson et al 2018 and colorado water conservation board 2015 had semi structured implementation methods for instance dawson et al 2018 developed a toolkit to support the integration of scenarios into business processes the authors are now using the scenarios to understand the risks of current strategies and plans and resilience test their strategies and plans on the other hand schütze et al 2019 had a more structured implementation approach formulating an action plan lima 2040 which consists of twelve specific measures for water management in lima e g water and climate risk management promoting wastewater treatment and reuse with responsibilities for their implementation clearly assigned to the relevant stakeholders and entities though van vliet and kok 2015 could not focus on implementation due to time constraints the authors did acknowledge its importance and explicitly stated the need to focus on the implementation phase of the scenario process other uwm studies did not have a clear implementation plan since implementation is directly related to organisational capacity crawford 2019 and 27 uwm studies did not have a clearly defined organisational capacity see section 3 4 2 these studies also did not have clearly defined implementation plans 4 discussion and recommendations based on the results of the systematic review and aligning the scenario studies with the dimensions of the csi typology we assessed how thoroughly the authors of uwm studies have addressed aspects of scenario analysis through this process we identified aspects that have not been addressed by many uwm studies and areas that future studies should pay particular attention to in order to undertake a more robust scenario analysis 4 1 lack of transparency in the scenario process transparency is indispensable for both usefulness and credibility durance and godet 2010 it is a key concept of scientific work and is particularly relevant for studies looking to the future cao et al 2016 necessary for a reproducible and valuable scenario study it was clear that uwm scenario studies lacked transparency see fig 2 whether it was little to no detailed information about the active scenario process section 3 2 lack of discussion about uncertainties section 3 3 8 or limited information about the impact phase section 3 4 note that a lack of information about the impact phase could be interpreted as either as a lack of transparency or because of uwm scenario studies ignoring the impact phase see section 4 4 or both the issue of insufficient comprehensibility in scenario studies is not new for example the scenario development process in the special report on emissions scenarios and the shared socioeconomic pathways has been criticised for its lack of reproducibility and comprehensiveness carlsen et al 2017 in their review dong et al 2013 found little documentation of the scenario development process in most cases many scenario studies tend to design or select their scenario approach in an ad hoc manner alcamo and henrichs 2008 oteros rozas et al 2015 with little front end stakeholder engagement when choosing scenario development processes alcamo and henrichs 2008 kok et al 2011b scenario applications in the literature rarely describe the design of the scenario development process or provide a rationale for the methods selected in this review too scenario analysis papers often do not qualify as transparent or at the least remain unclear regarding transparency there could be multiple reasons as to why scenario based assessments are not always transparent one of the reasons could be the scenario methods used a commonly frequented approach for scenario development is the intuitive logics model this method is based on intuitive group thinking which is not very transparent and has problems of reproducibility carlsen et al 2017 another reason could be that the concept of transparency is subjective a documentation that is transparent for some could be untransparent for others depending on the level of technical expertise and skills of the recipient required for understanding complex scenario studies witt 2020 additionally excessive information can cause the opposite of transparency a recipient will need to select the relevant parts from all available information therefore supplying too much information could be counter productive to achieving transparency witt 2020 this lack of transparency risks undermining the level of support offered by the stakeholders as well as the people and institutions who authorize them to act and therefore the legitimacy and ultimate uptake of results kirchhoff et al 2013 kok et al 2011b mauser et al 2013 it also risks limiting the utility of the resulting scenarios to researchers alcamo 2008 and the ability to learn from and build on past practices and modify participatory scenario processes to better achieve their stated objectives oteros rozas et al 2015 scenario based assessments can be made more systematic to ensure transparency by including well defined step by step procedures for construction evaluation and selection of scenarios documenting the above in detail improves transparency allows easier communication and encourages scenario developers to explicitly state the applied techniques and expert judgements dong et al 2013 a systematic documentation method was explored by cao et al 2016 in the application of scenarios for energy models the study aimed at highlighting and mitigating the lack of transparency that existed in energy scenario studies the authors developed transparency criteria based on which a checklist was generated the proposed transparency checklist acts as a tool which enables authors of energy scenario studies to increase the transparency of their work the checklist thus serves as a standardized communication protocol and offers guidance for interpreting these studies this review suggests a similar approach be undertaken for uwm scenario studies the csi typology used in this review aids scholars in exploring the necessary dimensions of scenario interventions framing and capturing the entire scenario process from the start to the end crawford 2019 the csi typology can be used as a transparency checklist for uwm studies as used in this review to guide uwm scenario practitioners along a more logical process to improve the utility and transparency of the scenario process in this context this typology based checklist gives uwm scenario practitioners a summary of important aspects that need to be considered for performing a scenario based analysis the experienced reader benefits from this representation format of transparency criteria because time consuming searching through the document for specific information can be avoided cao et al 2016 4 2 limited use of extreme events and surprises in scenarios the longer the scenarios stretch into the future the more difficult these futures become to describe this is because aspects of the future are emergent and cannot all be known in advance resulting in surprises bennett et al 2021 many authors have pointed to the importance and value of including surprises and discontinuities in scenarios e g read 2014 saritas and smith 2011 toth 2008 van notten et al 2005 if scenario development is going to be instrumental in preparing for the future then discontinuities should be explored to avoid having future shocks catch us off guard unnecessarily van notten et al 2005 such discontinuities can be expected in water systems as well for example the extent and intensity of human impacts on various ecosystems including water systems reduces the capacity of these systems to absorb these impacts leading to unanticipated often non linear behaviour in social ecological systems filbee dexter et al 2017 however uwm scenarios have generally excluded surprises as made evident when aligning the scenarios with the csi typology only means et al 2005 and gallopin and rijsberman 2000 had considered surprises within the scenarios they developed means et al 2005 described a catastrophic event scenario developed by workshop participants where they acknowledge that catastrophic events such as terrorism cannot be predicted but have the potential to significantly affect water utilities though the type of catastrophic events are not detailed within the scenario the authors do discuss strategies to deal with these possible events gallopin and rijsberman 2000 include surprise events across their scenarios including a major drought a flood epidemic outbreak of waterborne diseases the brink of a third world war and an airborne disease that is highly contagious other uwm studies such as rulleau et al 2020 and lienert et al 2006 identified potential wild cards but stopped short of introducing them in the actual scenarios for instance lienert et al 2006 identified future decoupling of drinking water supply and water for firefighting as well as future water supplies requiring greater levels of security against impacts such as terrorist sabotage it has previously been observed that many studies focused on identifying potential surprises or wild cards but stopping short of introducing them into the actual scenarios elsawah et al 2020 the results of this review confirm earlier findings by read 2014 that most scenario exercises are framed to be within the bounds of probable events rather than also exploring plausible but surprising events this reflects the difficulties in trying to explore surprises and discontinuities in scenarios a challenge in including surprises is getting experts or stakeholders to suspend disbelief and focus on low probability potentially high impact events frittaion et al 2010 adding to that challenge is effectively communicating the results of the analysis mahmoud et al 2009 if not communicated sufficiently convincingly surprise scenarios can disparage the entire scenario development process in the eyes of policy makers or stakeholders who may not understand the purpose of scenarios or that scenarios differ from forecasts or predictions read 2014 the methods used to develop scenarios can also limit the ability to include surprises and discontinuities the commonly used two axes approach may trap participants into focusing only on the interplay of two drivers read 2014 surprises are also inherently difficult to represent quantitatively because the mechanisms that give rise to surprise are also challenging to foresee and difficult if not impossible to capture within contemporary modelling capacities planque 2016 there are also minimal structured approaches available to deal with surprises burt 2007 further work is needed on how to deal with surprises in the scenario processes tools that engage creative thinking can be employed to help overcome this constraint including narrative based scenarios bennett et al 2003 reilly and willenbockel 2010 narratives incorporate imagination and are not bounded by knowledge of systemic relationships and other constraints merrie et al 2018 one example of narrative based scenarios is the seeds of good anthropocenes soga project bennett et al 2016 in the soga scenario development method participants develop visions of the future based on existing real world seeds which are existing innovations not yet mainstream that aim to address socio ecological challenges scenario development begins with sets of seeds with participants imagining the outcomes if these seeds were fully mature and mainstream including exploring how different seeds would interact to develop visions of the future bennett et al 2021 the soga project has implemented a range of different methods for scenario creation some of these methods encourage and think about surprises in different ways for example two seeds are combined or mashed up into a novel idea or initiative where challenges related to the anthropocene can be addressed at any point in the process especially to challenge the thinking about surprises pereira et al 2019 other examples include the three horizons approach wildcards live role playing and food policy council game the soga project is a creative narrative based approach to develop scenarios that are more diverse easily incorporate imagination and are not bounded by knowledge of systemic relationships and other constraints merrie et al 2018 4 3 lack of validation efforts plausibility is the most common validation method used in uwm studies however wright and cairns 2011 warn that focusing on scenarios to be only plausible can limit exploratory thinking since plausibility often aligns with high probability events ramírez and selin 2014 and takes away from considering both normal and highly unusual events schultz and burton 2015 at the other end of the spectrum few studies used internal consistency for validation testing for internal consistency is often important for qualitative scenarios that have assumptions about the drivers or variables these assumptions developed by the stakeholders and experts can have underlying biases morgan and keith 2008 and if not tested for internal consistency contradictions can appear hindering their credibility and their usefulness elsawah et al 2020 additionally few uwm studies clearly mention the relevance criterion and novelty criterion transparency or the lack thereof in uwm studies is discussed in detail section 4 1 model level validation techniques have been used in a couple of uwm studies the two categories of validation presented in crawford 2019 encapsulate the main sub categories applicable across virtually all scenario processes however there are multiple other criteria that can validate scenarios and as many tools to analyse each dimension which should not be overlooked bishop et al 2007 any one or a combination of these validation criteria can be used biggs et al 2007 however some uwm studies do not discuss validation at all while others possibly could have included other validation techniques but not explicitly stated it this ties in with the issue of transparency section 4 1 it is necessary to clearly state any and all validation techniques considered in the scenario exercise since audiences tend to focus more on the products than the process assuming that issues of salience relevance and credibility i e validation efforts have been properly addressed in the exercise cash et al 2003 the evolution of scenario planning has shown that some level of internal validation efforts can help practitioners determine the level of understanding that the scenarios can relay to the intended audience crawford 2019 validation aids in reducing many raw scenarios down to a more manageable few validations will largely depend on the chosen method aims and dimensions within the scenarios any discussion on validation should give a nod to the schultz and burton 2015 sentiment that the most important future is the future the greatest number of people believe the most crawford 2019 4 4 limited attention to the impact phase of a scenario process the csi typology added the scenario impact section to extend the scenario process concept from just the planning scoping and developmental stages to include the follow through section 3 4 this section looked at decision makers organisational capacity uncertainty strategy and implementation ensuring that decision makers comprise at least part of the practitioners is important since it ensures that the mental models of the decision makers and those of the practitioners will be well aligned allowing increased adoption of the knowledge gained from the scenario process organisational capacity is integral since a scenario process is as valuable as the level of adoption that the organisation is willing to achieve the inclusion of the uncertainty strategy is necessary since the types of uncertainties inherent in the scenarios will inform the strategy for the organisation implementation of the scenario process is the key in that it measures the organisation s abilities to successfully navigate the unknown future crawford 2019 however in the case of uwm studies there is little to no detailed information about decision makers section 3 4 1 organisational capacity section 3 4 2 uncertainty strategy section 3 4 3 and implementation section 3 4 4 as seen in this review uwm scenario studies often ignore the impact phase of the scenario process this is consistent with previous observations that the interface of scenarios and decision makers is ignored or neglected wack 1985 there is minimal effort invested in most scenario planning literature to understand the impact of a scenario process chermack 2011 this lack of evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of scenario planning makes it difficult to argue for its proposed benefits additionally some aspects of scenario planning are difficult to assess such as how does the team know that they have helped to avoid a catastrophe if they have indeed avoided it as a result most authors have avoided trying to assess scenario projects entirely chermack 2011 the work that emerges from scenario interventions should not stop after producing scenarios but continue with evaluation crawford 2019 trutnevyte et al 2016 xexakis et al 2019 given the costs associated with most scenario planning processes it is a value adds to spend time and resources to evaluate the impact of the scenario process on the organisation assessing scenario planning projects and establishing evidence of its contributions is crucial to understanding and documenting its effects and lends credibility to strategic activities in general chermack 2011 it allows the organisation to track the contribution of the scenario project to individual process and overall organisation performance chermack 2011 as well as be a check for the implemented strategies for example ghazinoory et al 2016 conducted an evaluation of nanotechnology scenarios in iran 10 years after the initial scenarios were implemented in evaluating the scenarios after their implementation the authors observed that iran had actually distanced itself from the scenario path of the identified best case scenario even though the implemented strategies were according to this scenario hence there was a need to revisit and modify the strategies used so that iran s future pathway would be in accordance with the desired best case scenario yet again evaluation of scenario impacts is therefore the key to making the specific scenario analysis effective as well as to improve the scenario methodologies multiple methods have been used to evaluate scenarios some studies provide a methodological evaluation bishop et al 2007 bradfield et al 2005 schoemaker 1993 van notten et al 2003 scenarios can be compared and evaluated according to the decision makers understanding of an organization s characteristics chermack et al 2007 some studies have examined the developed scenarios empirically using lab like experiments chermack et al 2007 schoemaker 1993 furthermore survey methods fleishman et al 2010 and structured interviews trutnevyte et al 2011 are useful tools for evaluating scenarios as the range of evaluation methods increases a theoretical framework should ideally be developed this theoretical framework could be multi dimensional and interdisciplinary and could explore a range of criteria elsawah et al 2020 5 limitations it is important to acknowledge the limitations in this study the first limitation is with the search criteria this review was limited to including only english language texts published between 2000 and 2020 the second limitation was with the selection criteria since the focus of the review was qualitative uwm scenarios there could be inherent biases in the identified gaps and proposed recommendations additionally studies were screened first based on their abstracts and then filtered further based on their content this selection technique led to a natural inclination towards studies with detailed relevant and well written abstracts the third limitation was lack of accessibility not all studies chosen were fully accessible quite a few studies had material that was inaccessible due to reasons such as being written in a different language and not being publicly available this led to the review losing out on potentially relevant studies the final limitation is human error this review was conducted by a single researcher who was primarily responsible for selecting interpreting and analysing the studies hence there was limited cross checking and verification possibly resulting in human bias that could be present in the results of this review 6 conclusion this systematic review explores the necessary dimensions of urban water management scenario assessment we use a comprehensive typology as the theoretical framework to organise existing literature highlight the shortcomings in existing practices and engage in discussions that answered the research questions to arrive at valid questions drawbacks in current practices include lack of transparency in the scenario process exclusion of surprises and extreme events minimal validation efforts and ignoring the impact phase of a scenario process subsequently we propose recommendations to provide a path for future scenario analysis in urban water management and to improve the application of urban water management scenarios recommendations include using structured methods for transparency exploring the inclusion of surprise events in scenarios using validation criteria to assess scenario credibility and highlighting the importance of assessing scenario impacts post workshop this review will be beneficial for those who are looking to use scenario analysis in strategic urban water planning and development in an increasingly uncertain world declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

16293,constantly changing and evolving social economic political and environmental landscapes create new uncertainties in urban water supplies these uncertainties surrounding urban water management have been captured using various scenario analysis techniques which have been developed to envision plausible futures although past review papers have conducted broad reviews on water related issues and water management generally there has been a lack of attention to urban water management specifically the growing uncertainty surrounding urban water management systems necessitates a focused review specifically aimed at the use of scenarios in urban water management using a comprehensive typology a systematic review is presented to empirically investigate the necessary dimensions of urban water management scenario assessment urban water management scenario studies that exclusively employ qualitative methods as well as urban water management studies that employ qualitative methods with quantitative techniques are reviewed against the comprehensive typology by aligning the reviewed scenarios with the dimensions in the typology some important gaps in the current literature were identified the need for i transparency in scenario development and analysis processes ii inclusion of surprises and extreme events iii validation efforts and iv considering the impact phase of a scenario process recommendations are proposed to address the above gaps in current urban water scenarios literature providing a path for future scenario analysis in urban water management uwm urban water management csi typology comprehensive scenario intervention typology keywords scenario analysis urban water management water scenarios typology 1 introduction management of urban water supplies currently faces a range of diverse challenges these include population growth urbanisation climate change volatile global economies increasing energy prices heightened environmental awareness and complex regulatory and social circumstances marlow et al 2010 romano and akhmouch 2019 werbeloff and brown 2011a 2011b the ability of cities to manage these challenges is limited by a range of factors which include the growing uncertainty with respect to operational environmental social and economic constraints blackmore and plant 2008 pearson et al 2009 in circumstances where future uncertainties are high scenario analysis has been applied as a key method for enabling appropriate planning to achieve future objectives kok et al 2011b these techniques aid in exploring a range of diverse and plausible futures reflecting the state of the world at some point in the future and the pathways to move from the present to that projected future börjeson et al 2006 scenario analysis has been widely applied in fields including the business and social domains with a significant application in the environmental domain tourki et al 2013 scenario analysis has a long history in exploring socio environmental futures e g elsawah et al 2020 guivarch et al 2017 rothman 2008 this approach has been extensively used to evaluate issues related to climate change and land use guaita garcía et al 2020 energy use paltsev 2017 food security and agriculture van dijk and meijerink 2014 and biodiversity pereira et al 2010 amongst others scenario analysis has also been applied in the field of urban water management with past studies depicting the usefulness of scenarios to account for uncertainties in the key driving forces that can influence the future of urban water systems e g claassen et al 2013 lienert et al 2015 three studies have reviewed scenario planning used in water related fields these studies reported that scenario analysis in water policy can contribute to robust decision making haasnoot and middelkoop 2012 another key finding was the explicit quantification of uncertainties should be addressed in water scenarios to provide information for more robust decision making dong et al 2013 furthermore an interpretative framework was created to synthesize the use of scenario analysis in water issues march et al 2012 although the studies described above have conducted broad reviews on water related issues and water management generally there has been a lack of attention to urban water management uwm specifically these studies reviewed water scenario literature using a traditional literature review approach dong et al 2013 haasnoot and middelkoop 2012 based on personal and expert experience haasnoot and middelkoop 2012 as well as had the authors develop an analytical framework which they used for their review march et al 2012 in this study however we used both a systematic literature review with an existing theoretical framework and a comprehensive scenario intervention csi typology that sits in broader scenario literature to explore the necessary dimensions of urban water scenario assessment a theoretical framework is the use of a theory in a study that conveys the deepest values of the researcher s and provides a clearly articulated signpost or lens for how the study will process new knowledge theoretical frameworks provide focus and organization to the study connect the study to existing scholarship and terms and identify strengths and weaknesses collins and stockton 2018 by using the csi typology as the theoretical framework for this systematic literature review we were able organise the uwm scenario literature identify the strengths search for negative or discrepant cases in relation to the theory the csi typology in this case engage in discussions that returned to the research questions and finally arrive at reasonable conclusions therefore this study explores the necessary dimensions of uwm scenario assessment particularly focusing on studies that employ qualitative methods as well as studies that employ qualitative methods with quantitative techniques we use a theoretical framework with a systematic review approach to highlight the limitations in existing practices and present suggestions to improve the application of uwm scenarios this paper will be beneficial for those engaged in planning for future urban water development particularly when considering options analysis this review attempts to answer the following research questions 1 what aspects of the scenario process have previous uwm studies incorporated 2 what are the components that have been broadly overlooked and what has been addressed clearly 3 what are the components of the scenario process that have not been described clearly but rather included in a non systematic way 4 what are the gaps identified and how can they be bridged 2 research methods a systematic literature review was performed based on the protocol developed by the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analyses prisma fig 1 moher et al 2009 the final list of 33 studies were then included and characterised using the csi typology developed by crawford 2019 2 1 systematic literature review the search was restricted to peer reviewed english language papers and grey literature including academic theses and unpublished scenario analyses by professional consultants dated between 2000 and 2020 studies that employed purely quantitative methods for scenarios were ineligible since the focus of this study is uwm studies that employ qualitative methods as well as uwm studies that employ qualitative methods with quantitative techniques studies that only included a single driving force for example climate change population growth economic development were ineligible since such studies become a simple factorial analysis rather than a true scenario analysis the analysis and the discussion presented in this paper will strictly follow the csi typology other factors that are not part of the typology but can influence scenarios such as asset management of ageing water infrastructures for example are out of scope for this review the complete selection process was performed independently by one reviewer the first author of this review paper peer reviewed studies were identified by searching compendex engineering village with the search run from 14 september 2020 to 4 november 2020 in addition grey literature was searched on google scholar which involved reading the abstract and introduction section of the documents an advanced topic search was used to identify the studies using the following boolean search string urban water management or urban water resource management or management of urban water resources or water management or water resource management or management of water resources or water use or water demand or water demands or water scarcity or water supply or water supplies or water footprint or water footprints and water future or scenario or futures or story line or storylines or socio economic scenario the keywords used are as given in the string above uwm scenario studies did not explicitly specify the methods they used as qualitative or quantitative using these terms as keywords in the search string would have incorrectly excluded and or included specific studies hence an elaborate manual review of the abstracts was conducted by one reviewer the first author of this review paper to identify the relevant studies that fit the selection criteria a total of 15 159 papers were identified from compendex ten grey literature sources were identified from google scholar and an in depth google search the details of these studies including title and abstract information was downloaded into a ms excel spreadsheet these records were then screened for duplicates after duplicates were removed 8258 studies were screened studies whose primary focus was not relevant to uwm such as those that drafted scenarios for water management in rural areas wetlands etc were screened out following the screening process 175 studies were then assessed for eligibility an in depth review of these studies was conducted to determine their eligibility as stated previously studies with only quantitative scenario methods and those with only a single driving force were ineligible a final list of 33 studies from 49 publications as some studies were divided into more than one paper were identified for this review bibliographic information was imported into endnote x9 a bibliographic database software 2 2 typology used to characterise scenario studies in developing this review uwm scenario studies were characterised using the csi typology developed by crawford 2019 aligning scenarios with the dimensions in a typology produces more credible scenarios resilient to methodological criticisms ducot and lubben 1980 this creates unique scenario profiles while other typologies such as the wilkinson et al 2013 typology and the ducot and lubben 1980 typology offer between four to twenty seven potential profiles the csi typology has the ability to map out more than one million unique profiles crawford 2019 crawford 2019 categorised the csi typology as follows the csi typology is divided into a hierarchy of dimensions the broadest dimensions are sections each section is divided into characteristics each characteristic is further divided into categories some categories are divided into sub categories which are the most focused dimensions of the csi typology depending on the dimensions the relationships between them can be dependant independent interrelated mutually exclusive or unrelated the csi typology is divided into four broad sections with 22 characteristics 91 categories and 30 sub categories p 5 the results presented follow the csi typological dimensions to characterise uwm scenario studies 2 3 characterisation of uwm scenario studies using csi typology each of the selected uwm scenario study was aligned with the typology s dimensions only one coder was involved in coding each scenario study each section of the csi typology was expanded in an excel worksheet where the characteristics of each section were presented as columns and each of the scenario study presented in rows each uwm study was read and analysed in detail and assigned the relevant category and sub category it was possible to have overlap across dimensions all overlaps were considered independently and as part of the analysis studies were classified into all relevant sub categories this resulted in a unique scenario profile for each study an example of a scenario planning profile is given in appendix a using claassen et al 2013 3 results 3 1 project goals this section presents the elements that must be addressed to set the agenda for a scenario process crawford 2019 within project goals there are ten key characteristics for which brief definitions are provided table 1 3 1 1 epistemology cartesian uwm studies explored knowledge about drivers and uncertainties were process focused or learning focused looked at forecasting plausible futures and investigated impacts on urban water e g loubet et al 2016 van duuren et al 2019 walczykiewicz 2014 uwm studies that had a non cartesian approach developed scenarios that became part of government action plans or policy identified a perfect or ideal water future to work towards linked strategy formation with implementation and evaluated policy options e g colorado water conservation board 2015 dawson et al 2018 schütze et al 2019 for example schütze et al 2019 used a transdisciplinary approach for water management combining adaptation and application of methods from hydrology social sciences water engineering and modelling and included stakeholders in this process as a result of this process lima 2040 action plan was developed with specific goals and targets that the main institutions and organisations responsible for the water sector of lima commit themselves to 3 1 2 control most uwm scenario papers took a preactive or proactive approach for instance claassen et al 2013 was preactive as the purpose of the scenario exercise was to determine preferred future outcomes and navigate towards them it was forward looking and the organisation had some control to navigate the external forces without being an active player that can provoke change and design the future on the other hand atkins 2013 was proactive since the author identified no regret pathways strategies that are beneficial across all plausible planning scenarios and can be taken today to prepare for an uncertain tomorrow thereby taking an active role to provoke change and design their future only three scenario studies took a reflexive approach the scenarios developed for colorado water plan were reflexive as they were adaptive in nature and the aim was to constantly revise them according to changing circumstances in both external environment and the internal organisation moving into the future none of the uwm scenario studies took a passive or reactive perspective groves 2005 could not be classified since the scenarios were developed as part of the california water plan and the water plan 2005 update could not be found online 3 1 3 value reality the descriptive approach was the most common amongst uwm studies with both plausible e g claassen et al 2013 van duuren et al 2019 zhi et al 2016 and hypothetical futures e g gallopin and rijsberman 2000 lienert et al 2006 rulleau et al 2020 of these only means et al 2005 and gallopin and rijsberman 2000 had considered surprises within the scenarios ten of the uwm scenarios were normative with both active e g colorado water conservation board 2015 dawson et al 2018 schütze et al 2019 and passive approaches al jayyousi 2003 allouche et al 2008 qingxin et al 2009 for instance schütze et al 2019 had normative active scenarios since they had a clear aim the objective to develop robust plans and strategies for decision making that consider future risks and potentials normative passive scenarios were found in qingxin et al 2009 where different policy scenarios were developed three of the uwm scenarios were dynamic having both descriptive and normative elements for example kok et al 2011b explicitly focused on combining both normative backcasting and explorative scenario approaches the main objective of this paper was to analyse the combination of exploratory and backcasting scenarios 3 1 4 vantage point crawford 2019 states that one of the most common types of forward casting scenarios is likely futures however this was not the case with uwm studies with what if scenarios being the majority by combining quantitative scenario analyses with high impacting high uncertainty driving forces forward casting what if uwm scenarios were used to identify major drivers and uncertainties surrounding uwm systems and to develop strategies to improve resilience in an uncertain future e g choi and park 2001 groves 2005 iny 2017 on the other hand uwm studies with forward casting likely scenarios were drafted using predetermined factors past and current events where the basis for expert deliberations is the historical trends shaping particular internal and external factors affecting the scenario condition of water management was characterized by information on the trends walczykiewicz 2014 of the studies that took the bi directional approach two of them had bi directional hedging scenarios burek et al 2016 van vliet and kok 2015 for example proskuryakova et al 2018 had bi directional selective scenarios the study aimed to backcast necessary strategic steps to reach the visionary future and mitigate the consequences of undesired scenarios in doing so they developed four plausible futures for the russian water sector till 2030 forward casting and then backcast ways to reach the desired nearly perfect future scenario none of the reviewed uwm studies take a backcasting approach 3 1 5 motivation from the publications identified in this review uwm scenarios had both preserving and transforming motivations both quantitative and qualitative measures can be part of the preserving scenario process börjeson et al 2006 uwm preserving scenarios had both quantitative and qualitative approaches e g ercin and hoekstra 2014 qingxin et al 2009 zhi et al 2016 or purely qualitative measures e g al jayyousi 2003 colorado water conservation board 2015 shakweer and youssef 2007 both börjeson et al 2006 and wilkinson and eidinow 2008 consider transforming scenarios to have only backcasting efforts however there were a number of scenario processes that were forward casting with transforming elements e g atkins 2013 baki et al 2018 claassen et al 2013 transforming scenarios are typically qualitative with quantitative elements supporting them börjeson et al 2006 with uwm studies they were either purely qualitative e g arup 2015 means et al 2005 proskuryakova et al 2018 or had both qualitative and quantitative elements e g lienert et al 2015 rulleau et al 2020 since the focus of the review was uwm scenario studies that exclusively employ qualitative methods as well as studies that employ qualitative methods with quantitative techniques there are inherent biases in the reported quantitative measures in this section 3 1 6 application generic uwm scenarios could be used by a wide range of sectors stakeholders organisations countries future research or any of these combinations flörke and alcamo 2004 kamari et al 2008 makropoulos et al 2008 for example kamari et al 2008 developed the water scenarios with a generic use in mind that could be used by pan europe scale regional and pilot area scales alerts policymakers and stakeholders to emerging problems related to water use test their regional and local water plans against uncertainties and surprises on the other hand specific uwm scenarios were used for various purposes one was to test efforts such as the impact of new policies or focus on issues in policy and practice crawford 2019 while van duuren et al 2019 and rulleau et al 2020 tested the impact of new policies such as the impact of decentralised systems in a centralised water supply region in the netherlands and water infrastructure asset management in france scenarios developed for the colorado water plan colorado water conservation board 2015 for water privatisation in korea choi and park 2001 and for investigating the impacts of public private partnerships in jordan al jayyousi 2003 focused on issues in policy and practice other specific uwm scenarios were developed either for a specific region or country e g claassen et al 2013 proskuryakova et al 2018 zhi et al 2016 or for a specific organisation dawson et al 2018 general efforts could also be made initially as groundwork for specific paths later crawford 2019 an example of this can be seen in schütze et al 2019 where the focus was on developing a method for water management that could be adapted specifically to the challenges of other regions 3 1 7 subject the most common subject focus was cross based while others were exclusively issue based out of the cross based studies most were both issue and area based e g saraswat et al 2017 shakweer and youssef 2007 walczykiewicz 2014 while others were issue area and institution based al jayyousi 2003 colorado water conservation board 2015 dawson et al 2018 flörke and alcamo 2004 scenarios focused on concerns from institutions such as sydney water dawson et al 2018 colorado state government colorado water conservation board 2015 european environment agency eea flörke and alcamo 2004 and the water authority of jordan wea and lema al jayyousi 2003 the different geographic areas explored in the scenarios are elaborated in section 3 1 10 3 1 8 variable scale a wide variety of external factors were included in the reviewed uwm studies encompassing social and demographic factors technology environment economy political and water related factors such as organisation and operation of water supply services availability of water resources table 2 some of the common internal variables were staff turnover ability of water sector to attract investments and finances water supply service sector or the consumer experience and water utility or company management a couple of studies included policy variables such as efficient non revenue water control strategy social pressures against liberalisation of water services and water pricing policies an example of multi scale scenarios can be found in al jayyousi 2003 that considered all three variable types the study looked at determining the impact on society from public private partnership ppp policy policy variable in jordan with consideration of financial conditions of water utilities the role of governance in water management internal variable and technology and environmental factors external variables 3 1 9 horizon with uwm scenario studies most studies take a long term horizon approach twenty four studies with five studies with a congruent horizon and one study with a medium term horizon three studies did not clearly present the time horizon choi and park 2001 dawson et al 2018 iny 2017 additionally none of the uwm scenario studies took a short term approach table 3 a mixture of congruent target horizons short to long term were identified in some uwm studies for instance makropoulos et al 2008 considered realistic timelines to reach the final scenarios from the current situation in congruent time horizons of 10 25 and 50 year intervals more assumptions were made for the long term horizons 25 and 50 years than the short term horizons other publications considered a base year for modelling and examined the outputs from the modelling for congruent time horizons spanning from short and long term horizons hejazi et al 2014 loubet et al 2016 ouyang et al 2004 zhi et al 2016 3 1 10 geographic scope in this review a range of geographic scopes were identified these included studies that looked at regional local global national supranational and overlapping geographic scopes as summarised in table 4 3 2 process design the components of the active scenario process are divided into specific characteristics crawford 2019 within process design there are six key characteristics for which brief definitions are provided in table 5 3 2 1 practitioners a wide range of practitioners were engaged in uwm scenario studies while some studies that conducted workshops explicitly mentioned engaging facilitators others did not and so it was unclear if facilitators were engaged in these studies e g dawson et al 2018 gallopin and rijsberman 2000 proskuryakova et al 2018 rulleau et al 2020 few studies engaged problem owners and employees table 6 with regards to experts more remarkable people than in house experts are recruited remarkable people are especially important since they come from outside the organisation and can bring external perspectives to the process lindgren and bandhold 2003 challenging business as usual thinking crawford 2019 stakeholders engaged in uwm studies included government representatives ngos researchers and managers only a couple of studies recruited community members in the scenario process table 6 interestingly some uwm studies did not talk about the scenario process in detail with little to no detailed information about the practitioners recruited in some cases a generic list of participants was given with no details about them e g loubet et al 2016 tramberend et al 2015 the information was not available to the public groves 2005 rulleau et al 2020 or the practitioners only identified the driving forces but did not construct the scenarios al jayyousi 2003 gallopín 2012 it is possible that these studies had limitations on what could be legitimately reported back to the public and made accessible freely which led to little detail reported within the study 3 2 2 groups several uwm studies had a heterogenous group of practitioners with a mix of representatives from ngos municipalities and government institutions water utilities water professionals community members and researchers other studies had practitioner groups comprised only of experts in the water industry or the authors themselves created the scenarios and hence were classified as homogenous however eight studies reported little to no information about the scenario process so details about the practitioner groups involved were not given table 7 presents the breakdown of studies and the respective groups 3 2 3 data purely quantitative data was used by some studies these studies used system dynamics models baki et al 2018 ouyang et al 2004 qingxin et al 2009 a few used existing models such as gcam hejazi et al 2014 and watergap flörke and alcamo 2004 while others created their own models see section 3 2 4 for details qualitative approaches were used by other studies focusing on expert judgements stakeholder discussions workshops interviews and other techniques eleven uwm studies used complimenting approaches where qualitative information such as results from interviews workshops and discussions were used to create the story and these narratives were translated into quantitative inputs for models e g choi and park 2001 saraswat et al 2017 schütze et al 2019 few studies did not clearly discuss the data methods allouche et al 2008 simply stated that there were partners involved loubet et al 2016 had helpful discussions atkins 2013 engaged with senior members while makropoulos et al 2008 did not mention data methods at all 3 2 4 data collection data collection in uwm studies included participatory methods such as surveys interviews workshops roundtables and seminars a commonly used desk research approach was dynamic modelling where models produced a snapshot of current or future states other studies developed their own models ercin and hoekstra 2014 used the water footprint assessment manual hoekstra et al 2011 to develop a simplified model to calculate water footprints and groves 2005 developed a model to forecast future water demand in california existing models were modified and used by zhi et al 2016 and hejazi et al 2014 literature research was also used as a desk research method blended methods of data collection combined literature research with qualitative participatory methods dynamic modelling with participatory methods or combined modelling with literature research and participatory methods examples of blended methods of data collection where quantitative modelling is used along with creative narratives of plausible futures is illustrated in kamari et al 2008 the authors used desk research methods to assemble readily available information on drivers and policies with qualitative participatory scenario panels these scenarios were then fed into a quantitative water availability model see table 8 for data collection methods used by the different uwm scenario studies 3 2 5 resources extensive resources in uwm studies meant there were multiple rounds of participatory approaches along with a sustained number of practitioners over the sessions e g claassen et al 2013 lienert et al 2015 rulleau et al 2020 for instance rulleau et al 2020 had 22 people in their foresight group who attended four one day workshops over a four month period three studies had a complex profile of resources hejazi et al 2014 and flörke and alcamo 2004 had no participatory methods but had extensive model development efforts on the other hand means et al 2005 had multiple rounds of participatory approaches but lacked sustained number of practitioners over the sessions with 41 participants for the workshops but only eight participants for interviews however 19 studies provided little to no detailed information about the participatory methods the participants and or the modelling process used making it difficult to gauge the available resources the study had access to 3 2 6 institutional conditions open conditions could be found in the scenario process for the colorado water conservation board 2015 and lienert et al 2006 scenarios were developed as part of the colorado water plan colorado water conservation board 2015 where the colorado water conservation board reviewed and responded to over 30 000 comments from all interest groups for consideration in the final plan lienert et al 2006 conducted expert interviews in which they reported that the interviewees were allowed to speak as freely as possible structured conditions in uwm scenarios studies revolve around two key processes the first is when studies had an initial pre process with just the main scenario panel or the scenario panel and stakeholders and determined the uncertainties drivers and objectives that helped to later craft plausible future scenarios claassen et al 2013 means et al 2005 proskuryakova et al 2018 rulleau et al 2020 schütze et al 2019 shakweer and youssef 2007 the second process was to use an existing set of scenarios as a starting point and adapt the scenarios according to the study s objectives ercin and hoekstra 2014 kok et al 2011b walczykiewicz 2014 for example ercin and hoekstra 2014 used the 2 2 matrix system of intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc scenarios as a starting point and developed detailed assumptions specific for their study however there were no details regarding the institutional conditions in 21 uwm studies 3 3 scenario content this section looks at both the individual scenario as well as the relationship between multiple scenarios crawford 2019 within scenario content there are ten key characteristics for which brief definitions are provided in table 9 3 3 1 temporal nature chain scenarios in uwm studies presented continuous storylines that showed relationships and developments between the variables e g atkins 2013 shakweer and youssef 2007 walczykiewicz 2014 the scenario storyline in choi and park 2001 for example had one event follow the other therefore the existing water authorities be financially independent from the central government the central government will do is to establish regional water management committees a water management committee can be established as a regulatory organization uwm snapshot scenarios followed the general format of an in depth description of water stakes for example water footprint water infrastructure systems water sector in a specific geographic region at a specified horizon ercin and hoekstra 2014 groves 2005 hejazi et al 2014 for instance van duuren et al 2019 presented a comprehensive view of the impact of decentralised systems on centralised water supply regime at a single point in time in 2050 varied uwm scenarios either focused on the end state with some level of implicit discussion of the path to the end state e g lienert et al 2006 loubet et al 2016 schütze et al 2019 or had each of their scenarios occurring at different points in time e g makropoulos et al 2008 qingxin et al 2009 saraswat et al 2017 for instance makropoulos et al 2008 demonstrated a zoom in approach for their scenarios for 10 25 and 50 year intervals 3 3 2 complexity there was no explicit cut off number of variables beyond which a study was considered to be of high complexity instead studies were evaluated based on the complexity of the variable definition and interconnectedness low complexity uwm scenarios had fewer variables and simplistic storylines within the scenarios e g al jayyousi 2003 baki et al 2018 dawson et al 2018 for instance in the scenarios presented by dawson et al 2018 there were only five factors considered and the scenarios themselves were simplistic with minimal interplay between the variables on the other hand high complexity scenarios usually had elaborate development of relationships between variables across multiple disciplines atkins 2013 claassen et al 2013 proskuryakova et al 2018 for example claassen et al 2013 considered 27 variables and the scenarios were described in detail with high interconnectedness between these variables in a few uwm studies it was hard to determine the complexity since the storyline was not present in detail and hence was categorised as unclear additionally the choice of not having an explicit cut off number of variables for high complexity studies became apparent when we considered groves 2005 and arup 2015 the former discussed simple interactions between thirteen variables and hence was marked to be of low complexity while the latter had only eight variables but they were sophisticated and interconnected warranting the study to be of high complexity 3 3 3 integration with high integration scenarios there was clear interconnectedness within the storyline with the variables in the scenarios unified in an interdisciplinary manner across relevant social economic environmental and institutional domains van notten et al 2003 for example atkins 2013 explored the interconnectedness between interdisciplinary variables while elaborating a graphene era future scenario exposure to extreme weather events in the uk because of climate change environmental domain has led to increased water restrictions this in turn increased public awareness social domain of water consumption and reinforced the government s commitment political domain to protecting the environment government encourages investment economic domain in clean technologies technological domain on the other hand uwm studies with a low level of integration had little interconnectedness between the variables and within the storyline for instance within each scenario in van duuren et al 2019 the variables in different domains social environmental etc had little to no inter play between them changes in one variable did not produce an effect on the other variable and they were all independent of each other 3 3 4 theme a wide range and mix of future images were included in uwm scenario studies with studies often containing more than one future image growth collapse and discipline scenarios were the most common uwm growth scenarios had growing populations economic developments and technological advances e g gallopin and rijsberman 2000 lienert et al 2015 makropoulos et al 2008 they were also built on past trends that informed the scenario growth for instance all scenarios in choi and park 2001 were growth scenarios since they were formulated on the basis of the current situation of the korean water industry and foreign examples of privatization collapse scenarios looked at collapse across several systems increased water scarcity increased conflict amongst water uses waterborne disease increased water costs economic collapse political instability and extensive climate change impacts e g arup 2015 gallopín 2012 iny 2017 makropoulos et al 2008 uwm discipline scenarios often highlighted environmental and social values e g atkins 2013 baki et al 2018 walczykiewicz 2014 the graphene era scenario in atkins 2013 was disciplined around a future where society places a high value on resources and people are motivated to consume sustainably transformational scenarios anticipate and welcome fundamental changes even paradigmatic changes to the system crawford 2019 uwm transformational scenarios had fundamental or paradigm shifting changes within the scenarios claassen et al 2013 kok et al 2011b proskuryakova et al 2018 in kok et al 2011b both policy rules and sustainability eventuality scenarios were transformational since there was a new socio economic paradigm of public private partnerships and this transition is the result of a long term process that starts with strong top down measures kick started by a series of extreme events later accompanied by behavioural change and a new governance structure wild card scenarios were presented in only means et al 2005 and gallopin and rijsberman 2000 these studies had considered surprises within the scenarios see section 4 2 for details 3 3 5 dynamics few uwm studies included trend scenarios present surprise free storylines e g flörke and alcamo 2004 ouyang et al 2004 qingxin et al 2009 compound dynamics were the most common while there were no peripheral scenarios compound scenarios blended trend and peripheral elements e g gallopin and rijsberman 2000 groves et al 2005 lienert et al 2006 loubet et al 2016 in zhi et al 2016 for example the westernizing lifestyles and comprehensive water saving scenario represented the worst case and best case scenario respectively peripheral while the reference scenario represented business as usual trend 3 3 6 validation most uwm studies explicitly stated and used at least one validation technique table 10 plausibility was the most common validation method used wright and cairns 2011 warn that focusing on scenarios to be only plausible can limit exploratory thinking this is because plausibility often aligns with high probability events ramírez and selin 2014 and it is important to consider both normal and crazy events with plausibility schultz and burton 2015 interestingly enough out of the uwm studies that use plausibility as a validation method only means et al 2005 and gallopin and rijsberman 2000 consider both normal and crazy events incorporating shocks and surprises in their scenarios while others did not various methods were used to check for internal consistency methods based on intuitive logistics cross impact balance analysis mathematical simulation fuzzy cognitive mapping fcm were used additionally studies checked for internal consistency by coordinating their work with other on going scenario efforts for instance burek et al 2016 ensured consistent scenarios by coordinating their work with the ipcc 5th assessment report the representative concentration pathways rcps consistent with integrated assessment models iam community few uwm studies explicitly discussed the relevance criterion a quantitative method was described by groves 2005 to identify scenarios that are often more relevant to the decision making process only a couple of uwm studies clearly described novelty for example kok et al 2011b highlighted novel aspects of their methodology which included a broad mix of tools and methods to develop their scenarios transparency or the lack thereof in uwm studies is discussed in detail in 4 1 with regards to model level validation some studies used bootstrapping where the model was compared with real world data and adjusted schütze et al 2019 used out of sample validation techniques with regards to intuition makropoulos et al 2008 said our work is more intuitive in nature and is based on storylines developed from knowledge and expertise eight studies did not mention any validation techniques 3 3 7 variable mixture most uwm scenario studies encompassed interdisciplinary variable mixtures the variable mixtures spanned across multiple domains social demographic environmental economic political and technological as elaborated in section 3 1 8 few uwm studies al jayyousi 2003 allouche et al 2008 choi and park 2001 van duuren et al 2019 had intradisciplinary variables and all these studies explored the policy impact on a designated population and area for example al jayyousi 2003 investigated the experience of a private public partnership in the management of domestic water in amman jordan though limited in scope some intradisciplinary scenarios were highly elaborative allouche et al 2008 van duuren et al 2019 while others were comprised of no more than one or two paragraphs al jayyousi 2003 choi and park 2001 3 3 8 variable types a small proportion of uwm studies identified critical uncertainties table 11 some of the more common examples were uncertainties surrounding consumer behaviour water technology development political landscape development and water policies other studies did not classify uncertainties as critical or predetermined but applied different ranking methods with stakeholders to identify and rank uncertainties claassen et al 2013 lienert et al 2006 lienert et al 2015 for instance claassen et al 2013 asked stakeholders to rank the importance and uncertainty of identified driving forces through an online questionnaire on a scale of 1 5 on the other hand gallopin and rijsberman 2000 stated and identified a number of critical uncertainties and reported that some of the forces were invariant over all scenarios and to a large extent predetermined a majority of uwm studies are quite unclear in their discussion of uncertainties table 11 some studies simply stated the existence of uncertainties without elaboration of the types while others did not mention uncertainties at all in a few cases authors reported having undertaken assessment of uncertainties but that assessment was referenced to another document which could not be easily obtained kok et al 2011b rulleau et al 2020 3 3 9 deviation none of the uwm studies identified in this review were limited to purely conventional scenarios the scenarios were either alternative or a combination of conventional and alternative the alternative scenarios had different content and trajectories from each other with few aligning factors between them e g qingxin et al 2009 saraswat et al 2017 shakweer and youssef 2007 the scenarios that had both conventional and alternative characteristics had alternative scenarios with different trajectories but were not so different that they had no aligning factors the scenarios did have considerable overlap for example ercin and hoekstra 2014 presented four scenarios inspired by the ipcc scenarios though the trajectories of the scenarios were different there was considerable overlap between the factors two of them had the same population growth assumption and two others had the same bio energy demand assumption 3 3 10 quantity in terms of the number of scenarios uwm studies had a wide range table 12 many of the publications identified in this review developed three scenarios some had distinct storylines presenting plausible but unrelated futures e g burek et al 2016 lienert et al 2006 a few had one business as usual scenario with two other distinct scenarios gallopin and rijsberman 2000 shakweer and youssef 2007 and others presented a best case worst case and a business as usual scenario the development of four scenarios was also relatively common the most common methods used was the gbn matrix described in 3 3 5 used by several studies e g ercin and hoekstra 2014 iny 2017 and the sri method the sri method begins with a fixed number of scenarios identified as titles to columns in a matrix and the dimensions of the world are then listed in the rows the whole scenario is then elaborated in each column and the differences for a specific domain across the scenarios are elaborated in each row e g groves 2005 kok et al 2011b other methods were also used when developing four scenarios such as designing micro scenarios to generate macro scenarios rulleau et al 2020 cross impact balance analysis along with computer software schütze et al 2019 and developing an integrated model baki et al 2018 3 4 scenario impact this final section looks at the impact of the scenario process crawford 2019 within scenario impact there are four characteristics for which brief definitions are provided in table 13 3 4 1 decision makers in fifteen uwm studies all or some of the practitioners were the final decision makers and hence within the process e g claassen et al 2013 iny 2017 means et al 2005 scenario processes were sometimes attended by practitioners external to the process though ercin and hoekstra 2014 and flörke and alcamo 2004 used no participative methods to create the scenarios practitioners outside the scenario process were the final decision makers similarly choi and park 2001 and baki et al 2018 created the scenarios themselves so the decision makers specified were outside the scenario process a compromise to the two extreme options is a collaboration of representatives from both groups this was the process applied by three uwm studies al jayyousi 2003 arup 2015 shakweer and youssef 2007 in arup 2015 for example the practitioners were primarily experts and employees while the results of the scenario study was aimed towards water sector utilities governments cities communities and any other individuals or organisations interested in the future of urban water in several studies the decision makers were not clearly identified many studies did not explicitly list the practitioners involved in the scenario creation phase see section 3 2 1 which made it difficult to determine the nature of the decision makers e g allouche et al 2008 loubet et al 2016 walczykiewicz 2014 some just stated that the results could be used for future research gallopín 2012 hejazi et al 2014 zhi et al 2016 while others did not identify any decision makers at all groves 2005 ouyang et al 2004 qingxin et al 2009 3 4 2 organisational capacity the capacity for full engagement was present in some studies e g colorado water conservation board 2015 schütze et al 2019 shakweer and youssef 2007 these studies developed scenarios that were later integrated into the organisation s action plan where the stakeholders integrated the information developed during the scenario process into their long term planning in one major project van vliet and kok 2015 the authors acknowledged that because of time constraints in the workshops the scenarios did not reach the level of detail needed to inform water management decision processes thereby in an implicit sense abandoning it however they recommended that for ensuring the implementation of results in policy processes the scenario projects should be linked to on going policy processes in another project burek et al 2016 phase 2 considered supply and demand side measures which the authors stated will be the focus of future reports since there is reference to future implementation at the next stage the efforts are not abandoned but rather selectively adopted however in a majority of uwm studies the organisational capacity was quite unclear either there was no discussion about the level of adoption or recommendations and strategies were suggested without any plan for integration and implementation e g lienert et al 2006 means et al 2005 ouyang et al 2004 studies also did not discuss the organisational capacity when the focus was on the process or on the learning e g allouche et al 2008 gallopín 2012 makropoulos et al 2008 3 4 3 uncertainty strategy the adaptive strategy was used by some uwm studies to deal with dynamic uncertainty claassen et al 2013 proskuryakova and sivaev 2020 for example proskuryakova and sivaev 2020 acknowledged an inability to capture the full range of existing trends and uncertainties concluding that these needed to be reviewed at certain time intervals to maintain currency for static uncertainties different studies approached them differently iny 2017 and atkins 2013 both took the flexibility strategy iny 2017 stated that there were actions that could be taken in the present to be best prepared for all eventualities while atkins 2013 identified no regret pathways that would be beneficial across all plausible planning scenarios on the other hand means iii et al 2005 while identifying the uncertainty in the trends looked at strategies that involved exploring and diversifying their risk response i e hedging some uwm studies used a combination of strategies to mitigate various identified uncertainties for example dawson et al 2018 used an adaptive planning approach to accommodate the uncertainties surrounding changing land use as well as climate change at the same time the authors recognised that they cannot necessarily predict the customer of the future population growth and how technology will be used so they needed to wait and see what happened before deciding i e signposting though kok et al 2011b did not discuss an uncertainty strategy they acknowledged that stakeholders suggested to include signposts in the exploratory scenarios however a majority of uwm studies did not discuss or mention any uncertainty strategy 3 4 4 implementation amongst the uwm studies dawson et al 2018 and colorado water conservation board 2015 had semi structured implementation methods for instance dawson et al 2018 developed a toolkit to support the integration of scenarios into business processes the authors are now using the scenarios to understand the risks of current strategies and plans and resilience test their strategies and plans on the other hand schütze et al 2019 had a more structured implementation approach formulating an action plan lima 2040 which consists of twelve specific measures for water management in lima e g water and climate risk management promoting wastewater treatment and reuse with responsibilities for their implementation clearly assigned to the relevant stakeholders and entities though van vliet and kok 2015 could not focus on implementation due to time constraints the authors did acknowledge its importance and explicitly stated the need to focus on the implementation phase of the scenario process other uwm studies did not have a clear implementation plan since implementation is directly related to organisational capacity crawford 2019 and 27 uwm studies did not have a clearly defined organisational capacity see section 3 4 2 these studies also did not have clearly defined implementation plans 4 discussion and recommendations based on the results of the systematic review and aligning the scenario studies with the dimensions of the csi typology we assessed how thoroughly the authors of uwm studies have addressed aspects of scenario analysis through this process we identified aspects that have not been addressed by many uwm studies and areas that future studies should pay particular attention to in order to undertake a more robust scenario analysis 4 1 lack of transparency in the scenario process transparency is indispensable for both usefulness and credibility durance and godet 2010 it is a key concept of scientific work and is particularly relevant for studies looking to the future cao et al 2016 necessary for a reproducible and valuable scenario study it was clear that uwm scenario studies lacked transparency see fig 2 whether it was little to no detailed information about the active scenario process section 3 2 lack of discussion about uncertainties section 3 3 8 or limited information about the impact phase section 3 4 note that a lack of information about the impact phase could be interpreted as either as a lack of transparency or because of uwm scenario studies ignoring the impact phase see section 4 4 or both the issue of insufficient comprehensibility in scenario studies is not new for example the scenario development process in the special report on emissions scenarios and the shared socioeconomic pathways has been criticised for its lack of reproducibility and comprehensiveness carlsen et al 2017 in their review dong et al 2013 found little documentation of the scenario development process in most cases many scenario studies tend to design or select their scenario approach in an ad hoc manner alcamo and henrichs 2008 oteros rozas et al 2015 with little front end stakeholder engagement when choosing scenario development processes alcamo and henrichs 2008 kok et al 2011b scenario applications in the literature rarely describe the design of the scenario development process or provide a rationale for the methods selected in this review too scenario analysis papers often do not qualify as transparent or at the least remain unclear regarding transparency there could be multiple reasons as to why scenario based assessments are not always transparent one of the reasons could be the scenario methods used a commonly frequented approach for scenario development is the intuitive logics model this method is based on intuitive group thinking which is not very transparent and has problems of reproducibility carlsen et al 2017 another reason could be that the concept of transparency is subjective a documentation that is transparent for some could be untransparent for others depending on the level of technical expertise and skills of the recipient required for understanding complex scenario studies witt 2020 additionally excessive information can cause the opposite of transparency a recipient will need to select the relevant parts from all available information therefore supplying too much information could be counter productive to achieving transparency witt 2020 this lack of transparency risks undermining the level of support offered by the stakeholders as well as the people and institutions who authorize them to act and therefore the legitimacy and ultimate uptake of results kirchhoff et al 2013 kok et al 2011b mauser et al 2013 it also risks limiting the utility of the resulting scenarios to researchers alcamo 2008 and the ability to learn from and build on past practices and modify participatory scenario processes to better achieve their stated objectives oteros rozas et al 2015 scenario based assessments can be made more systematic to ensure transparency by including well defined step by step procedures for construction evaluation and selection of scenarios documenting the above in detail improves transparency allows easier communication and encourages scenario developers to explicitly state the applied techniques and expert judgements dong et al 2013 a systematic documentation method was explored by cao et al 2016 in the application of scenarios for energy models the study aimed at highlighting and mitigating the lack of transparency that existed in energy scenario studies the authors developed transparency criteria based on which a checklist was generated the proposed transparency checklist acts as a tool which enables authors of energy scenario studies to increase the transparency of their work the checklist thus serves as a standardized communication protocol and offers guidance for interpreting these studies this review suggests a similar approach be undertaken for uwm scenario studies the csi typology used in this review aids scholars in exploring the necessary dimensions of scenario interventions framing and capturing the entire scenario process from the start to the end crawford 2019 the csi typology can be used as a transparency checklist for uwm studies as used in this review to guide uwm scenario practitioners along a more logical process to improve the utility and transparency of the scenario process in this context this typology based checklist gives uwm scenario practitioners a summary of important aspects that need to be considered for performing a scenario based analysis the experienced reader benefits from this representation format of transparency criteria because time consuming searching through the document for specific information can be avoided cao et al 2016 4 2 limited use of extreme events and surprises in scenarios the longer the scenarios stretch into the future the more difficult these futures become to describe this is because aspects of the future are emergent and cannot all be known in advance resulting in surprises bennett et al 2021 many authors have pointed to the importance and value of including surprises and discontinuities in scenarios e g read 2014 saritas and smith 2011 toth 2008 van notten et al 2005 if scenario development is going to be instrumental in preparing for the future then discontinuities should be explored to avoid having future shocks catch us off guard unnecessarily van notten et al 2005 such discontinuities can be expected in water systems as well for example the extent and intensity of human impacts on various ecosystems including water systems reduces the capacity of these systems to absorb these impacts leading to unanticipated often non linear behaviour in social ecological systems filbee dexter et al 2017 however uwm scenarios have generally excluded surprises as made evident when aligning the scenarios with the csi typology only means et al 2005 and gallopin and rijsberman 2000 had considered surprises within the scenarios they developed means et al 2005 described a catastrophic event scenario developed by workshop participants where they acknowledge that catastrophic events such as terrorism cannot be predicted but have the potential to significantly affect water utilities though the type of catastrophic events are not detailed within the scenario the authors do discuss strategies to deal with these possible events gallopin and rijsberman 2000 include surprise events across their scenarios including a major drought a flood epidemic outbreak of waterborne diseases the brink of a third world war and an airborne disease that is highly contagious other uwm studies such as rulleau et al 2020 and lienert et al 2006 identified potential wild cards but stopped short of introducing them in the actual scenarios for instance lienert et al 2006 identified future decoupling of drinking water supply and water for firefighting as well as future water supplies requiring greater levels of security against impacts such as terrorist sabotage it has previously been observed that many studies focused on identifying potential surprises or wild cards but stopping short of introducing them into the actual scenarios elsawah et al 2020 the results of this review confirm earlier findings by read 2014 that most scenario exercises are framed to be within the bounds of probable events rather than also exploring plausible but surprising events this reflects the difficulties in trying to explore surprises and discontinuities in scenarios a challenge in including surprises is getting experts or stakeholders to suspend disbelief and focus on low probability potentially high impact events frittaion et al 2010 adding to that challenge is effectively communicating the results of the analysis mahmoud et al 2009 if not communicated sufficiently convincingly surprise scenarios can disparage the entire scenario development process in the eyes of policy makers or stakeholders who may not understand the purpose of scenarios or that scenarios differ from forecasts or predictions read 2014 the methods used to develop scenarios can also limit the ability to include surprises and discontinuities the commonly used two axes approach may trap participants into focusing only on the interplay of two drivers read 2014 surprises are also inherently difficult to represent quantitatively because the mechanisms that give rise to surprise are also challenging to foresee and difficult if not impossible to capture within contemporary modelling capacities planque 2016 there are also minimal structured approaches available to deal with surprises burt 2007 further work is needed on how to deal with surprises in the scenario processes tools that engage creative thinking can be employed to help overcome this constraint including narrative based scenarios bennett et al 2003 reilly and willenbockel 2010 narratives incorporate imagination and are not bounded by knowledge of systemic relationships and other constraints merrie et al 2018 one example of narrative based scenarios is the seeds of good anthropocenes soga project bennett et al 2016 in the soga scenario development method participants develop visions of the future based on existing real world seeds which are existing innovations not yet mainstream that aim to address socio ecological challenges scenario development begins with sets of seeds with participants imagining the outcomes if these seeds were fully mature and mainstream including exploring how different seeds would interact to develop visions of the future bennett et al 2021 the soga project has implemented a range of different methods for scenario creation some of these methods encourage and think about surprises in different ways for example two seeds are combined or mashed up into a novel idea or initiative where challenges related to the anthropocene can be addressed at any point in the process especially to challenge the thinking about surprises pereira et al 2019 other examples include the three horizons approach wildcards live role playing and food policy council game the soga project is a creative narrative based approach to develop scenarios that are more diverse easily incorporate imagination and are not bounded by knowledge of systemic relationships and other constraints merrie et al 2018 4 3 lack of validation efforts plausibility is the most common validation method used in uwm studies however wright and cairns 2011 warn that focusing on scenarios to be only plausible can limit exploratory thinking since plausibility often aligns with high probability events ramírez and selin 2014 and takes away from considering both normal and highly unusual events schultz and burton 2015 at the other end of the spectrum few studies used internal consistency for validation testing for internal consistency is often important for qualitative scenarios that have assumptions about the drivers or variables these assumptions developed by the stakeholders and experts can have underlying biases morgan and keith 2008 and if not tested for internal consistency contradictions can appear hindering their credibility and their usefulness elsawah et al 2020 additionally few uwm studies clearly mention the relevance criterion and novelty criterion transparency or the lack thereof in uwm studies is discussed in detail section 4 1 model level validation techniques have been used in a couple of uwm studies the two categories of validation presented in crawford 2019 encapsulate the main sub categories applicable across virtually all scenario processes however there are multiple other criteria that can validate scenarios and as many tools to analyse each dimension which should not be overlooked bishop et al 2007 any one or a combination of these validation criteria can be used biggs et al 2007 however some uwm studies do not discuss validation at all while others possibly could have included other validation techniques but not explicitly stated it this ties in with the issue of transparency section 4 1 it is necessary to clearly state any and all validation techniques considered in the scenario exercise since audiences tend to focus more on the products than the process assuming that issues of salience relevance and credibility i e validation efforts have been properly addressed in the exercise cash et al 2003 the evolution of scenario planning has shown that some level of internal validation efforts can help practitioners determine the level of understanding that the scenarios can relay to the intended audience crawford 2019 validation aids in reducing many raw scenarios down to a more manageable few validations will largely depend on the chosen method aims and dimensions within the scenarios any discussion on validation should give a nod to the schultz and burton 2015 sentiment that the most important future is the future the greatest number of people believe the most crawford 2019 4 4 limited attention to the impact phase of a scenario process the csi typology added the scenario impact section to extend the scenario process concept from just the planning scoping and developmental stages to include the follow through section 3 4 this section looked at decision makers organisational capacity uncertainty strategy and implementation ensuring that decision makers comprise at least part of the practitioners is important since it ensures that the mental models of the decision makers and those of the practitioners will be well aligned allowing increased adoption of the knowledge gained from the scenario process organisational capacity is integral since a scenario process is as valuable as the level of adoption that the organisation is willing to achieve the inclusion of the uncertainty strategy is necessary since the types of uncertainties inherent in the scenarios will inform the strategy for the organisation implementation of the scenario process is the key in that it measures the organisation s abilities to successfully navigate the unknown future crawford 2019 however in the case of uwm studies there is little to no detailed information about decision makers section 3 4 1 organisational capacity section 3 4 2 uncertainty strategy section 3 4 3 and implementation section 3 4 4 as seen in this review uwm scenario studies often ignore the impact phase of the scenario process this is consistent with previous observations that the interface of scenarios and decision makers is ignored or neglected wack 1985 there is minimal effort invested in most scenario planning literature to understand the impact of a scenario process chermack 2011 this lack of evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of scenario planning makes it difficult to argue for its proposed benefits additionally some aspects of scenario planning are difficult to assess such as how does the team know that they have helped to avoid a catastrophe if they have indeed avoided it as a result most authors have avoided trying to assess scenario projects entirely chermack 2011 the work that emerges from scenario interventions should not stop after producing scenarios but continue with evaluation crawford 2019 trutnevyte et al 2016 xexakis et al 2019 given the costs associated with most scenario planning processes it is a value adds to spend time and resources to evaluate the impact of the scenario process on the organisation assessing scenario planning projects and establishing evidence of its contributions is crucial to understanding and documenting its effects and lends credibility to strategic activities in general chermack 2011 it allows the organisation to track the contribution of the scenario project to individual process and overall organisation performance chermack 2011 as well as be a check for the implemented strategies for example ghazinoory et al 2016 conducted an evaluation of nanotechnology scenarios in iran 10 years after the initial scenarios were implemented in evaluating the scenarios after their implementation the authors observed that iran had actually distanced itself from the scenario path of the identified best case scenario even though the implemented strategies were according to this scenario hence there was a need to revisit and modify the strategies used so that iran s future pathway would be in accordance with the desired best case scenario yet again evaluation of scenario impacts is therefore the key to making the specific scenario analysis effective as well as to improve the scenario methodologies multiple methods have been used to evaluate scenarios some studies provide a methodological evaluation bishop et al 2007 bradfield et al 2005 schoemaker 1993 van notten et al 2003 scenarios can be compared and evaluated according to the decision makers understanding of an organization s characteristics chermack et al 2007 some studies have examined the developed scenarios empirically using lab like experiments chermack et al 2007 schoemaker 1993 furthermore survey methods fleishman et al 2010 and structured interviews trutnevyte et al 2011 are useful tools for evaluating scenarios as the range of evaluation methods increases a theoretical framework should ideally be developed this theoretical framework could be multi dimensional and interdisciplinary and could explore a range of criteria elsawah et al 2020 5 limitations it is important to acknowledge the limitations in this study the first limitation is with the search criteria this review was limited to including only english language texts published between 2000 and 2020 the second limitation was with the selection criteria since the focus of the review was qualitative uwm scenarios there could be inherent biases in the identified gaps and proposed recommendations additionally studies were screened first based on their abstracts and then filtered further based on their content this selection technique led to a natural inclination towards studies with detailed relevant and well written abstracts the third limitation was lack of accessibility not all studies chosen were fully accessible quite a few studies had material that was inaccessible due to reasons such as being written in a different language and not being publicly available this led to the review losing out on potentially relevant studies the final limitation is human error this review was conducted by a single researcher who was primarily responsible for selecting interpreting and analysing the studies hence there was limited cross checking and verification possibly resulting in human bias that could be present in the results of this review 6 conclusion this systematic review explores the necessary dimensions of urban water management scenario assessment we use a comprehensive typology as the theoretical framework to organise existing literature highlight the shortcomings in existing practices and engage in discussions that answered the research questions to arrive at valid questions drawbacks in current practices include lack of transparency in the scenario process exclusion of surprises and extreme events minimal validation efforts and ignoring the impact phase of a scenario process subsequently we propose recommendations to provide a path for future scenario analysis in urban water management and to improve the application of urban water management scenarios recommendations include using structured methods for transparency exploring the inclusion of surprise events in scenarios using validation criteria to assess scenario credibility and highlighting the importance of assessing scenario impacts post workshop this review will be beneficial for those who are looking to use scenario analysis in strategic urban water

16294,harmful algal blooms habs events have a serious impact on marine fisheries and marine management they occur globally with high frequency and are characterized by a long duration and difficult governance habs incidents have occurred in the south china sea scs and the frequency of occurrence has been on the rise in recent decades predicting the long term chlorophyll a chl a concentration has the potential to facilitate long term monitoring and early warning of habs events currently long term predictions of ocean circulation and temperature are common while long term predictions of marine biochemistry are still in their infancy traditional chl a prediction methods have problems such as low accuracy and the inability to carry out long term predictions this research improved the cnn lstm model by combining spatio temporal features to predict chl a concentrations this model can extract both the temporal and spatial features of chl a expand the dataset and improve the prediction accuracy and training speed the predictions were made using a chl a dataset for the reed tablemount in the scs the time series of chl a used was the satellite data of nasa s official website from january 2002 to june 2020 the results indicate that the predictions of the cnn lstm model are better than those of the lstm and sarima models the five year long term rolling prediction of chl a was carried out and the three year pearson correlation coefficient reached 0 5 the novelty of this study is the realization of a three year long term prediction of chl a concentrations the mann kendall trend test method and the least square method were used to fit the straight line to detect the trend of the five year predicted value and the true value respectively the results indicated that the prediction value and true value of the sea surface chl a from 2015 to 2020 both exhibited an overall upward trend in addition the prediction performance of the model in large scale prediction is better than that in small scale prediction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords habs chl a cnn lstm model long term rolling prediction time series analysis 1 introduction according to the harmful algae red tide event database haedat in the 30 years after 1985 there were more than 8000 harmful algal blooms habs events worldwide and the frequency of occurrences has gradually increased the south china sea scs has a high quality of seawater due to factors such as deep water and the distance from land however habs frequently occur in the scs studies have determined that between 1980 and 2003 there were more than 700 habs occurrences in the scs with 170 in the 1980s and 440 in the 1990s wang et al 2008 habs in the scs have exhibited an upward trend in recent decades zhang 2013 habs are one of the three major marine disasters worldwide after an outbreak it has the characteristics of a long duration and difficult governance when habs occur they negatively affect fisheries mcowen et al 2015 and marine ecosystems causing substantial property loss and even threatening human life and health therefore it is essential to build a habs prediction model and a marine water quality prediction system rostam et al 2021 in the past the unpredictability of red tide fluctuations caused difficulty in handling habs events the red tide monitoring and early warning has ushered in the big data era making long term and large scale red tide monitoring and early warning possible park et al 2019 summarized previous studies seferian et al 2014 and demonstrated that biogeochemical factors such as acidity oxygen and primary production may be more predictable than their physical counterparts therefore the concentration of chlorophyll a chl a a factor that is commonly used for oceans represents the concentration of algae yang et al 2019 as a key indicator for monitoring the degree of seawater nutrition zou et al 2020 the over proliferation of marine algae triggers red tides and predicting the temporal and spatial changes in chl a concentrations can provide timely insights into the algae and marine ecological conditions to provide an early warning of red tide disasters xu et al 2019 the original chl a prediction model is a simple first order equation proposed by vollenweider 1975 this model does not consider other factors affecting chl a there are many factors that affect the concentration of chl a such as sea surface temperature wind speed light transmittance of the sea water and whether it is near the shore chen et al 2011 carneiro et al 2014 subsequently scholars established a theoretical analysis model to predict chl a concentration based on the nature of the water body jørgensen et al 1978 wu et al 2018 this type of model can consider the interactions between various elements in the water body but the diversity of water quality variables in the ocean may make correct modeling or parameterization difficult dutkiewicz et al 2020 the autoregressive integrated moving average model arima is the most common type of predictive model for time series data the arima model has a simple structure but requires that the time series data must be stable the seasonal difference autoregressive moving average model sarima is an advanced arima model that can support the seasonal variables of the time series in the past chl a determination primarily relied on site sampling which has the disadvantages of high cost and slow speed wu and liu 2012 with the development of satellite remote sensing technology remote sensing monitoring of chl a gitelson et al 2007 and remote sensing inversion o reilly et al 1998 dall olmo et al 2003 research has become increasingly mature with the diversification of the means of obtaining information a large amount of variable water quality data can be obtained therefore machine learning models are widely used in water quality variable predictions ark et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 such as artificial neural networks lu et al 2008 vilas et al 2011 alizadeh and kavianpour 2015 sinshaw et al 2019 shi et al 2020 the random forest method li et al 2017a 2018 yajima and derot 2018 and support vector machines noori et al 2015 park et al 2015 xu et al 2015 kisi and parmar 2016 fijani et al 2019 in water quality predictions machine learning focuses more on prediction accuracy than on model structures elith and leathwick 2009 deep learning dl is a special type of machine learning guo et al 2020 that has been widely used in the field of data prediction in recent years and its predictions using large datasets are better than with machine learning dl prediction models have been widely used in the field of marine environment in the past two years such as ship navigation liu et al 2020 waves bao et al 2020 sea height anomalies ssha song et al 2020 and sea surface temperatures xie et al 2020 as well as a few studies on predicting ocean chl a concentrations rostam et al 2021 most current studies have used independent dl models for short term chl a predictions researchers have mostly used the lstm model to predict chl a concentrations cho et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 with some using the convolutional neural network cnn model choi et al 2019 yussof et al 2021 implemented the lstm and cnn methods to predict habs events on the west coast of sabah eight days in advance and determined that the predictions of the lstm model are better than those of the cnn model because the lstm method can learn the long term dependence which the cnn method cannot the lstm method can memorize the time series information however the correlation coefficient of the lstm model is still very low barzegar et al 2020 used the hybrid cnn lstm model for the first time to perform short term chl a predictions on small prespa lake in greece and verified that the hybrid cnn lstm model is better than the dl independent model in predicting chl a levels chl a seasonal and multi year predictions are necessary to maintain fishery production chavez et al 2003 chassot et al 2010 stock et al 2017 moreover it can provide valuable support for scientific sea area management and red tide control currently long term predictions of ocean circulation and temperature are common while long term predictions of marine biochemistry are still in their infancy existing chl a prediction studies have been mostly short term predictions zhao et al 2017 and most of the prediction targets have been lakes hou et al 2004 zeng et al 2006 chen et al 2014a li et al 2017c barzegar et al 2020 2021 and rivers lee and lee 2018 with a lack of long term predictions for the multi year chl a concentrations in sea areas the prediction algorithm that is suitable for one water source may not be suitable for other water sources because they have different characteristics in terms of hydrology climate geochemistry and biological characteristics rostam et al 2021 it is necessary to model the medium and long term predictions of chl a concentrations but long term predictions are exceptionally difficult because long term predictions require more historical data input li et al 2017b the robustness of lstms in medium and long term simulations wang et al 2019 provides support for long term predictions some scholars chen et al 2020 yu et al 2020 have predicted the long term trends in chl a concentrations but they have not compared these results with the true values to verify the accuracy predictions the national aeronautics and space administration nasa global modeling and assimilation office gmao subseasonal to seasonal forecast system geos s2s established a long term global biogeochemical prediction model conducted a 9 month long term seasonal prediction of the global ocean chl a concentrations rousseaux and gregg 2017 rousseaux et al 2021 and have continued to improve the model in addition park et al 2019 attempted a longer time span for chl a predictions using the global earth system model esm stock et al 2014 to predict regional seasonal to multi year ocean chl a fluctuations including predicting the fluctuations in the somali sea up to 2 3 years in advance but the prediction time for the tropical pacific was only 12 months seferian et al 2014 used esm in 2014 to verify that the effective predictable range of tropical pacific net primary productivity npp could be extended to three years studies have demonstrated that the npp is the most sensitive to the surface chl a concentration lee et al 2015 and is usually modeled as a function of chl a westberry et al 2008 it is inferred from this that the prediction time of chl a concentration in the tropical pacific could also be extended to interannual scales the current study has improved the cnn lstm model compared with the traditional lstm time series prediction model this model adds the process of extracting spatial data features that are highly correlated with the target prediction area supplements the dataset and effectively ameliorates the poor prediction performance of traditional lstms for small data volumes the model was tested and compared with lstm and sarima models then the three dimensional spatio temporal characteristics of the chl a sequence were extracted and analyzed with a long term rolling prediction of chl a concentrations over a five year time span long term chl a predictions help to understand chl a fluctuations and provides services for the establishment of a red tide early warning research system 2 materials and methods 2 1 data set the study area was located in the scs the scs is a vital and controversial part of global ocean governance while its abundant resources provide opportunities for the surrounding countries it also brings challenges to the environmental protection of the scs surrounding countries have a common responsibility for the environment in the scs however the controversy surrounding the scs complicates its environmental protection and there is no complete governance system the balance of the scs and the management of eutrophication of the scs require long term environmental cooperation between china and the neighboring countries water pollution in the scs predominantly includes land transportation pollution heavy metal pollution of coral reefs and oil and gas development pollution the selected dataset covers the global oceans and scs from 11 1 n 12 1 n 115 8 e 117 5 e and covers part of the reed tablemount in the scs fig 1 the reed tablemount is rich in oil and gas resources drilling mud discharge domestic sewage discharge and pipeline laying sediments in oil and gas exploration and development activities may cause pollution to the sea therefore the environmental conditions of the sea near the reed tablemount should be considered using a single variable input has a higher accuracy than using multiple variable inputs xiao et al 2017 yussof et al 2021 in this study the chl a concentration was selected as the only variable input the scs is far from the mainland and it is difficult to cover a wide range of sea areas with actual measurements and station observations therefore remote sensing was used to obtain the long term and large scale observation data the data used in the experiment were obtained from the official website of nasa ocean color https oceancolor gsfc nasa gov the downloaded data were the vector data of the satellite time series because of the large number of missing values in the daily chl a data we selected the second level chl a semi monthly synthetic product data of the modified sensor from january 2002 to june 2020 the data comes from terra and aqua satellites and the accuracy of the remote sensing data was 1000 m nasa s research on the inversion of chl a concentration has reached a relatively mature stage o reilly et al 1998 obtained a model ocean chlorophyll x ocx for global chl a concentration inversion that is suitable for various types of remote sensing data through experimental summaries the global chl a inversion algorithm is not as accurate as the regional inversion algorithm but because the study area is case 1 water the inversion is relatively reliable o reilly et al 1998 the downloaded chl a remote sensing data had a resolution of 1 km 1 km first we re analyzed the data divided it into grids and expanded it 20 times to produce a grid product with a spatial resolution of 20 km 20 km fig 1 the value of a single grid was replaced by the average of 400 original data points the scs is a sea area with substantial cloud coverage especially in summer when the cloud coverage can reach 80 which could cause missing and abnormal sensor data therefore to observe the continuity of the data it was necessary to remove the outliers outside the interquartile range when studying the temporal and spatial changes in the chl a concentration and spline interpolation was used for the missing values before entering the model the original data were normalized with min max normalization to prevent gradient changes and improve the convergence speed of the model the normalization and min max scaling techniques scale between 0 and 1 executed in the scikit learn preprocessing library for each grid the dataset was divided into a training set validation set and prediction set according to the time periods in the time dimension the semi monthly chl a data from january 2002 to june 2020 included 444 data with 210 data from january 2002 to september 2010 as the training set 114 data from september 2010 to june 2015 as the validation set and 120 data from june 2015 to june 2020 as the prediction set 2 2 chl a prediction models 2 2 1 sarima box et al 1976 proposed the traditional arima prediction model which is more suitable for datasets with stable sequence trends that is stationary data sets therefore in the prediction process we first eliminated the trend and seasonal influence and converted the data into stable data sarima p d q p d q s have seven parameters adding seasonal parameters to arima p d q the structure of the sarima model is as follows ma et al 2021 1 φ l a p l s d s d x i δ q l b q l s ε t e ε t 0 v a r ε t σ s 2 e ε t ε s 0 s t e x s ε t 0 s t in the formula l is the delay operator a p l s is the p order autoregressive operator b q l s is the q order seasonal moving average operator d 1 l d is the difference operation and s d 1 l s d is seasonal difference operation first we determined whether the data were stationary data using the stationarity test then we determined whether the model satisfied the residual white noise test finally the autocorrelation graph acf and partial autocorrelation graph pacf were used to determine the model parameters 2 2 2 lstm the lstm network was originally a recurrent neural network rnn proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the neurons of the traditional rnn contain self feedback connections and the output is jointly determined by the input and the previous output making it capable of remembering however as the time interval increases the information is multiplied by the decimal multiple times during the neuron flow process and is lost resulting in the disappearance of the gradient zeng and zhang 2013 the influence of the current output on the subsequent output weakens until it disappears therefore useful information cannot be continuously remembered the lstm can continuously circulate information to ensure that the information is stored and remember the long term information of the time series for future predictions when the data flow in the network it can be stored removed and added according to whether the information is needed effectively coping with the problem of vanishing gradients shi et al 2015 therefore lstm can predict longer sequences and widely spaced sequences gers et al 2002 lstm has advantages in time series modeling has strong learning and generalization abilities and has a good predictive effect on nonstationary data however lstm neural networks are complex and there are many processing parameters during the training process in addition lstm training is slow computationally intensive time consuming and requires advanced hardware systems for rnn gradient disappearance and gradient explosion problems there is a certain degree of improvement in lstm but this has not been completely solved lstm can only extract relatively long time series information weninger et al 2015 and the predictions for longer time series and long term trends worsen 2 2 3 cnn lstm cnn neurons can respond to the surrounding units when processing data and are generally used to process images cnns include an input layer convolutional layer activation layer pooling layer and fully connected layer the cnn lstm model in this study combines the cnn and lstm it has the advantage of cnn to extract multi dimensional image features and can perceive spatial information features however it retains the advantage of lstm in processing the time series in the cnn lstm model the cnn extracts the deep features of the index the lstm model is then applied to perform predictions using these deep features huang et al 2018 cnn lstm contains six modules an input layer convolution layer pooling layer dropout layer lstm layer and output layer compared with the lstm time series model the convolutional layer pooling layer and dropout layer of the cnn are added the cnn lstm automatically generates a feature extractor during the training process and the convolution kernel performs a multi dimensional feature extraction on the input data for local perception and integrates all the information through shared weights nonlinear mapping is performed on the convolution output through the activation function commonly used activation functions are the sigmoid function tanh function and relu the convolutional layer can transfer the shape information to the next layer in the form of the same dimension the data circulating in the convolutional layer are shape data that is multidimensional data the pooling layer can reduce the dimensionality into one dimension lose spatial information and then pass it to the lstm layer the pooling process includes max pooling and average pooling the pooling layer primarily performs dimensionality reduction operations on the features reduces the number of data and parameters and reduces overfitting 2 3 implementation of dl prediction models 2 3 1 simulation environment the experiment was carried out on a pc with the following features hardware processor intel r core tm i7 7500 u cpu 8 gb memory dual graphics card amd radeon tm 530 and intel r hd graphics 620 software windows64 bit operating system pycharm professional 2020

layer length is 50 the time step is 100 the learning rate is 1e 7 and the batch size is set to 16 lstm implements adam optimization and 80 rounds of sample training the model predicts one time step at a time and when performing multi step prediction the previous prediction output is added and iterated to the next sequence for the next prediction process 2 3 3 cnn lstm 2 3 3 1 mutual information when using the cnn lstm model to predict the chl a concentration a grid mutual information analysis is performed first mutual information is a measure of the statistical correlation between two random variables that can measure the correlation between two events for two discrete variables x and y the calculation is defined as follows 2 i x y y y x x p x y log p x y p x p y d x d y where i x y is the mutual information entropy p x y is the joint probability distribution function of the discrete variables x and y and p x p y are the marginal probability distribution functions of the discrete variables x and y respectively if i x y 0 the variables x and y are independent of each other if i x y 1 the variables x and y are completely correlated 2 3 3 2 cnn lstm training implementation by adding a convolutional layer we extract the overall features of the surrounding grid area data that are highly related to the current grid area the model uses the convolutional layer conv1d of the unified kernel initializer the size of the added convolution kernel is 64 and the sigmoid activation function is used there are no learning parameters in the pooling process before the data enters the lstm layer if the number of neurons is too large it may lead to over learning and overfitting therefore this study adds a dropout layer and randomly removes some neurons to reduce overfitting with a dropout rate of 0 001 the lstm layer selects the tanh activation function and 64 hidden neural units in the lstm layer the kernel layer sets the glorot uniform initialization value the weight initialization uses the zeros method and the activation function of the loop step is hard sigmoid the learning rate of the cnn lstm model is set to 0 001 the batchsize is set to 8 and the training epoch is set to 150 during the runtime the model uses the loss function of the mse and performs adam optimization fig 2 2 3 3 3 cnn lstm prediction implementation the sea surface is divided into grids in space and the chl a data are condensed into one observation value at each grid point the chl a value of a single grid point is correlated with the adjacent grid points and the related grid data constitute the spatial data the chl a value at each grid point is a time series and the chl a value has a correlation dependency with the historical data which constitutes the time dimension data the time dimension data and spatial data constitute the 3d time series grid data in the cnn lstm prediction process we selected the historical 3d time series grid data of the chl a concentration to predict the future 3d time series grid data and scroll forward through the window to make the next prediction taking the d42 grid as an example the d42 grid needs to be tested for mutual information before the prediction it was found that the d43 and e42 grids adjacent to the d42 grid had a strong correlation with the d42 grid greater than 0 7 therefore this study input the three dimensional chl a time series data of the three grid areas of d42 d43 and e42 in the single step prediction process 30 time steps of the sample are used to predict the next chl a data of the target grid sliding forward one step at a time predicts the next data point in the target grid area in the rolling prediction process the predicted data are added to the sample and the following 72 time steps three years of the chl a concentration data are used to predict the subsequent chl a concentration data as the number of iterations increases the prediction accuracy gradually decreases fig 3 2 4 inspection index 2 4 1 prediction accuracy test the root mean square error mse and mean absolute error mae were calculated to test the chl a prediction level the smaller the mse and mae the closer the predicted value is to the true value a value of 0 indicates the highest accuracy the pearson correlation coefficient r was calculated to test the rolling prediction level of the long term chl a the r metric represents the level of linear regression between the observed and predicted values the larger the pearson correlation coefficient the higher the correlation between the predicted and original values when r is equal to 1 the strongest correlation is observed 3 m s e 1 n i 1 n y i f i 2 4 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i f i 5 r i 1 n y i y f i f i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n f i f 2 1 2 where n is the size of the

coefficient k of the straight line if k 0 the sequence exhibits an upward trend if k 0 then the sequence is a stationary sequence when k 0 the sequence exhibits a downward trend 3 results and discussion 3 1 index analysis 3 1 1 mutual information before testing the cnn lstm model we first clarified the correlation of the grid area selected multiple grids with a strong correlation with the target grid extracted features and predicted the chl a concentration of the target area the mutual information entropy was calculated to express the correlation of the grid area the d42 grid area is used as an example to calculate the mutual information entropy of the d42 grid and other grids the grid area of d42 has the highest correlation with d43 and e42 and the mutual information entropy is 0 705 and 0 772 respectively which are both greater than 0 7 fig 4 d42 has a high correlation with the e41 grid and the mutual information entropy is approximately 0 6 for the prediction we selected the d42 d43 e42 combination and the d42 d43 e42 e41 combination to predict the chl a concentration of the d42 grid area compared the prediction effects of the two combinations and selected the optimal combination we conducted mutual information entropy experiments on all the grids fig 5 each grid area has a strong correlation with its surrounding area when predicting the target grid we selected different combinations of the target grid and its surrounding grid areas for the comparison experiments and selected the combination method with the best prediction 3 1 2 parameter analysis the timestep is the key parameter of the model when predicting a sequence we usually need to determine the optimal timestep that is how many historical values are used to predict future values mae mg m3 and mse mg m3 represent the prediction errors for the prediction of the chl a concentration in the d42 area of the target grid we chose two combinations d42 d43 e42 and d42 d43 e42 e41 set the different timestep values respectively compared the sizes of mae and mse and selected the best combination method and best timestep value table 1 when predicting the chl a concentration in the d42 grid area the d42 d43 e42 combination method was selected to have the smallest prediction errors and best model performance table 1 the overall error of the d42 d43 e42 e41 combination method is higher than that of the d42 d43 e42 combination and the prediction was poor the reason for this result may be that the correlation between the e41 and d42 grids is weak and the mutual information entropy is less than 0 6 both the mae and mse values as well as the error were the smallest when the timestep value was set to 30 when the timestep value was set to 70 the mae and mse errors were relatively small but slightly larger than those with the timestep of 30 and the prediction was better the experiments demonstrated that within the timestep range of 100 with the increase in the timestep the mae and mse values exhibited periodic changes when the timestep was 30 or 70 the model provided the best prediction when compared with the historical chl a concentrations in the scs this may be because the chl a concentration presents seasonal and periodic changes by comparing the mae and mse errors we determined the best value of the network combination method and timestep for the prediction of the d42 grid area sequence when selecting the combination d42 d43 e42 and set the time step to 30 or 70 the error was small and the model performance was good the epoch represents the number of training rounds for a training sample the timesteps were selected as 30 and 70 respectively and different epochs were selected based on experience to test the best performance of the model table 2 when the timesteps were 30 and 70 the errors of mae and mse were not significantly different when epoch was less than 100 the error was large indicating that the model was not fully trained when the epoch was greater than 500 the values of mae and mse began to increase indicating that the model was over fitting increasing the epoch will also lead to a long training time and high cost through experiments we found that after training approximately 150 times the model stabilized therefore we set the epoch as 150 to provide the best model table 2 through the parameter analysis we selected the d42 d43 e42 combination set the timestep to 30 and epoch to 150 and as with the prediction model of the d42 sequence predicted the target grid d42 sequence and calculated the predicted loss curve fig 6 after 150 rounds of training the loss of the training set and the loss of the test set were both below 0 005 all the grid areas were predicted and the true and predicted values of the chl a concentration in june 2015 were selected for display fig 7 the cnn lstm model has high accuracy in predicting the chl a in the study area the error between the predicted value and the true value was small and the chl a concentration change trend in the entire area was consistent this shows that our model performs well in terms of the regional chl a predictions the same model with the same parameters could be applied to the chl a prediction of the entire region with strong spatial stability and universal applicability after training on all the grid regions the average mae of the study area prediction was 1 20e 2 mg m3 and the average mse was 2 99e 4 mg m3 the grid resolution was 20 km 20 km and the standard deviation and coefficient of variation for calculating a single grid area were small the average standard deviation was 0 0158 and the average coefficient of variation was 0 201 this demonstrates that a remote sensing resolution of 1 km and a grid resolution of 20 km 20 km can accurately analyze the characteristics of temporal and spatial changes in chl a concentrations the chl a content in the study area gradually increased from west to east and from north to south fig 7 the reason may be due to the existence of xiongnan jiao in the north of the study area and the nares bank in the west the chl a concentration near the coral reef beach is lower than that of the open ocean which is consistent with the results of yahel et al 1998 yahel et al 1998 believed that the abundance and chl a concentration of phytoplankton near coral reefs are 15 65 lower than that of the adjacent open waters and the decline in chl a near coral reefs is usually related to an increase in the degradation products 3 2 comparison of three models in this study three models were used to predict the grid area dataset sarima lstm and cnn lstm we used the d42 area as an example to make the predictions compared the prediction performance of the three models and calculated the 95 confidence interval of the predicted value for the sarima model the stationarity test was first performed on the time series and the p value was 6 30e 10 which is less than the significance level of 0 05 indicating that the time series was a stationary series and there was no need to carry out the difference operation that is d 0 the white noise test result was p 3 40e 28 which is less than the significance level of 0 05 we use the autocorrelation graph acf and partial autocorrelation graph pacf to determine p 4 and q 4 the concentration of chl a in the scs exhibits seasonal changes with a half year cycle so s 12 was used 3 2 1 single step prediction three models were used to predict the d42 sequence and determine the confidence interval fig 8 the predicted value of the cnn lstm model best fit the true value curve and the confidence interval was the narrowest indicating that the predicted value was the closest to the true value the lstm model was second and the sarima model provided the worst prediction fig 8 it can be seen from the figure that the prediction interval is included in the true value interval which may be that the predictive data is not sensitive to extreme values and human influences such as government management yu et al 2020 affected by complex geophysical and chemical effects chl a changes in the scs have complex and multiscale characteristics the reed tablemount is located in the nansha area of the central basin of the scs the chl a concentration is generally low maintained at approximately 0 1 mg m3 the seasonal chl a time series of the reed tablemount waters has a bimodal structure annually with a time scale and period of approximately 6 months the chl a concentration is the highest in winter approximately 0 15 mg m3 and the lowest in summer approximately 0 075 mg m3 this is primarily because the scs monsoon is the key influencing factor for chl a changes in liletan waters yu et al 2020 the strong monsoon and complex topography cause the scs to have a significant seasonal circulation system in winter the northeast monsoon affects the sea and the circulation in the scs has a cyclonic structure vertical mixing is significant transporting nutrients from the lower layer upward and promoting the growth of phytoplankton on the sea surface in summer driven by the southwest monsoon the scs circulation presents an anticyclonic structure the summer monsoon is not as strong as the winter monsoon which limits the vertical mixing of the seawater the increase in the sea surface temperature is also an crucial factor in the decrease in the chl a concentration during summer chen et al 2020 the increase in temperature limits the growth and reproduction of phytoplankton therefore the chl a content is lower than that in winter the chl a concentrations were high in 2007 and 2010 when la niña phenomena occurred and decreased significantly in 2002 2006 2009 and 2015 with the el niño phenomena this is because when an el niño phenomenon occurs the water temperature rises abnormally and the monsoons weaken which inhibits the diffusion of nutrients and reduces the amount of phytoplankton when the la niña phenomenon occurred the opposite was observed the prediction errors for the three models were calculated table 3 the prediction error of the cnn lstm model had the smallest prediction error and provided the best prediction of chl a concentrations in the scs 3 2 2 multi step prediction three models were used to perform 1 year 2 year 3 year 4 year and 5 year long term rolling predictions on the d42 grid area and calculate the pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted value and the true value table 4 the larger the pearson correlation coefficient the higher the correlation between the predicted and true values the experiments verified that when the time step of the cnn lstm model was 72 the correlation coefficient between the predicted value and the true value was the largest and the prediction performance was the best seferian et al 2014 determined that primary production in tropical regions could be predicted three years in advance through the experiments we concluded that the long term prediction of chl a concentrations in the scs can be up to three years as the predictions progressed the pearson correlation coefficient decreased exponentially indicating that the predictions worsen with an increase in time the performance of the cnn lstm model in predicting the long term chl a concentrations was significantly better than that of the lstm and sarima models table 4 3 3 long term rolling prediction we used the cnn lstm model to predict the long term chl a sequences of all the grid regions then the correlations between the predicted and true values were calculated fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that the prediction of all the grid areas of the dataset gradually decreases with an increase in time in the next year the pearson correlation coefficient exceeds 0 8 indicating that the predictions for one year are ideal when predicting the five year chl a concentration the pearson correlation coefficient is reduced to below 0 4 the predicted value and the true value are quite different and the prediction accuracy is low the variation in the prediction performance for different grid areas indicates the need to fine tune the model parameters or identifies the influence of human activities to express the level of cnn lstm long term more accurately predictions we calculated the regional average of the mae mse and pearson correlation coefficients of the cnn lstm long term predictions table 5 as the prediction time increased the average mae and mse errors of the predicted regions gradually increased and the pearson correlation coefficient gradually decreased the prediction error of the three year chl a value was relatively small and the pearson correlation coefficient reached 0 5 table 5 therefore the cnn lstm model could extend the chl a prediction to three years the experiments demonstrated that the prediction accuracy of the cnn lstm model is not only significantly higher than the lstm and sarima models but it can also be applied to long term rolling predictions the study used the m k trend test method and the least square method to fit a straight line to analyze the monotonic change trend of the chl a time series the chl a sequence was divided into subsets in units of years and the m k test statistic z was obtained the significance level α was set to 0 05 and p is the probability of the statistical trend using the mann kendall trend test method and the least squares method the five year long term predicted values and true values of all grids in the study area were analyzed table 6 the m k test indicates that from 2015 to 2020 the interannual changes in chl a in the study area exhibited a slight upward trend which was not significant p 1 α the least square test also established that chl a in the study area demonstrated an upward trend table 6 this is consistent with the results of previous studies palacz et al 2011 chen et al 2014b from the monotonic trend analysis it was concluded that the chl a concentration in the central and southern scs exhibited an upward trend the p is relatively low which may be because the data were retrieved using remote sensing and the lack of comparison with the measured voyage data resulted in a variations between the obtained data and the true values in addition there were many missing data and the sequence obtained by interpolation produced errors compared with the true values the trend analysis of a single grid demonstrates that the true chl a concentration of the grids other than the h42 grid exhibited an upward trend however the grid trend change in the predicted value has both upward and downward trends indicating that the long term prediction for the grid is volatile and has certain errors this may be because the predicted data were added to the sequence to predict the next value during the prediction and the accuracy of the prediction will decrease annually in addition factors such as human activity trajectories and submerged reefs also affect the prediction accuracy of a single grid area the reed tablemount area is rich in oil and gas resources and some oil and gas development activities in the surrounding countries may affect the predicted level of chl a areas with more human development activities may affect the change in the chl a concentration leading to the inapplicability and affecting the predictive performance of the model furthermore there numerous submerged reefs in the reed tablemount which may affect the distribution of chl a in different grid areas the long term prediction of a single grid has errors but for the entire region the long term prediction of regional chl a concentrations is consistent with the actual situation therefore this study analyzed whether the model performs better in large scale predictions than for a single grid this results indicate that the model has the potential to be applied to a wider area for example other waters of the scs and even global waters from the perspective of the overall study area both the predicted and true values show an upward trend on a long term scale this indicates that the long term predictions of chl a concentrations are ideal for the entire study area the overall chl a concentration on the surface of the lile beach exhibited an upward trend this may be due to the influence of wind speed yu et al 2020 the annual increase in wind speed in the scs promotes the vertical mixing of seawater which is beneficial to the growth and reproduction of phytoplankton thereby promoting an increase in the chl a concentration jiang et al 2019 furthermore a gradual increase in human activities may cause scs pollution the number of red tides in the scs in recent decades has also exhibited an upward trend which is consistent with the upward trend of the chl a concentration this indicates that the increase in the chl a concentration may be related to the occurrence of habs events therefore the long term prediction of chl a has the potential to provide long term monitoring and early warning of habs in the scs due to the complexity around the scs habs governance in the scs also has the characteristics of fragmentation and lag it is necessary to increase investments in marine monitoring and predictions establish long term chl a marine monitoring and predicting networks and effectively provide early warnings of habs chl a and many other water quality factors such as sea temperature organic carbon yellow substances and heavy metals constitute vital indicators for marine water quality monitoring and predictions currently based on the research on the temporal and spatial changes in chl a concentrations we determined through some extended experiments that the improved cnn lstm model can also be applied to other seasonal seawater elements the next step is to carry out relevant predicting research on other seawater elements establish a multi element coupling model to form a global long term prediction system for marine biochemistry and participate in global governance 4 conclusion through spatio temporal trend analyses this study found that the chl a concentrations on the surface of the reed tablemount have been increasing furthermore the number of habs events in the scs in recent decades has also increased on an interannual scale consistent with the rising trend of chl a concentrations this indicates that the increase in the chl a concentration may be related to the occurrence of habs events therefore the long term prediction of chl a seasonality has the potential to provide long term monitoring and early warning of habs and support for fishery management protection of marine endangered species and marine ecosystem health and global ocean governance however the long term predictions of chl a are still in its infancy currently to the best of the authors knowledge the longest prediction time for tropical oceans in related studies is 12 months in this study a chl a concentration prediction experiment was carried out using the cnn lstm model the long term prediction of the chl a seasonal data was carried out and the chl a prediction time was extended to three years this research improved the cnn lstm model to achieve long term predictions on a small sample dataset the traditional lstm time series prediction model performs poorly on small sample datasets the improvement of the cnn lstm prediction model in this study can effectively address this problem this method is based on the idea of combining spatio temporal features of data to expand the dataset and it performs well on small sample datasets compared with the lstm and sarima models the results indicate that the prediction accuracy of the cnn lstm model is much higher than that of the lstm and sarima models and the training speed is also faster than that of the two models a long term prediction experiment on chl a concentrations was carried out and it was found that the pearson correlation coefficient r reached 0 674 0 542 0 492 for one year two years and three years respectively a trend analysis was conducted on the predictive data and true values from 2015 to 2020 and it was found that the chl a concentration exhibited an upward trend from 2015 to 2020 in addition the inspection effect is better for large scale areas and the model provides a better predictions this indicates that the model may be applicable to larger scale sea areas and has the potential to predict chl a concentrations in global seas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16294,harmful algal blooms habs events have a serious impact on marine fisheries and marine management they occur globally with high frequency and are characterized by a long duration and difficult governance habs incidents have occurred in the south china sea scs and the frequency of occurrence has been on the rise in recent decades predicting the long term chlorophyll a chl a concentration has the potential to facilitate long term monitoring and early warning of habs events currently long term predictions of ocean circulation and temperature are common while long term predictions of marine biochemistry are still in their infancy traditional chl a prediction methods have problems such as low accuracy and the inability to carry out long term predictions this research improved the cnn lstm model by combining spatio temporal features to predict chl a concentrations this model can extract both the temporal and spatial features of chl a expand the dataset and improve the prediction accuracy and training speed the predictions were made using a chl a dataset for the reed tablemount in the scs the time series of chl a used was the satellite data of nasa s official website from january 2002 to june 2020 the results indicate that the predictions of the cnn lstm model are better than those of the lstm and sarima models the five year long term rolling prediction of chl a was carried out and the three year pearson correlation coefficient reached 0 5 the novelty of this study is the realization of a three year long term prediction of chl a concentrations the mann kendall trend test method and the least square method were used to fit the straight line to detect the trend of the five year predicted value and the true value respectively the results indicated that the prediction value and true value of the sea surface chl a from 2015 to 2020 both exhibited an overall upward trend in addition the prediction performance of the model in large scale prediction is better than that in small scale prediction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords habs chl a cnn lstm model long term rolling prediction time series analysis 1 introduction according to the harmful algae red tide event database haedat in the 30 years after 1985 there were more than 8000 harmful algal blooms habs events worldwide and the frequency of occurrences has gradually increased the south china sea scs has a high quality of seawater due to factors such as deep water and the distance from land however habs frequently occur in the scs studies have determined that between 1980 and 2003 there were more than 700 habs occurrences in the scs with 170 in the 1980s and 440 in the 1990s wang et al 2008 habs in the scs have exhibited an upward trend in recent decades zhang 2013 habs are one of the three major marine disasters worldwide after an outbreak it has the characteristics of a long duration and difficult governance when habs occur they negatively affect fisheries mcowen et al 2015 and marine ecosystems causing substantial property loss and even threatening human life and health therefore it is essential to build a habs prediction model and a marine water quality prediction system rostam et al 2021 in the past the unpredictability of red tide fluctuations caused difficulty in handling habs events the red tide monitoring and early warning has ushered in the big data era making long term and large scale red tide monitoring and early warning possible park et al 2019 summarized previous studies seferian et al 2014 and demonstrated that biogeochemical factors such as acidity oxygen and primary production may be more predictable than their physical counterparts therefore the concentration of chlorophyll a chl a a factor that is commonly used for oceans represents the concentration of algae yang et al 2019 as a key indicator for monitoring the degree of seawater nutrition zou et al 2020 the over proliferation of marine algae triggers red tides and predicting the temporal and spatial changes in chl a concentrations can provide timely insights into the algae and marine ecological conditions to provide an early warning of red tide disasters xu et al 2019 the original chl a prediction model is a simple first order equation proposed by vollenweider 1975 this model does not consider other factors affecting chl a there are many factors that affect the concentration of chl a such as sea surface temperature wind speed light transmittance of the sea water and whether it is near the shore chen et al 2011 carneiro et al 2014 subsequently scholars established a theoretical analysis model to predict chl a concentration based on the nature of the water body jørgensen et al 1978 wu et al 2018 this type of model can consider the interactions between various elements in the water body but the diversity of water quality variables in the ocean may make correct modeling or parameterization difficult dutkiewicz et al 2020 the autoregressive integrated moving average model arima is the most common type of predictive model for time series data the arima model has a simple structure but requires that the time series data must be stable the seasonal difference autoregressive moving average model sarima is an advanced arima model that can support the seasonal variables of the time series in the past chl a determination primarily relied on site sampling which has the disadvantages of high cost and slow speed wu and liu 2012 with the development of satellite remote sensing technology remote sensing monitoring of chl a gitelson et al 2007 and remote sensing inversion o reilly et al 1998 dall olmo et al 2003 research has become increasingly mature with the diversification of the means of obtaining information a large amount of variable water quality data can be obtained therefore machine learning models are widely used in water quality variable predictions ark et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 such as artificial neural networks lu et al 2008 vilas et al 2011 alizadeh and kavianpour 2015 sinshaw et al 2019 shi et al 2020 the random forest method li et al 2017a 2018 yajima and derot 2018 and support vector machines noori et al 2015 park et al 2015 xu et al 2015 kisi and parmar 2016 fijani et al 2019 in water quality predictions machine learning focuses more on prediction accuracy than on model structures elith and leathwick 2009 deep learning dl is a special type of machine learning guo et al 2020 that has been widely used in the field of data prediction in recent years and its predictions using large datasets are better than with machine learning dl prediction models have been widely used in the field of marine environment in the past two years such as ship navigation liu et al 2020 waves bao et al 2020 sea height anomalies ssha song et al 2020 and sea surface temperatures xie et al 2020 as well as a few studies on predicting ocean chl a concentrations rostam et al 2021 most current studies have used independent dl models for short term chl a predictions researchers have mostly used the lstm model to predict chl a concentrations cho et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 with some using the convolutional neural network cnn model choi et al 2019 yussof et al 2021 implemented the lstm and cnn methods to predict habs events on the west coast of sabah eight days in advance and determined that the predictions of the lstm model are better than those of the cnn model because the lstm method can learn the long term dependence which the cnn method cannot the lstm method can memorize the time series information however the correlation coefficient of the lstm model is still very low barzegar et al 2020 used the hybrid cnn lstm model for the first time to perform short term chl a predictions on small prespa lake in greece and verified that the hybrid cnn lstm model is better than the dl independent model in predicting chl a levels chl a seasonal and multi year predictions are necessary to maintain fishery production chavez et al 2003 chassot et al 2010 stock et al 2017 moreover it can provide valuable support for scientific sea area management and red tide control currently long term predictions of ocean circulation and temperature are common while long term predictions of marine biochemistry are still in their infancy existing chl a prediction studies have been mostly short term predictions zhao et al 2017 and most of the prediction targets have been lakes hou et al 2004 zeng et al 2006 chen et al 2014a li et al 2017c barzegar et al 2020 2021 and rivers lee and lee 2018 with a lack of long term predictions for the multi year chl a concentrations in sea areas the prediction algorithm that is suitable for one water source may not be suitable for other water sources because they have different characteristics in terms of hydrology climate geochemistry and biological characteristics rostam et al 2021 it is necessary to model the medium and long term predictions of chl a concentrations but long term predictions are exceptionally difficult because long term predictions require more historical data input li et al 2017b the robustness of lstms in medium and long term simulations wang et al 2019 provides support for long term predictions some scholars chen et al 2020 yu et al 2020 have predicted the long term trends in chl a concentrations but they have not compared these results with the true values to verify the accuracy predictions the national aeronautics and space administration nasa global modeling and assimilation office gmao subseasonal to seasonal forecast system geos s2s established a long term global biogeochemical prediction model conducted a 9 month long term seasonal prediction of the global ocean chl a concentrations rousseaux and gregg 2017 rousseaux et al 2021 and have continued to improve the model in addition park et al 2019 attempted a longer time span for chl a predictions using the global earth system model esm stock et al 2014 to predict regional seasonal to multi year ocean chl a fluctuations including predicting the fluctuations in the somali sea up to 2 3 years in advance but the prediction time for the tropical pacific was only 12 months seferian et al 2014 used esm in 2014 to verify that the effective predictable range of tropical pacific net primary productivity npp could be extended to three years studies have demonstrated that the npp is the most sensitive to the surface chl a concentration lee et al 2015 and is usually modeled as a function of chl a westberry et al 2008 it is inferred from this that the prediction time of chl a concentration in the tropical pacific could also be extended to interannual scales the current study has improved the cnn lstm model compared with the traditional lstm time series prediction model this model adds the process of extracting spatial data features that are highly correlated with the target prediction area supplements the dataset and effectively ameliorates the poor prediction performance of traditional lstms for small data volumes the model was tested and compared with lstm and sarima models then the three dimensional spatio temporal characteristics of the chl a sequence were extracted and analyzed with a long term rolling prediction of chl a concentrations over a five year time span long term chl a predictions help to understand chl a fluctuations and provides services for the establishment of a red tide early warning research system 2 materials and methods 2 1 data set the study area was located in the scs the scs is a vital and controversial part of global ocean governance while its abundant resources provide opportunities for the surrounding countries it also brings challenges to the environmental protection of the scs surrounding countries have a common responsibility for the environment in the scs however the controversy surrounding the scs complicates its environmental protection and there is no complete governance system the balance of the scs and the management of eutrophication of the scs require long term environmental cooperation between china and the neighboring countries water pollution in the scs predominantly includes land transportation pollution heavy metal pollution of coral reefs and oil and gas development pollution the selected dataset covers the global oceans and scs from 11 1 n 12 1 n 115 8 e 117 5 e and covers part of the reed tablemount in the scs fig 1 the reed tablemount is rich in oil and gas resources drilling mud discharge domestic sewage discharge and pipeline laying sediments in oil and gas exploration and development activities may cause pollution to the sea therefore the environmental conditions of the sea near the reed tablemount should be considered using a single variable input has a higher accuracy than using multiple variable inputs xiao et al 2017 yussof et al 2021 in this study the chl a concentration was selected as the only variable input the scs is far from the mainland and it is difficult to cover a wide range of sea areas with actual measurements and station observations therefore remote sensing was used to obtain the long term and large scale observation data the data used in the experiment were obtained from the official website of nasa ocean color https oceancolor gsfc nasa gov the downloaded data were the vector data of the satellite time series because of the large number of missing values in the daily chl a data we selected the second level chl a semi monthly synthetic product data of the modified sensor from january 2002 to june 2020 the data comes from terra and aqua satellites and the accuracy of the remote sensing data was 1000 m nasa s research on the inversion of chl a concentration has reached a relatively mature stage o reilly et al 1998 obtained a model ocean chlorophyll x ocx for global chl a concentration inversion that is suitable for various types of remote sensing data through experimental summaries the global chl a inversion algorithm is not as accurate as the regional inversion algorithm but because the study area is case 1 water the inversion is relatively reliable o reilly et al 1998 the downloaded chl a remote sensing data had a resolution of 1 km 1 km first we re analyzed the data divided it into grids and expanded it 20 times to produce a grid product with a spatial resolution of 20 km 20 km fig 1 the value of a single grid was replaced by the average of 400 original data points the scs is a sea area with substantial cloud coverage especially in summer when the cloud coverage can reach 80 which could cause missing and abnormal sensor data therefore to observe the continuity of the data it was necessary to remove the outliers outside the interquartile range when studying the temporal and spatial changes in the chl a concentration and spline interpolation was used for the missing values before entering the model the original data were normalized with min max normalization to prevent gradient changes and improve the convergence speed of the model the normalization and min max scaling techniques scale between 0 and 1 executed in the scikit learn preprocessing library for each grid the dataset was divided into a training set validation set and prediction set according to the time periods in the time dimension the semi monthly chl a data from january 2002 to june 2020 included 444 data with 210 data from january 2002 to september 2010 as the training set 114 data from september 2010 to june 2015 as the validation set and 120 data from june 2015 to june 2020 as the prediction set 2 2 chl a prediction models 2 2 1 sarima box et al 1976 proposed the traditional arima prediction model which is more suitable for datasets with stable sequence trends that is stationary data sets therefore in the prediction process we first eliminated the trend and seasonal influence and converted the data into stable data sarima p d q p d q s have seven parameters adding seasonal parameters to arima p d q the structure of the sarima model is as follows ma et al 2021 1 φ l a p l s d s d x i δ q l b q l s ε t e ε t 0 v a r ε t σ s 2 e ε t ε s 0 s t e x s ε t 0 s t in the formula l is the delay operator a p l s is the p order autoregressive operator b q l s is the q order seasonal moving average operator d 1 l d is the difference operation and s d 1 l s d is seasonal difference operation first we determined whether the data were stationary data using the stationarity test then we determined whether the model satisfied the residual white noise test finally the autocorrelation graph acf and partial autocorrelation graph pacf were used to determine the model parameters 2 2 2 lstm the lstm network was originally a recurrent neural network rnn proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the neurons of the traditional rnn contain self feedback connections and the output is jointly determined by the input and the previous output making it capable of remembering however as the time interval increases the information is multiplied by the decimal multiple times during the neuron flow process and is lost resulting in the disappearance of the gradient zeng and zhang 2013 the influence of the current output on the subsequent output weakens until it disappears therefore useful information cannot be continuously remembered the lstm can continuously circulate information to ensure that the information is stored and remember the long term information of the time series for future predictions when the data flow in the network it can be stored removed and added according to whether the information is needed effectively coping with the problem of vanishing gradients shi et al 2015 therefore lstm can predict longer sequences and widely spaced sequences gers et al 2002 lstm has advantages in time series modeling has strong learning and generalization abilities and has a good predictive effect on nonstationary data however lstm neural networks are complex and there are many processing parameters during the training process in addition lstm training is slow computationally intensive time consuming and requires advanced hardware systems for rnn gradient disappearance and gradient explosion problems there is a certain degree of improvement in lstm but this has not been completely solved lstm can only extract relatively long time series information weninger et al 2015 and the predictions for longer time series and long term trends worsen 2 2 3 cnn lstm cnn neurons can respond to the surrounding units when processing data and are generally used to process images cnns include an input layer convolutional layer activation layer pooling layer and fully connected layer the cnn lstm model in this study combines the cnn and lstm it has the advantage of cnn to extract multi dimensional image features and can perceive spatial information features however it retains the advantage of lstm in processing the time series in the cnn lstm model the cnn extracts the deep features of the index the lstm model is then applied to perform predictions using these deep features huang et al 2018 cnn lstm contains six modules an input layer convolution layer pooling layer dropout layer lstm layer and output layer compared with the lstm time series model the convolutional layer pooling layer and dropout layer of the cnn are added the cnn lstm automatically generates a feature extractor during the training process and the convolution kernel performs a multi dimensional feature extraction on the input data for local perception and integrates all the information through shared weights nonlinear mapping is performed on the convolution output through the activation function commonly used activation functions are the sigmoid function tanh function and relu the convolutional layer can transfer the shape information to the next layer in the form of the same dimension the data circulating in the convolutional layer are shape data that is multidimensional data the pooling layer can reduce the dimensionality into one dimension lose spatial information and then pass it to the lstm layer the pooling process includes max pooling and average pooling the pooling layer primarily performs dimensionality reduction operations on the features reduces the number of data and parameters and reduces overfitting 2 3 implementation of dl prediction models 2 3 1 simulation environment the experiment was carried out on a pc with the following

layer length is 50 the time step is 100 the learning rate is 1e 7 and the batch size is set to 16 lstm implements adam optimization and 80 rounds of sample training the model predicts one time step at a time and when performing multi step prediction the previous prediction output is added and iterated to the next sequence for the next prediction process 2 3 3 cnn lstm 2 3 3 1 mutual information when using the cnn lstm model to predict the chl a concentration a grid mutual information analysis is performed first mutual information is a measure of the statistical correlation between two random variables that can measure the correlation between two events for two discrete variables x and y the calculation is defined as follows 2 i x y y y x x p x y log p x y p x p y d x d y where i x y is the mutual information entropy p x y is the joint probability distribution function of the discrete variables x and y and p x p y are the marginal probability distribution functions of the discrete variables x and y respectively if i x y 0 the variables x and y are independent of each other if i x y 1 the variables x and y are completely correlated 2 3 3 2 cnn lstm training implementation by adding a convolutional layer we extract the overall features of the surrounding grid area data that are highly related to the current grid area the model uses the convolutional layer conv1d of the unified kernel initializer the size of the added convolution kernel is 64 and the sigmoid activation function is used there are no learning parameters in the pooling process before the data enters the lstm layer if the number of neurons is too large it may lead to over learning and overfitting therefore this study adds a dropout layer and randomly removes some neurons to reduce overfitting with a dropout rate of 0 001 the lstm layer selects the tanh activation function and 64 hidden neural units in the lstm layer the kernel layer sets the glorot uniform initialization value the weight initialization uses the zeros method and the activation function of the loop step is hard sigmoid the learning rate of the cnn lstm model is set to 0 001 the batchsize is set to 8 and the training epoch is set to 150 during the runtime the model uses the loss function of the mse and performs adam optimization fig 2 2 3 3 3 cnn lstm prediction implementation the sea surface is divided into grids in space and the chl a data are condensed into one observation value at each grid point the chl a value of a single grid point is correlated with the adjacent grid points and the related grid data constitute the spatial data the chl a value at each grid point is a time series and the chl a value has a correlation dependency with the historical data which constitutes the time dimension data the time dimension data and spatial data constitute the 3d time series grid data in the cnn lstm prediction process we selected the historical 3d time series grid data of the chl a concentration to predict the future 3d time series grid data and scroll forward through the window to make the next prediction taking the d42 grid as an example the d42 grid needs to be tested for mutual information before the prediction it was found that the d43 and e42 grids adjacent to the d42 grid had a strong correlation with the d42 grid greater than 0 7 therefore this study input the three dimensional chl a time series data of the three grid areas of d42 d43 and e42 in the single step prediction process 30 time steps of the sample are used to predict the next chl a data of the target grid sliding forward one step at a time predicts the next data point in the target grid area in the rolling prediction process the predicted data are added to the sample and the following 72 time steps three years of the chl a concentration data are used to predict the subsequent chl a concentration data as the number of iterations increases the prediction accuracy gradually decreases fig 3 2 4 inspection index 2 4 1 prediction accuracy test the root mean square error mse and mean absolute error mae were calculated to test the chl a prediction level the smaller the mse and mae the closer the predicted value is to the true value a value of 0 indicates the highest accuracy the pearson correlation coefficient r was calculated to test the rolling prediction level of the long term chl a the r metric represents the level of linear regression between the observed and predicted values the larger the pearson correlation coefficient the higher the correlation between the predicted and original values when r is equal to 1 the strongest correlation is observed 3 m s e 1 n i 1 n y i f i 2 4 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i f i 5 r i 1 n y i y f i f i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n f i f 2 1 2 where n is the size of the

discussion 3 1 index analysis 3 1 1 mutual information before testing the cnn lstm model we first clarified the correlation of the grid area selected multiple grids with a strong correlation with the target grid extracted features and predicted the chl a concentration of the target area the mutual information entropy was calculated to express the correlation of the grid area the d42 grid area is used as an example to calculate the mutual information entropy of the d42 grid and other grids the grid area of d42 has the highest correlation with d43 and e42 and the mutual information entropy is 0 705 and 0 772 respectively which are both greater than 0 7 fig 4 d42 has a high correlation with the e41 grid and the mutual information entropy is approximately 0 6 for the prediction we selected the d42 d43 e42 combination and the d42 d43 e42 e41 combination to predict the chl a concentration of the d42 grid area compared the prediction effects of the two combinations and selected the optimal combination we conducted mutual information entropy experiments on all the grids fig 5 each grid area has a strong correlation with its surrounding area when predicting the target grid we selected different combinations of the target grid and its surrounding grid areas for the comparison experiments and selected the combination method with the best prediction 3 1 2 parameter analysis the timestep is the key parameter of the model when predicting a sequence we usually need to determine the optimal timestep that is how many historical values are used to predict future values mae mg m3 and mse mg m3 represent the prediction errors for the prediction of the chl a concentration in the d42 area of the target grid we chose two combinations d42 d43 e42 and d42 d43 e42 e41 set the different timestep values respectively compared the sizes of mae and mse and selected the best combination method and best timestep value table 1 when predicting the chl a concentration in the d42 grid area the d42 d43 e42 combination method was selected to have the smallest prediction errors and best model performance table 1 the overall error of the d42 d43 e42 e41 combination method is higher than that of the d42 d43 e42 combination and the prediction was poor the reason for this result may be that the correlation between the e41 and d42 grids is weak and the mutual information entropy is less than 0 6 both the mae and mse values as well as the error were the smallest when the timestep value was set to 30 when the timestep value was set to 70 the mae and mse errors were relatively small but slightly larger than those with the timestep of 30 and the prediction was better the experiments demonstrated that within the timestep range of 100 with the increase in the timestep the mae and mse values exhibited periodic changes when the timestep was 30 or 70 the model provided the best prediction when compared with the historical chl a concentrations in the scs this may be because the chl a concentration presents seasonal and periodic changes by comparing the mae and mse errors we determined the best value of the network combination method and timestep for the prediction of the d42 grid area sequence when selecting the combination d42 d43 e42 and set the time step to 30 or 70 the error was small and the model performance was good the epoch represents the number of training rounds for a training sample the timesteps were selected as 30 and 70 respectively and different epochs were selected based on experience to test the best performance of the model table 2 when the timesteps were 30 and 70 the errors of mae and mse were not significantly different when epoch was less than 100 the error was large indicating that the model was not fully trained when the epoch was greater than 500 the values of mae and mse began to increase indicating that the model was over fitting increasing the epoch will also lead to a long training time and high cost through experiments we found that after training approximately 150 times the model stabilized therefore we set the epoch as 150 to provide the best model table 2 through the parameter analysis we selected the d42 d43 e42 combination set the timestep to 30 and epoch to 150 and as with the prediction model of the d42 sequence predicted the target grid d42 sequence and calculated the predicted loss curve fig 6 after 150 rounds of training the loss of the training set and the loss of the test set were both below 0 005 all the grid areas were predicted and the true and predicted values of the chl a concentration in june 2015 were selected for display fig 7 the cnn lstm model has high accuracy in predicting the chl a in the study area the error between the predicted value and the true value was small and the chl a concentration change trend in the entire area was consistent this shows that our model performs well in terms of the regional chl a predictions the same model with the same parameters could be applied to the chl a prediction of the entire region with strong spatial stability and universal applicability after training on all the grid regions the average mae of the study area prediction was 1 20e 2 mg m3 and the average mse was 2 99e 4 mg m3 the grid resolution was 20 km 20 km and the standard deviation and coefficient of variation for calculating a single grid area were small the average standard deviation was 0 0158 and the average coefficient of variation was 0 201 this demonstrates that a remote sensing resolution of 1 km and a grid resolution of 20 km 20 km can accurately analyze the characteristics of temporal and spatial changes in chl a concentrations the chl a content in the study area gradually increased from west to east and from north to south fig 7 the reason may be due to the existence of xiongnan jiao in the north of the study area and the nares bank in the west the chl a concentration near the coral reef beach is lower than that of the open ocean which is consistent with the results of yahel et al 1998 yahel et al 1998 believed that the abundance and chl a concentration of phytoplankton near coral reefs are 15 65 lower than that of the adjacent open waters and the decline in chl a near coral reefs is usually related to an increase in the degradation products 3 2 comparison of three models in this study three models were used to predict the grid area dataset sarima lstm and cnn lstm we used the d42 area as an example to make the predictions compared the prediction performance of the three models and calculated the 95 confidence interval of the predicted value for the sarima model the stationarity test was first performed on the time series and the p value was 6 30e 10 which is less than the significance level of 0 05 indicating that the time series was a stationary series and there was no need to carry out the difference operation that is d 0 the white noise test result was p 3 40e 28 which is less than the significance level of 0 05 we use the autocorrelation graph acf and partial autocorrelation graph pacf to determine p 4 and q 4 the concentration of chl a in the scs exhibits seasonal changes with a half year cycle so s 12 was used 3 2 1 single step prediction three models were used to predict the d42 sequence and determine the confidence interval fig 8 the predicted value of the cnn lstm model best fit the true value curve and the confidence interval was the narrowest indicating that the predicted value was the closest to the true value the lstm model was second and the sarima model provided the worst prediction fig 8 it can be seen from the figure that the prediction interval is included in the true value interval which may be that the predictive data is not sensitive to extreme values and human influences such as government management yu et al 2020 affected by complex geophysical and chemical effects chl a changes in the scs have complex and multiscale characteristics the reed tablemount is located in the nansha area of the central basin of the scs the chl a concentration is generally low maintained at approximately 0 1 mg m3 the seasonal chl a time series of the reed tablemount waters has a bimodal structure annually with a time scale and period of approximately 6 months the chl a concentration is the highest in winter approximately 0 15 mg m3 and the lowest in summer approximately 0 075 mg m3 this is primarily because the scs monsoon is the key influencing factor for chl a changes in liletan waters yu et al 2020 the strong monsoon and complex topography cause the scs to have a significant seasonal circulation system in winter the northeast monsoon affects the sea and the circulation in the scs has a cyclonic structure vertical mixing is significant transporting nutrients from the lower layer upward and promoting the growth of phytoplankton on the sea surface in summer driven by the southwest monsoon the scs circulation presents an anticyclonic structure the summer monsoon is not as strong as the winter monsoon which limits the vertical mixing of the seawater the increase in the sea surface temperature is also an crucial factor in the decrease in the chl a concentration during summer chen et al 2020 the increase in temperature limits the growth and reproduction of phytoplankton therefore the chl a content is lower than that in winter the chl a concentrations were high in 2007 and 2010 when la niña phenomena occurred and decreased significantly in 2002 2006 2009 and 2015 with the el niño phenomena this is because when an el niño phenomenon occurs the water temperature rises abnormally and the monsoons weaken which inhibits the diffusion of nutrients and reduces the amount of phytoplankton when the la niña phenomenon occurred the opposite was observed the prediction errors for the three models were calculated table 3 the prediction error of the cnn lstm model had the smallest prediction error and provided the best prediction of chl a concentrations in the scs 3 2 2 multi step prediction three models were used to perform 1 year 2 year 3 year 4 year and 5 year long term rolling predictions on the d42 grid area and calculate the pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted value and the true value table 4 the larger the pearson correlation coefficient the higher the correlation between the predicted and true values the experiments verified that when the time step of the cnn lstm model was 72 the correlation coefficient between the predicted value and the true value was the largest and the prediction performance was the best seferian et al 2014 determined that primary production in tropical regions could be predicted three years in advance through the experiments we concluded that the long term prediction of chl a concentrations in the scs can be up to three years as the predictions progressed the pearson correlation coefficient decreased exponentially indicating that the predictions worsen with an increase in time the performance of the cnn lstm model in predicting the long term chl a concentrations was significantly better than that of the lstm and sarima models table 4 3 3 long term rolling prediction we used the cnn lstm model to predict the long term chl a sequences of all the grid regions then the correlations between the predicted and true values were calculated fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that the prediction of all the grid areas of the dataset gradually decreases with an increase in time in the next year the pearson correlation coefficient exceeds 0 8 indicating that the predictions for one year are ideal when predicting the five year chl a concentration the pearson correlation coefficient is reduced to below 0 4 the predicted value and the true value are quite different and the prediction accuracy is low the variation in the prediction performance for different grid areas indicates the need to fine tune the model parameters or identifies the influence of human activities to express the level of cnn lstm long term more accurately predictions we calculated the regional average of the mae mse and pearson correlation coefficients of the cnn lstm long term predictions table 5 as the prediction time increased the average mae and mse errors of the predicted regions gradually increased and the pearson correlation coefficient gradually decreased the prediction error of the three year chl a value was relatively small and the pearson correlation coefficient reached 0 5 table 5 therefore the cnn lstm model could extend the chl a prediction to three years the experiments demonstrated that the prediction accuracy of the cnn lstm model is not only significantly higher than the lstm and sarima models but it can also be applied to long term rolling predictions the study used the m k trend test method and the least square method to fit a straight line to analyze the monotonic change trend of the chl a time series the chl a sequence was divided into subsets in units of years and the m k test statistic z was obtained the significance level α was set to 0 05 and p is the probability of the statistical trend using the mann kendall trend test method and the least squares method the five year long term predicted values and true values of all grids in the study area were analyzed table 6 the m k test indicates that from 2015 to 2020 the interannual changes in chl a in the study area exhibited a slight upward trend which was not significant p 1 α the least square test also established that chl a in the study area demonstrated an upward trend table 6 this is consistent with the results of previous studies palacz et al 2011 chen et al 2014b from the monotonic trend analysis it was concluded that the chl a concentration in the central and southern scs exhibited an upward trend the p is relatively low which may be because the data were retrieved using remote sensing and the lack of comparison with the measured voyage data resulted in a variations between the obtained data and the true values in addition there were many missing data and the sequence obtained by interpolation produced errors compared with the true values the trend analysis of a single grid demonstrates that the true chl a concentration of the grids other than the h42 grid exhibited an upward trend however the grid trend change in the predicted value has both upward and downward trends indicating that the long term prediction for the grid is volatile and has certain errors this may be because the predicted data were added to the sequence to predict the next value during the prediction and the accuracy of the prediction will decrease annually in addition factors such as human activity trajectories and submerged reefs also affect the prediction accuracy of a single grid area the reed tablemount area is rich in oil and gas resources and some oil and gas development activities in the surrounding countries may affect the predicted level of chl a areas with more human development activities may affect the change in the chl a concentration leading to the inapplicability and affecting the predictive performance of the model furthermore there numerous submerged reefs in the reed tablemount which may affect the distribution of chl a in different grid areas the long term prediction of a single grid has errors but for the entire region the long term prediction of regional chl a concentrations is consistent with the actual situation therefore this study analyzed whether the model performs better in large scale predictions than for a single grid this results indicate that the model has the potential to be applied to a wider area for example other waters of the scs and even global waters from the perspective of the overall study area both the predicted and true values show an upward trend on a long term scale this indicates that the long term predictions of chl a concentrations are ideal for the entire study area the overall chl a concentration on the surface of the lile beach exhibited an upward trend this may be due to the influence of wind speed yu et al 2020 the annual increase in wind speed in the scs promotes the vertical mixing of seawater which is beneficial to the growth and reproduction of phytoplankton thereby promoting an increase in the chl a concentration jiang et al 2019 furthermore a gradual increase in human activities may cause scs pollution the number of red tides in the scs in recent decades has also exhibited an upward trend which is consistent with the upward trend of the chl a concentration this indicates that the increase in the chl a concentration may be related to the occurrence of habs events therefore the long term prediction of chl a has the potential to provide long term monitoring and early warning of habs in the scs due to the complexity around the scs habs governance in the scs also has the characteristics of fragmentation and lag it is necessary to increase investments in marine monitoring and predictions establish long term chl a marine monitoring and predicting networks and effectively provide early warnings of habs chl a and many other water quality factors such as sea temperature organic carbon yellow substances and heavy metals constitute vital indicators for marine water quality monitoring and predictions currently based on the research on the temporal and spatial changes in chl a concentrations we determined through some extended experiments that the improved cnn lstm model can also be applied to other seasonal seawater elements the next step is to carry out relevant predicting research on other seawater elements establish a multi element coupling model to form a global long term prediction system for marine biochemistry and participate in global governance 4 conclusion through spatio temporal trend analyses this study found that the chl a concentrations on the surface of the reed tablemount have been increasing furthermore the number of habs events in the scs in recent decades has also increased on an interannual scale consistent with the rising trend of chl a concentrations this indicates that the increase in the chl a concentration may be related to the occurrence of habs events therefore the long term prediction of chl a seasonality has the potential to provide long term monitoring and early warning of habs and support for fishery management protection of marine endangered species and marine ecosystem health and global ocean governance however the long term predictions of chl a are still in its infancy currently to the best of the authors knowledge the longest prediction time for tropical oceans in related studies is 12 months in this study a chl a concentration prediction experiment was carried out using the cnn lstm model the long term prediction of the chl a seasonal data was carried out and the chl a prediction time was extended to three years this research improved the cnn lstm model to achieve long term predictions on a small sample dataset the traditional lstm time series prediction model performs poorly on small sample datasets the improvement of the cnn lstm prediction model in this study can effectively address this problem this method is based on the idea of combining spatio temporal features of data to expand the dataset and it performs well on small sample datasets compared with the lstm and sarima models the results indicate that the prediction accuracy of the cnn lstm model is much higher than that of the lstm and sarima models and the training speed is also faster than that of the two models a long term prediction experiment on chl a concentrations was carried out and it was found that the pearson correlation coefficient r reached 0 674 0 542 0 492 for one year two years and three years respectively a trend analysis was conducted on the predictive data and true values from 2015 to 2020 and it was found that the chl a concentration exhibited an upward trend from 2015 to 2020 in addition the inspection effect is better for large scale areas and the model provides a better predictions this indicates that the model may be applicable to larger scale sea areas and has the potential to predict chl a concentrations in global seas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
