6310,contaminant transport in the wetland flow is subject to various reactions most researches on this topic have limited to the single component contaminant relatively little has concerned the effect of competitive reaction on the transport of coupled bicomponent contaminant this work analytically studies the bicomponent contaminant transport in the free surface wetland flow under the combined conditions of reversible competitive transfer irreversible degradation and bed absorption by solving the constant coefficient second order linear system of parabolic type and the method of concentration moments up to the fourth order concentration moment in the previous work wang and chen 2017a is applied to support the fourth order expansion of hermite polynomials to rigorously derive the solutions with high accuracy the results demonstrate that the masses of binary components decay at different rate and the vertical concentration distributions of binary components are tremendously non uniform in the asymptotic dispersion stage three types of reactions in addition to the hydraulic dispersion exert separate control on the concentration distributions it suggests that the peak concentration rather than the mean should be based for strict environmental implements keywords wetlands bicomponent contaminant transport vertical concentration distribution peak concentration 1 introduction wetlands provide essential ecological services such as ecological restoration wastewater treatment and being important habitats for a wide variety of species etc us environmental protection agency epa 1999 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 zeng et al 2011 nepf 2012 wang et al 2013 wu and chen 2014b wang and chen 2015 wang and chen 2017a rubol et al 2016 jiang and chen 2018 gao et al 2018 shi et al 2019 ecological effects are ubiquitous in wetlands for examples the contaminants are degradated by the oxidation reduction reactions photo degradation and bio degradation the substrate physically and chemically absorbs and adsorbs the contaminants and the contaminants are catalyzed to be transformed to other components ziagova et al 2007 langergraber et al 2009 chiban et al 2011 mburu et al 2013 knapp and cirpka 2017 wang and chen 2015 wang and chen 2016b wang and chen 2017a the physical chemical and biological reactions exert considerable control on the contaminant transport process thus the contaminant concentration distributions guerrero and skaggs 2010 wang and chen 2016b wang and chen 2017b an awareness of the effects of reactions is imperative in understanding the transport of contaminants in wetland flows important for environmental impact studies the concept of taylor dispersion has been extensively adopted in studies of contaminant transport in flows taylor dispersion refers to the process that the solute spreads longitudinally under the combined effects of flow advection and molecular or turbulent diffusion taylor 1953 taylor 1954 it is widely accepted that after an initial period since the solute discharge the transverse concentration is nearly uniformly distributed and the transverse mean concentration reaches longitudinally gaussian distribution the solute cloud moves downstream at the mean flow velocity and it spreads longitudinally with a coefficient namely the dispersivity being several magnitudes larger than the molecular diffusion however until very recently wang and chen 2016b conducted an analytical research on the effect of irreversible bed absorption on the solute transport the vertical concentration distribution was as the first time illustrated to be largely deviated from the mean the basic characteristics describing the transport process including the mass exchange rate advection dispersivity skewness and kurtosis were as well demonstrated to be greatly modified by the bed absorption wang and chen 2017b ng and yip 2001 theoretically analyzed the solute transport in open channel flows with effects of kinetic sorptive exchange the mean concentration distribution was also found to deviate from gaussianity with a long tail mazumder and paul 2012 among others as well focused on the solute dispersion in flows with reactions dentz and carrera 2007 gonnella and lamura 2007 henri and fernandez garcia 2014 barik and dalal 2018 contaminant transport process in wetlands is much more complex than that in non vegetated flows being of multiscales caused by vegetation as a solid phase other than fluid nepf and ghisalberti 2008 nepf 2012 zeng and chen 2011 by treating wetlands as porous media some researchers have analytically and numerically explored the solute transport process and obtained the concentration distributions larmaei and mahdi 2012 brito et al 2016 rubol et al 2016 for practical applications often focused is the transport process at the large environmental scale the technique of phase averaging was applied to smear out the discontinuity between the vegetation and water to get continuous superficial water flow and concentration distribution zeng et al 2011 based on the frame of zeng et al 2011 wang and chen 2017a theoretically explored the contaminant transport process in a free surface wetland with bulk degradation and bed absorption it has been established that the vertical concentration is tremendously non uniformly distributed in a longtime even though the vertical mean concentration reached its longitudinal normality bulk degradation homogeneously decreases the whole concentration while bed absorption further increases the vertical concentration nonuniformity particularly in the downstream of the cloud the method proposed in wang and chen 2017a was then applied in the related work guo et al 2018 to explore the transport of point source in wetland flows numerous researches have studied the contaminant transport process under the conditions of reactions most of which focus on the single component contaminant relatively little attention has been devoted to the analysis of coupled bicomponent contaminant transport process nor the accurate vertical concentration distributions concerned in strict environmental and health risk assessments zeng et al 2014 wang and chen 2016a bicomponent contaminant transport is much more complex than the single owing to the coupled competitive reactions between the binary components bed absorption depletes the contaminant and decreases the concentration near the bed while bulk degradation reduces the concentration in the whole wetland channel thus these two reactions further affect the competitive reactions between the binary components and vise versa therefore these coupled reactions pose a challenge to the accurate prediction of the concentration distributions it is not clear yet that how the concentrations of bicomponents evolve under the conditions of reactions not to mention the peak concentration values this work aims to explore the vertical concentration distributions in bicomponent contaminant transport in wetlands with various reactions through the decoupling transformation and the method of concentration moments and the peak concentration values are as well captured up to the fourth order concentration moments are adopted to obtain analytical solutions with high accuracy the specific contents of this paper are 1 to deduce the formulations for coupled bicomponent contaminant dispersion in the free surface wetland flow 2 to analytically derive the two dimensional concentration distributions for binary components and 3 to illustrate the vertical concentration distributions and peak concentration values under the conditions of various reactions the results revealed in this work provide the groundwork for future studies regarding environmental implications 2 method 2 1 formulation for bicomponent contaminant transport due to the vegetation occupied in the wetland channel contaminant is carried by flows in the irregular vicinity of vegetation and thereby the transport process is of extreme complexity characterized by multiscales zeng et al 2011 nepf 2012 it is unnecessary to figure out the detailed transport process at the plant scale because what concerned most by engineers and governments for practical applications is the superficial transport at the large environmental scale such as the critical length of a toxic contaminant cloud and the peak concentration position and value wang and chen 2015 wang and chen 2017a fu et al 2016 to meet the requirements the wetland is treated as porous media which is a reasonable simplification of the real wetland by modeling the vegetation as porous media the velocity profile and solute transport in submerged vegetated flows are illustrated through a two domain approach battiato 2012 battiato and rubol 2014 rubol et al 2016 larmaei and mahdi 2012 as well simulated heat and fluid flows in rigid vegetation through the porous media treatment by resorting to the porous media treatment chen and zeng 2009 applied the technique of phase averaging to smear out the discontinuity between the two phases of water and vegetation phase averaging is a technique for deriving continuum equations for multiphase systems whitaker 1999 and it provides a continuum model that is valid at the phase average scale for both the superficial water flow and superficial mass transport in the entire domain of the wetland the various physical characteristics of wetlands are combined into the important dimensionless damping factor Î± chen and zeng 2009 it is widely used to capture the superficial contaminant transport process in various types of wetland flows wang et al 2013 chen 2013 zeng et al 2014 wu et al 2015 wang and chen 2015 wang and chen 2017a luo et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 jiang and chen 2018 by treating the wetland as porous media and using the phase averaging technique the present work investigates the transport and two dimensional concentration distribution of bicomponent contaminants at the macro environmental scale with various reactions including the competitive transfer bed absorption and bulk degradation taken into consideration although the porous media model cannot capture the detailed stem scale turbulence it allows one to break free of the complex micro scale flow and to focus on the average flow and momentum transfer at the macro scale which regulates the mass transport process in wetlands chen and zeng 2009 battiato and rubol 2014 additionally for numerical simulations the computational cost of vegetated porous media is considerably lower it is therefore more practical in engineering applications brito et al 2016 zhan et al 2017 the transport of binary contaminant components are described respectively with coupled competitive reactions the governing equations for superficial bicomponent contaminant transport in free surface wetland flows with bulk degradation can be generally adopted at the phase averaging scale as liu and masliyah 2005 chen et

to explore the fundamental mechanism of bicomponent contaminant transport in wetland flows contaminant transport in real wetland is extremely complex due to the irregular topography discontinuous vegetation patch unstable intensity of reactions etc it is hard to simulate the transport process through analytical approaches in real wetland thus an idealized wetland configuration is adopted for possible analytical exploration from the concept of taylor dispersion as shown in fig 1 the ideal wetland is set to be homogeneous with constant physical parameters in the concerned area with fully developed superficial flow this ideal and simplified wetland configuration has also been adopted in various analytical and numerical works especially those based on the treatment of porous media huang

to more clearly reveal the relative importance of reaction parameters some ratio quantities are adopted to illustrate the concentration distributions r r b r a represents the ratio of reversible transfer rate of component b to that of component a similarly k k b k a represents the ratio of irreversible degradation rate and Î² Î² b Î² a represents the ratio of irreversible bed absorption 3 results and discussion both the irreversible bulk degradation and irreversible bed absorption deplete the total mass of contaminants leading to decay of concentration at a faster rate than hydraulic dispersion the reversible competitive reactions between the binary components lead to mass balance of binary components depending on the transfer rate and distribution coefficient fig 2 shows the temporal evolution of masses retained in the flow for binary contaminant components under different conditions for the basic case of advection diffusion equation with bed absorption as shown in the fig 2 a the mass attenuates at a larger rate with stronger bed absorption which has been analyzed in wang and chen 2017a fig 2 b displays the effect of competitive transfer rate on the masses of binary components both decrease with increasing transfer rate it is well worth noting that the mass of component a remains nearly stable in a short initial period it may be explained by the transient period of the competitive reactions fig 2 c displays the evolution under different conditions of irreversible bulk degradation with stronger degradation both masses attenuate more obviously shown in fig 2 d the effects of irreversible degradation and reversible transfer in addition to the bed absorption result into different behaviours against those in fig 2 a as analyzed in wang and chen 2016b 2017a bed absorption depletes contaminant near the bottom and causes large vertical concentration non uniformity while bulk degradation in the present work deplete contaminant at a uniform rate in the whole channel in the studies of microorganism in natural waterbodies and treatment of toxic contaminant discharge the vertical concentration distribution as well as the peak concentration value and position are extensively concerned carvalho et al 2009 zeng and pedley 2018 wu et al 2019 to provide further information on the concentration fig 3 shows the vertical concentration distributions for binary components over typical planes there exists tremendously large vertical concentration nonuniformity due to the nonuniform vertical velocity profile faster velocity near the free surface carries the contaminant to move downstream while the contaminant near the bottom remains in the relatively upstream bed absorption depletes the contaminant near the bottom and leads to more obvious concentration non uniformity in the downstream wang and chen 2016b wang and chen 2017a the distribution coefficient k d represents the competitive dissolving capacity of binary components in an equilibrium status as shown in figs 3 a and b the concentration of component a increases while that of component b decreases with increasing k d figs 3 c and 3 d reveal the effect of competitive transfer rate on both concentrations the concentrations decrease with increasing transfer rate it is identical with those in fig 2 b figs 3 e and 3 f display the change tendency of vertical concentrations under the condition of different degradation rate it is established that stronger degradation leads to lower concentration but it does not change the vertical concentration non uniformity wang and chen 2016b wang and chen 2017a figs 3 g and 3 h display the effect of bed absorption on the vertical concentrations bed absorption causes larger decrease of concentration near the bottom than far away thereby three vertical concentration curves intersect especially over the planes in the center and downstream fig 4 further displays the temporal evolution of vertical concentration distributions over typical planes given certain parameters taking the downstream as an example at time 0 5 the vertical concentration curves appear with tremendous non uniformity and concentration in the downstream is even higher than that in the gravity center the reason lies in the fact that in the initial stage the contaminant cloud is very concentrated around the gravity center with short longitudinal range and the largely skewed concentration results into that the peak concentration appears in the downstream rather than in the gravity center wu and chen 2014a wang and chen 2017a guo et al 2018 the concentration of component b is lower than that of a depending on the distribution coefficient k d it needs to be noted that the concentration curves of binary components are slightly different because the different bed absorption rate for the two as time passes the vertical concentrations turn to be more uniform under the hydraulic dispersion and the longitudinal range extends with peak concentration decreases 4 application we consider the typical parameters with vegetation porosity Ï 0 9 us environmental protection agency epa 1999 mean diameter

transfer for bicomponent contaminant are subject to various environmental factors including temperature sunlight microorganism etc as well as the contaminant itself chiban et al 2011 knapp and cirpka 2017 they vary in a large range and are generally unstable in a certain event of contaminant transport to give an analytical exploration in the application the values in zeng et al 2014 are adopted here to illustrate the concentration distributions where the distribution coefficient k d 2 0 the transfer rates r a r b 4 63 10 5 s 1 and the degradation rates k a k b 5 0 10 6 s 1 the initial instantaneous mass discharged for binary components is q 0 9 kg fig 5 illustrates the two dimensional concentration distributions for binary components at typical times it reveals the intuitive information on the spatial and temporal evolution of concentration distributions at three times the concentration of component a is obviously higher than that of component b with the distribution coefficient k d 2 0 under the irreversible reactions such as bed absorption and bulk degradation the concentrations decrease much more faster than that just under hydraulic dispersion it can also be noted that the vertical concentration is not uniformly distributed particularly with the effect of bed absorption in some practical applications peak concentration value is commonly concerned it is extensively applied in the emergency treatment of toxic contaminant discharged in natural waterbodies and is used to judge if the peak concentration beyond the given environmental and health standards wang and chen 2016b wang and chen 2017a wu et al 2015 furthermore the peak concentration and concentration non uniformity along the depth provide information for studying of microorganisms and swimmers which is helpful in treatment of water eutrophication wang and chen 2016a zeng and pedley 2018 fig 6 illustrates the peak concentration c ap c bp values along the depth from the upstream to the downstream in comparison with the classical vertical mean concentration distributions c a c b where the mean concentrations are derived by the operation of depth average eq 14 of the two dimensional concentration the peak concentrations are obviously higher than the means at the initial time and the differences are not constant along the longitudinal direction the reason lies in the different vertical concentration non uniformity along the longitudinal direction wang and chen 2017a even though the absolute value of the concentration difference is not large it will be useful in the analyses of emergent micropollutants in environmental engineering knapp and cirpka 2017 the difference between the peak concentration and the mean in the upstream tends to be identical as time passes as particularly shown in figs 6 b and 6 c because the bed absorption depletes contaminant and reduces the peak concentration in the upstream the analytical solutions of bicomponent concentration distributions are derived based on some reasonable simplifications of the real wetland values of some parameters of the real wetland are directively adopted from experimental measurements in existing works while some values are adopted to approximately reveal the extremely complex real cases the present solutions will give the vertical concentration distributions and their temporal evolutions at the phase average scale in real wetland providing the physical parameters of the real wetland as well as the reaction coefficients for both components the present work on one hand explores the vertical concentration distributions of both components rather than the usual one dimensional depth averaged mean concentration distribution on the other hand the effects of the most common reactions including competitive transfer bed absorption and bulk degradation on the transport and fates of contaminants have been analytically quantified the results will provide information of the critical length duration and peak concentration distribution of contaminant cloud beyond given standards and effectively support the environmental and health risk assessment and environmental management after contaminant discharged into the real wetland 5 conclusions ecological effects including various reactions exert considerable control on the contaminant transport process in the wetland flow which introduce much difficulty in predicting the contaminant concentration distribution this work presents a theoretical study of coupled bicomponent contaminant transport in the free surface wetland flow with the effects of competitive transfer bulk degradation and bed absorption through the decoupling transformation and the method of concentration moments the vertical and peak concentration distributions are concretely captured as the first time the results will bring important environmental implications such as strict environmental and health risk assessments the bicomponent contaminant is demonstrated to be largely subject to various reactions the masses of binary components retained in the flow decay but with different rate under the condition of different reaction the vertical concentration distribution shows tremendous non uniformity in the asymptotic dispersion stage three types of reactions in addition to the hydraulic dispersion further result into different change tendency of the vertical concentration distribution the peak concentration value is established to be obviously higher than the mean in the application the results suggest that the peak concentration rather than the mean should be based for strict environmental implements declaration of competing interest none declared acknowledgement this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 11802032 and the beijing forestry university outstanding young talent cultivation project no 2019jq03002

non uniform in the asymptotic dispersion stage three types of reactions in addition to the hydraulic dispersion exert separate control on the concentration distributions it suggests that the peak

introduction wetlands provide essential ecological services such as ecological restoration wastewater treatment and being important habitats for a wide variety of species etc us environmental protection agency epa 1999 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 zeng et al 2011 nepf 2012 wang et al 2013 wu and chen 2014b wang and chen 2015 wang and chen 2017a rubol et al 2016 jiang and chen 2018 gao et al 2018 shi et al 2019 ecological effects are ubiquitous in wetlands for examples the contaminants are degradated by the oxidation reduction reactions photo degradation and bio degradation the substrate physically and chemically absorbs and adsorbs the contaminants and the contaminants are catalyzed to be transformed to other components ziagova et al 2007 langergraber et al 2009 chiban et al 2011 mburu et al 2013 knapp and cirpka 2017 wang and chen 2015 wang and chen 2016b wang and chen 2017a the physical chemical and biological reactions exert considerable control on the contaminant transport process thus the contaminant concentration distributions guerrero and skaggs 2010 wang and chen 2016b wang and chen 2017b an awareness of the effects of reactions is imperative in understanding the transport of contaminants in wetland flows important for environmental impact studies the concept of taylor dispersion has been extensively adopted in studies of contaminant transport in flows taylor dispersion refers to the process that the solute spreads longitudinally under the combined effects of flow advection and molecular or turbulent diffusion taylor 1953 taylor 1954 it is widely accepted that after an initial period since the solute discharge the transverse concentration is nearly uniformly distributed and the transverse mean concentration reaches longitudinally gaussian distribution the solute cloud moves downstream at the mean flow velocity and it spreads longitudinally with a coefficient namely the dispersivity being several magnitudes larger than the molecular diffusion however until very recently wang and chen 2016b conducted an analytical research on the effect of irreversible bed absorption on the solute transport the vertical concentration distribution was as the first time illustrated to be largely deviated from the mean the basic characteristics describing the transport process including the mass exchange rate advection dispersivity skewness and kurtosis were as well demonstrated to be greatly modified by the bed absorption wang and chen 2017b ng and yip 2001 theoretically analyzed the solute transport in open channel flows with effects of kinetic sorptive exchange the mean concentration distribution was also found to deviate from gaussianity with a long tail mazumder and paul 2012 among others as well focused on the solute dispersion in flows with reactions dentz and carrera 2007 gonnella and lamura 2007 henri and fernandez garcia 2014 barik and dalal 2018 contaminant transport process in wetlands is much more complex than that in non vegetated flows being of multiscales caused by vegetation as a solid phase other than fluid nepf and ghisalberti 2008 nepf 2012 zeng and chen 2011 by treating wetlands as porous media some researchers have analytically and numerically explored the solute transport process and obtained the concentration distributions larmaei and mahdi 2012 brito et al 2016 rubol et al 2016 for practical applications often focused is the transport process at the large environmental scale the technique of phase averaging was applied to smear out the discontinuity between the vegetation and water to get continuous superficial water flow and concentration distribution zeng et al 2011 based on the frame of zeng et al 2011 wang and chen 2017a theoretically explored the contaminant transport process in a free surface wetland with bulk degradation and bed absorption it has been established that the vertical concentration is tremendously non uniformly distributed in a longtime even though the vertical mean concentration reached its longitudinal normality bulk degradation homogeneously decreases the whole concentration while bed absorption further increases the vertical concentration nonuniformity particularly in the downstream of the cloud the method proposed in wang and chen 2017a was then applied in the related work guo et al 2018 to explore the transport of point source in wetland flows numerous researches have studied the contaminant transport process under the conditions of reactions most of which focus on the single component contaminant relatively little attention has been devoted to the analysis of coupled bicomponent contaminant transport process nor the accurate vertical concentration distributions concerned in strict environmental and health risk assessments zeng et al 2014 wang and chen 2016a bicomponent contaminant transport is much more complex than the single owing to the coupled competitive reactions between the binary components bed absorption depletes the contaminant and decreases the concentration near the bed while bulk degradation reduces the concentration in the whole wetland channel thus these two reactions further affect the competitive reactions between the binary components and vise versa therefore these coupled reactions pose a challenge to the accurate prediction of the concentration distributions it is not clear yet that how the concentrations of bicomponents evolve under the conditions of reactions not to mention the peak concentration values this work aims to explore the vertical concentration distributions in bicomponent contaminant transport in wetlands with various reactions through the decoupling transformation and the method of concentration moments and the peak concentration values are as well captured up to the fourth order concentration moments are adopted to obtain analytical solutions with high accuracy the specific contents of this paper are 1 to deduce the formulations for coupled bicomponent contaminant dispersion in the free surface wetland flow 2 to analytically derive the two dimensional concentration distributions for binary components and 3 to illustrate the vertical concentration distributions and peak concentration values under the conditions of various reactions the results revealed in this work provide the groundwork for future studies regarding environmental implications 2 method 2 1 formulation for bicomponent contaminant transport due to the vegetation occupied in the wetland channel contaminant is carried by flows in the irregular vicinity of vegetation and thereby the transport process is of extreme complexity characterized by multiscales zeng et al 2011 nepf 2012 it is unnecessary to figure out the detailed transport process at the plant scale because what concerned most by engineers and governments for practical applications is the superficial transport at the large environmental scale such as the critical length of a toxic contaminant cloud and the peak concentration position and value wang and chen 2015 wang and chen 2017a fu et al 2016 to meet the requirements the wetland is treated as porous media which is a reasonable simplification of the real wetland by modeling the vegetation as porous media the velocity profile and solute transport in submerged vegetated flows are illustrated through a two domain approach battiato 2012 battiato and rubol 2014 rubol et al 2016 larmaei and mahdi 2012 as well simulated heat and fluid flows in rigid vegetation through the porous media treatment by resorting to the porous media treatment chen and zeng 2009 applied the technique of phase averaging to smear out the discontinuity between the two phases of water and vegetation phase averaging is a technique for deriving continuum equations for multiphase systems whitaker 1999 and it provides a continuum model that is valid at the phase average scale for both the superficial water flow and superficial mass transport in the entire domain of the wetland the various physical characteristics of wetlands are combined into the important dimensionless damping factor Î± chen and zeng 2009 it is widely used to capture the superficial contaminant transport process in various types of wetland flows wang et al 2013 chen 2013 zeng et al 2014 wu et al 2015 wang and chen 2015 wang and chen 2017a luo et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 jiang and chen 2018 by treating the wetland as porous media and using the phase averaging technique the present work investigates the transport and two dimensional concentration distribution of bicomponent contaminants at the macro environmental scale with various reactions including the competitive transfer bed absorption and bulk degradation taken into consideration although the porous media model cannot capture the detailed stem scale turbulence it allows one to break free of the complex micro scale flow and to focus on the average flow and momentum transfer at the macro scale which regulates the mass transport process in wetlands chen and zeng 2009 battiato and rubol 2014 additionally for numerical simulations the computational cost of vegetated porous media is considerably lower it is therefore more practical in engineering applications brito et al 2016 zhan et al 2017 the transport of binary contaminant components are described respectively with coupled competitive reactions the governing equations for superficial bicomponent contaminant transport in free surface wetland flows with bulk degradation can be generally adopted at the phase averaging scale as liu and masliyah 2005 chen et

to explore the fundamental mechanism of bicomponent contaminant transport in wetland flows contaminant transport in real wetland is extremely complex due to the irregular topography discontinuous vegetation patch unstable intensity of reactions etc it is hard to simulate the transport process through analytical approaches in real wetland thus an idealized wetland configuration is adopted for possible analytical exploration from the concept of taylor dispersion as shown in fig 1 the ideal wetland is set to be homogeneous with constant physical parameters in the concerned area with fully

to more clearly reveal the relative importance of reaction parameters some ratio quantities are adopted to illustrate the concentration distributions r r b r a represents the ratio of reversible

results and discussion both the irreversible bulk degradation and irreversible bed absorption deplete the total mass of contaminants leading to decay of concentration at a faster rate than hydraulic dispersion the reversible competitive reactions between the binary components lead to mass balance of binary components depending on the transfer rate and distribution coefficient fig 2 shows the temporal evolution of masses retained in the flow for binary contaminant components under different conditions for the basic case of advection diffusion equation with bed absorption as shown in the fig 2 a the mass attenuates at a larger rate with stronger bed absorption which has been analyzed in wang and chen 2017a fig 2 b displays the effect of competitive transfer rate on the masses of binary components both decrease with increasing transfer rate it is well worth noting that the mass of component a remains nearly stable in a short initial period it may be explained by the transient period of the competitive reactions fig 2 c displays the evolution under different conditions of irreversible bulk degradation with stronger degradation both masses attenuate more obviously shown in fig 2 d the effects of irreversible degradation and reversible transfer in addition to the bed absorption result into different behaviours against those in fig 2 a as analyzed in wang and chen 2016b 2017a bed absorption depletes contaminant near the bottom and causes large vertical concentration non uniformity while bulk degradation in the present work deplete contaminant at a uniform rate in the whole channel in the studies of microorganism in natural waterbodies and treatment of toxic contaminant discharge the vertical concentration distribution as well as the peak concentration value and position are extensively concerned carvalho et al 2009 zeng and pedley 2018 wu et al 2019 to provide further information on the concentration fig 3 shows the vertical concentration distributions for binary components over typical planes there exists tremendously large vertical concentration nonuniformity due to the nonuniform vertical velocity profile faster velocity near the free surface carries the contaminant to move downstream while the contaminant near the bottom remains in the relatively upstream bed absorption depletes the contaminant near the bottom and leads to more obvious concentration non uniformity in the downstream wang and chen 2016b wang and chen 2017a the distribution coefficient k d represents the competitive dissolving capacity of binary components in an equilibrium status as shown in figs 3 a and b the concentration of component a increases while that of component b decreases with increasing k d figs 3 c and 3 d reveal the effect of competitive transfer rate on both concentrations the concentrations decrease with increasing transfer rate it is identical with those in fig 2 b figs 3 e and 3 f display the change tendency of vertical concentrations under the condition of different degradation rate it is established that stronger degradation leads to lower concentration but it does not change the vertical concentration non uniformity wang and chen 2016b wang and chen 2017a figs 3 g and 3 h display the effect of bed absorption on the vertical concentrations bed absorption causes larger decrease of concentration near the bottom than far away thereby three vertical concentration curves intersect especially over the planes in the center and downstream fig 4 further displays the temporal evolution of vertical concentration distributions over typical planes given certain parameters taking the downstream as an example at time 0 5 the vertical concentration curves appear with tremendous non uniformity and concentration in the downstream is even higher than that in the gravity center the reason lies in the fact that in the initial stage the contaminant cloud is very concentrated around the gravity center with short longitudinal range and the largely skewed concentration results into that the peak concentration appears in the downstream rather than in the gravity center wu and chen 2014a wang and chen 2017a guo et al 2018 the concentration of component b is lower than that of a depending on the distribution coefficient k d it needs to be noted that the concentration curves of binary components are slightly different because the different bed absorption rate for the two as time passes the vertical concentrations turn to be more uniform under the hydraulic dispersion and the longitudinal range extends with peak concentration decreases 4 application we consider the typical parameters with vegetation porosity Ï 0 9 us environmental protection agency epa 1999 mean diameter

2017 they vary in a large range and are generally unstable in a certain event of contaminant transport to give an analytical exploration in the application the values in zeng et al 2014 are adopted

instantaneous mass discharged for binary components is q 0 9 kg fig 5 illustrates the two dimensional concentration distributions for binary components at typical times it reveals the intuitive information on the spatial and temporal evolution of concentration distributions at three times the concentration of component a is obviously higher than that of component b with the distribution coefficient k d 2 0 under the irreversible reactions such as bed absorption and bulk degradation the concentrations decrease much more faster than that just under hydraulic dispersion it can also be noted that the vertical concentration is not uniformly distributed particularly with the effect of bed absorption in some practical applications peak concentration value is commonly concerned it is extensively applied in the emergency treatment of toxic contaminant discharged in natural waterbodies and is used to judge if the peak concentration beyond the given environmental and health standards wang and chen 2016b wang and chen 2017a wu et al 2015 furthermore the peak concentration and concentration non uniformity along the depth provide information for studying of microorganisms and swimmers which is helpful in treatment of water eutrophication wang and chen 2016a zeng and pedley 2018 fig 6 illustrates the peak concentration c ap c bp values along the depth from the upstream to the downstream in comparison with the classical vertical mean concentration distributions c a c b where the mean concentrations are derived by the operation of depth average eq 14 of the two dimensional concentration the peak concentrations are obviously higher than the means at the initial time and the differences are not constant along the longitudinal direction the reason lies in the different vertical concentration non uniformity along the longitudinal direction wang and chen 2017a even though the absolute value of the concentration difference is not large it will be useful in the analyses of emergent micropollutants in environmental engineering knapp and cirpka 2017 the difference between the peak concentration and the mean in the upstream tends to be identical as time passes as particularly shown in figs 6 b and 6 c because the bed absorption depletes contaminant and reduces the peak concentration in the upstream the analytical solutions of bicomponent concentration distributions are derived based on some reasonable simplifications of the real wetland values of some parameters of the real wetland are directively adopted from experimental measurements in existing works while some values are adopted to approximately reveal the extremely complex real cases the present solutions will give the vertical concentration distributions and their temporal evolutions at the phase average scale in real wetland providing the physical parameters of the real wetland as well as the reaction coefficients for both components the present work on one hand explores the vertical concentration distributions of both components rather than the usual one dimensional depth averaged mean concentration distribution on the other hand the effects of the most common reactions including competitive transfer bed absorption and bulk degradation on the transport and fates of contaminants have been analytically quantified the results will provide information of the critical length duration and peak concentration distribution of contaminant cloud beyond given standards and effectively support the environmental and health risk assessment and environmental management after contaminant discharged into the real wetland 5 conclusions ecological effects including various reactions exert considerable control on the contaminant transport process in the wetland flow which introduce much difficulty in predicting the contaminant concentration distribution this work presents a theoretical study of coupled bicomponent contaminant transport in the free surface wetland flow with the effects of competitive transfer bulk degradation and bed absorption through the decoupling transformation and the method of concentration moments the vertical and peak concentration distributions are concretely captured as the first time the results will bring important environmental implications such as strict environmental and health risk assessments the bicomponent contaminant is demonstrated to be largely subject to various reactions the masses of binary components retained in the flow decay but with different rate under the condition of different reaction the vertical concentration distribution shows tremendous non uniformity in the asymptotic dispersion stage three types of reactions in addition to the hydraulic dispersion further result into different change tendency of the vertical concentration distribution the peak concentration value is established to be obviously higher than the mean in the application the results suggest that the peak concentration rather than the mean should be based for strict environmental implements declaration of competing interest none declared acknowledgement this work is supported by the national

close to times of precipitation events the pan derived isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour was found to be closer to the ftir averages over longer periods including intervals with no precipitation overall this means that the pan method is far more effective for uninterrupted estimation of Î´ 2ha and Î´ 18oa of atmospheric water vapour as required for water budget studies than the precipitation equilibrium method and it is more cost effective and robust than continuous measurement keywords deuterium oxygen 18 precipitation evaporation pan atmospheric vapour isotopes 1 introduction losses of water due to evaporation from surface waters can be an important component of the terrestrial hydrological cycle particularly for arid and semi arid regions skrzypek et al 2015 measurements of the parameters required to determine the evaporative flux is often time consuming and costly especially for catchment scale studies an alternative technique is to use the natural variations in 2h 1h or 18o 16o to quantify evaporative loss e g van den akker et al 2011 gibson and reid 2014 jasechko et al 2014 skrzypek et al 2015 gibson et al 2016 however one of the parameters required is the isotopic composition of the evaporating moisture which is difficult to measure hence generally the craig and gordon model 1965 is used to estimate its value gibson et al 2008a additionally one of the parameters required by the craig and gordon model is the isotopic composition of the atmospheric moisture into which the evaporation is occurring Î´a over the continent Î´a can have considerable temporal and spatial variations horita et al 2008 purushothaman et al 2014 due to i air masses of different origins and rainout histories ii variation in the degree of day time vertical mixing which can cause the mixing of air close to the surface with air from the free atmosphere tsujimura et al 2007 and iii moisture originating from evapotranspiration over land which can also have a diurnal variation e g lee et al 2006 while diurnal variations in Î´a are observed lee et al 2006 found that the variation through the weather cycle was higher this parameter Î´a can be either determined from direct measurements or estimated direct measurements include cryogenic traps e g gibson et al 1999 vallet coulomb et al 2010 devi et al 2015 or using laser spectroscopy e g welp et al 2008 galewsky et al 2016 present an overview of techniques used to determine the isotopic composition of water vapour including discrete water vapour sampling cavity enhanced spectroscopy and remote sensing the alternative to direct measurements is to estimate Î´a either by liquid vapour equilibrium calculations based on knowledge of the isotopic composition of local rainfall or using evaporation pans the isotopic composition of water vapour at ground level has been shown to be close to equilibrium with precipitation in most cases over the continents from studies over europe and the usa araguÃ¡s araguÃ¡s et al 2000 however estimation of Î´a from precipitation records may not be suitable where the time period under consideration includes extended rain free periods gibson et al 1999 e g in arid climates gibson et al 2008a tsujimura et al 2007 or locations where local evaporation recycling affects vapour composition e g lakes gat et al 1994 devi et al 2015 an alternative is to use evaporation pans to derive the value of Î´a in the vicinity of the pan which is then assumed to be representative for predicating evaporative enrichment of downwind water bodies in the surrounding region evaporation pans have been widely used to determine irrigation schedules but more recently have been used to determine hydroclimatologic trends worldwide roderick et al 2009 in australia jovanovic et al 2008 reported on a long term pan evaporation trend using high quality pan data from 60 stations interestingly as an evaporation pan network is already in operation across australia and a large number of these locations record the required meteorological conditions jovanovic et al 2008 the potential exists to operationalize sampling of isotopes in pans and precipitation to permit calculation of Î´a across the continent with little additional cost gibson et al 1999 have detailed evaporation pan based models for determining Î´a for three water balance situations 1 a drying pan with no inflow 2 a drying pan with precipitation input and 3 a pan maintained at constant volume by the addition of water and precipitation previously welhan and fritz 1977 and allison and leaney 1982 had shown that constant volume evaporation pans can be reliable methods for determining Î´a of atmospheric moisture more recent studies using evaporation pans include wang et al 2009 vallet coulomb et al 2010 van den akker et al 2011 and devi et al 2015 to evaluate the evaporation pan technique for the determination of Î´a comparisons between pan derived Î´a and cryogenically trapped moisture have been published by a number of authors e g gibson et al 1999 vallet coulomb et al 2010 devi et al 2015 generally most studies report higher Î´ 2h measured from the vapour traps than in pan derived Î´a for example devi et al 2015 reported average differences between Î´2h values measured in vapour traps and pan derived Î´ 2h values of 19 50 and 25 85 for two separate sites with vapour trap values being more Î´ 2h enriched for Î´ 18o the differences were smaller 0 14 and 0 27 they attributed these differences to diurnal changes in air mass movement devi et al 2015 also reported that Î´a derived under the assumption of isotopic equilibrium with the precipitation was consistent with the pan derived values of Î´a many of the noted evaporation pan studies were of shorter duration weeks and estimates from pans were most commonly compared to vapour trap results two of the most recent studies were carried out in a mediterranean wetland vallet coulomb et al 2010 and in roorkee india devi et al 2015 here we present results from a 16 month study for an east australian site previous studies in australia include a 50 day experimental trial using custom designed constant feed pans reported by allison and leaney 1982 that showed good agreement between measured and modelled pan enrichment we use a similar model applicable for standard class a pan operation to determine Î´ a and compare results with measurements using an ftir optic spectrometer see haverd et al 2011 which were available at hourly time intervals early results from this study were presented in azcurra et al 2011 the aim of this study was to evaluate the pan method for the determination of the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapour by 1 using a longer time period to determine the atmospheric Î´a using the pan method than has been used in previous studies 2 comparison of the pan method determined Î´a with ftir measurement for which no previous studies have been reported 3

in this application and it was found that when n was set to 0 5 as used by vallet coulomb et al 2010 and devi et al 2015 the estimated results corresponded more closely to the measured values the value of Î´ a in eq 1 needs to be determined this can be either measured directly or determined from local precipitation or evaporation pan experiments gibson et al 1999 has detailed the equations

file 3 methods and data 3 1 study site the study site is located at the australian nuclear science and technology organisation ansto at lucas heights 34 03 s 150 59 e lucas heights is 30 km southwest of sydney and 18 km from the nearest coast to the east being at the southern edge of the sydney metropolitan area surface land use in the area is a mixture of suburban mainly to the east and north and natural bushland vegetation mainly to the south see supplementary fig s1 the site is located on the top of a plateau locally the topography is complex with changes in elevation of 150 m within 1 km of the site crawford et al 2011 chambers et al 2011 local meteorological conditions are monitored every 15 min from a 50 m instrumented tower wind speed and wind direction are measured at 10 and 49 m above ground level a g l for this investigation the 10 m a g l measurements were used in the cooler months of the year the wind direction is predominantly from the south west and in the warmer month predominantly from the east thus in the cooler month of the year the air masses arriving at lucas heights have a longer overland history whereas in the warmer months of the year there is a more recent oceanic fetch temperature and relative humidity from 2 m a g l was used when using the pan method to estimate the isotopic composition of the vapour the information required include 1 the isotopic composition of the pan water rainfall and feed water used to top up the pan 2 the pan temperature atmospheric temperature relative humidity and the amount of rainfall and feed water added further for evaluation of the method the measured isotopic composition of the vapour using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir is used the methods used to obtain these variables are detailed in the following sections 3 2 direct observations meteorological data were available from the lucas heights weather station operated by ansto the data consisted of manual measurements of daily pan evaporation to 9 am and daily precipitation amount to 9 am bom station 066078 with estimated accuracy of 0 05 mm and automated measurements bom station 066023 of the following rainfall tipping bucket rain gauge measurements at a frequency of 15 min greater of 0 25 mm or 2 air temperature at 2 m at a frequency of 15 min 0 05 c relative humidity at 2 m 0 05 and wind speed 0 05 m s and direction 0 05 at 10 m for the analysis the average hourly measurements were used 3 3 sampling 3 3 1 evaporation pan operation and sampling the evaporation pan has the standard dimensions of a class a pan with 1 2 m diameter and a depth of 0 25 m deep located on a wooden platform jovanovic et al 2008 water from the evaporation pan of the lucas heights weather station has been sampled at weekly intervals for isotope analysis since october 2006 as part of an ongoing project potable feed water at the site has also been sampled at weekly intervals along with precipitation collected over the same time intervals the evaporation pan is topped up or bailed if necessary at 9 am each day with water from the local potable supply to maintain a volume depth of 170 mm the volumes of potable water added to the pan and pan water removed from the pan were manually measured and recorded duplicate 30 ml samples of the pan and potable feed waters were taken for isotopic analysis at regular intervals of between six and eight days typically seven if pan water had significant algal growth or was noticeably turbid the pan was emptied and cleaned and filled to 170 mm with water from the potable supply in addition to the stable isotope data from the water samples the temperature of the water was also recorded as it was assumed that the pan water was well mixed a single bulk temperature measurement was taken at hourly intervals with an odyssey submersible temperature logger suspended in the pan water however in this study pan water temperature was routinely measured at mid depth rather than at the water surface an assessment was undertaken over a 4 day period where the temperature was measured both at the surface and at the bottom of the pan the main difference between the two temperatures was that during periods of warming the surface temperature increased before the temperature at the bottom of the pan the average percentage difference was 1 3 0 35 c and only 64 measurements out of the 382 measurements had a difference of more than 2 with the maximum difference being 7 6 2 c therefore the overall impact of this was minor a weekly time step was used for the purpose of pan modelling 3 3 2 precipitation sampling precipitation was sampled in a collector previously described by hughes and crawford 2013 where precipitation was accumulated over the time interval between pan samples from the weather station the collector consisted of a high density polyethylene hdpe plastic container fitted with a plastic funnel and venting tube similar to the simple collector described by grÃ¶ning et al 2012 the collector featured a submerged tube that connects the tip of the funnel directly to the bottom of the collection container to prevent evaporation of the sample and exchange with ambient vapour a 5 m long venting tube allows the air pressure in the bottle to equilibrate with outside atmospheric pressure while reducing the risk of diffusion this collection method was found to be comparable to collection in a container with a 1 cm layer of paraffin oil for events greater than 2 mm and better than composite samples from daily rain gauge samples hughes and crawford 2013 however it was noted that enrichment of samples could occur for precipitation volumes less than 5 mm depending on temperature and the time between precipitation and sample collection several time intervals consisted of composite precipitation samples as significant forecast precipitation necessitated the early change over of the precipitation collector in case of overflow 3 3 3 atmospheric vapour isotopes a low resolution fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer deployed at the lucas heights weather station was used to collect in situ measurements of Î´ 2h in ambient vapour the instrumentation used was similar to that described by haverd et al 2011 during the monitoring periods the ftir sampled air through heated sampling lines from a height of 10 m the ftir collects spectra continuously at a rate of approximately 2 hz however at this sampling rate the precision of the measurements was very poor averaging scans over 1 h produced a measurement precision 1Ï of 0 5 at mixing ratios between 5000 and 30000 ppm for comparison with pan derived Î´ a mean ftir measured vapour was compiled for the same time steps used in the evaporation pan modelling however as there were a number of gaps in the measured Î´ 2ha ftir for comparison purposes the average of the available ftir data in each period was used a test was also undertaken where if less than 24 measurements were missing linear interpolation was used to fill the gaps following which the average of the interpolated and available ftir data in each period was used this resulted in no improvement of the results hence the data without the interpolation is used in the remainder of the document further the percentage of time for which the Î´ 2ha ftir values were available was calculated supplementary data file column e and analysis was carried out and once again the percentage of time for which the ftir data was available had no significant impact on the results comparing ftir data at an elevation of 10 m with ground level pan derived Î´ a can be justified by reference to radon 222 measurements available at 2 m and 50 m above surface level at the site chambers et al 2011 radon 222 is a naturally occurring radioactive gas emitted from soil rocks and provides a measure of the extent of vertical mixing at lucas heights radon 222 measurements indicate strong vertical mixing between 10 am and 6 pm corresponding to the period of the largest evaporation rates parlange and katul 1992 hence it is expected that the vertical gradient of the isotopic composition of the vapour will not be significant due to the significant vertical mixing direct measurements of Î´ 2h of ambient vapour were only available between june 2009 and october 2010 hence this is the period used for this analysis a more detailed description of the operation of the ftir can be found in griffith et al 2006 in this application calibration was undertaken by vaporising liquid water of known isotopic composition with varying mixing ratios and then analysing it using the ftir at the time of this study spectral interference for 18o on the relatively low resolution ftir resulted in an unacceptable level of uncertainty for Î´ 18o 3 4 laboratory analysis Î´ 2h and Î´ 18o were determined for 184 samples of pan water precipitation and feed water collected at weekly intervals results are expressed in per mille and reported relative to vsmow isotope analyses were conducted at the ansto environmental isotope laboratories n 169 and the alberta research council n 15 at the alberta research council laboratory arc samples were analysed using a delta v advantage dual inlet mass spectrometer with an hdevice peripheral for Î´ 2h and a gasbench ii peripheral for Î´ 18o at ansto samples were analysed using a picarro l1115 i cavity ring down spectroscopy crds method in house standards established by runs with vsmow2 and slap2 at ansto ails 001 Î´ 2h 32 5 Î´ 18o 7 47 ails 004 Î´ 2h 174 0 Î´ 18o 22 19 and arc std1 Î´ 2h 17 4 Î´ 18o 4 69 std2 Î´ 2h 170 8 Î´ 18o 22 41 were run as samples to allow the results to properly be reported vs vsmow nelson 2000 results are accurate to 1 for Î´ 2h and 0 2 for Î´ 18o for arc and 1 0 for Î´ 2h and 0 15 for Î´ 18o for ansto the data are reported relative to vsmow on scales normalized such that Î´ 18o and Î´ 2h values of slap are 55 5 and 428 relative to vsmow data were checked for outliers and as a result two feedwater data points were rejected because feedwater isotope composition varies slowly over time the composition was estimated by interpolation 3 5 data combined to determine an evaporation pan derived Î´a in this study a constant volume pan was used for the determination of Î´a given atmospheric temperature and humidity pan temperature precipitation amount feed water amount and the isotopic compositions of the feed water precipitation and water body the value of Î´a can be determined by nonlinear least squares methods where the difference between the measured Î´l and that predicted by eq 8 section 2 2 is minimised the meteorological variables were available on an hourly basis whereas pan evaporation amount was available on daily basis and the isotopic composition of pan water feed water and precipitation were available on weekly basis as a result a weekly time step was used in eq 8 for the determination of Î´a using the arithmetic average values of the meteorological variables 4 results and discussion this results and discussion section compares the results of three different methods of estimating the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapour over 16 months direct measurements of Î´2h by fourier transform infrared spectrometer Î´ 2ha ftir estimates of Î´2h and Î´18o using the pan method Î´ 2ha pan Î´ 18oa pan estimates of Î´2h and Î´18o using precipitation equilibrium Î´ 2ha precip Î´ 18oa precip 4 1 measured Î´2h of vapour measured Î´ 2h in the vapour Î´ 2ha ftir ranged between 199 71 and 47 20 and systematic variations with wind speed and direction were noted fig 1 left overall more negative values of Î´ 2h in vapour occurred when the wind direction was from the northwest especially at higher wind speeds this pattern is interpreted to arise in situations where the air mass has travelled long distances over the continent and undergone significant rainout as well as addition of moisture derived from evaporative recycling these air masses typically show lower atmospheric relative humidity fig 1 right in contrast air masses arriving from the northeast and southeast along fetches characterized by more recent oceanic passage tend to have higher relative humidity and typically have higher Î´ 2h analysis of seasonal trends in wind speed and direction at the study site fig 2 reveal that westerly wind setup is more common during may to august late autumn winter leading to more negative values of Î´ 2h in precipitation and atmospheric moisture at this time consistent with the findings of lee et al 2006 seasonal isotopic variations fig 3 a were more pronounced than diurnal variations fig 3b including both summer fig 3c and winter periods fig 3d little diurnal variation was observed at this site a similar trend was also observed by cai et al 2015 which was attributed to low impact of atmospheric vapour from local evapotranspiration on the isotopic composition 4 2 derived Î´2h and Î´18o of vapour 4 2 1 arithmetic averages the statistics for the Î´a estimates using the three methods measured using the ftir and derived using the pan and equilibrium with precipitation are presented in table 1 a high degree of correlation was seen between Î´ 2ha pan and Î´ 18oa pan r 0 93 p value of 0 00 this correlation is higher than that reported by gibson et al 1999 with r 0 60 and devi et al 2015 with r 0 66 precipitation derived Î´2h values of atmospheric moisture Î´ 2ha precip ranged between 158 7 and 64 2 and the Î´ 18oa precip values ranged between 21 26 and 9 82 with an r value of 0 94 the lowest values of Î´ 2ha precip corresponded to a 9 mm precipitation event that will be discussed later on fig 4 presents the bi variate plots of Î´ 2h versus Î´ 18o for the measured isotopic values of precipitation Î´precip and the pan water Î´l as well as the estimated isotopic values of atmospheric moisture Î´a precip and Î´a pan the local meteoric water line lmwl is also shown Î´ 2h 7 84Î´ 18o 14 r2 0 94 which is derived using the weekly precipitation isotopic values collected over the period of this study this is close to the lmwl

with previous surface water studies in the region i e gibson et al 2008b meredith et al 2009 the precipitation equilibrium estimates of atmospheric vapour Î´a precip plot on or slightly below the lmwl whereas the Î´a pan values are scattered more evenly around the lmwl on a line with a lower slope 4 11 which is close to the lel this was also found in previous studies e g gibson et al 1999 devi et al 2015 this is likely due to use of relative humidity at 2 m height rather than directly above the evaporation pan as detailed in section 4 5 relative humidity has a significant impact on the determined Î´a pan values 4 2 2 evaporation flux weighted Î´2ha ftir values given that daily pan evaporation rates were available we compare the Î´a pan values on a weekly basis against the weekly evaporation flux weighted Î´ 2ha ftir values this was achieved by first obtaining a daily arithmetic average value of Î´ 2ha ftir and then converting this to a weekly evaporation flux weighted Î´ 2ha ftir value by using the daily measured pan evaporation rates the correlation between Î´ 2ha pan and the evaporation flux weighted Î´ 2ha ftir values r 0 68 was marginally lower than that for arithmetic averages shown in fig 5 the largest difference occurred between the following dates 29 09 2009 06 10 2009 24 9 15 12 2009 22 12 2009 23 0 and 20 07 2010 27 07 2010 22 7 where 92 66 and 95 of the Î´2ha ftir data was available in these three cases the difference between Î´ 2ha ftir and Î´ 2ha precip were low 9 0 4 3 and 1 5 respectively for these periods there were 43 9 and 15 h during which rainfall occurred the rainfall duration explains the difference for the first case however the difference for the middle case could well be due to the lower percentage of the Î´2ha ftir available data during the period of missing data a large proportion of the wind was from the south east sector as opposed to predominantly from the north east sector during the period of available data as seen in fig 1 a large variation in Î´2ha ftir can be seen between these quadrants mainly due to the distance from the site to the nearest ocean in each direction larger values in the north east quadrant and more variable and lower values in the south east quadrant for this period the Î´ 2ha pan value was 104 2 as opposed to 81 6 for the evaporation flux weighted Î´ 2ha ftir value for the last period rainfall had occurred on four out of the seven days which could explain the reason for Î´ 2ha ftir being closer to Î´ 2ha precip than Î´ 2ha pan while the evaporation rate can vary on diurnal scales given that for instance the relative humidity and temperature exhibit diurnal variations see supplementary fig s2 a and b from fig 3 the diurnal variation of Î´ 2ha ftir is low this can also be seen in supplementary fig s2c where small variations in the hourly average values are only seen for winter this is an indication that the pan derived estimations will not vary significantly if hourly evaporation rates were considered 4 3 difference between measured and pan derived Î´2h of vapour when pan derived Î´ 2ha pan and ftir measured Î´ 2ha ftir values of atmospheric moisture were compared a significant correlation was seen r 0 7 p value 0 00 fig 5a Î´ 2ha pan varied between 121 7 and 70 5 whereas average ftir measurements over the same period varied between 123 3 and 78 6 the difference Î´ 2ha pan Î´ 2ha ftir spanned a range from 25 0 to 20 4 with a mean absolute difference of 8 0 these results show a smaller difference between measured and estimated values than was reported in devi et al 2015 a more interesting result was that the Î´ 2ha ftir values were not consistently higher than the Î´ 2ha pan values as found in devi et al 2015 in fact the differences were almost evenly distributed on either side of zero with 33 weeks having a difference of less than zero and 30 weeks having a difference greater than zero however in devi et al 2015 the vapour trap measurements were carried out between 9 30 am and 3 30 pm whereas in this study continuous hourly values of Î´ 2ha ftir were available and the value used for the comparison was the average over the period covering the pan calculation for the current study site marginally higher values of Î´ 2ha ftir were seen in the daily measurement time window used by devi et al 2015 fig 3a which may account for some of this difference also devi et al 2015 used daily calculations whereas in this case weekly calculations were used which might smooth out the results humidity rather than temperature wind speed or wind direction was found to be the dominant control on the degree of match between Î´ 2ha pan and Î´ 2ha ftir higher differences were seen at low and high relative humidity when the relative humidity was above 85 Î´ 2ha pan was higher by more than 9 than Î´ 2ha ftir for seven cases and was lower only for two cases this is consistent with reports by kumar and nachiappan 1999 who noted high uncertainty in the estimation of isotopic composition of evaporating moisture for relative humidity above 75 correlation between relative humidity and Î´ 2ha pan Î´ 2ha ftir was weak but significant r 0 32 p value 0 01 a correlation was seen between the difference and the standard deviation of either the air temperature or pan temperature r 0 39 p value 0 01 which reflects the diurnal range no significant relationship was seen between the rainfall amount and Î´ 2ha pan Î´ 2ha ftir the assumption of the craig gordon model that there is no divergence is not fully met for a pan particularly under low humidity when there is effectively a larger sink and higher evaporation as evaporating pan moisture disperses into the air in addition in this study wind speed was higher under lower humidity which would increase this effect under lower humidity conditions the net effect would be for the pan method to estimate lower Î´a values in comparison to those measured with the ftir conversely for high humidity the measured wind speed was lower and the evaporation rate was probably more consistently low due to both less diurnal fluctuation in temperature i e low temperature standard deviation and lower humidity gradient between pan and air for the equilibrium component this should cause no concern but instead the assumption of turbulent flow underpinning the choice of n for kinetic fractionation eq 2 may need to be adjusted should it be more laminar and could this be parameterised as a function of humidity and wind speed for the pan model this was tested by replacing n in eq 2 from 0 5 to 1 which resulted in a small improvement in the estimated Î´ 2ha pan with the difference Î´ 2ha pan Î´ 2ha ftir when the relative humidity was above 80 reducing to 9 8 9 8 13 8 and 12 1 from 10 3 11 7 14 6 and 12 4 respectively when a value of 0 5 was used for n a further test was undertaken where eqs 8 11 were used to determine the Î´2h values of the pan water at the end of each week using the measured Î´ 2ha ftir value for Î´a in eq 10 the correlation coefficient between the measured and estimated Î´2h values of the pan water was r 0 76 p value of 0 00 fig 5b with the largest differences occurring under higher relative humidity a strong and significant correlation r 0 99 was seen between the differences of the measurements and estimates for Î´ 2h values of pan water Î´l Î´l estimated and Î´2h values of atmospheric vapour Î´ 2ha pan Î´ 2ha ftir 4 4 difference between measured and precipitation derived Î´2h of vapour precipitation equilibrium estimates of the isotopic composition of the atmospheric vapour Î´ 2ha precip are more poorly correlated with Î´ 2ha ftir overall r 0 58 p value 0 00 than Î´ 2ha pan is due to a marked difference for a number of time intervals fig 6 this difference was the largest for periods when less precipitation was recorded however these differences are considered to be predominantly due to the seven day averaging time used in the calculations the first interval with a large discrepancy between Î´ 2ha precip and Î´ 2ha ftir was noted for the seven days ending on 21 july 2009 average Î´2ha ftir for that period was 119 2 whereas the estimated Î´2ha precip value was 158 7 a difference of 39 5 the precipitation occurred over a six hour period on 17 july 2009 and had an Î´ 2h value of 74 9 over this period the average Î´ 2ha ftir value was 140 7 which is closer to the estimated Î´ 2ha precip thus the precipitation derived isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour was more representative of conditions during the precipitation event than during the entire week for a second seven day period ending on 6 april 2010 Î´ 2ha precip was estimated to be 139 4 while the seven day average measured Î´ 2ha ftir was 97 9 however during the precipitation event the average measured Î´ 2ha ftir was 140 4 very close to the estimated value this demonstrates that using the assumption that the isotopic composition of the atmospheric vapour is in equilibrium with the isotopic composition of precipitation is not valid after some time has passed since the end of the precipitation event this is clearly demonstrated in fig 7 where prior to the precipitation event the measured Î´ 2ha ftir value was around 100 0 during the precipitation event the value went down to less than 150 0 and after the precipitation event it returned to above 100 0 inspection of the Î´ 2ha ftir hourly time series shows that where precipitation leads to a distinct change in the Î´ 2ha ftir this change generally only persists for a period of 6 36 h before the atmospheric vapour returns to a similar composition to that seen before the precipitation event while equilibrium with precipitation appears to accurately capture conditions during precipitation periods it may be less appropriate than evaporation pans for predicting conditions over longer periods especially during drier conditions we find pan derived Î´ a to be closer to measured values using ftir over weekly periods due to the intrinsic temporal flux weighting of pans they appear to provide more representative records for nearby evaporation studies in addition at this study site precipitation had occurred for only 7 6 of the study period and precipitation was above 5 mm h for only 0 4 of the study period on an hourly basis this is an additional indication of the benefit of the pan derived method 4 5 sensitivity analysis to determine most important parameters to determine which parameters are most significant in the determination of Î´ 2ha pan and Î´ 18oa pan a sensitivity analysis was carried out by perturbing each measured value of the parameters by 10 one parameter at a time following this the root mean square error rmse between the pan derived isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour as determined by the base case and the perturbed case was determined where the measured values of the parameters were used in the base case from the results in table 2 it can be inferred that the most important parameter is relative humidity followed by air temperature and pan temperature an increase in relative humidity results in a higher estimate of both Î´ 2ha pan and Î´ 18oa pan values and vice versa on the other hand an increase in air temperature which would result in lower relative humidity under conditions of no change in specific humidity results in lower estimates of both Î´ 2ha pan and Î´ 18oa pan values and vice versa the influence on the Î´ 18oa pan values is proportionally greater than that on Î´ 2ha pan values due to differences in the equilibrium vapour pressure of the two heavy isotopologues the importance of relative humidity in the craig gordon model has previously been identified in a study by kumar and nachiappan 1999 where errors in the measured parameters were propagated to the estimate they concluded that an error in the relative humidity would result in errors in the estimated isotopic composition of the evaporating moisture furthermore errors in the other parameters were more significant for relative humidity above 80 when only the isotopic composition of pan water feed water and precipitation was considered the isotopic composition of the pan water was the most important parameter consistent with the finding of vallet coulomb et al 2010 vallet coulomb et al 2010 undertook sensitivity studies based on the accuracy of measurements of various parameters in the craig gordon model they found that the uncertainty in the measurement of the isotopic composition of the pan water was the most important and that the uncertainty in the estimation of the isotopic composition of the evaporating vapour was higher than the error in the estimation of the isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour i e Î´a further the importance of the relative humidity was also stressed and diurnal variation in the relative humidity was a potential source of uncertainty when sensitivity to errors relating to measurement uncertainty are considered table 2 right smaller errors are expected aside from the amount of water added to the pan however these errors are still an order of magnitude smaller than the errors due to uncertainty in the meteorological variables 5 conclusions the isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour has been determined by using two methods 1 the pan method and 2 equilibrium with local precipitation and compared against measurements using the ftir a complication in the pan derived Î´ a estimation procedure was that the pan isotopic composition was available on weekly time scales the evaporation rate was available on daily time scales and the atmospheric variables were available on hourly time scales as the weekly time scale had to be used for the pan calculations in one set of estimates the arithmetic averages of the atmospheric variables were used in this case good agreement was seen between the pan derived and the ftir measured Î´ 2ha the difference between pan derived and ftir measured Î´ 2ha ranged from 25 0 to 20 4 with the mean of the absolute difference being 8 0 the cost of deployment of instruments such as the ftir and their continuous maintenance is higher while evaporation pans are more robust and require less maintenance while the precipitation equilibrium approach produces good results close to the precipitation event if average values are required over a longer period the pan derived isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour was closer to the average of the measured values over the same period this means that because the pan method enables Î´a to be estimated regardless of whether precipitation has occurred it can provide a far more accurate continuous dataset than can be achieved using precipitation equilibrium and at far less cost than continuous measurements in addition at this study site precipitation had occurred for only 7 6 of the study period which is an additional indication of the benefit of the pan method potential users of the pan method need to ensure accurate measurements of the atmospheric relative humidity and the isotopic composition of the pan water and need to take caution with results for relative humidity above 80 declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge jim pascoe and leisa dyer and the ansto environmental monitoring team for the

6311,for a period of 16 months in sydney australia the variations of 2h 1h and 18o 16o in atmospheric vapour Î´ 2ha and Î´ 18oa were estimated using an evaporation pan method as well as using the isotopic precipitation equilibrium approach these calculations were then compared with Î´2ha values measured at 10 m above ground surface using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir as pan isotopic composition was available on a weekly time scale the evaporation rates were measured daily and the atmospheric variables were available hourly the weekly time scale was used to calculate the arithmetic averages of the atmospheric variables that were used in the estimation of the pan derived Î´ 2ha good agreement r 0 7 p value 0 00 was found between the pan derived and the ftir measured Î´ 2ha for weekly intervals although individual differences ranged from 25 0 to 20 4 with the absolute difference averaging 8 0 a sensitivity analysis showed that the determination of Î´ 2ha is most sensitive to air temperature relative humidity and the isotopic composition of the pan water while the precipitation equilibrium approach only appears to be representative of atmospheric conditions close to times of precipitation events the pan derived isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour was found to be closer to the ftir averages over longer periods including intervals with no precipitation overall this means that the pan method is far more effective for uninterrupted estimation of Î´ 2ha and Î´ 18oa of atmospheric water vapour as required for water budget studies than the precipitation equilibrium method and it is more cost effective and robust than continuous measurement keywords deuterium oxygen 18 precipitation evaporation pan atmospheric vapour isotopes 1 introduction losses of water due to evaporation from surface waters can be an important component of the terrestrial hydrological cycle particularly for arid and semi arid regions skrzypek et al 2015 measurements of the parameters required to determine the evaporative flux is often time consuming and costly especially for catchment scale studies an alternative technique is to use the natural variations in 2h 1h or 18o 16o to quantify evaporative loss e g van den akker et al 2011 gibson and reid 2014 jasechko et al 2014 skrzypek et al 2015 gibson et al 2016 however one of the parameters required is the isotopic composition of the evaporating moisture which is difficult to measure hence generally the craig and gordon model 1965 is used to estimate its value gibson et al 2008a additionally one of the parameters required by the craig and gordon model is the isotopic composition of the atmospheric moisture into which the evaporation is occurring Î´a over the continent Î´a can have considerable temporal and spatial variations horita et al 2008 purushothaman et al 2014 due to i air masses of different origins and rainout histories ii variation in the degree of day time vertical mixing which can cause the mixing of air close to the surface with air from the free atmosphere tsujimura et al 2007 and iii moisture originating from evapotranspiration over land which can also have a diurnal variation e g lee et al 2006 while diurnal variations in Î´a are observed lee et al 2006 found that the variation through the weather cycle was higher this parameter Î´a can be either determined from direct measurements or estimated direct measurements include cryogenic traps e g gibson et al 1999 vallet coulomb et al 2010 devi et al 2015 or using laser spectroscopy e g welp et al 2008 galewsky et al 2016 present an overview of techniques used to determine the isotopic composition of water vapour including discrete water vapour sampling cavity enhanced spectroscopy and remote sensing the alternative to direct measurements is to estimate Î´a either by liquid vapour equilibrium calculations based on knowledge of the isotopic composition of local rainfall or using evaporation pans the isotopic composition of water vapour at ground level has been shown to be close to equilibrium with precipitation in most cases over the continents from studies over europe and the usa araguÃ¡s araguÃ¡s et al 2000 however estimation of Î´a from precipitation records may not be suitable where the time period under consideration includes extended rain free periods gibson et al 1999 e g in arid climates gibson et al 2008a tsujimura et al 2007 or locations where local evaporation recycling affects vapour composition e g lakes gat et al 1994 devi et al 2015 an alternative is to use evaporation pans to derive the value of Î´a in the vicinity of the pan which is then assumed to be representative for predicating evaporative enrichment of downwind water bodies in the surrounding region evaporation pans have been widely used to determine irrigation schedules but more recently have been used to determine hydroclimatologic trends worldwide roderick et al 2009 in australia jovanovic et al 2008 reported on a long term pan evaporation trend using high quality pan data from 60 stations interestingly as an evaporation pan network is already in operation across australia and a large number of these locations record the required meteorological conditions jovanovic et al 2008 the potential exists to operationalize sampling of isotopes in pans and precipitation to permit calculation of Î´a across the continent with little additional cost gibson et al 1999 have detailed evaporation pan based models for determining Î´a for three water balance situations 1 a drying pan with no inflow 2 a drying pan with precipitation input and 3 a pan maintained at constant volume by the addition of water and precipitation previously welhan and fritz 1977 and allison and leaney 1982 had shown that constant volume evaporation pans can be reliable methods for determining Î´a of atmospheric moisture more recent studies using evaporation pans include wang et al 2009 vallet coulomb et al 2010 van den akker et al 2011 and devi et al 2015 to evaluate the evaporation pan technique for the determination of Î´a comparisons between pan derived Î´a and cryogenically trapped moisture have been published by a number of authors e g gibson et al 1999 vallet coulomb et al 2010 devi et al 2015 generally most studies report higher Î´ 2h measured from the vapour traps than in pan derived Î´a for example devi et al 2015 reported average differences between Î´2h values measured in vapour traps and pan derived Î´ 2h values of 19 50 and 25 85 for two separate sites with vapour trap values being more Î´ 2h enriched for Î´ 18o the differences were smaller 0 14 and 0 27 they attributed these differences to diurnal changes in air mass movement devi et al 2015 also reported that Î´a derived under the assumption of isotopic equilibrium with the precipitation was consistent with the pan derived values of Î´a many of the noted evaporation pan studies were of shorter duration weeks and estimates from pans were most commonly compared to vapour trap results two of the most recent studies were carried out in a mediterranean wetland vallet coulomb et al 2010 and in roorkee india devi et al 2015 here we present results from a 16 month study for an east australian site previous studies in australia include a 50 day experimental trial using custom designed constant feed pans reported by allison and leaney 1982 that showed good agreement between measured and modelled pan enrichment we use a similar model applicable for standard class a pan operation to determine Î´ a and compare results with measurements using an ftir optic spectrometer see haverd et al 2011 which were available at hourly time intervals early results from this study were presented in azcurra et al 2011 the aim of this study was to evaluate the pan method for the determination of the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapour by 1 using a longer time period to determine the atmospheric Î´a using the pan method than has been used in previous studies 2 comparison of the pan method determined Î´a with ftir measurement for which no previous studies have been reported 3

in this application and it was found that when n was set to 0 5 as used by vallet coulomb et al 2010 and devi et al 2015 the estimated results corresponded more closely to the measured values the value of Î´ a in eq 1 needs to be determined this can be either measured directly or determined from local precipitation or evaporation pan experiments gibson et al 1999 has detailed the equations

file 3 methods and data 3 1 study site the study site is located at the australian nuclear science and technology organisation ansto at lucas heights 34 03 s 150 59 e lucas heights is 30 km southwest of sydney and 18 km from the nearest coast to the east being at the southern edge of the sydney metropolitan area surface land use in the area is a mixture of suburban mainly to the east and north and natural bushland vegetation mainly to the south see supplementary fig s1 the site is located on the top of a plateau locally the topography is complex with changes in elevation of 150 m within 1 km of the site crawford et al 2011 chambers et al 2011 local meteorological conditions are monitored every 15 min from a 50 m instrumented tower wind speed and wind direction are measured at 10 and 49 m above ground level a g l for this investigation the 10 m a g l measurements were used in the cooler months of the year the wind direction is predominantly from the south west and in the warmer month predominantly from the east thus in the cooler month of the year the air masses arriving at lucas heights have a longer overland history whereas in the warmer months of the year there is a more recent oceanic fetch temperature and relative humidity from 2 m a g l was used when using the pan method to estimate the isotopic composition of the vapour the information required include 1 the isotopic composition of the pan water rainfall and feed water used to top up the pan 2 the pan temperature atmospheric temperature relative humidity and the amount of rainfall and feed water added further for evaluation of the method the measured isotopic composition of the vapour using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir is used the methods used to obtain these variables are detailed in the following sections 3 2 direct observations meteorological data were available from the lucas heights weather station operated by ansto the data consisted of manual measurements of daily pan evaporation to 9 am and daily precipitation amount to 9 am bom station 066078 with estimated accuracy of 0 05 mm and automated measurements bom station 066023 of the following rainfall tipping bucket rain gauge measurements at a frequency of 15 min greater of 0 25 mm or 2 air temperature at 2 m at a frequency of 15 min 0 05 c relative humidity at 2 m 0 05 and wind speed 0 05 m s and direction 0 05 at 10 m for the analysis the average hourly measurements were used 3 3 sampling 3 3 1 evaporation pan operation and sampling the evaporation pan has the standard dimensions of a class a pan with 1 2 m diameter and a depth of 0 25 m deep located on a wooden platform jovanovic et al 2008 water from the evaporation pan of the lucas heights weather station has been sampled at weekly intervals for isotope analysis since october 2006 as part of an ongoing project potable feed water at the site has also been sampled at weekly intervals along with precipitation collected over the same time intervals the evaporation pan is topped up or bailed if necessary at 9 am each day with water from the local potable supply to maintain a volume depth of 170 mm the volumes of potable water added to the pan and pan water removed from the pan were manually measured and recorded duplicate 30 ml samples of the pan and potable feed waters were taken for isotopic analysis at regular intervals of between six and eight days typically seven if pan water had significant algal growth or was noticeably turbid the pan was emptied and cleaned and filled to 170 mm with water from the potable supply in addition to the stable isotope data from the water samples the temperature of the water was also recorded as it was assumed that the pan water was well mixed a single bulk temperature measurement was taken at hourly intervals with an odyssey submersible temperature logger suspended in the pan water however in this study pan water temperature was routinely measured at mid depth rather than at the water surface an assessment was undertaken over a 4 day period where the temperature was measured both at the surface and at the bottom of the pan the main difference between the two temperatures was that during periods of warming the surface temperature increased before the temperature at the bottom of the pan the average percentage difference was 1 3 0 35 c and only 64 measurements out of the 382 measurements had a difference of more than 2 with the maximum difference being 7 6 2 c therefore the overall impact of this was minor a weekly time step was used for the purpose of pan modelling 3 3 2 precipitation sampling precipitation was sampled in a collector previously described by hughes and crawford 2013 where precipitation was accumulated over the time interval between pan samples from the weather station the collector consisted of a high density polyethylene hdpe plastic container fitted with a plastic funnel and venting tube similar to the simple collector described by grÃ¶ning et al 2012 the collector featured a submerged tube that connects the tip of the funnel directly to the bottom of the collection container to prevent evaporation of the sample and exchange with ambient vapour a 5 m long venting tube allows the air pressure in the bottle to equilibrate with outside atmospheric pressure while reducing the risk of diffusion this collection method was found to be comparable to collection in a container with a 1 cm layer of paraffin oil for events greater than 2 mm and better than composite samples from daily rain gauge samples hughes and crawford 2013 however it was noted that enrichment of samples could occur for precipitation volumes less than 5 mm depending on temperature and the time between precipitation and sample collection several time intervals consisted of composite precipitation samples as significant forecast precipitation necessitated the early change over of the precipitation collector in case of overflow 3 3 3 atmospheric vapour isotopes a low resolution fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer deployed at the lucas heights weather station was used to collect in situ measurements of Î´ 2h in ambient vapour the instrumentation used was similar to that described by haverd et al 2011 during the monitoring periods the ftir sampled air through heated sampling lines from a height of 10 m the ftir collects spectra continuously at a rate of approximately 2 hz however at this sampling rate the precision of the measurements was very poor averaging scans over 1 h produced a measurement precision 1Ï of 0 5 at mixing ratios between 5000 and 30000 ppm for comparison with pan derived Î´ a mean ftir measured vapour was compiled for the same time steps used in the evaporation pan modelling however as there were a number of gaps in the measured Î´ 2ha ftir for comparison purposes the average of the available ftir data in each period was used a test was also undertaken where if less than 24 measurements were missing linear interpolation was used to fill the gaps following which the average of the interpolated and available ftir data in each period was used this resulted in no improvement of the results hence the data without the interpolation is used in the remainder of the document further the percentage of time for which the Î´ 2ha ftir values were available was calculated supplementary data file column e and analysis was carried out and once again the percentage of time for which the ftir data was available had no significant impact on the results comparing ftir data at an elevation of 10 m with ground level pan derived Î´ a can be justified by reference to radon 222 measurements available at 2 m and 50 m above surface level at the site chambers et al 2011 radon 222 is a naturally occurring radioactive gas emitted from soil rocks and provides a measure of the extent of vertical mixing at lucas heights radon 222 measurements indicate strong vertical mixing between 10 am and 6 pm corresponding to the period of the largest evaporation rates parlange and katul 1992 hence it is expected that the vertical gradient of the isotopic composition of the vapour will not be significant due to the significant vertical mixing direct measurements of Î´ 2h of ambient vapour were only available between june 2009 and october 2010 hence this is the period used for this analysis a more detailed description of the operation of the ftir can be found in griffith et al 2006 in this application calibration was undertaken by vaporising liquid water of known isotopic composition with varying mixing ratios and then analysing it using the ftir at the time of this study spectral interference for 18o on the relatively low resolution ftir resulted in an unacceptable level of uncertainty for Î´ 18o 3 4 laboratory analysis Î´ 2h and Î´ 18o were determined for 184 samples of pan water precipitation and feed water collected at weekly intervals results are expressed in per mille and reported relative to vsmow isotope analyses were conducted at the ansto environmental isotope laboratories n 169 and the alberta research council n 15 at the alberta research council laboratory arc samples were analysed using a delta v advantage dual inlet mass spectrometer with an hdevice peripheral for Î´ 2h and a gasbench ii peripheral for Î´ 18o at ansto samples were analysed using a picarro l1115 i cavity ring down spectroscopy crds method in house standards established by runs with vsmow2 and slap2 at ansto ails 001 Î´ 2h 32 5 Î´ 18o 7 47 ails 004 Î´ 2h 174 0 Î´ 18o 22 19 and arc std1 Î´ 2h 17 4 Î´ 18o 4 69 std2 Î´ 2h 170 8 Î´ 18o 22 41 were run as samples to allow the results to properly be reported vs vsmow nelson 2000 results are accurate to 1 for Î´ 2h and 0 2 for Î´ 18o for arc and 1 0 for Î´ 2h and 0 15 for Î´ 18o for ansto the data are reported relative to vsmow on scales normalized such that Î´ 18o and Î´ 2h values of slap are 55 5 and 428 relative to vsmow data were checked for outliers and as a result two feedwater data points were rejected because feedwater isotope composition varies slowly over time the composition was estimated by interpolation 3 5 data combined to determine an evaporation pan derived Î´a in this study a constant volume pan was used for the determination of Î´a given atmospheric temperature and humidity pan temperature precipitation amount feed water amount and the isotopic compositions of the feed water precipitation and water body the value of Î´a can be determined by nonlinear least squares methods where the difference between the measured Î´l and that predicted by eq 8 section 2 2 is minimised the meteorological variables were available on an hourly basis whereas pan evaporation amount was available on daily basis and the isotopic composition of pan water feed water and precipitation were available on weekly basis as a result a weekly time step was used in eq 8 for the determination of Î´a using the arithmetic average values of the meteorological variables 4 results and discussion this results and discussion section compares the results of three different methods of estimating the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapour over 16 months direct measurements of Î´2h by fourier transform infrared spectrometer Î´ 2ha ftir estimates of Î´2h and Î´18o using the pan method Î´

and 47 20 and systematic variations with wind speed and direction were noted fig 1 left overall more negative values of Î´ 2h in vapour occurred when the wind direction was from the northwest especially at higher wind speeds this pattern is interpreted to arise in situations where the air mass has travelled long distances over the continent and undergone significant rainout as well as addition of moisture derived from evaporative recycling these air masses typically show lower atmospheric relative humidity fig 1 right in contrast air masses arriving from the northeast and southeast along fetches characterized by more recent oceanic passage tend to have higher relative humidity and typically have higher Î´ 2h analysis of seasonal trends in wind speed and direction at the study site fig 2 reveal that westerly wind setup is more common during may to august late autumn winter leading to more negative values of Î´ 2h in precipitation and atmospheric moisture at this time consistent with the findings of lee et al 2006 seasonal isotopic variations fig 3 a were more pronounced than diurnal variations fig 3b including both summer fig 3c and winter periods fig 3d little diurnal variation was observed at this site a similar trend was also observed by cai et al 2015 which was attributed to low impact of atmospheric vapour from local evapotranspiration on the isotopic composition 4 2 derived Î´2h and Î´18o of vapour 4 2 1 arithmetic averages the statistics for the Î´a estimates using the three methods measured using the ftir and derived using the pan and equilibrium with precipitation are presented in table 1 a high degree of correlation was seen between Î´ 2ha pan and Î´ 18oa pan r 0 93 p value of 0 00 this correlation is higher than that reported by gibson et al 1999 with r 0 60 and devi et al 2015 with r 0 66 precipitation derived Î´2h values of atmospheric moisture Î´ 2ha precip ranged between 158 7 and 64 2 and the Î´ 18oa precip values ranged between 21 26 and 9 82 with an r value of 0 94 the lowest values of Î´ 2ha precip corresponded to a 9 mm precipitation event that will be discussed later on fig 4 presents the bi variate plots of Î´ 2h versus Î´ 18o for the measured isotopic values of precipitation Î´precip and the pan water Î´l as well as the estimated isotopic values of atmospheric moisture Î´a precip and Î´a pan the local meteoric water line lmwl is also shown Î´ 2h 7 84Î´ 18o 14 r2 0 94 which is derived using the weekly precipitation isotopic values collected over the period of this study this is close to the lmwl

with previous surface water studies in the region i e gibson et al 2008b meredith et al 2009 the precipitation equilibrium estimates of atmospheric vapour Î´a precip plot on or slightly below the lmwl whereas the Î´a pan values are scattered more evenly around the lmwl on a line with a lower slope 4 11 which is close to the lel this was also found in previous studies e g gibson et al 1999 devi et al 2015 this is likely due to use of relative humidity at 2 m height rather than directly above the evaporation pan as detailed in section 4 5 relative humidity has a significant impact on the determined Î´a pan values 4 2 2 evaporation flux weighted Î´2ha ftir values given that daily pan evaporation rates were available we compare the Î´a pan values on a weekly basis against the weekly evaporation flux weighted Î´ 2ha ftir values this was achieved by first obtaining a daily arithmetic average value of Î´ 2ha ftir and then converting this to a weekly evaporation flux weighted Î´ 2ha ftir value by using the daily measured pan evaporation rates the correlation between Î´ 2ha pan and the evaporation flux weighted Î´ 2ha ftir values r 0 68 was marginally lower than that for arithmetic averages shown in fig 5 the largest difference occurred between the following dates 29 09 2009 06 10 2009 24 9 15 12 2009 22 12 2009 23 0 and 20 07 2010 27 07 2010 22 7 where 92 66 and 95 of the Î´2ha ftir data was available in these three cases the difference between Î´ 2ha ftir and Î´ 2ha precip were low 9 0 4 3 and 1 5 respectively for these periods there were 43 9 and 15 h during which rainfall occurred the rainfall duration explains the difference for the first case however the difference for the middle case could well be due to the lower percentage of the Î´2ha ftir available data during the period of missing data a large proportion of the wind was from the south east sector as opposed to predominantly from the north east sector during the period of available data as seen in fig 1 a large variation in Î´2ha ftir can be seen between these quadrants mainly due to the distance from the site to the nearest ocean in each direction larger values in the north east quadrant and more variable and lower values in the south east quadrant for this period the Î´ 2ha pan value was 104 2 as opposed to 81 6 for the evaporation flux weighted Î´ 2ha ftir value for the last period rainfall had occurred on four out of the seven days which could explain the reason for Î´ 2ha ftir being closer to Î´ 2ha precip than Î´ 2ha pan while the evaporation rate can vary on diurnal scales given that for instance the relative humidity and temperature exhibit diurnal variations see supplementary fig s2 a and b from fig 3 the diurnal variation of Î´ 2ha ftir is low this can also be seen in supplementary fig s2c where small variations in the hourly average values are only seen for winter this is an indication that the pan derived estimations will not vary significantly if hourly evaporation rates were considered 4 3 difference between measured and pan derived Î´2h of vapour when pan derived Î´ 2ha pan and ftir measured Î´ 2ha ftir values of atmospheric moisture were compared a significant correlation was seen r 0 7 p value 0 00 fig 5a Î´ 2ha pan varied between 121 7 and 70 5 whereas average ftir measurements over the same period varied between 123 3 and 78 6 the difference Î´ 2ha pan Î´ 2ha ftir spanned a range from 25 0 to 20 4 with a mean absolute difference of 8 0 these results show a smaller difference between measured and estimated values than was reported in devi et al 2015 a more interesting result was that the Î´ 2ha ftir values were not consistently higher than the Î´ 2ha pan values as found in devi et al 2015 in fact the differences were almost evenly distributed on either side of zero with 33 weeks having a difference of less than zero and 30 weeks having a difference greater than zero however in devi et al 2015 the vapour trap measurements were carried out between 9 30 am and 3 30 pm whereas in this study continuous hourly values of Î´ 2ha ftir were available and the value used for the comparison was the average over the period covering the pan calculation for the current study site marginally higher values of Î´ 2ha ftir were seen in the daily measurement time window used by devi et al 2015 fig 3a which may account for some of this difference also devi et al 2015 used daily calculations whereas in this case weekly calculations were used which might smooth out the results humidity rather than temperature wind speed or wind direction was found to be the dominant control on the degree of match between Î´ 2ha pan and Î´ 2ha ftir higher differences were seen at low and high relative humidity when the relative humidity was above 85 Î´ 2ha pan was higher by more than 9 than Î´ 2ha ftir for seven cases and was lower only for two cases this is consistent with reports by kumar and nachiappan 1999 who noted high uncertainty in the estimation of isotopic composition of evaporating moisture for relative humidity above 75 correlation between relative humidity and Î´ 2ha pan Î´ 2ha ftir was weak but significant r 0 32 p value 0 01 a correlation was seen between the difference and the standard deviation of either the air temperature or pan temperature r 0 39 p value 0 01 which reflects the diurnal range no significant relationship was seen between the rainfall amount and Î´ 2ha pan Î´ 2ha ftir the assumption of the craig gordon model that there is no divergence is not fully met for a pan particularly under low humidity when there is effectively a larger sink and higher evaporation as evaporating pan moisture disperses into the air in addition in this study wind speed was higher under lower humidity which would increase this effect under lower humidity conditions the net effect would be for the pan method to estimate lower Î´a values in comparison to those measured with the ftir conversely for high humidity the measured wind speed was lower and the evaporation rate was probably more consistently low due to both less diurnal fluctuation in temperature i e low temperature standard deviation and lower humidity gradient between pan and air for the equilibrium component this should cause no concern but instead the assumption of turbulent flow underpinning the choice of n for kinetic fractionation eq 2 may need to be adjusted should it be more laminar and could this be parameterised as a function of humidity and wind speed for the pan model this was tested by replacing n in eq 2 from 0 5 to 1 which resulted in a small improvement in the estimated Î´ 2ha pan with the difference Î´ 2ha pan Î´ 2ha ftir when the relative humidity was above 80 reducing to 9 8 9 8 13 8 and 12 1 from 10 3 11 7 14 6 and 12 4 respectively when a value of 0 5 was used for n a further test was undertaken where eqs 8 11 were used to determine the Î´2h values of the pan water at the end of each week using the measured Î´ 2ha ftir value for Î´a in eq 10 the correlation coefficient between the measured and estimated Î´2h values of the pan water was r 0 76 p value of 0 00 fig 5b with the largest differences occurring under higher relative humidity a strong and significant correlation r 0 99 was seen between the differences of the measurements and estimates for Î´ 2h values of pan water Î´l Î´l estimated and Î´2h values of atmospheric vapour Î´ 2ha pan Î´ 2ha ftir 4 4 difference between measured and precipitation derived Î´2h of vapour precipitation equilibrium estimates of the isotopic composition of the atmospheric vapour Î´ 2ha precip are more poorly correlated with Î´ 2ha ftir overall r 0 58 p value 0 00 than Î´ 2ha pan is due to a marked difference for a number of time intervals fig 6 this difference was the largest for periods when less precipitation was recorded however these differences are considered to be predominantly due to the seven day averaging time used in the calculations the first interval with a large discrepancy between Î´ 2ha precip and Î´ 2ha ftir was noted for the seven days ending on 21 july 2009 average Î´2ha ftir for that period was 119 2 whereas the estimated Î´2ha precip value was 158 7 a difference of 39 5 the precipitation occurred over a six hour period on 17 july 2009 and had an Î´ 2h value of 74 9 over this period the average Î´ 2ha ftir value was 140 7 which is closer to the estimated Î´ 2ha precip thus the precipitation derived isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour was more representative of conditions during the precipitation event than during the entire week for a second seven day period ending on 6 april 2010 Î´ 2ha precip was estimated to be 139 4 while the seven day average measured Î´ 2ha ftir was 97 9 however during the precipitation event the average measured Î´ 2ha ftir was 140 4 very close to the estimated value this demonstrates that using the assumption that the isotopic composition of the atmospheric vapour is in equilibrium with the isotopic composition of precipitation is not valid after some time has passed since the end of the precipitation event this is clearly demonstrated in fig 7 where prior to the precipitation event the measured Î´ 2ha ftir value was around 100 0 during the precipitation event the value went down to less than 150 0 and after the precipitation event it returned to above 100 0 inspection of the Î´ 2ha ftir hourly time series shows that where precipitation leads to a distinct change in the Î´ 2ha ftir this change generally only persists for a period of 6 36 h before the atmospheric vapour returns to a similar composition to that seen before the precipitation event while equilibrium with precipitation appears to accurately capture conditions during precipitation periods it may be less appropriate than evaporation pans for predicting conditions over longer periods especially during drier conditions we find pan derived Î´ a to be closer to measured values using ftir over weekly periods due to the intrinsic temporal flux weighting of pans they appear to provide more representative records for nearby evaporation studies in addition at this study site precipitation had occurred for only 7 6 of the study period and precipitation was above 5 mm h for only 0 4 of the study period on an hourly basis this is an additional indication of the benefit of the pan derived method 4 5 sensitivity analysis to determine most important parameters to determine which parameters are most significant in the determination of Î´ 2ha pan and Î´ 18oa pan a sensitivity analysis was carried out by perturbing each measured value of the parameters by 10 one parameter at a time following this the root mean square error rmse between the pan derived isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour as determined by the base case and the perturbed case was determined where the measured values of the parameters were used in the base case from the results in table 2 it can be inferred that the most important parameter is relative humidity followed by air temperature and pan temperature an increase in relative humidity results in a higher estimate of both Î´ 2ha pan and Î´ 18oa pan values and vice versa on the other hand an increase in air temperature which would result in lower relative humidity under conditions of no change in specific humidity results in lower estimates of both Î´ 2ha pan and Î´ 18oa pan values and vice versa the influence on the Î´ 18oa pan values is proportionally greater than that on Î´ 2ha pan values due to differences in the equilibrium vapour pressure of the two heavy isotopologues the importance of relative humidity in the craig gordon model has previously been identified in a study by kumar and nachiappan 1999 where errors in the measured parameters were propagated to the estimate they concluded that an error in the relative humidity would result in errors in the estimated isotopic composition of the evaporating moisture furthermore errors in the other parameters were more significant for relative humidity above 80 when only the isotopic composition of pan water feed water and precipitation was considered the isotopic composition of the pan water was the most important parameter consistent with the finding of vallet coulomb et al 2010 vallet coulomb et al 2010 undertook sensitivity studies based on the accuracy of measurements of various parameters in the craig gordon model they found that the uncertainty in the measurement of the isotopic composition of the pan water was the most important and that the uncertainty in the estimation of the isotopic composition of the evaporating vapour was higher than the error in the estimation of the isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour i e Î´a further the importance of the relative humidity was also stressed and diurnal variation in the relative humidity was a potential source of uncertainty when sensitivity to errors relating to measurement uncertainty are considered table 2 right smaller errors are expected aside from the amount of water added to the pan however these errors are still an order of magnitude smaller than the errors due to uncertainty in the meteorological variables 5 conclusions the isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour has been determined by using two methods 1 the pan method and 2 equilibrium with local precipitation and compared against measurements using the ftir a complication in the pan derived Î´ a estimation procedure was that the pan isotopic composition was available on weekly time scales the evaporation rate was available on daily time scales and the atmospheric variables were available on hourly time scales as the weekly time scale had to be used for the pan calculations in one set of estimates the arithmetic averages of the atmospheric variables were used in this case good agreement was seen between the pan derived and the ftir measured Î´ 2ha the difference between pan derived and ftir measured Î´ 2ha ranged from 25 0 to 20 4 with the mean of the absolute difference being 8 0 the cost of deployment of instruments such as the ftir and their continuous maintenance is higher while evaporation pans are more robust and require less maintenance while the precipitation equilibrium approach produces good results close to the precipitation event if average values are required over a longer period the pan derived isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour was closer to the average of the measured values over the same period this means that because the pan method enables Î´a to be estimated regardless of whether precipitation has occurred it can provide a far more accurate continuous dataset than can be achieved using precipitation equilibrium and at far less cost than continuous measurements in addition at this study site precipitation had occurred for only 7 6 of the study period which is an additional indication of the benefit of the pan method potential users of the pan method need to ensure accurate measurements of the atmospheric relative humidity and the isotopic composition of the pan water and need to take caution with results for relative humidity above 80 declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge jim pascoe and leisa dyer and the ansto environmental monitoring team for the

6312,this paper proposes an analytical model for predicting the longitudinal profile of depth averaged streamwise velocities in a channel with an emergent array of rigid cylinders the governing equation of the analytical model was derived from the momentum equation and flow continuity equation the longitudinal transect through a flume with a vegetation patch was divided into four regions based on two length scales of flow adjustment upstream of and inside the array and analytical solutions were proposed for the four regions laboratory experiments demonstrated that the array length does not influence flow adjustments near the upstream edge of the array so the model can predict the longitudinal profile of streamwise velocity for either short or long arrays twenty groups of velocity data from different sources were used to verify the proposed model the predicted velocities agreed well with the measured velocities indicating that the model is capable of predicting the longitudinal profiles of the velocity upstream of and inside a model patch the predicted velocity profile can be further employed to estimate regions of enhanced or diminished deposition of fine sediment or organic matter inside model patches keywords velocity vegetation longitudinal profile predictive model flume experiments 1 introduction vegetation is widely observed in natural rivers and plays an important role in river systems by altering flow structures trapping sediment and changing bed morphology e g bennett et al 2002 gurnell et al 2012 schoelynck et al 2012 follett and nepf 2012 kim et al 2015 liu et al 2013 2016 shan et al 2017 2018 hu et al 2018 gu et al 2019 yang et al 2007 in the field vegetation can be present in patches with finite length and width varying between 0 5 and 5 m sand jensen and pedersen 2008 cornacchia et al 2018 understanding the interaction between flow and vegetation patches can help researchers further understand the local erosion and sediment deposition inside and around patches liu and nepf 2016 tal and paola 2010 specifically inside a vegetation patch the streamwise velocity within the interior adjustment region decreases as the distance from the upstream edge increases and the velocity is constant beyond the region when the velocity inside a patch decreases to a certain point suspended sediment with organic material and nutrients deposits within the patch thereby promoting the growth of new plants and increasing the density of plants vandenbruwaene et al 2011 gurnell et al 2012 the deposition of suspended sediment inside patches depends on the strength of the stem scale turbulence and the sediment settling velocity which can produce local sediment deposition sand jensen 1998 liu and nepf 2016 in addition near the upstream edge of an emergent vegetation patch the flow is deflected laterally out of the patch leading to an increase in velocity and promoting bed erosion at side edges of the patch which can prevent the lateral expansion of the vegetation patch sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2010 bouma et al 2007 van wesenbeeck et al 2008 many studies have used arrays of cylinders to simulate vegetation patches and have investigated the velocity evolution inside and outside model patches of emergent vegetation similar to field observations introduced above lateral flow deflection is observed near the upstream edge of the model patch resulting in longitudinal velocity acceleration along two edges of the patch and longitudinal velocity deceleration inside the patch e g jÃ¤rvelÃ¤ 2005 white and nepf 2007 van wesenbeeck et al 2008 zong and nepf 2011 rominger and nepf 2011 vandenbruwaene et al 2011 bouma et al 2007 huai et al 2015 therefore in this study model patches of emergent vegetation were constructed and the velocities inside and upstream patches were measured meanwhile we focus on developing a model for predicting the longitudinal profile of the time averaged streamwise velocity upstream of and inside emergent model patches the length scales of the velocity decay near the upstream edge of the model patch are introduced below a sketch of flow adjustments associated with a model vegetation patch is shown in fig 1 a inside the model patch the distance over which the time averaged streamwise velocity decreases to a minimum and remains constant is defined as the interior adjustment length li rominger and nepf 2011 found that the length scale li is dependent on both the vegetation drag and the patch width and proposed the following predictive equation for li 1 l i 5 5 0 4 2 c d a 2 b 2 where cd is the drag coefficient a nd is the frontal area per patch volume n is the cylinder density d is the diameter of the cylinder and b is the half patch width eq 1 is valid over the range of a 0 05 0 8 cm 1 and b 4 40 cm rominger and nepf 2011 due to the lateral flow deflection the mixing layer forms at the beginning of the patch edge x 0 and develops rapidly along the edge between x 0 and li huai et al 2015 white and nepf 2007 the absence of a kelvin helmholtz kh vortex street between x 0 and li has been numerically demonstrated see fig 13 in huai et al 2015 beyond the distance li the mixing layer thickness stabilizes and becomes constant if the shear between the outer and inner flow streams is strong enough to generate vortices kh vortices form along the patch edge and the vortices penetrate through the edge into the patch white and nepf 2008 also see the cartoon in fig 1a the momentum exchange driven by kh vortices at the edges of the patch leads to higher velocities in the penetration region than in the central region of the patch white and nepf 2007 2008 the penetration distance Î´ has been demonstrated to be highly correlated with the canopy density cda i e Î´ cda 1 poggi et al 2004 nepf et al 2007 and Î´ has different dependences for cda 1 5 cm 1 and cda 1 5 cm 1 white and nepf 2008 specifically Î´ was correlated with the drag cda 1 for cda 1 5 cm 1 whereas it was correlated with the cylinder diameter d for cda 1 5 cm 1 see fig 10 in white and nepf 2008 based on these correlations white and nepf 2008 proposed the following equation to predict Î´ 2 Î´ max 0 5 c d a 1 1 8 d when the half patch width b is greater than the penetration distance Î´ the kh vortices cannot enter the patch central region in this study the central region inside the model patch b Î´ y b Î´ see the region between the red dashed lines in fig 1a in which the flow is not influenced by kh vortices is our focus an analytical model is proposed for predicting the longitudinal profile of the velocity in this region for vegetation patches with finite length and width e g chen et al 2012 liu and nepf 2016 liu et al 2018 hu et al 2018 a fully developed flow region is not created inside the patch because the patch length l is generally shorter than the interior adjustment region li l li therefore the velocity decreasing to a minimum and subsequent remaining constant value cannot be observed inside the patch and kh vortices are not observed along the two patch edges for submerged vegetation canopies chen et al 2013 reported that the canopy length does not impact the vertical flow adjustment near the upstream edge of the canopy because streamwise velocities inside canopies with different lengths collapsed onto the same line in the longitudinal direction however the current study focuses on emergent patches and the impact of patch length on the lateral flow adjustment near the upstream patch edge has not been examined yet this effect is clarified in this study some numerical models can simulate the flow through vegetation patches e g nicolle and eames 2011 kim et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 however to our knowledge there are no analytical models that can predict the longitudinal profile of velocities inside vegetation patches in the field detailed velocity measurements can be difficult to perform inside vegetation patches particularly inside dense patches because the equipment is not easy to place based on this difficulty a model capable of accurately predicting the velocity profiles inside patches would be very helpful for laboratory experiments a predictive model can save time and labor because researchers only need to measure a few velocities e g the mean channel velocity and the velocity at the patch upstream edge the present study proposes an analytical model for predicting the longitudinal profile of the streamwise velocity upstream of and inside the central region of emergent vegetation patches over a wide range of patch densities we first introduce our flume experiments in section 2 section 3 presents the experimental results in which the length scales regarding flow adjustments are determined and the divided region method is introduced the theory underlying the analytical model is then presented in section 4 the published data for model validation are summarized in section 5 sections 6 and 7 present the model validation and application respectively finally a comparison with previous models and the limitations of the proposed model are discussed in section 8 2 experimental methods the experiments were performed in a 23 m long and 2 m wide flume with a 15 m long test section and a horizontal bed the flow discharge was measured using a triangle weir installed in front of the flume the flow depth was measured using water level gauges along the flume the mean channel velocity was measured using a sontek acoustic doppler velocimeter adv 5 m upstream from the upstream edge of the model patch where the velocity was not influenced by the patch a discharge of q 65 2 l s and a flow depth of h 17 8 0 2 cm were used in all cases the mean channel velocity was u0 18 0 0 5 cm s the flow was turbulent in all cases with the channel reynolds number re u0 r Î½ 27 200 with the hydraulic radius r and kinematic viscosity Î½ 0 01 cm2 s the flow was subcritical with the froude number fr u 0 gh 0 14 with gravitational acceleration g only one u0 was considered in this study because the longitudinal profile of velocities was proven to be independent of u0 under the turbulent flow re 5 000 13 000 and patch conditions a 0 04 0 21 cm 1 and b 40 cm zong and nepf 2011 and those conditions are similar to our experiments re 27 200 a 0 048 0 144 cm 1 and b 30 40 cm at the entrance of the flume the water went through a flow straightener producing a laterally uniform velocity profile at the downstream edge of the flume the tailgate was manually modified to achieve the target flow depth the free surface slope was estimated using the measured water depths the slope was s 1 10 4 corresponding to variations in the water depth and the time averaged streamwise velocity inside the model patch of 0 8 over the experimental section an array of rigid cylinders was constructed to simulate a vegetation patch fig 1b in the field the patch length may be less than or greater than the interior adjustment length li to explore the influence of the patch length l on the velocity inside the patch three patches with different lengths l 1 5 m were designed depending on the flow blockage of the patch cdab for each flow blockage two patches were designed shorter than li and the third was longer than li the patch width 2b b is the half patch width varied between 60 and 80 cm kh vortex streets occur in three cases cases 3 6 and 9 with patches longer than li the penetration distance Î´ was estimated using eq 2 in cases 3 6 and 9 Î´ 3 5 10 6 cm was only 12 27 of the half patch width b 30 40 cm see table 1 thus there was a central region inside the patch where kh vortices could not enter each model patch was constructed using plastic rigid cylinders cylinders were fitted into 1 cm thick pvc boards with a staggered array of holes the dowels were 20 cm long so in this study all patches were emergent patches were placed 7 m downstream from the entrance of the test section at the center of the channel y 0

cylinders where u and w are fluctuating velocities in streamwise and vertical directions respectively ud was calculated from vertical profiles of measured time averaged streamwise velocities Ï xz was measured at z 1 cm above the pvc plate z h 0 06 with h 17 8 cm and could be considered the same as the bed shear stress Ï b Ï c f u d 2 according to yang et al 2015 see eq 7 in their paper in this study cf 0 006 0 001 for the pvc boards which was determined from cf Ï b Ï u d 2 the cylinders were rigid and exhibited no deformation during experiments the cylinders do not represent a specific macrophyte but are realistic for reeds and cattails the cylinder diameter d 0 4 cm was chosen to fall within the range of stems and leaves of reeds grasses and floodplain vegetation d 0 1 1 cm leonard and luther 1995 lightbody and nepf 2006 sand jensen 1998 the cylinder density was n 0 12 0 36 cm 2 and the frontal area per patch volume was a nd 0 048 0 144 cm 1 the solid volume fraction was Ï Ï 4

cylinder array which is close to that of an isolated cylinder for red 0 200 is used to perform the prediction where red 0 ud 0 d Î½ is the cylinder reynolds number at the upstream edge x 0 of the array and ud 0 is the time averaged streamwise velocity at x 0 cd is estimated using the equation of white 1991 3 c d 1 re d 0 2 3 in this study red 0 600 yielding cd 1 1 in natural rivers the velocity approaching the canopy is ud 0 2 40 cm s sand jensen and pedersen 2008 and the stem diameter d 0 1 1 cm introduced above yielding red 0 20 4000 based on this cd 1 1 14 as estimated from eq 3 therefore in cases 1 9 cd 1 0 0 2 was used with the possible variation for predicting velocities the longitudinal coordinate was x with x 0 representing the upstream edge of the patch the lateral coordinate was y with y 0 representing the centerline of the channel and patch and the vertical coordinate was z with z 0 representing the channel bed fig 1 the streamwise velocity u t lateral velocity v t and vertical velocity w t were measured using a sontek acoustic doppler velocimeter adv with a downward looking probe the adv was equipped on a measurement bridge which could be moved in the x y and z directions via a wireless software package at each position the recording period and frequency were 150 s and 50 hz respectively the raw data were despiked using the method proposed by goring and nikora 2002 a matlab code was used to decompose velocities into time averaged components denoted u v and w and fluctuating components denoted u v and w the noise in the streamwise velocity was less than 0 4 cm s which was determined by velocity measurements in still water the vertical profiles of the time averaged streamwise velocities were measured outside and inside the patch to obtain the depth averaged streamwise velocity u d 1 h 0 h u d z in both the bare channel and patch region the streamwise velocity measured at the mid depth z 9 cm could be greater or smaller than u d and the difference between the mid depth streamwise velocity and u d was less than 6 therefore the mid depth velocity was considered to be the same as u d the velocity was measured at two positions at the mid depth in a characteristic region between cylinders along the patch centerline blue region in fig 1c denoted y 0 and dy 4 where dy is the lateral distance between in line neighboring cylinders the longitudinal interval between two characteristic regions varied between 10 and 20 cm depending on the patch density and length ud is the mean of the two measured velocities which is representative of the velocity over half of the vegetation spacing dy 2 the uncertainty in ud indicates the variation in the velocity over the spacing at all sampling positions at each longitudinal section y 0 or dy 4 the adv was placed in the same orientation and position relative to neighboring cylinders placing the adv in a consistent orientation and at the same relative position can minimize the error induced by the spatial heterogeneity of the flow inside the cylinder array at some longitudinal positions in cases 3 and 9 Ï 0 015 and 0 045 respectively the detailed lateral velocity profile in the characteristic region was recorded in which the mean velocity of two positions was within 12 of the spatially averaged velocity similarly the mid depth velocity has been shown to be within 20 of the spatially averaged velocity for the cylinder arrays with Ï 0 02 0 1 white and nepf 2007 the lateral profile of the velocity over the channel width was measured in the fully developed flow region li inside the patch e g x 4 5 m inside the 5 m long patch in which li 3 5 0 1 m to illustrate the flow symmetry on two sides of the patch the root mean square error rmse is used to quantitatively compare the difference between the predicted and measured velocities and is expressed as 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n u d m u d p 2 where n is the number of measurements and predictions and ud m and ud p are the measured and predicted velocities respectively 3 experimental results 3 1 flow adjustment length scales the model patches longer than the interior adjustment length l li were chosen to investigate two length scales lu and li regarding the lateral flow adjustment upstream of and inside the patch taking case 3 cdab 1 9 b 40 cm and l 5 m as an example the longitudinal profile of the mean depth averaged velocity ud normalized by the mean channel velocity u0 is plotted against the distance x from the leading edge of the patch in fig 2 we first determine the adjustment region x lu to 0 cm upstream of the patch the length of this region was defined as the distance over which 90 of the velocity change Î´u u0 ud 0 occurred that is the upstream adjustment region begins at the point where ud x ud 0 0 9Î´u in fig 2 lu 40 20 cm corresponding to lu b 1 0 5 second inside the patch the interior adjustment region was defined as the distance from the upstream edge of the patch to the point at which the velocity reaches a minimum and remains constant x 0 cm to li in fig 2 li 350 10 cm corresponds to li b 8 8 0 3 similar steps were performed to obtain lu for the patches shorter than li cases 1 2 4 5 7 and 8 and to obtain lu and li for the patches longer than li cases 6 and 9 the two length scales are summarized in table 1 in all cases lu b 1 0 0 3 indicating lu b the measured li b values 8 8 0 3 in case 3 10 0 0 7 in case 6 and 7 0 0 5 in case 9 were close to the predicted li b values 8 0 in case 3 7 5 in case 6 and 6 1 in case 9 by the predictor of rominger and nepf 2011 eq 1 in the introduction hence rominger and nepf s model was employed to predict li inside the patches for cases in which li was not reported 3 2 divided regions fig 3 shows that in the central region of a model vegetation patch the velocity mainly changed between x lu and li thus the longitudinal transect of a model patch can be divided into four regions regions 1 4 in fig 3 region 1 is defined as the region of x lu over which ud u0 region 2 is defined as the distance lu x 0 between the position at which ud starts decreasing and the upstream edge of the patch x 0 region 3 is defined as the distance 0 x li from the upstream edge of the patch to the position at which ud achieves a minimum and remains constant region 4 is defined at li x l over which ud is constant indicating that the flow deep inside the patch is fully developed 4 theory 4 1 equation derivation for the flow in a channel with an emergent cylinder array the equations for continuity and streamwise momentum are 5 u u x v u y w u z 1 Ï Ï

of model patches the central region is b Î´ y b Î´ in which the velocity is not affected by the kh vortices along the two edges of the patch fig 1a consequently in the central region inside an array the time averaged velocity u and reynolds shear stress Ï yx Ï u v are constant in the lateral direction fig 4 similarly rominger and nepf 2011 observed that u and Ï u v achieved constant values in the fully developed flow region in the central region of an emergent array see fig 11 in their paper therefore in the central region of a model patch it is reasonable to assume the following equations

this model is proposed for an emergent vegetation patch so that the flow inside and outside the patch is two dimensional that is the flow deflection mainly occurs in the longitudinal and lateral

a velocity scale it is reasonable to assume that Îµ d Î» h u Î» h c f u d with a nondimensional parameter Î» we first discuss the order of the Î» value Îµ d is of the order o 10 cm2 s for the local velocity u 10 60 cm s flow depth h 10 30 cm and the vegetation condition Ï 0 07 0 2 lopez and garcia 1997 vionnet et al 2004 choi and kang 2004 therefore Î» is of the order o 1 10 estimated from h cf

measured ud 0 at the interface of regions 2 and 3 the upstream edge of the patch x 0 cm to determine the Î» value because it occurs only in the governing equation eq 10 for regions 2 and 3 in our study for each density the mean of ud 0 u0 for three patches was used to determine Î» so Î» was the same for the three patches with the same density but different lengths table 1 across all cases the values of Î» are summarized in tables 1 and 2 when ud 0 cannot be measured ud 0 can be estimated from the flow blockage cdab and mean channel velocity u0 see the detailed discussion in section 6

conditions at the interface of regions 1 and 2 x lu the depth averaged streamwise velocity ud calculated from eqs 13 and 14 must be the same thus ud 1 ud 2 at x lu is the first boundary condition in which the subscript i indicates the number of the region at the interface of regions 2 and 3 x 0 the continuities of ud and of the longitudinal gradient of ud must be considered and these continuities are the second and third boundary conditions at the interface of regions 3 and 4 x li ud estimated from eqs 15 and 16 must be the same thus ud 3 ud 4 at x li is the fourth boundary condition overall

experimental data from rominger and nepf 2011 zong and nepf 2011 and chen et al 2012 were used to verify the proposed model the three studies reported the detailed measured velocities at the centerline upstream of and inside model patches over a wide range of solid volume fractions Ï 0 02 0 38 and flow blockages cdab 1 3 8 4 the details of the experiments can be found in rominger and nepf 2011 zong and nepf 2011 and chen et al 2012 to connect the predicted velocity profile for the tendency of fine sediment deposition inside cylinder arrays the experimental data from liu and nepf 2016 were chosen because their study reported both velocities and deposition inside a model patch a brief introduction to the experiments is provided herein for convenience a summary of the parameters in the four studies is presented in table 2 first rominger and nepf 2011 constructed emergent model vegetation patches with different widths 12 30 cm using rigid wooden dowels three cases denoted rn1 to rn3 in table 2 were chosen to verify the proposed model the dowels were fitted into pvc boards with a staggered array of holes the solid volume fraction was varied between Ï 0 09 and 0 38 the patch half width was varied between b 6 and 15 cm and the frontal area per patch volume was varied between a 0 2 and 0 8 cm 1 corresponding to flow blockages cdab 3 and 8 second zong and nepf 2011 considered a half width patch along the right sidewall of a flume because the flow at two patch edges was symmetric six cases denoted zn1 to zn6 in table 2 were used to verify the proposed model in those cases the mean channel velocities were different i e u0 5 0 9 0 and 11 6 cm s two frontal areas per patch volume a 0 04 and 0 21 cm 1 were considered leading to flow blockages cdab 1 6 and 8 4 respectively the solid volume fraction was Ï 0 02 and 0 1 third chen et al 2012 measured the velocity profile upstream of and inside a circular model patch with cdab 1 3 the diameter of the patch was d 42 cm the half patch width was b 21 cm the mean upstream velocity was u0 9 8 cm s and the flow depth was h 13 3 cm the solid volume fraction was Ï 0 03 fourth liu and nepf 2016 performed deposition experiments for a capsule patch with a width of 10 cm and a length of 20 cm the half width of the patch was b 5 cm the mean upstream velocity was u0 9 1 cm s and the flow depth was h 14 cm the solid volume fraction was Ï 0 15 the frontal area per volume a nd was 0 51 cm 1 yielding cdab 8 microscope slides were used to collect the net deposition at four positions x b 0 5 1 5 2 5 and 3 5 inside the patch a model sediment of glass spheres with d50 5 6 Î¼m and a density of 2 5 g cm3 was mixed with water in the flume once the fine particles and water were mixed completely the deposition experiment started after 4 h the pump was stopped and the flume was drained after two days the slides with deposition were removed and placed in an oven to remove all moisture the weight difference between the slides before and after the experiment was the net deposition the enhanced or diminished deposition zone was determined via a comparison to the control experiment without patches see fig 6 in liu and nepf 2016 five common points among the four studies are summarized first all patches were emergent and the velocities were measured at mid depth upstream of and inside patches using a nortek vectrino adv in both regions the differences between the velocities at mid depth and the true depth averaged velocities were reported to be less than 5 white and nepf 2007 liu and nepf 2016 it is reasonable to consider that the velocities measured at mid depth were the same as the depth averaged velocities second the time averaged velocity was measured at the midpoint of two cylinders and was found to differ from the true temporally and spatially averaged velocity within 20 white and nepf 2007 the point velocities at the centerline are representative of temporally and spatially averaged velocities in the central region of an array for the cylinder array with Ï 0 02 0 1 third the distance Î´ of the kh vortex penetrating the edge patch was smaller than the half patch width b in all cases Î´ b 0 06 0 39 thus the velocities in the central region of the patch were not influenced by the vortex fourth the bed friction coefficient cf 0 006 because pvc boards were used as the channel beds in all four cases fifth the channel beds in the four cases were horizontal so the free surface slope was estimated from s c f gh u 0 2 the free surface slope is summarized in table 2 and was very small s 1 10 4 the influence of the change in flow depth on the streamwise velocity in the longitudinal direction was less than 1 over the experimental section finally in the four studies the cylinder reynolds number at the upstream patch edge was red 0 200 600 so the drag coefficient cd 1 0 0 2 was estimated from eq 3 and was used for velocity prediction 6 model validation the proposed model was verified by the data in this study section 2 and published literature section 5 for all cases because the mean channel velocity u0 was different the rmses of the depth averaged velocity and rmse u0 are summarized in tables 1 and 2 first the predicted velocities were compared to the measured depth averaged velocity in this study for the long patches l li cases 3 6 and 9 the predicted and measured velocities agree well as shown in fig 5 black solid lines and gray squares respectively for a canopy of submerged cylinder arrays with different array lengths chen et al 2013 observed that measured streamwise velocities inside such arrays collapsed onto the same line in the longitudinal direction see fig 16 in their paper thus they suggested that the impact of the canopy length on vertical flow adjustments near the upstream patch edge is negligible similarly in this study although the lengths of the emergent arrays were different the measured velocities collapsed onto the same line in the longitudinal direction symbols in fig 5 indicating that the array length does not influence the lateral flow adjustment and velocity decay near the upstream edge of emergent cylinder arrays even if the array is shorter than li based on this result a part of the profile of the predicted velocities for the patches longer than li matches the measured velocities for the patches shorter than li for example in fig 5c the velocity profile for the 3 m long array was predicted solid line and a part of this profile x b 10 3 3 matched the measured velocity for the 1 m long patch blue triangles second the data from rominger and nepf 2011 were used to verify the model for the patches with cdab 3 4 8 and 8 the measured velocities red triangles in fig 6 agree well with the prediction solid line third the data recorded in two patch densities cdab 1 6 and 8 4 under three flow conditions u0 5 9 and 11 6 cm s from zong and nepf 2011 were used to verify the proposed model for patches with cdab 1 6 red lines and circles in fig 7 and patches with cdab 8 4 blue lines and squares the model prediction agrees well with the measured velocities finally the velocity data from chen et al 2012 were used to further verify the model predictive capability for short patches l li the predicted and measured velocities agree well with each other upstream of and inside the patch fig 8 overall for channels with vegetation patches with a wide range of flow blockages cdab 1 3 8 4 and solid volume fractions Ï 0 015 0 38 the predicted depth averaged streamwise velocities highly agree with the measured velocities specifically across all cases in tables 1 and 2 the rmses ranged between 0 2 and 2 5 cm s and the rmses in most cases 90 were less than 10 of the mean channel velocity u0 these results indicate that the proposed model is capable of accurately predicting the longitudinal profile of velocities in the central region upstream of and inside vegetation patches we notice that the proposed model can present an accurate velocity profile upstream of and inside the patch as shown in figs 5 8 if the velocity at the upstream patch edge ud 0 is provided however it might not be possible to measure ud 0 when one applies the model to estimate ud 0 a relation between the normalized velocity at the upstream patch edge ud 0 u0 and the flow blockage cdab was built based on experimental data from this study rominger and nepf 2011 zong and nepf 2011 chen et al 2012 liu and nepf 2016 and li et al 2018 and a numerical simulation by huai et al 2015 li et al 2018 considered eight groups of emergent circular model patches with a 0 2 0 25 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 cm 1 and the same patch diameter d 6 cm the half patch width was b 3 cm the measured velocities at the upstream edge of the patches ud 0 were extracted from fig 5 in li et al 2018 huai et al 2015 used a large eddy simulation model to simulate the flow inside and outside two emergent model patches with a 0 01 cm 1 and half patch width b 25 cm in the two cases from huai et al 2015 the patch was the same but the flow depth was different and the modeled ud 0 was extracted from fig 9 in their paper over a wide range of cdab 0 4 9 the measured ud 0 in all 19 cases extracted from fig 4 in chen et al 2012 was included for the cases of li et al 2018 huai et al 2015 and chen et al 2012 the values of cd at the leading edge of the patch were also assumed to be cd 1 0 0 2 because in all these cases red 0 270 for the other cases ud 0 u0 and cdab are summarized in tables 1 and 2 the best fitting line the solid line with 95 confidence intervals dashed lines is shown in fig 9 and the equation of the best fitting line is 17 u d 0 u 0 1 0 15 0 02 c d a b we note that eq 17 is valid only for cdab 0 9 fig 9 when a porous patch is sufficiently dense ud 0 u0 at the upstream edge of the patch exhibits flow patterns similar to those of a solid cylinder because very little or no flow can enter the patch thus the velocity at the upstream patch edge decreases to zero i e ud 0 u0 0 however the critical cdab is not reported in the published literature and is not the goal of this study overall eq 17 can predict ud 0 u0 for 9 cdab 0 and the value of Î» can then be determined using the predicted ud 0 u0 when ud 0 is unknown cd 1 can be initially assumed in eq 17 to correct ud 0 an iterative solution between ud 0 and cd using eqs 3 and 17 is needed 7 model applications we can use the proposed model to further estimate the deposition region of fine sediment inside a model patch to further discuss this aspect we take the 10 cm wide and 20 cm long capsule patch case from liu and nepf 2016 as an example because the velocity and sediment deposition inside the patch were reported first we used the proposed model to predict the longitudinal profile of velocity the predicted and measured velocities solid line and triangles respectively are plotted in fig 10 a the region between the two gray dashed lines x b 0 4 with the half patch width b 5 cm indicates the patch length the predicted profile agrees with the measured velocities with rmse 0 4 cm s corresponding to only 4 of u0 to estimate the deposition region the predicted longitudinal profile of velocity in fig 10a was then translated into the longitudinal profile of the local cylinder reynolds number red ud d Î½ in fig 10b comparing the red profile the solid line in fig 10b to the threshold cylinder reynolds number red c 120 the red line we can predict the region inside the patch with or without stem scale turbulence corresponding to red red c and red red c respectively thus the diminished and enhanced deposition regions are expected to be the upstream half of the patch x b 0 1 8 and the downstream half of the patch x b 1 8 4 respectively liu and nepf s deposition experiments confirm our estimate fig 10c however we note that the estimation of diminished and enhanced deposition regions is based on the presence or absence of stem scale turbulence so this estimate is valid only for suspended fine sediment with the ratio of settling velocity ws to channel shear velocity u observed in streams i e ws u 0 002 0 3 see the discussion in ortiz et al 2013 additionally the model cannot quantitatively predict the amount of sediment deposition overall the proposed model can accurately predict the longitudinal profile of velocities inside vegetation patches and the predicted profile of velocity can be translated into a profile of the local cylinder reynolds number red through comparison of the local red and the threshold red c 120 the regions with and without stem scale turbulence can be identified and then the diminished and enhanced deposition regions can be estimated the proposed model could be very helpful for identifying deposition regions for fine sediment or organic matter inside vegetation patches in natural rivers or wetlands without detailed velocity measurements 8 discussion 8 1 comparison to previous models the predictive capability of the proposed model is compared to those of two previous models first chen et al 2012 proposed a model to predict the longitudinal profile of streamwise velocity at mid depth across the centerline inside a circular array of cylinders eqs 4 and 5 in their paper in their study the arrays were shorter than the interior adjustment length l li so rapid deceleration of the flow occurred inside all arrays chen et al considered the linear flow deceleration inside the arrays and presented velocity estimators for the streamwise velocities at the upstream edge of an array u d 0 and the downstream edge of an array u d e 18a u d 0 u 0 1 Î± a 1 Ï c d a b 2 1 2 2 18b u d e u 0 1 Î² 1 Ï c d a b 2 1 2 2 where Î± a and Î² are nondimensional parameters chen et al 2012 reported Î± a 0 04 and Î² 0 42 in eqs 18a and 18b respectively second for the cylinder array with c d a b 2 rominger and nepf 2011 estimated the streamwise velocity in the fully developed flow region inside the array region 4 in fig 1 as follows 19 u d u 0 c f h 1 Ï c d a we chose cases 7 and 9 of this study to perform the comparison case 7 has an array shorter than li so the model of chen et al 2012 can be used to predict the deceleration of velocity inside the array case 9 has an array with cdab 4 3 2 and longer than li so the model of rominger and nepf 2011 can be used to predict the velocity in region 4 the predictions of the proposed model and the models of chen et al 2012 and rominger and nepf 2011 are plotted against the measured velocities in fig 11 the proposed model captures the velocity evolution upstream of and inside the 1 m and 3 m arrays and yields accurate velocity profiles for both arrays however inside the 1 m array the linear velocity profile predicted using chen et al s 2012 model does not follow the measured velocity profile yielding an average overestimate of the velocities of 120 rominger and nepf s 2011 model can accurately predict the velocity in the fully developed region in the 3 m array with an rmse 0 01 cm s but their model cannot predict velocities in the other three regions 8 2 sensitivity analysis for Î» cd cf and s the effects of the dimensionless parameter Î» drag coefficient cd bed friction coefficient cf and water surface slope s on the predictive velocity profile are discussed below we used case 3 cdab 1 9 as an example in this study when the target parameter Î» cd cf or s was changed the other parameters were fixed as specified in table 1 first Î» impacts the predictions only in regions 2 and 3 x b 1 to 8 8 fig 12 a compared to a large Î» e g Î» 40 a small Î» e g Î» 1 leads to overestimation of the velocity over x b 1 to 1 but underestimation over x b 1 to 8 8 the appropriate Î» can be determined using the velocity at the upstream edge of the array eq 17 second cd ranges between 1 and 1 1 based on the flow and vegetation conditions in natural rivers section 2 values of cd 1 5 are chosen to examine the model sensitivity in fig 12b cd primarily influences the predicted velocities in the interior adjustment region region 3 inside the cylinder array a greater cd leads to a more rapid decrease in the predicted velocities in region 3 third in typical stream conditions the water depth may be between 50 and 100 cm and cf 0 01 for sand beds e g for d50 0 6 sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2010 thus we consider a wider range of cf 0 005 0 03 fig 12c cf influences the prediction in the undisturbed region region 1 and the two adjustment regions regions 2 and 3 a larger c f corresponds to a smaller prediction particularly in region 1 in contrast cf does not change the predicted velocity deep inside the array region 4 because inside an array the bed drag c f is generally smaller than the vegetation drag 1 2 c d a h 1 Ï resulting in a negligible contribution in eq 16 specifically c f 1 2 c d a h 1 Ï 0 004 0 014 in this study finally s mainly affects the predictions in regions 1 2 and 3 in which the prediction increases as s increases in the field s is not easy to measure thus it can be estimated from s c f gh u 0 2 based on the measured flow depth bed friction coefficient and mean channel velocity far upstream from the vegetation patch 8 3 model limitations this model was verified for emergent cylinder arrays with a flow blockage of cdab 1 3 8 4 and a solid volume fraction of Ï 0 015 0 38 for patches exceeding these ranges further verification of the model is needed another limitation is that the proposed model does not address flexible plants the spatial variability in flow may be more pronounced inside a flexible array or an array with a complicated plant morphology in which the velocity profile may exhibit a different shape relative to the velocity profile inside a cylinder array this is because the local maximal velocity may occur anywhere inside the flexible canopy and the position of maximum velocity is related to the local stem frontal area e g sand jensen and pedersen 2008 defina and bixio 2005 nepf and vivoni 2000 inside a flexible array the depth averaged velocity is no longer equal to the mid depth velocity which may be instead determined from the vertical profile of the velocity when the longitudinal profile of the velocity inside a flexible canopy significantly deviates from the predicted profile the proposed model may not be able to accurately estimate the deposition region inside the canopy 9 summary based on the flow continuity equation and momentum equation an analytical model was proposed for predicting the longitudinal profile of the streamwise depth averaged velocity upstream of and inside model patches of emergent vegetation the longitudinal transect in the central region of a flume and patch was divided into four regions based on two length scales regarding lateral flow adjustments upstream of and inside the patch analytical solutions were presented for each region our experimental results suggest that the patch length is not an important factor in changing the lateral flow adjustment and velocity decay near the upstream edge of model patches so the model should be able to predict the velocity profiles for patches longer or shorter than the interior adjustment length twenty groups of velocity data from our experiments and four published studies see sections 2 and 3 were used to verify the proposed model the predicted longitudinal profile of velocities agrees with the measured velocities indicating that the proposed model is able to accurately predict the velocity profile in a channel with an emergent model patch the predicted velocities can be translated into local cylinder reynolds numbers to identify the presence or absence of stem scale turbulence and further estimate

6312,this paper proposes an analytical model for predicting the longitudinal profile of depth averaged streamwise velocities in a channel with an emergent array of rigid cylinders the governing equation of the analytical model was derived from the momentum equation and flow continuity equation the longitudinal transect through a flume with a vegetation patch was divided into four regions based on two length scales of flow adjustment upstream of and inside the array and analytical solutions were proposed for the four regions laboratory experiments demonstrated that the array length does not influence flow adjustments near the upstream edge of the array so the model can predict the longitudinal profile of streamwise velocity for either short or long arrays twenty groups of velocity data from different sources were used to verify the proposed model the predicted velocities agreed well with the measured velocities indicating that the model is capable of predicting the longitudinal profiles of the velocity upstream of and inside a model patch the predicted velocity profile can be further employed to estimate regions of enhanced or diminished deposition of fine sediment or organic matter inside model patches keywords velocity vegetation longitudinal profile predictive model flume experiments 1 introduction vegetation is widely observed in natural rivers and

kim et al 2015 liu et al 2013 2016 shan et al 2017 2018 hu et al 2018 gu et al 2019 yang et al 2007 in the field vegetation can be present in patches with finite length and width varying between 0 5 and 5 m sand jensen and pedersen 2008 cornacchia et al 2018 understanding the interaction between flow and vegetation patches can help researchers further understand the local erosion and sediment deposition inside and around patches liu and nepf 2016 tal and paola 2010 specifically inside a vegetation patch the streamwise velocity within the interior adjustment region decreases as the distance from the upstream edge increases and the velocity is constant beyond the region when the velocity inside a patch decreases to a certain point suspended sediment with organic material and nutrients deposits within the patch thereby promoting the growth of new plants and increasing the density of plants vandenbruwaene et al 2011 gurnell et al 2012 the deposition of suspended sediment inside patches depends on the strength of the stem scale turbulence and the sediment settling velocity which can produce local sediment deposition sand jensen 1998 liu and nepf 2016 in addition near the upstream edge of an emergent vegetation patch the flow is deflected laterally out of the patch leading to an increase in velocity and promoting bed erosion at side edges of the patch which can prevent the lateral expansion of the vegetation patch sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2010 bouma et al 2007 van wesenbeeck et al 2008 many studies have used arrays of cylinders to simulate vegetation patches and have investigated the velocity evolution inside and outside model patches of emergent vegetation similar to field observations introduced above lateral flow deflection is observed near the upstream edge of the model patch resulting in longitudinal velocity acceleration along two edges of the patch and longitudinal velocity deceleration inside the patch e g jÃ¤rvelÃ¤ 2005 white and nepf 2007 van wesenbeeck et al 2008 zong and nepf 2011 rominger and nepf 2011 vandenbruwaene et al 2011 bouma et al 2007 huai et al 2015 therefore in this study model patches of emergent vegetation were constructed and the velocities inside and upstream patches were measured meanwhile we focus on developing a model for predicting the longitudinal profile of the time averaged streamwise velocity upstream of and inside emergent model patches the length scales of the velocity decay near the upstream edge of the model patch are introduced below a sketch of flow adjustments associated with a model vegetation patch is shown in fig 1 a inside the model patch the distance over which the time averaged streamwise velocity decreases to a minimum and remains constant is defined as the interior adjustment length li rominger and nepf 2011 found that the length scale li is dependent on both the vegetation drag and the patch width and proposed the following predictive equation for li 1 l i 5 5 0 4 2 c d a 2 b 2 where cd is the drag coefficient a nd is the frontal area per patch volume n is the cylinder density d is the diameter of the cylinder and b is the half patch width eq 1 is valid over the range of a 0 05 0 8 cm 1 and b 4 40 cm rominger and nepf 2011 due to the lateral flow deflection the mixing layer forms at the beginning of the patch edge x 0 and develops rapidly along the edge between x 0 and li huai et al 2015 white and nepf 2007 the absence of a kelvin helmholtz kh vortex street between x 0 and li has been numerically demonstrated see fig 13 in huai et al 2015 beyond the distance li the mixing layer thickness stabilizes and becomes constant if the shear between the outer and inner flow streams is strong enough to generate vortices kh vortices form along the patch edge and the vortices penetrate through the edge into the patch white and nepf 2008 also see the cartoon in fig 1a the momentum exchange driven by kh vortices at the edges of the patch leads to higher velocities in the penetration region than in the central region of the patch white and nepf 2007 2008 the penetration distance Î´ has been demonstrated to be highly correlated with the canopy density cda i e Î´ cda 1 poggi et al 2004 nepf et al 2007 and Î´ has different dependences for cda 1 5 cm 1 and cda 1 5 cm 1 white and nepf 2008 specifically Î´ was correlated with the drag cda 1 for cda 1 5 cm 1 whereas it was correlated with the cylinder diameter d for cda 1 5 cm 1 see fig 10 in white and nepf 2008 based on these correlations white and nepf 2008 proposed the following equation to predict Î´ 2 Î´ max 0 5 c d a 1 1 8 d when the half patch width b is greater than the penetration distance Î´ the kh vortices cannot enter the patch central region in this study the central region inside the model patch b Î´ y b Î´ see the region between the red dashed lines in fig 1a in which the flow is not influenced by kh vortices is our focus an analytical model is proposed for predicting the longitudinal profile of the velocity in this region for vegetation patches with finite length and width e g chen et al 2012 liu and nepf 2016 liu et al 2018 hu et al 2018 a fully developed flow region is not created inside the patch because the patch length l is generally shorter than the interior adjustment region li l li therefore the velocity decreasing to a minimum and subsequent remaining constant value cannot be observed inside the patch and kh vortices are not observed along the two patch edges for submerged vegetation canopies chen et al 2013 reported that the canopy length does not impact the vertical flow adjustment near the upstream edge of the canopy because streamwise velocities inside canopies with different lengths collapsed onto the same line in the longitudinal direction however the current study focuses on emergent patches and the impact of patch length on the lateral flow adjustment near the upstream patch edge has not been examined yet this effect is clarified in this study some numerical models can simulate the flow through vegetation patches e g nicolle and eames 2011 kim et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 however to our knowledge there are no analytical models that can predict the longitudinal profile of velocities inside vegetation patches in the field detailed velocity measurements can be difficult to perform inside vegetation patches particularly inside dense patches because the equipment is not easy to place based on this difficulty a model capable of accurately predicting the velocity profiles inside patches would be very helpful for laboratory experiments a predictive model can save time and labor because researchers only need to measure a few velocities e g the mean channel velocity and the velocity at the patch upstream edge the present study proposes an analytical model for predicting the longitudinal profile of the streamwise velocity upstream of and inside the central region of emergent vegetation patches over a wide range of patch densities we first introduce our flume experiments in section 2 section 3 presents the experimental results in which the length scales regarding flow adjustments are determined and the divided region method is introduced the theory underlying the analytical model is then presented in section 4 the published data for model validation are summarized in section 5 sections 6 and 7 present the model validation and application respectively finally a comparison with previous models and the limitations of the proposed model are discussed in section 8 2 experimental methods the experiments were performed in a 23 m long and 2 m wide flume with a 15 m long test section and a horizontal bed the flow discharge was measured using a triangle weir installed in front of the flume the flow depth was measured using water level gauges along the flume the mean channel velocity was measured using a sontek acoustic doppler velocimeter adv 5 m upstream from the upstream edge of the model patch where the velocity was not influenced by the patch a discharge of q 65 2 l s and a flow depth of h 17 8 0 2 cm were used in all cases the mean channel velocity was u0 18 0 0 5 cm s the flow was turbulent in all cases with the channel reynolds number re u0 r Î½ 27 200 with the hydraulic radius r and kinematic viscosity Î½ 0 01 cm2 s the flow was subcritical with the froude number fr u 0 gh 0 14 with gravitational acceleration g only one u0 was considered in this study because the longitudinal profile of velocities was proven to be independent of u0 under the turbulent flow re 5 000 13 000 and patch conditions a 0 04 0 21 cm 1 and b 40 cm zong and nepf 2011 and those conditions are similar to our experiments re 27 200 a 0 048 0 144 cm 1 and b 30 40 cm at the entrance of the flume the water went through a flow straightener producing a laterally uniform velocity profile at the downstream edge of the flume the tailgate was manually modified to achieve the target flow depth the free surface slope was estimated using the measured water depths the slope was s 1 10 4 corresponding to variations in the water depth and the time averaged streamwise velocity inside the model patch of 0 8 over the experimental section an array of rigid cylinders was constructed to simulate a vegetation patch fig 1b in the field the patch length may be less than or greater than the interior adjustment length li to explore the influence of the patch length l on the velocity inside the patch three patches with different lengths l 1 5 m were designed depending on the flow blockage of the patch cdab for each flow blockage two patches were designed shorter than li and the third was longer than li the patch width 2b b is the half patch width varied between 60 and 80 cm kh vortex streets occur in three cases cases 3 6 and 9 with patches longer than li the penetration distance Î´ was estimated using eq 2 in cases 3 6 and 9 Î´ 3 5 10 6 cm was only 12 27 of the half patch width b 30 40 cm see table 1 thus there was a central region inside the patch where kh vortices could not enter each model patch was constructed using plastic rigid cylinders cylinders were fitted into 1 cm thick pvc boards with a staggered array of holes the dowels were 20 cm long so in this study all patches were emergent patches were placed 7 m downstream from the entrance of the test section at the center of the channel y 0 m the bed friction coefficient of the pvc boards cf was determined from the measured depth averaged velocity ud and near bed reynolds shear stress Ï xz Ï u w in the preliminary experiment without cylinders where u and w are fluctuating velocities in streamwise and vertical directions respectively ud was calculated from vertical profiles of measured time averaged streamwise velocities Ï xz was measured at z 1 cm above the pvc plate z h 0 06 with h 17 8 cm and could be considered the same as the bed shear stress Ï b Ï c f u d 2 according to yang et al 2015 see eq 7 in their paper in this study cf 0 006 0 001 for the pvc boards which was determined from cf Ï b Ï u d 2 the cylinders were rigid and exhibited no deformation during experiments the cylinders do not represent a specific macrophyte but are realistic for reeds and cattails the cylinder diameter d 0 4 cm was chosen to fall within the range of stems and leaves of reeds grasses and floodplain vegetation d 0 1 1 cm leonard and luther 1995 lightbody and nepf 2006 sand jensen 1998 the cylinder density was n 0 12 0 36 cm 2 and the frontal area per patch volume was a nd 0 048 0 144 cm 1 the solid volume fraction was Ï Ï 4 n d 2 0 015 0 045 which matched the observed range for cattails in natural rivers and wetlands Ï 0 001 0 04 grace et al 1986 coon et al 2000 the drag coefficient cd at the upstream edge of the cylinder array which is close to that of an isolated cylinder for red 0 200 is used to perform the prediction where red 0 ud 0 d Î½ is the cylinder reynolds number at the upstream edge x 0 of the array and ud 0 is the time averaged streamwise velocity at x 0 cd is estimated using the equation of white 1991 3 c d 1 re d 0 2 3 in this study red 0 600 yielding cd 1 1 in natural rivers the velocity approaching the canopy is ud 0 2 40 cm s sand jensen and pedersen 2008 and the stem diameter d 0 1 1 cm introduced above yielding red 0 20 4000 based on this cd 1 1 14 as estimated from eq 3 therefore in cases 1 9 cd 1 0 0 2 was used with the possible variation for predicting velocities the longitudinal coordinate was x with x 0 representing the upstream edge of the patch the lateral coordinate was y with y 0 representing the centerline of the channel and patch and the vertical coordinate was z with z 0 representing the channel bed fig 1 the streamwise velocity u t lateral velocity v t and vertical velocity w t were measured using a sontek acoustic doppler velocimeter adv with a downward looking probe the adv was equipped on a measurement bridge which could be moved in the x y and z directions via a wireless software package at each position the recording period and frequency were 150 s and 50 hz respectively the raw data were despiked using the method proposed by goring and nikora 2002 a matlab code was used to decompose velocities into time averaged components denoted u v and w and fluctuating components denoted u v and w the noise in the streamwise velocity was less than 0 4 cm s which was determined by velocity measurements in still water the vertical profiles of the time averaged streamwise velocities were measured outside and inside the patch to obtain the depth averaged streamwise velocity u d 1 h 0 h u d z in both the bare channel and patch region the streamwise velocity measured at the mid depth z 9 cm could be greater or smaller than u d and the difference between the mid depth streamwise velocity and u d was less than 6 therefore the mid depth velocity was considered to be the same as u d the velocity was measured at two positions at the mid depth in a characteristic region between cylinders along the patch centerline blue region in fig 1c denoted y 0 and dy 4 where dy is the lateral distance between in line neighboring cylinders the longitudinal interval between two characteristic regions varied between 10 and 20 cm depending on the patch density and length ud is the mean of the two measured velocities which is representative of the velocity over half of the vegetation spacing dy 2 the uncertainty in ud indicates the variation in the velocity over the spacing at all sampling positions at each longitudinal section y 0 or dy 4 the adv was placed in the same orientation and position relative to neighboring cylinders placing the adv in a consistent orientation and at the same relative position can minimize the error induced by the spatial heterogeneity of the flow inside the cylinder array at some longitudinal positions in cases 3 and 9 Ï 0 015 and 0 045 respectively the detailed lateral velocity profile in the characteristic region was recorded in which the mean velocity of two positions was within 12 of the spatially averaged velocity similarly the mid depth velocity has been shown to be within 20 of the spatially averaged velocity for the cylinder arrays with Ï 0 02 0 1 white and nepf 2007 the lateral profile of the velocity over the channel width was measured in the fully developed flow region li inside the patch e g x 4 5 m inside the 5 m long patch in which li 3 5 0 1 m to illustrate the flow symmetry on two sides of the patch the root mean square error rmse is used to quantitatively compare the difference between the predicted and measured velocities and is expressed as 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n u d m u d p 2 where n is the number of measurements and predictions and ud m and ud p are the measured and predicted velocities respectively 3 experimental results 3 1 flow adjustment length scales the model patches longer than the interior adjustment length l li were chosen to investigate two length scales lu and li regarding the lateral flow adjustment upstream of and inside the patch taking case 3 cdab 1 9 b 40 cm and l 5 m as an example the longitudinal profile of the mean depth averaged velocity ud normalized by the mean channel velocity u0 is plotted against the distance x from the leading edge of the patch in fig 2 we first determine the adjustment region x lu to 0 cm upstream of the patch the length of this region was defined as the distance over which 90 of the velocity change Î´u u0 ud 0 occurred that is the upstream adjustment region begins at the point where ud x ud 0 0 9Î´u in fig 2 lu 40 20 cm corresponding to lu b 1 0 5 second inside the patch the interior adjustment region was defined as the distance from the upstream edge of the patch to the point at which the velocity reaches a minimum and remains constant x 0 cm to li in fig 2 li 350 10 cm corresponds to li b 8 8 0 3 similar steps were performed to obtain lu for the patches shorter than li cases 1 2 4 5 7 and 8 and to obtain lu and li for the patches longer than li cases 6 and 9 the two length scales are summarized in table 1 in all cases lu b 1 0 0 3 indicating lu b the measured li b values 8 8 0 3 in case 3 10 0 0 7 in case 6 and 7 0 0 5 in case 9 were close to the predicted li b values 8 0 in case 3 7 5 in case 6 and 6 1 in case 9 by the predictor of rominger and nepf 2011 eq 1 in the introduction hence rominger and nepf s model was employed to predict li inside the patches for cases in which li was not reported 3 2 divided regions fig 3 shows that in the central region of a model vegetation patch the velocity mainly changed between x lu and li thus the longitudinal transect of a model patch can be divided into four regions regions 1 4 in fig 3 region 1 is defined as the region of x lu over which ud u0 region 2 is defined as the distance lu x 0 between the position at which ud starts decreasing and the upstream edge of the patch x 0 region 3 is defined as the distance 0 x li from the upstream edge of the patch to the position at which ud achieves a minimum and remains constant region 4 is defined at li x l over which ud is constant indicating that the flow deep inside the patch is fully developed 4 theory 4 1 equation derivation for the flow in a channel with an emergent cylinder array the equations for continuity and streamwise momentum are 5 u u x v u y w u z 1 Ï Ï xx x Ï yx y Ï zx z f x 6 u x v y w z 0 where u v and w are the time averaged velocities in the x y and z directions respectively Ï is the fluid density Ï is the reynolds shear stress and fx is the drag force acting on the fluid in the streamwise direction this study proposes an analytical model for predicting the longitudinal profile of depth averaged streamwise velocity in the central region of model patches the central region is b Î´ y b Î´ in which the velocity is not affected by the kh vortices along the two edges of the patch fig 1a consequently in the central region inside an array the time averaged velocity u and reynolds shear stress Ï yx Ï u v are constant in the lateral direction fig 4 similarly rominger and nepf 2011 observed that u and Ï u v achieved constant values in the fully developed flow region in the central region of an emergent array see fig 11 in their paper therefore in the central region of a model patch it is reasonable to assume the following equations over upstream and interior adjustment regions and the fully developed flow region 7 u y 0 a n d Ï yx y 0 the drag force fx exerted on the water volume inside vegetation patches is defined as 8 f x 1

this model is proposed for an emergent vegetation patch so that the flow inside and outside the patch is two dimensional that is the flow deflection mainly occurs in the longitudinal and lateral directions x and y respectively the vertical velocity w is sufficiently small 0 cm s data not shown at the surface of the channel bed z 0 cm and water surface z h thus 0 h u w z d z 0 cm2 s2 the shear stress Ï zx Ï u w is approximately zero at the water surface z h but is equal to the bed shear stress Ï b Ï u 2 at the surface of the channel bed z 0 cm where u c f u d is the shear velocity the depth averaged additional shear stress Î´ Ï xx d is expressed as Î´ Ï xx d 2 Ï Îµ d u d x in which Îµ d cm2 s is the depth averaged eddy viscosity proportional to the product of a length scale and a velocity scale it is reasonable to assume that Îµ d Î» h u Î» h c f u d with a nondimensional parameter Î» we first discuss the order of the Î» value Îµ d is of the order o 10 cm2 s for the local velocity u 10 60 cm s flow depth h 10 30 cm and the vegetation condition Ï 0 07 0 2 lopez and garcia 1997 vionnet et al 2004 choi and kang 2004 therefore Î» is of the order o 1 10 estimated from h cf and ud in this study for a vegetated case Îµ d h and cf generally remain constant so Î» Îµ d h c f u d is inversely related to ud we then focus on the determination of Î» it is reasonable to use the measured ud 0 at the interface of regions 2 and 3 the upstream edge of the patch x 0 cm to determine the Î» value because it occurs only in the governing equation eq 10 for regions 2 and 3 in our study for each density the mean of ud 0 u0 for three patches was used to determine Î» so Î» was the same for the three patches with the same density but different lengths table 1 across all cases the values of Î» are summarized in tables 1 and 2 when ud 0 cannot be measured ud 0 can be estimated from the flow blockage cdab and mean channel velocity u0 see the detailed discussion in section 6 integrating eq 10 over the flow depth h the governing equation is 11 ghs Î» h 2 c f 2 u d 2 x 2 h u d 2 x c f 1 2 c d a h 1 Ï u d 2 0 in which u d h 0 h u d z as introduced in section 3 2 ud varies at lu x li regions 2 and 3 see fig 3 resulting in u d 2 x 0 therefore eq 11 is valid in regions 2 and 3 however ud is constant at x lu in region 1 and at l x li in region 4 fig 3 yielding u d 2 x 0

conditions at the interface of regions 1 and 2 x lu the depth averaged streamwise velocity ud calculated from eqs 13 and 14 must be the same thus ud 1 ud 2 at x lu is the first boundary condition in which the subscript i indicates the number of the region at the interface of regions 2 and 3 x 0 the continuities of ud and of the longitudinal gradient of ud must be considered and these continuities are the second and third boundary conditions at the interface of regions 3 and 4 x li ud estimated from eqs 15 and 16 must be the same thus ud 3 ud 4 at x li is the fourth boundary condition overall the four boundary conditions which are shown below can be used to solve for a1 a4 1 ud 1 ud 2 at x lu 2 ud 2 ud 3 at x 0 3 u d 2 x u d 3 x at x 0 4 ud 3 ud 4 at x li 5 published data the published experimental data from rominger and nepf 2011 zong and nepf 2011 and chen et al 2012 were used to verify the proposed model the three studies reported the detailed measured velocities at the centerline upstream of and inside model patches over a wide range of solid volume fractions Ï 0 02 0 38 and flow blockages cdab 1 3 8 4 the details of the experiments can be found in rominger and nepf 2011 zong and nepf 2011 and chen et al 2012 to connect the predicted velocity profile for the tendency of fine sediment deposition inside cylinder arrays the experimental data from liu and nepf 2016 were chosen because their study reported both velocities and deposition inside a model patch a brief introduction to the experiments is provided herein for convenience a summary of the parameters in the four studies is presented in table 2 first rominger and nepf 2011 constructed emergent model vegetation patches with different widths 12 30 cm using rigid wooden dowels three cases denoted rn1 to rn3 in table 2 were chosen to verify the proposed model the dowels were fitted into pvc boards with a staggered array of holes the solid volume fraction was varied between Ï 0 09 and 0 38 the patch half width was varied between b 6 and 15 cm and the frontal area per patch volume was varied between a 0 2 and 0 8 cm 1 corresponding to flow blockages cdab 3 and 8 second zong and nepf 2011 considered a half width patch along the right sidewall of a flume because the flow at two patch edges was symmetric six cases denoted zn1 to zn6 in table 2 were used to verify the proposed model in those cases the mean channel velocities were different i e u0 5 0 9 0 and 11 6 cm s two frontal areas per patch volume a 0 04 and 0 21 cm 1 were considered leading to flow blockages cdab 1 6 and 8 4 respectively the solid volume fraction was Ï 0 02 and 0 1 third chen et al 2012 measured the velocity profile upstream of and inside a circular model patch with cdab 1 3 the diameter of the patch was d 42 cm the half patch width was b 21 cm the mean upstream velocity was u0 9 8 cm s and the flow depth was h 13 3 cm the solid volume fraction was Ï 0 03 fourth liu and nepf 2016 performed deposition experiments for a capsule patch with a width of 10 cm and a length of 20 cm the half width of the patch was b 5 cm the mean upstream velocity was u0 9 1 cm s and the flow depth was h 14 cm the solid volume fraction was Ï 0 15 the frontal area per volume a nd was 0 51 cm 1 yielding cdab 8 microscope slides were used to collect the net deposition at four positions x b 0 5 1 5 2 5 and 3 5 inside the patch a model sediment of glass spheres with d50 5 6 Î¼m and a density of 2 5 g cm3 was mixed with water in the flume once the fine particles and water were mixed completely the deposition experiment started after 4 h the pump was stopped and the flume was drained after two days the slides with deposition were removed and placed in an oven to remove all moisture the weight difference between the slides before and after the experiment was the net deposition the enhanced or diminished deposition zone was determined via a comparison to the control experiment without patches see fig 6 in liu and nepf 2016 five common points among the four studies are summarized first all patches were emergent and the velocities were measured at mid depth upstream of and inside patches using a nortek vectrino adv in both regions the differences between the velocities at mid depth and the true depth averaged velocities were reported to be less than 5 white and nepf 2007 liu and nepf 2016 it is reasonable to consider that the velocities measured at mid depth were the same as the depth averaged velocities second the time averaged velocity was measured at the midpoint of two cylinders and was found to differ from the true temporally and spatially averaged velocity within 20 white and nepf 2007 the point velocities at the centerline are representative of temporally and spatially averaged velocities in the central region of an array for the cylinder array with Ï 0 02 0 1 third the distance Î´ of the kh vortex penetrating the edge patch was smaller than the half patch width b in all cases Î´ b 0 06 0 39 thus the velocities in the central region of the patch were not influenced by the vortex fourth the bed friction coefficient cf 0 006 because pvc boards were used as the channel beds in all four cases fifth the channel beds in the four cases were horizontal so the free surface slope was estimated from s c f gh u 0 2 the free surface slope is summarized in table 2 and was very small s 1 10 4 the influence of the change in flow depth on the streamwise velocity in the longitudinal direction was less than 1 over the experimental section finally in the four studies the cylinder reynolds number at the upstream patch edge was red 0 200 600 so the drag coefficient cd 1 0 0 2 was estimated from eq 3 and was used for velocity prediction 6 model validation the proposed model was verified by the data in this study section 2 and published literature section 5 for all cases because the mean channel velocity u0 was different the rmses of the depth averaged velocity and rmse u0 are summarized in tables 1 and 2 first the predicted velocities were compared to the measured depth averaged velocity in this study for the long patches l li cases 3 6 and 9 the predicted and measured velocities agree well as shown in fig 5 black solid lines and gray squares respectively for a canopy of submerged cylinder arrays with different array lengths chen et al 2013 observed that measured streamwise velocities inside such arrays collapsed onto the same line in the longitudinal direction see fig 16 in their paper thus they suggested that the impact of the canopy length on vertical flow adjustments near the upstream patch edge is negligible similarly in this study although the lengths of the emergent arrays were different the measured velocities collapsed onto the same line in the longitudinal direction symbols in fig 5 indicating that the array length does not influence the lateral flow adjustment and velocity decay near the upstream edge of emergent cylinder arrays even if the array is shorter than li based on this result a part of the profile of the predicted velocities for the patches longer than li matches the measured velocities for the patches shorter than li for example in fig 5c the velocity profile for the 3 m long array was predicted solid line and a part of this profile x b 10 3 3 matched the measured velocity for the 1 m long patch blue triangles second the data from rominger and nepf 2011 were used to verify the model for the patches with cdab 3 4 8 and 8 the measured velocities red triangles in fig 6 agree well with the prediction solid line third the data recorded in two patch densities cdab 1 6 and 8 4 under three flow conditions u0 5 9 and 11 6 cm s from zong and nepf 2011 were used to verify the proposed model for patches with cdab 1 6 red lines and circles in fig 7 and patches with cdab 8 4 blue lines and squares the model prediction agrees well with the measured velocities finally the velocity data from chen et al 2012 were used to further verify the model predictive capability for short patches l li the predicted and measured velocities agree well with each other upstream of and inside the patch fig 8 overall for channels with vegetation patches with a wide range of flow blockages cdab 1 3 8 4 and solid volume fractions Ï 0 015 0 38 the predicted depth averaged streamwise velocities highly agree with the measured velocities specifically across all cases in tables 1 and 2 the rmses ranged between 0 2 and 2 5 cm s and the rmses in most cases 90 were less than 10 of the mean channel velocity u0 these results indicate that the proposed model is capable of accurately predicting the longitudinal profile of velocities in the central region upstream of and inside vegetation patches we notice that the proposed model can present an accurate velocity profile upstream of and inside the patch as shown in figs 5 8 if the velocity at the upstream patch edge ud 0 is provided however it might not be possible to measure ud 0 when one applies the model to estimate ud 0 a relation between the normalized velocity at the upstream patch edge ud 0 u0 and the flow blockage cdab was built based on experimental data from this study rominger and nepf 2011 zong and nepf 2011 chen et al 2012 liu and nepf 2016 and li et al 2018 and a numerical simulation by huai et al 2015 li et al 2018 considered eight groups of emergent circular model patches with a 0 2 0 25 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 cm 1 and the same patch diameter d 6 cm the half patch width was b 3 cm the measured velocities at the upstream edge of the patches ud 0 were extracted from fig 5 in li et al 2018 huai et al 2015 used a large eddy simulation model to simulate the flow inside and outside two emergent model patches with a 0 01 cm 1 and half patch width b 25 cm in the two cases from huai et al 2015 the patch was the same but the flow depth was different and the modeled ud 0 was extracted from fig 9 in their paper over a wide range of cdab 0 4 9 the measured ud 0 in all 19 cases extracted from fig 4 in chen et al 2012 was included for the cases of li et al 2018 huai et al 2015 and chen et al 2012 the values of cd at the leading edge of the patch were also assumed to be cd 1 0 0 2 because in all these cases red 0 270 for the other cases ud 0 u0 and cdab are summarized in tables 1 and 2 the best fitting line the solid line with 95 confidence intervals dashed lines is shown in fig 9 and the equation of the best fitting line is 17 u d 0 u 0 1 0 15 0 02 c d a b we note that eq 17 is valid only for cdab 0 9 fig 9 when a porous patch is sufficiently dense ud 0 u0 at the upstream edge of the patch exhibits flow patterns similar to those of a solid cylinder because very little or no flow can enter the patch thus the velocity at the upstream patch edge decreases to zero i e ud 0 u0 0 however the critical cdab is not reported in the published literature and is not the goal of this study overall eq 17 can predict ud 0 u0 for 9 cdab 0 and the value of Î» can then be determined using the predicted ud 0 u0 when ud 0 is unknown cd 1 can be initially assumed in eq 17 to correct ud 0 an iterative solution between ud 0 and cd using eqs 3 and 17 is needed 7 model applications we can use the proposed model to further estimate the deposition region of fine sediment inside a model patch to further discuss this aspect we take the 10 cm wide and 20 cm long capsule patch case from liu and nepf 2016 as an example because the velocity and sediment deposition inside the patch were reported first we used the proposed model to predict the longitudinal profile of velocity the predicted and measured velocities solid line and triangles respectively are plotted in fig 10 a the region between the two gray dashed lines x b 0 4 with the half patch width b 5 cm indicates the patch length the predicted profile agrees with the measured velocities with rmse 0 4 cm s corresponding to only 4 of u0 to estimate the deposition region the predicted longitudinal profile of velocity in fig 10a was then translated into the longitudinal profile of the local cylinder reynolds number red ud d Î½ in fig 10b comparing the red profile the solid line in fig 10b to the threshold cylinder reynolds number red c 120 the red line we can predict the region inside the patch with or without stem scale turbulence corresponding to red red c and red red c respectively thus the diminished and enhanced deposition regions are expected to be the upstream half of the patch x b 0 1 8 and the downstream half of the patch x b 1 8 4 respectively liu and nepf s deposition experiments confirm our estimate fig 10c however we note that the estimation of diminished and enhanced deposition regions is based on the presence or absence of stem scale turbulence so this estimate is valid only for suspended fine sediment with the ratio of settling velocity ws to channel shear velocity u observed in streams i e ws u 0 002 0 3 see the discussion in ortiz et al 2013 additionally the model cannot quantitatively predict the amount of sediment deposition overall the proposed model can accurately predict the longitudinal profile of velocities inside vegetation patches and the predicted profile of velocity can be translated into a profile of the local cylinder reynolds number red through comparison of the local red and the threshold red c 120 the regions with and without stem scale turbulence can be identified and then the diminished and enhanced deposition regions can be estimated the proposed model could be very helpful for identifying deposition regions for fine sediment or organic matter inside vegetation patches in natural rivers or wetlands without detailed velocity measurements 8 discussion 8 1 comparison to previous models the predictive capability of the proposed model is compared to those of two previous models first chen et al 2012 proposed a model to predict the longitudinal profile of streamwise velocity at mid depth across the centerline inside a circular array of cylinders eqs 4 and 5 in their paper in their study the arrays were shorter than the interior adjustment length l li so rapid deceleration of the flow occurred inside all arrays chen et al considered the linear flow deceleration inside the arrays and presented velocity estimators for the streamwise velocities at the upstream edge of an array u d 0 and the downstream edge of an array u d e 18a u d 0 u 0 1 Î± a 1 Ï c d a b 2 1 2 2 18b u d e u 0 1 Î² 1 Ï c d a b 2 1 2 2 where Î± a and Î² are nondimensional parameters chen et al 2012 reported Î± a 0 04 and Î² 0 42 in eqs 18a and 18b respectively second for the cylinder array with c d a b 2 rominger and nepf 2011 estimated the streamwise velocity in the fully developed flow region inside the array region 4 in fig 1 as follows 19 u d u 0 c f h 1 Ï c d a we chose cases 7 and 9 of this study to perform the comparison case 7 has an array shorter than li so the model of chen et al 2012 can be used to predict the deceleration of velocity inside the array case 9 has an array with cdab 4 3 2 and longer than li so the model of rominger and nepf 2011 can be used to predict the velocity in region 4 the predictions of the proposed model and the models of chen et al 2012 and rominger and nepf 2011 are plotted against the measured velocities in fig 11 the proposed model captures the velocity evolution upstream of and inside the 1 m and 3 m arrays and yields accurate velocity profiles for both arrays however inside the 1 m array the linear velocity profile predicted using chen et al s 2012 model does not follow the measured velocity profile yielding an average overestimate of the velocities of 120 rominger and nepf s 2011 model can accurately predict the velocity in the fully developed region in the 3 m array with an rmse 0 01 cm s but their model cannot predict velocities in the other three regions 8 2 sensitivity analysis for Î» cd cf and s the effects of the dimensionless parameter Î» drag coefficient cd bed friction coefficient cf and water surface slope s on the predictive velocity profile are discussed below we used case 3 cdab 1 9 as an example in this study when the target parameter Î» cd cf or s was changed the other parameters were fixed as specified in table 1 first Î» impacts the predictions only in regions 2 and 3 x b 1 to 8 8 fig 12 a compared to a large Î» e g Î» 40 a small Î» e g Î» 1 leads to overestimation of the velocity over x b 1 to 1 but underestimation over x b 1 to 8 8 the appropriate Î» can be determined using the velocity at the upstream edge of the array eq 17 second cd ranges between 1 and 1 1 based on the flow and vegetation conditions in natural rivers section 2 values of cd 1 5 are chosen to examine the model sensitivity in fig 12b cd primarily influences the predicted velocities in the interior adjustment region region 3 inside the cylinder array a greater cd leads to a more rapid decrease in the predicted velocities in region 3 third in typical stream conditions the water depth may be between 50 and 100 cm and cf 0 01 for sand beds e g for d50 0 6 sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2010 thus we consider a wider range of cf 0 005 0 03 fig 12c cf influences the prediction in the undisturbed region region 1 and the two adjustment regions regions 2 and 3 a larger c f corresponds to a smaller prediction particularly in region 1 in contrast cf does not change the predicted velocity deep inside the array region 4 because inside an array the bed drag c f is generally smaller than the vegetation drag 1 2 c d a h 1 Ï resulting in a negligible contribution in eq 16 specifically c f 1 2 c d a h 1 Ï 0 004 0 014 in this study finally s mainly affects the predictions in regions 1 2 and 3 in which the prediction increases as s increases in the field s is not easy to measure thus it can be estimated from s c f gh u 0 2 based on the measured flow depth bed friction coefficient and mean channel velocity far upstream from the vegetation patch 8 3 model limitations this model was verified for emergent cylinder arrays with a flow blockage of cdab 1 3 8 4 and a solid volume fraction of Ï 0 015 0 38 for patches exceeding these ranges further verification of the model is needed another limitation is that the proposed model does not address flexible plants the spatial variability in flow may be more pronounced inside a flexible array or an array with a complicated plant morphology in which the velocity profile may exhibit a different shape relative to the velocity profile inside a cylinder array this is because the local maximal velocity may occur anywhere inside the flexible canopy and the position of maximum velocity is related to the local stem frontal area e g sand jensen and pedersen 2008 defina and bixio 2005 nepf and vivoni 2000 inside a flexible array the depth averaged velocity is no longer equal to the mid depth velocity which may be instead determined from the vertical profile of the velocity when the longitudinal profile of the velocity inside a flexible canopy significantly deviates from the predicted profile the proposed model may not be able to accurately estimate the deposition region inside the canopy 9 summary based on the flow continuity equation and momentum equation an analytical model was proposed for predicting the longitudinal profile of the streamwise depth averaged velocity upstream of and inside model patches of emergent vegetation the longitudinal transect in the central region of a flume and patch was divided into four regions based on two length scales regarding lateral flow adjustments upstream of and inside the patch analytical solutions were presented for each region our experimental results suggest that the patch length is not an important factor in changing the lateral flow adjustment and velocity decay near the upstream edge of model patches so the model should be able to predict the velocity profiles for patches longer or shorter than the interior adjustment length twenty groups of velocity data from our experiments and four published studies see sections 2 and 3 were used to verify the proposed model the predicted longitudinal profile of velocities agrees with the measured velocities indicating that the proposed model is able to accurately predict the velocity profile in a channel with an emergent model patch the predicted velocities can be translated into local cylinder reynolds numbers to identify the presence or absence of stem scale turbulence and further estimate the diminished or enhanced deposition of fine sediment or organic matter declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments we would like to acknowledge the financial support from the national

6313,green roofs are emerging as practical strategies to retain stormwater runoff and improve water environment quality of urban cities however the impacts of green roofs on stormwater runoff quality remains a topic of concern to urban planners and mangers in this study we designed the scale based runoff plots of extensive green roofs with different substrate and vegetation types and investigate whether the studied green roofs act as a sink or source of nutrients and suspended solids in their runoff compared to a conventional roof the influences of substrate and vegetation on the water quality of green roof outflows were also assessed the results showed that the average tss total suspended solids tn total nitrogen and tp total phosphorus concentrations of the green roof runoff were all significantly higher than that of the conventional roof runoff except substrate s3 the composition ratio of rural soil peat soil perlite vermiculite was 2 5 5 2 0 5 and s1 the composition ratio of rural soil peat soil was 1 1 in tp the substrate s2 the composition ratio of rural soil peat soil pine needle perlite was 1 1 1 1 displayed significantly higher tn and tp concentrations than either of the runoff from the substrate s1 and s3 the tn and tp concentrations of 5 cm substrate depth were significantly lower than that in the 15 cm substrate depth treatments significant differences were observed in tn concentrations between vegetation sedum spectabile and radix ophiopogonis however no significant differences were observed between any of the vegetation types with regard to tp concentrations therefore we suggest that green roofs need to be constructed of suitable substrate materials and plants based on their function on runoff water quality in order to mitigate the pollution risk of green roof runoff on urban water environment keywords green roof nutrition substrate total suspended solids vegetation water quality 1 introduction urbanization is a worldwide trend with more than 50 of the world s population currently living in cities united nations 2010 this trend leads to urban sprawl and has changed natural landscapes into increasing impervious surfaces the increase of impervious area associated with urbanization alters the natural hydrologic cycle by increasing runoff to rainwater drainages and surface waters while hindering deep surface infiltration fletcher et al 2013 the increased flooding events and deteriorating water quality in receiving waters are particularly associated with these ongoing changes carpenter et al 2016 one of the solutions to these problems is adopting new stormwater management strategies such as low impact development voyde et al 2010 green infrastructure gi benedict and mcmahon 2012 sustainable urban drainage systems suds stovin 2010 and water sensitive urban design wsud beecham and chowdhury 2012 installing green roof is viewed as a best technology to minimize the negative impact of urban development while providing numerous environmental benefits rowe et al 2012 these benefits include urban hydrology improvements water and air quality improvements noise pollution mitigation heat island effect reduction and increased green space in urban environments ascione et al 2013 berndtsson 2010 chen et al 2019 getter et al 2009 niu et al 2010 oberndorfer et al 2007 moreover green roofs use existing roof space without requiring extra land allowing potentially widespread application dvorak and volder 2010 mentens et al 2006 villarreal and bengtsson 2005 however the potential of green roofs to achieve these benefits often comes under debate ascione et al 2013 mentens et al 2006 for instance improvement of runoff water quality is one of the main benefits of green roofs which is unfortunately not properly understood berndtsson 2010 while much attention has focused on stormwater runoff quantity of green roofs several researchers have investigated the water quality of green roof outflows alsup et al 2010 carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 getter and rowe 2009 gregoire and clausen 2011 hathaway et al 2008 teemusk and mander 2007 van seters et al 2009 theoretically green roofs may reduce the pollution of urban rainwater runoff by absorbing and filtering pollutants as the roofs are covered with substrate and vegetation moreover the nutrient retention by the vegetated roof was strongly driven by retention of water quantity todorov et al 2018 some studies have found that green roofs are a sink for nitrate and ammonia nitrogen berndtsson et al 2009 carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 speak et al 2014 todorov et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 however there have been researches indicating that green roofs act as sources of pollutants such as nitrogen phosphorus organic carbon and heavy metals berndtsson et al 2006 buffam et al 2016 razzaghmanesh et al 2014 speak et al 2014 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 green roof may potentially contribute to the degradation of the receiving waters quality with pollutants released from substrate and fertilizers rowe 2011 teemusk and mander 2007 2011 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 therefore studies of nutrients in green roof runoff have shown mixed findings which have left the unanswered question of how green roofs affect the water quality in urban environment the water quality of runoff from green roofs generally decrease over time but runoff quality vary with substrate type substrate depth vegetation type age of green roof fertilization and maintenance practices as well as physical and chemical properties of pollutants berndtsson et al 2006 2010 gregoire and clausen 2011 monterusso et al 2005 morgan et al 2011 sutton 2015 teemusk and mander 2007 toland et al 2012 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 wang et al 2017 the growth substrate and vegetation play a critical role in influencing the quality of green roof outflows by absorbing and filtering pollutants berndtsson 2010 chen et al 2018 jennett and zheng 2018 rowe 2011 vijayaraghavan et al 2019 chen et al 2018 implied that the differences in the substrates exerted significant effects on the nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations expanded shale has the capacity to retain phosphorus ammonia nitrogen and metals in light substrates long et al 2006 moran et al 2004 showed that compost in the substrate layer may cause high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in green roof runoff monterusso et al 2004 found that nitrate concentrations in the green roofs runoff were higher from the sedum roofs than the herbaceous perennials and also reported higher concentrations from those roofs with a shallower substrate depth dunnett et al 2008 found that vegetation composition influenced runoff water quality from green roof when comparing differences in plants ranging from monocultures of forbs and grasses to combinations of both however research performed on these factors to possibly improve the runoff water quality of green roof is relatively limited long et al 2008 vijayaraghavan and joshi 2014 vijayaraghavan and raja 2015 the potential for runoff pollution of green roofs restricts the ecological and social values of green roofs which will negatively impact their wide spread utilization wang et al 2017 although several investigators reported green roofs as a pollution source which impacts urban water environment only few research efforts have been devoted to tackling this problem berndtsson 2010 chen et al 2018 vijayaraghavan et al 2019 if green roofs are to be considered environmentally benign then the selection of proper green roof component is extremely important vijayaraghavan and joshi 2014 without proper design and maintenance the leachate from green roofs might contain pollutants and become a new nonpoint pollution source in urban areas chen 2013 the ideal characteristics for green roof substrates should be lightweight and possess high water retention capacity hydraulic conductivity and air filled porosity burÃ©s 2013 vijayaraghavan and joshi 2014 however in practices substrate materials of green roofs were not screened based on their sorption capacity or less leaching tendency rowe 2011 green roof plants are usually selected based on their drought tolerance and aesthetics monterusso et al 2005 vijayaraghavan and joshi 2014 the contaminant absorption capacity was almost ignored in the design phase the questions asked in this paper are what is the current role of green roof in urban water environment with regard to its runoff water quality and does the runoff water quality differ significantly from different structural green roofs to answer the questions we design runoff plots of extensive green roofs with different substrate and vegetation types and to detect their concentrations of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total suspended solids tss under the simulated rainfall events the objective of this study was to 1 investigate if studied extensive green roofs behave as a sink or source of nutrients and total suspended solids in stormwater runoff compared to a conventional roof 2 assess the influences of substrate and vegetation on the water quality of green roof outflows 2 materials and methods 2 1 runoff plots of green roofs ten scale based runoff plots of extensive green roofs were constructed by 2 mm thick stainless steel platforms with internal dimensions of 100 cm wide 100 cm long 10 30 cm height fig 1 a the assembled constitution of a green roof from top to bottom is a vegetation growing substrate filter fabric and drainage layer the last layer was an additional waterproof layer comprising a waterproof roll paved onto the bottom of the platform the drainage layer was a 25 mm thick drainage board with high impact polystyrene dimple sheet a non woven geotextile fabric was bonded to the upper surface of the drainage board as the filter layer which prevented the small particles from being washed from the substrate layer out of the system the growing substrate and vegetation were filled and planted on top of the non woven geotextile the outflow openings were installed in the middle of the drainage layer and were connected by pipes with the diameter of 25 mm meanwhile a runoff plot of conventional roof paved with a 10 cm thick cement surface was constructed with the uniform size of the above green roofs a marked steel v flume was created at the outlet of the conventional roof for facilitating runoff collection all these runoff plots were placed on their metal bases at the testing ground of the dingxi institute of soil and water conservation in gansu province china 35 34 45 88 n 104 38 5 67 e this region is located in a semiarid climatic zone and is dominated by the warm humid summers and cold dry winters the mean annual precipitation based on local recorded data from 1956 to 2010 is 421 mm year of which about 78 total rain falls during the growing season wei et al 2009 the green roofs were designed following the orthogonal experimental design with three structural factors i e substrate composition substrate depth and vegetation types at three levels table 1 the substrate material selection was based on the roof greening material available in china bls 2005 considering the growth environment of plants and the bearing capacity of building roof three composition types of light weight materials were selected as the growing substrate the volume ratio of each mixture were as follow rural soil peat soil was 1 1 in substrate s1 rural soil peat soil pine needle perlite was 1 1 1 1 in substrate s2 rural soil peat soil perlite vermiculite was 2 5 5 2 0 5 in substrate s3 a small shovel was used to measure the mix proportions and blend the substrate in the assemble process simultaneously in order to keep the similar compactness of these substrate the substrate padding process was watered several times until the substrate infiltration had saturated according to the kosareo and ries 2007 the substrate depth treatments of extensive green roofs were set to 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm the vegetation layers were planted with three different plant species included radix ophiopogonis ophiopogon japonicas linn f ker gawl sedum spectabile hylotelephium erythrostictum miq h ohba and iris iris tectorum maxim these plants have high resistance abilities to drought stress conditions and have been widely incorporated in local landscaping works and green roof designs the plants were positioned in the substrate with an averaged density of 184 plugs m2 124 plugs m2 65 plugs m2 in addition a bare green roof g10 with no vegetation was also considered as a control sample compares with the green roof g1 2 2 rainfall simulation a norton ladder type artificial rainfall simulator was used in the field experiment and that was set to 3 5 m above the green roof runoff plots fig 1b veejet 80 100 nozzles with 41 kpa water pressure were applied in the spraying systems and spaced 1 1 m apart with a computer that oscillated across the plot to generate a constant rainfall intensity lee et al 2015 sutherland and ziegler 2006 specifically the median volume of rain drop size obtained by this rainfall simulator was 2 2 mm and the uniformity coefficient of rainfall reached more than 0 8 rainfall depth was set to 20 mm according to the rainfall characteristic in the study area six simulated rainfall events were repeated for each runoff plot of green roof during the experimental period 2 3 water quality test procedures and methods the water quality parameters of green roof runoff in this study focused on tss tn and tp the outflow from the green roof and conventional roof was collected in a plastic container below the designated runoff plot by means of a pipe at its downstream end the plastic containers and sampling bottles were rinsed three times with distilled water before rainfall beginning or runoff sampling in each rainfall event the composite water sample was collected after the runoff flow is over therefore a total of 11 water samples were taken from ten green roofs and one conventional roof runoff plots during each rainfall repetition in addition in order to determine the background input water quality six inflow water samples were manually collected during the experimental period this resulted in 72 water samples were collected with 0 5 l pre cleaned polyethylene bottles and stored in a refrigerator at the experimental station and then the collected water samples immediately carried to the laboratory in northwest institute of eco environment and resources chinese academy of sciences and prepared for testing the tss tn and tp concentrations which in all cases were carried out within a week of collection the tested methods of water quality were according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater which was published by the american public health association apha et al 2005 the concentrations of tss were measured using the filtering drying and weighing method little et al 2005 the concentrations of tn were measured using the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion and uv spectrophotometric method the concentrations of tp were measured using the persulfate digestion spectrophotometric method the test instrument of tn and tp was spectrophotometer hach dr5000 usa 2 4 date analysis methods as the experimental data did not meet the assumption of normality for parametric statistical analyses the data were then pooled for comparison of median values using the kruskal wallis non parametric statistical test with water quality concentrations as the independent variable the green roofs with different structural factors n 18 and conventional roof n 6 were classed as statistical groups the kruskal wallis test was performed using spss 19 0 software all figures were carried out using sigmaplot 15 0 3 results 3 1 patterns of the suspended solids and nutrition concentrations of green roof runoff the averaged concentrations of rainfall inputs for tss tn and tp were 10 50 5 65 mg l 0 45 0 17 mg l and 0 002 0 001 mg l respectively n 6 the average values and standard deviations of the measured water quality concentrations of outflows from the conventional roof and nine green roofs were summarized in table 2 the averaged concentrations of the conventional roof d1 runoff were 10 50 mg l 0 45 mg l and 0 002 mg l for tss tn and tp respectively the observed tss concentrations of green roofs except the bare green roof g10 were ranged from 22 44 mg l to 55 22 mg l with an average value of 37 73 mg l the averaged tss concentration of the bare green roof was extremely higher 149 11 mg l the averaged tn concentration of green roofs was approximately 1 58 mg l additionally all green roofs have very low tp concentrations the mean value was 0 04 mg l 3 2 runoff water quality of green roofs compared with the conventional roof as showed in table 3 the average tss concentration of the green roof runoff was 37 73 mg l which was significantly higher than that of the conventional roof runoff 12 08 mg l kruskal wallis x 2 27 4 p 0 001 the average tn concentration of the green roof runoff 1 71 mg l was significantly higher than that of the conventional roof runoff 0 59 mg l kruskal wallis x 2 6 5 p 0 01 the average tss and tn concentrations of green roofs were approximately 3 times than the conventional roof the average tp concentration of the green roof runoff 0 046 mg l was about 2 times than that of the conventional roof runoff 0 025 mg l the difference between them was also significant kruskal wallis x 2 5 0 p 0 05 3 3 impacts of substrate composition on the runoff water quality from green roof the differences for tss concentrations among the three substrate treatments were minimal the values were ranged from 30 72 mg l to 40 33 mg l statistically there were no significant differences in the levels of tss between the different substrate compositions the substrate s2 displayed higher tn and tp concentrations than either of the runoff from the substrate s1 and s3 fig 2 the differences were highly significant for tn concentrations kruskal wallis x 2 16 87 p 0 001 n 54 and significant for tp concentrations kruskal wallis x 2 6 6 p 0 05 n 54 the tn concentrations were significantly higher in the substrate s3 than in the runoff from substrate s1 kruskal wallis x 2 5 0 p 0 05 substrate s3 has the lowest tn levels with an average value of 0 035 mg l however no significant differences were investigated between the runoff from substrate s3 and s1 in tp concentrations 3 4 effects of substrate depth on the runoff water quality from green roof the results showed that the mean tn and tp concentrations were increased as the substrate depths of green roofs increased from 5 cm to 15 cm fig 3 indicated that nutrition was readily leached through the thicker substrate the tn concentrations of 5 cm substrate depth were significantly lower than in the 10 cm and 15 cm substrate depth treatments kruskal wallis x 2 8 4 p 0 01 the tp concentrations were significantly higher in 15 cm substrate depth than in the runoff from 5 cm substrate depth kruskal wallis x 2 4 1 p 0 05 however the tss levels were significantly lower in the runoff from 10 cm substrate depth than 5 cm and 15 cm depth treatments kruskal wallis x 2 7 4 p 0 01 3 5 impacts of vegetation on the runoff water quality of green roof the tss tn and tp concentrations for runoff from the green roof planted with different vegetation types was showed in fig 4 significant differences were observed in tn concentrations between green roof planted with sedum spectabile and radix ophiopogonis kruskal wallis x 2 4 9 p 0 05 similarly the tss levels for runoff from the green roof planted with sedum spectabile were significantly lower than the radix ophiopogonis kruskal wallis x 2 4 1 p 0 05 however no significant differences were observed between any of the vegetation types of green roofs with regard to tp concentrations the mean values of tp levels ranged from 0 039 mg l in sedum spectabile to 0 054 mg l in radix ophiopogonis the outflows from bare green roof g10 displayed higher tss concentrations than the planted green roof g1 runoff table 4 the average tss concentration of the bare green roof 149 11 mg l was about three times than that of the planted green roof 50 83 mg l the runoff from planted green roof showed higher tn concentrations than the bare green roof runoff and their differences were highly significant tss kruskal wallis x 2 8 3 p 0 01 tn kruskal wallis x 2 5 8 p 0 05 however no significant differences were observed between the planted green roof and bare green roof with regard to tp concentrations 4 discussion 4 1 general performance and function of the runoff water quality from green roof overall the tss levels of green roof runoff were ranged from 22 44 mg l to 55 22 mg l except the bare green roof this variability in tss levels was more obvious than that in the nutrition because some fine particles in the substrate passed through the filter net resulting in very high tss concentrations therefore there is a need to improve the filter layer to reduce the fine substrate loss thus decreasing the suspended solids levels in green roof runoff the tn concentrations in green roof runoff ranged from 0 37 mg l to 5 74 mg l this results are consistent with the previous findings that reported in other green roof studies berndtsson et al 2009 hathaway et al 2008 teemusk and mander 2007 for example hathaway et al 2008 showed that the mean concentration of tn in green roof outflows ranged from 0 07 mg l to 6 9 mg l in north carolina usa the tp concentrations in green roof runoff ranged from 0 023 mg l to 0 094 mg l which were lower than results in other green roof researches berndtsson et al 2009 hathaway et al 2008 liptan and strecker 2003 in this study the relatively lower tp concentrations of the green roof runoff resulted from the differences in wet deposition input fertilizer and growing substrate materials in this study the average tss tn and tp concentrations of the green roof outflows were significantly higher than that of the conventional roof runoff indicated that the studied green roofs behave as a source of nitrogen phosphorus and suspended solids table 3 the leach and flush of growing substrate by rainfall can potentially cause stormwater runoff contamination some studies observed a similar pattern of performance that green roofs acted as a source for nutrition berndtsson et al 2006 emilsson et al 2007 hathaway et al 2008 moran et al 2005 conversely some studies have found that green roofs are a sink for nitrate and ammonia nitrogen berndtsson et al 2009 speak et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 therefore observations of the nitrogen retention of green roofs have been inconsistent phosphorus is always leached from roof substrate at elevated concentrations berndtsson et al 2009 buffam and mitchell 2015 mitchell et al 2017 seidl et al 2013 teemusk and mander 2011 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 these mixed findings about nutrition in runoff from green roofs are mainly due to the large variations in substrate composition and depth plant species fertilizer application and age of the green roof berndtsson 2010 rowe 2011 sutton 2015 wang et al 2017 rowe 2011 concluded that the newer green roofs tend to release higher levels of pollutants than older green roofs therefore in this study continuous rainfall events were expected to readily leach the nitrogen phosphorus and suspended solids out from these newly built green roofs 4 2 impacts of substrate composition and depth on the runoff water quality from green roof in this study there were significantly differences of tn and tp concentrations between the three substrate composition types except between substrate s1 and s3 in tp the substrate s2 has relatively higher tn and tp in outflows than other two substrate compositions due to the pine needle in substrate s2 contains more organic matters similarly berndtsson et al 2009 and hathaway et al 2008 pointed that the percentage of compost in the substrate and the fertilizer used are the two key components apparently contributing to nutrients in green roof outflows lower tn and tp were leached from substrate s3 might be caused by the absorbability of vermiculite material jennett and zheng 2018 proposed that substrates optimized for phosphorus adsorption may be developed through careful selection of components with prior knowledge of their chemical properties alsup et al 2010 and vijayaraghavan et al 2012 emphasized that growing substrates can have an immense effect on the water quality of green roof runoff despite the increase of organic matter will improve substrate structure and provide more active nutrients the organic matter may be a source of leachate sutton 2015 moreover it has been described that rainwater passing through growing substrate with less organic matter presented more good water quality beecham and razzaghmanesh 2015 hathaway et al 2008 monteiro et al 2017 razzaghmanesh et al 2014 the substrate performs as an ion exchange filter for nutrients in the rainwater vijayaraghavan 2016 if the concentration of ions in the rainwater is substantially lower than the concentration in the substrate of a green roof then some of the ion will be leached from the substrate and the outflow will have a higher concentration of the ion than the inflow rainwater in this study the tn and tp concentrations of 5 cm substrate depth were significantly lower than that in the 15 cm substrate depth treatments indicated that the thicker growing substrate released more nutrition the thicker substrate contains more organic matters thus the nutrition was more prone to being leached out from the green roof system if substrates themselves are sources of pollution deeper substrates may seriously leachate the pollutants out from green roof system berndtsson et al 2009 dusza et al 2017 however the results were inconsistent with chai et al 2018 they found that the increase of substrate thickness was conducive to absorb more ammonia ions thereby reducing the ammonia nitrogen concentration of runoff monterusso et al 2004 investigated that higher nitrate concentrations from those roofs with the shallower substrate depths except the composition of substrate and its depth the magnitude of contaminants in green roof runoff is also affected by the soil microbes in the substrate the use of organics in the substrate and the age of the substrate 4 3 effect of vegetation on the runoff water quality from green roof in this study the plant sedum spectabile has the lowest tss tn and tp among the three vegetation types indicated that sedum produced few pollutants concentration in the leachate moreover the effect of the sedum on tn was more significant and noticeable it was possible that the sedums utilized n more efficiently than the other two plants and thus minimized the n concentrations in the leachate plant species in green roofs with higher nutrient demands and transpiration rates can retain more nutrients to decrease leachate contaminants john et al 2017 monterusso et al 2004 however no significant differences were observed between any of the vegetation types with regard to tp concentrations these results imply that the phosphorus in the substrate might not be used efficiently by plants and can be leached out by stormwater runoff chen et al 2018 also point out that plants used for green roofs are usually leaf producing plants and not fruit producing plants which might affect the usage of phosphorus in the substrate the bare green roof runoff displayed lower tn and higher tss concentrations than the planted green roof runoff in this study in consistent with our results aitkenhead peterson et al 2011 found that there is higher leachate nitrogen from a sedum green roof than from a bare substrate inconsistently beecham and razzaghmanesh 2015 and us epa 2009 investigated significant higher concentrations of water quality parameters e g nitrate nitrite and ammonia from the outflows of non vegetated than vegetated green roof in the first operational year of the system the impact of plants on nutrition or suspended solids of green roof outflows is complicated between bare and planted green roof on the one hand without vegetation cover the topsoil of bare substrate would suffer severe erosion loss thus fine particles in the substrate were more prone to being washed out from the bare green roof on the other hand the nutrient component of the substrate will be changed by plant litter branch leaf dead roots and metabolites of substrate microbial processes all of which will increase the pollutant sources sutton 2015 5 conclusion the present study investigated if the studied green roofs behave as a sink or source of pollutants in runoff based on simulated rainfall events and assess the impacts of substrate composition substrate depth and vegetation on the water quality of green roof outflows compared to the conventional roof the green roof enriched in the water quality parameters thus behave as a source of nutrient and suspended solids concentrations in green roof runoff the substrate composition significantly affected the nutrition in green roof runoff but did not significantly differ on tss levels the tn and tp concentrations of 5 cm substrate depth were significantly lower than that in the 15 cm substrate depth treatments the thicker growing substrate released more nutrition and suspended solids levels differences in plant species significantly influenced the tn concentration of green roof outflows the bare green roof had significantly higher levels in the tss and lower concentrations in the tn than that of the planted green roof however the tp values were not significantly different between the planted green roof and bare green roof in conclusion the nitrogen concentrations were more significantly affected by differences in both the substrate composition and the vegetation therefore we strongly emphasize that the appropriate choice of growth substrate and plants should be based on their function on runoff water quality in addition improving the filter layer would reduce the fine substrate loss thus decreasing suspended solids levels in green roof runoff precisely there is a lot of scope to screen substrate composition with less leaching and high sorption capacity as well as plants with high phytoremediation capacity and nitrogen utilization to mitigate the pollution risk of green roof runoff on urban water environment declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this study was supported by the national key

6313,green roofs are emerging as practical strategies to retain stormwater runoff and improve water environment quality of urban cities however the impacts of green roofs on stormwater runoff quality remains a topic of concern to urban planners and mangers in this study we designed the scale based runoff plots of extensive green roofs with different substrate and vegetation types and investigate whether the studied green roofs act as a sink or source of nutrients and suspended solids in their runoff compared to a conventional roof the influences of substrate and vegetation on the water quality of green roof outflows were also assessed the results showed that the average tss total suspended solids tn total nitrogen and tp total phosphorus concentrations of the green roof runoff were all significantly higher than that of the conventional roof runoff except substrate s3 the composition ratio of rural soil peat soil perlite vermiculite was 2 5 5 2 0 5 and s1 the composition ratio of rural soil peat soil was 1 1 in tp the substrate s2 the composition ratio of rural soil peat soil pine needle perlite was 1 1 1 1 displayed significantly higher tn and tp concentrations than either of the runoff from the substrate s1 and s3 the tn and tp concentrations of 5 cm substrate depth were significantly lower than that in the 15 cm substrate depth treatments significant differences were observed in tn concentrations between vegetation sedum spectabile and radix ophiopogonis however no significant differences were observed between any of the vegetation types with regard to tp concentrations therefore we suggest that green roofs need to be constructed of suitable substrate materials and plants based on their function on runoff water quality in order to mitigate the pollution risk of green roof runoff on urban water environment keywords green roof nutrition substrate total suspended solids vegetation water quality 1 introduction urbanization is a worldwide trend with more than 50 of the world s population currently living in cities united nations 2010 this trend leads to urban sprawl and has changed natural landscapes into increasing impervious surfaces the increase of impervious area associated with urbanization alters the natural hydrologic cycle by increasing runoff to rainwater drainages and surface waters while hindering deep surface infiltration fletcher et al 2013 the increased flooding events and deteriorating water quality in receiving waters are particularly associated with these ongoing changes carpenter et al 2016 one of the solutions to these problems is adopting new stormwater management strategies such as low impact development voyde et al 2010 green infrastructure gi benedict and mcmahon 2012 sustainable urban drainage systems suds stovin 2010 and water sensitive urban design wsud beecham and chowdhury 2012 installing green roof is viewed as a best technology to minimize the negative impact of urban development while providing numerous environmental benefits rowe et al 2012 these benefits include urban hydrology improvements water and air quality improvements noise pollution mitigation heat island effect reduction and increased green space in urban environments ascione et al 2013 berndtsson 2010 chen et al 2019 getter et al 2009 niu et al 2010 oberndorfer et al 2007 moreover green roofs use existing roof space without requiring extra land allowing potentially widespread application dvorak and volder 2010 mentens et al 2006 villarreal and bengtsson 2005 however the potential of green roofs to achieve these benefits often comes under debate ascione et al 2013 mentens et al 2006 for instance improvement of runoff water quality is one of the main benefits of green roofs which is unfortunately not properly understood berndtsson 2010 while much attention has focused on stormwater runoff quantity of green roofs several researchers have investigated the water quality of green roof outflows alsup et al 2010 carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 getter and rowe 2009 gregoire and clausen 2011 hathaway et al 2008 teemusk and mander 2007 van seters et al 2009 theoretically green roofs may reduce the pollution of urban rainwater runoff by absorbing and filtering pollutants as the roofs are covered with substrate and vegetation moreover the nutrient retention by the vegetated roof was strongly driven by retention of water quantity todorov et al 2018 some studies have found that green roofs are a sink for nitrate and ammonia nitrogen berndtsson et al 2009 carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 speak et al 2014 todorov et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 however there have been researches indicating that green roofs act as sources of pollutants such as nitrogen phosphorus organic carbon and heavy metals berndtsson et al 2006 buffam et al 2016 razzaghmanesh et al 2014 speak et al 2014 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 green roof may potentially contribute to the degradation of the receiving waters quality with pollutants released from substrate and fertilizers rowe 2011 teemusk and mander 2007 2011 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 therefore studies of nutrients in green roof runoff have shown mixed findings which have left the unanswered question of how green roofs affect the water quality in urban environment the water quality of runoff from green roofs generally decrease over time but runoff quality vary with substrate type substrate depth vegetation type age of green roof fertilization and maintenance practices as well as physical and chemical properties of pollutants berndtsson et al 2006 2010 gregoire and clausen 2011 monterusso et al 2005 morgan et al 2011 sutton 2015 teemusk and mander 2007 toland et al 2012 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 wang et al 2017 the growth substrate and vegetation play a critical role in influencing the quality of green roof outflows by absorbing and filtering pollutants berndtsson 2010 chen et al 2018 jennett and zheng 2018 rowe 2011 vijayaraghavan et al 2019 chen et al 2018 implied that the differences in the substrates exerted significant effects on the nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations expanded shale has the capacity to retain phosphorus ammonia nitrogen and metals in light substrates long et al 2006 moran et al 2004 showed that compost in the substrate layer may cause high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in green roof runoff monterusso et al 2004 found that nitrate concentrations in the green roofs runoff were higher from the sedum roofs than the herbaceous perennials and also reported higher concentrations from those roofs with a shallower substrate depth dunnett et al 2008 found that vegetation composition influenced runoff water quality from green roof when comparing differences in plants ranging from monocultures of forbs and grasses to combinations of both however research performed on these factors to possibly improve the runoff water quality of green roof is relatively limited long et al 2008 vijayaraghavan and joshi 2014 vijayaraghavan and raja 2015 the potential for runoff pollution of green roofs restricts the ecological and social values of green roofs which will negatively impact their wide spread utilization wang et al 2017 although several investigators reported green roofs as a pollution source which impacts urban water environment only few research efforts have been devoted to tackling this problem berndtsson 2010 chen et al 2018 vijayaraghavan et al 2019 if green roofs are to be considered environmentally benign then the selection of proper green roof component is extremely important vijayaraghavan and joshi 2014 without proper design and maintenance the leachate from green roofs might contain pollutants and become a new nonpoint pollution source in urban areas chen 2013 the ideal characteristics for green roof substrates should be lightweight and possess high water retention capacity hydraulic conductivity and air filled porosity burÃ©s 2013 vijayaraghavan and joshi 2014 however in practices substrate materials of green roofs were not screened based on their sorption capacity or less leaching tendency rowe 2011 green roof plants are usually selected based on their drought tolerance and aesthetics monterusso et al 2005 vijayaraghavan and joshi 2014 the contaminant absorption capacity was almost ignored in the design phase the questions asked in this paper are what is the current role of green roof in urban water environment with regard to its runoff water quality and does the runoff water quality differ significantly from different structural green roofs to answer the questions we design runoff plots of extensive green roofs with different substrate and vegetation types and to detect their concentrations of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total suspended solids tss under the simulated rainfall events the objective of this study was to 1 investigate if studied extensive green roofs behave as a sink or source of nutrients and total suspended solids in stormwater runoff compared to a conventional roof 2 assess the influences of substrate and vegetation on the water quality of green roof outflows 2 materials and methods 2 1 runoff plots of green roofs ten scale based runoff plots of extensive green roofs were constructed by 2 mm thick stainless steel platforms with internal dimensions of 100 cm wide 100 cm long 10 30 cm height fig 1 a the assembled constitution of a green roof from top to bottom is a vegetation growing substrate filter fabric and drainage layer the last layer was an additional waterproof layer comprising a waterproof roll paved onto the bottom of the platform the drainage layer was a 25 mm thick drainage board with high impact polystyrene dimple sheet a non woven geotextile fabric was bonded to the upper surface of the drainage board as the filter layer which prevented the small particles from being washed from the substrate layer out of the system the growing substrate and vegetation were filled and planted on top of the non woven geotextile the outflow openings were installed in the middle of the drainage layer and were connected by pipes with the diameter of 25 mm meanwhile a runoff plot of conventional roof paved with a 10 cm thick cement surface was constructed with the uniform size of the above green roofs a marked steel v flume was created at the outlet of the conventional roof for facilitating runoff collection all these runoff plots were placed on their metal bases at the testing ground of the dingxi institute of soil and water conservation in gansu province china 35 34 45 88 n 104 38 5 67 e this region is located in a semiarid climatic zone and is dominated by the warm humid summers and cold dry winters the mean annual precipitation based on local recorded data from 1956 to 2010 is 421 mm year of which about 78 total rain falls during the growing season wei et al 2009 the green roofs were designed following the orthogonal experimental design with three structural factors i e substrate composition substrate depth and vegetation types at three levels table 1 the substrate material selection was based on the roof greening material available in china bls 2005 considering the growth environment of plants and the bearing capacity of building roof three composition types of light weight materials were selected as the growing substrate the volume ratio of each mixture were as follow rural soil peat soil was 1 1 in substrate s1 rural soil peat soil pine needle perlite was 1 1 1 1 in substrate s2 rural soil peat soil perlite vermiculite was 2 5 5 2 0 5 in substrate s3 a small shovel was used to measure the mix proportions and blend the substrate in the assemble process simultaneously in order to keep the similar compactness of these substrate the substrate padding process was watered several times until the substrate infiltration had saturated according to the kosareo and ries 2007 the substrate depth treatments of extensive green roofs were set to 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm the vegetation layers were planted with three different plant species included radix ophiopogonis ophiopogon japonicas linn f ker gawl sedum spectabile hylotelephium erythrostictum miq h ohba and iris iris tectorum maxim these plants have high resistance abilities to drought stress conditions and have been widely incorporated in local landscaping works and green roof designs the plants were positioned in the substrate with an averaged density of 184 plugs m2 124 plugs m2 65 plugs m2 in addition a bare green roof g10 with no vegetation was also considered as a control sample compares with the green roof g1 2 2 rainfall simulation a norton ladder type artificial rainfall simulator was used in the field experiment and that was set to 3 5 m above the green roof runoff plots fig 1b veejet 80 100 nozzles with 41 kpa water pressure were applied in the spraying systems and spaced 1 1 m apart with a computer that oscillated across the plot to generate a constant rainfall intensity lee et al 2015 sutherland and ziegler 2006 specifically the median volume of rain drop size obtained by this rainfall simulator was 2 2 mm and the uniformity coefficient of rainfall reached more than 0 8 rainfall depth was set to 20 mm according to the rainfall characteristic in the study area six simulated rainfall events were repeated for each runoff plot of green roof during the experimental period 2 3 water quality test procedures and methods the water quality parameters of green roof runoff in this study focused on tss tn and tp the outflow from the green roof and conventional roof was collected in a plastic container below the designated runoff plot by means of a pipe at its downstream end the plastic containers and sampling bottles were rinsed three times with distilled water before rainfall beginning or runoff sampling in each rainfall event the composite water sample was collected after the runoff flow is over therefore a total of 11 water samples were taken from ten green roofs and one conventional roof runoff plots during each rainfall repetition in addition in order to determine the background input water quality six inflow water samples were manually collected during the experimental period this resulted in 72 water samples were collected with 0 5 l pre cleaned polyethylene bottles and stored in a refrigerator at the experimental station and then the collected water samples immediately carried to the laboratory in northwest institute of eco environment and resources chinese academy of sciences and prepared for testing the tss tn and tp concentrations which in all cases were carried out within a week of collection the tested methods of water quality were according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater which was published by the american public health association apha et al 2005 the concentrations of tss were measured using the filtering drying and weighing method little et al 2005 the concentrations of tn were measured using the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion and uv spectrophotometric method the concentrations of tp were measured using the persulfate digestion spectrophotometric method the test instrument of tn and tp was spectrophotometer hach dr5000 usa 2 4 date analysis methods as the experimental data did not meet the assumption of normality for parametric statistical analyses the data were then pooled for comparison of median values using the kruskal wallis non parametric statistical test with water quality concentrations as the independent variable the green roofs with different structural factors n 18 and conventional roof n 6 were classed as statistical groups the kruskal wallis test was performed using spss 19 0 software all figures were carried out using sigmaplot 15 0 3 results 3 1 patterns of the suspended solids and nutrition concentrations of green roof runoff the averaged concentrations of rainfall inputs for tss tn and tp were 10 50 5 65 mg l 0 45 0 17 mg l and 0 002 0 001 mg l respectively n 6 the average values and standard deviations of the measured water quality concentrations of outflows from the conventional roof and nine green roofs were summarized in table 2 the averaged concentrations of the conventional roof d1 runoff were 10 50 mg l 0 45 mg l and 0 002 mg l for tss tn and tp respectively the observed tss concentrations of green roofs except the bare green roof g10 were ranged from 22 44 mg l to 55 22 mg l with an average value of 37 73 mg l the averaged tss concentration of the bare green roof was extremely higher 149 11 mg l the averaged tn concentration of green roofs was approximately 1 58 mg l additionally all green roofs have very low tp concentrations the mean value was 0 04 mg l 3 2 runoff water quality of green roofs compared with the conventional roof as showed in table 3 the average tss concentration of the green roof runoff was 37 73 mg l which was significantly higher than that of the conventional roof runoff 12 08 mg l kruskal wallis x 2 27 4 p 0 001 the average tn concentration of the green roof runoff 1 71 mg l was significantly higher than that of the conventional roof runoff 0 59 mg l kruskal wallis x 2 6 5 p 0 01 the average tss and tn concentrations of green roofs were approximately 3 times than the conventional roof the average tp concentration of the green roof runoff 0 046 mg l was about 2 times than that of the conventional roof runoff 0 025 mg l the difference between them was also significant kruskal wallis x 2 5 0 p 0 05 3 3 impacts of substrate composition on the runoff water quality from green roof the differences for tss concentrations among the three substrate treatments were minimal the values were ranged from 30 72 mg l to 40 33 mg l statistically there were no significant differences in the levels of tss between the different substrate compositions the substrate s2 displayed higher tn and tp concentrations than either of the runoff from the substrate s1 and s3 fig 2 the differences were highly significant for tn concentrations kruskal wallis x 2 16 87 p 0 001 n 54 and significant for tp concentrations kruskal wallis x 2 6 6 p 0 05 n 54 the tn concentrations were significantly higher in the substrate s3 than in the runoff from substrate s1 kruskal wallis x 2 5 0 p 0 05 substrate s3 has the lowest tn levels with an average value of 0 035 mg l however no significant differences were investigated between the runoff from substrate s3 and s1 in tp concentrations 3 4 effects of substrate depth on the runoff water quality from green roof the results showed that the mean tn and tp concentrations were increased as the substrate depths of green roofs increased from 5 cm to 15 cm fig 3 indicated that nutrition was readily leached through the thicker substrate the tn concentrations of 5 cm substrate depth were significantly lower than in the 10 cm and 15 cm substrate depth treatments kruskal wallis x 2 8 4 p 0 01 the tp concentrations were significantly higher in 15 cm substrate depth than in the runoff from 5 cm substrate depth kruskal wallis x 2 4 1 p 0 05 however the tss levels were significantly lower in the runoff from 10 cm substrate depth than 5 cm and 15 cm depth treatments kruskal wallis x 2 7 4 p 0 01 3 5 impacts of vegetation on the runoff water quality of green roof the tss tn and tp concentrations for runoff from the green roof planted with different vegetation types was showed in fig 4 significant differences were observed in tn concentrations between green roof planted with sedum spectabile and radix ophiopogonis kruskal wallis x 2 4 9 p 0 05 similarly the tss levels for runoff from the green roof planted with sedum spectabile were significantly lower than the radix ophiopogonis kruskal wallis x 2 4 1 p 0 05 however no significant differences were observed between any of the vegetation types of green roofs with regard to tp concentrations the mean values of tp levels ranged from 0 039 mg l in sedum spectabile to 0 054 mg l in radix ophiopogonis the outflows from bare green roof g10 displayed higher tss concentrations than the planted green roof g1 runoff table 4 the average tss concentration of the bare green roof 149 11 mg l was about three times than that of the planted green roof 50 83 mg l the runoff from planted green roof showed higher tn concentrations than the bare green roof runoff and their differences were highly significant tss kruskal wallis x 2 8 3 p 0 01 tn kruskal wallis x 2 5 8 p 0 05 however no significant differences were observed between the planted green roof and bare green roof with regard to tp concentrations 4 discussion 4 1 general performance and function of the runoff water quality from green roof overall the tss levels of green roof runoff were ranged from 22 44 mg l to 55 22 mg l except the bare green roof this variability in tss levels was more obvious than that in the nutrition because some fine particles in the substrate passed through the filter net resulting in very high tss concentrations therefore there is a need to improve the filter layer to reduce the fine substrate loss thus decreasing the suspended solids levels in green roof runoff the tn concentrations in green roof runoff ranged from 0 37 mg l to 5 74 mg l this results are consistent with the previous findings that reported in other green roof studies berndtsson et al 2009 hathaway et al 2008 teemusk and mander 2007 for example hathaway et al 2008 showed that the mean concentration of tn in green roof outflows ranged from 0 07 mg l to 6 9 mg l in north carolina usa the tp concentrations in green roof runoff ranged from 0 023 mg l to 0 094 mg l which were lower than results in other green roof researches berndtsson et al 2009 hathaway et al 2008 liptan and strecker 2003 in this study the relatively lower tp concentrations of the green roof runoff resulted from the differences in wet deposition input fertilizer and growing substrate materials in this study the average tss tn and tp concentrations of the green roof outflows were significantly higher than that of the conventional roof runoff indicated that the studied green roofs behave as a source of nitrogen phosphorus and suspended solids table 3 the leach and flush of growing substrate by rainfall can potentially cause stormwater runoff contamination some studies observed a similar pattern of performance that green roofs acted as a source for nutrition berndtsson et al 2006 emilsson et al 2007 hathaway et al 2008 moran et al 2005 conversely some studies have found that green roofs are a sink for nitrate and ammonia nitrogen berndtsson et al 2009 speak et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 therefore observations of the nitrogen retention of green roofs have been inconsistent phosphorus is always leached from roof substrate at elevated concentrations berndtsson et al 2009 buffam and mitchell 2015 mitchell et al 2017 seidl et al 2013 teemusk and mander 2011 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 these mixed findings about nutrition in runoff from green roofs are mainly due to the large variations in substrate composition and depth plant species fertilizer application and age of the green roof berndtsson 2010 rowe 2011 sutton 2015 wang et al 2017 rowe 2011 concluded that the newer green roofs tend to release higher levels of pollutants than older green roofs therefore in this study continuous rainfall events were expected to readily leach the nitrogen phosphorus and suspended solids out from these newly built green roofs 4 2 impacts of substrate composition and depth on the runoff water quality from green roof in this study there were significantly differences of tn and tp concentrations between the three substrate composition types except between substrate s1 and s3 in tp the substrate s2 has relatively higher tn and tp in outflows than other two substrate compositions due to the pine needle in substrate s2 contains more organic matters similarly berndtsson et al 2009 and hathaway et al 2008 pointed that the percentage of compost in the substrate and the fertilizer used are the two key components apparently contributing to nutrients in green roof outflows lower tn and tp were leached from substrate s3 might be caused by the absorbability of vermiculite material jennett and zheng 2018 proposed that substrates optimized for phosphorus adsorption may be developed through careful selection of components with prior knowledge of their chemical properties alsup et al 2010 and vijayaraghavan et al 2012 emphasized that growing substrates can have an immense effect on the water quality of green roof runoff despite the increase of organic matter will improve substrate structure and provide more active nutrients the organic matter may be a source of leachate sutton 2015 moreover it has been described that rainwater passing through growing substrate with less organic matter presented more good water quality beecham and razzaghmanesh 2015 hathaway et al 2008 monteiro et al 2017 razzaghmanesh et al 2014 the substrate performs as an ion exchange filter for nutrients in the rainwater vijayaraghavan 2016 if the concentration of ions in the rainwater is substantially lower than the concentration in the substrate of a green roof then some of the ion will be leached from the substrate and the outflow will have a higher concentration of the ion than the inflow rainwater in this study the tn and tp concentrations of 5 cm substrate depth were significantly lower than that in the 15 cm substrate depth treatments indicated that the thicker growing substrate released more nutrition the thicker substrate contains more organic matters thus the nutrition was more prone to being leached out from the green roof system if substrates themselves are sources of pollution deeper substrates may seriously leachate the pollutants out from green roof system berndtsson et al 2009 dusza et al 2017 however the results were inconsistent with chai et al 2018 they found that the increase of substrate thickness was conducive to absorb more ammonia ions thereby reducing the ammonia nitrogen concentration of runoff monterusso et al 2004 investigated that higher nitrate concentrations from those roofs with the shallower substrate depths except the composition of substrate and its depth the magnitude of contaminants in green roof runoff is also affected by the soil microbes in the substrate the use of organics in the substrate and the age of the substrate 4 3 effect of vegetation on the runoff water quality from green roof in this study the plant sedum spectabile has the lowest tss tn and tp among the three vegetation types indicated that sedum produced few pollutants concentration in the leachate moreover the effect of the sedum on tn was more significant and noticeable it was possible that the sedums utilized n more efficiently than the other two plants and thus minimized the n concentrations in the leachate plant species in green roofs with higher nutrient demands and transpiration rates can retain more nutrients to decrease leachate contaminants john et al 2017 monterusso et al 2004 however no significant differences were observed between any of the vegetation types with regard to tp concentrations these results imply that the phosphorus in the substrate might not be used efficiently by plants and can be leached out by stormwater runoff chen et al 2018 also point out that plants used for green roofs are usually leaf producing plants and not fruit producing plants which might affect the usage of phosphorus in the substrate the bare green roof runoff displayed lower tn and higher tss concentrations than the planted green roof runoff in this study in consistent with our results aitkenhead peterson et al 2011 found that there is higher leachate nitrogen from a sedum green roof than from a bare substrate inconsistently beecham and razzaghmanesh 2015 and us epa 2009 investigated significant higher concentrations of water quality parameters e g nitrate nitrite and ammonia from the outflows of non vegetated than vegetated green roof in the first operational year of the system the impact of plants on nutrition or suspended solids of green roof outflows is complicated between bare and planted green roof on the one hand without vegetation cover the topsoil of bare substrate would suffer severe erosion loss thus fine particles in the substrate were more prone to being washed out from the bare green roof on the other hand the nutrient component of the substrate will be changed by plant litter branch leaf dead roots and metabolites of substrate microbial processes all of which will increase the pollutant sources sutton 2015 5 conclusion the present study investigated if the studied green roofs behave as a sink or source of pollutants in runoff based on simulated rainfall events and assess the impacts of substrate composition substrate depth and vegetation on the water quality of green roof outflows compared to the conventional roof the green roof enriched in the water quality parameters thus behave as a source of nutrient and suspended solids concentrations in green roof runoff the substrate composition significantly affected the nutrition in green roof runoff but did not significantly differ on tss levels the tn and tp concentrations of 5 cm substrate depth were significantly lower than that in the 15 cm substrate depth treatments the thicker growing substrate released more nutrition and suspended solids levels differences in plant species significantly influenced the tn concentration of green roof outflows the bare green roof had significantly higher levels in the tss and lower concentrations in the tn than that of the planted green roof however the tp values were not significantly different between the planted green roof and bare green roof in conclusion the nitrogen concentrations were more significantly affected by differences in both the substrate composition and the vegetation therefore we strongly emphasize that the appropriate choice of growth substrate and plants should be based on their function on runoff water quality in addition improving the filter layer would reduce the fine substrate loss thus decreasing suspended solids levels in green roof runoff precisely there is a lot of scope to screen substrate composition with less leaching and high sorption capacity as well as plants with high phytoremediation capacity and nitrogen utilization to mitigate the pollution risk of green roof runoff on urban water environment declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this study was supported by the national key

6314,urban waterlogging occurs frequently and often causes considerable damage that seriously affects human activities and the economy effectively assessing waterlogging susceptibility can reduce or even avoid the damage caused by such disasters here a support vector machine svm was chosen for waterlogging susceptibility assessment due to its simplicity objectivity and understandability the particle swarm optimization method was used to compute parameters of the svm when selecting negative samples for machine learning methods the methods of subjective selection and single random selection used in previous studies made it easy to select improper negative samples and thus affected the classification accuracy and generalization capacity of the trained classifiers to overcome these shortcomings we proposed a repeatedly random sampling and verifying model to select negative samples for an svm as such this study adopted the spatial framework of integrating gis and an svm to assess waterlogging susceptibility using the primary urban area of guangzhou as an example the results demonstrate that the waterlogging susceptibility map derived from the most accurate classifier mac can reflect the real occurrence and spatial distribution of waterlogging moreover we randomly generated 100 000 groups of samples to test the classification accuracy and generalization capacity of the mac the results show that in 82 of the samples the area under the curve value of the mac was higher than that of the randomly generated classifier this demonstrated that the sampling and verifying model can allow the selection of an mac with a relatively high and stable classification accuracy the proposed sampling method can overcome the shortcomings of negative sample selection method employed in previous studies which makes the machine learning results more accurate and reliable furthermore the method requires less data which can be helpful in developing countries where the availability of long term intensive hydrologic monitoring data is limited keywords gis most accurate classifier negative training sample selection particle swarm optimization svm 1 introduction urban rainstorm waterlogging can be defined as a stagnant water disaster in an urban area created by heavy precipitation that causes a collapse of urban traffic systems as well as enormous economic losses climate change and urban expansion frequently causes such disasters in the cities of china zhang et al 2012 yin et al 2015 such as in wuhan in july 2016 in beijing in july 2012 in changsha in july 2017 and so on assessing and predicting urban waterlogging can provide an effective way to reduce or even prevent related losses a common method used to simulate and predict the spatial distribution of urban waterlogging is to use hydrologic and hydrodynamic models quan et al 2010 based on locations of outlets the hydrologic model divides the study area into a large number of catchment sub areas then it uses experience methods to calculate the sink off and runoff of each catchment sub area and simulates inundation areas according to the spatial distribution of pipe networks smith 1993 one of the main representatives of hydrologic models the storm water management model swmm is often used in urban flood analysis bisht et al 2016 li et al 2016 however because an swmm relies heavily on pipeline data that is difficult to obtain this model has limited applicability zhang and pan 2014 the hydrodynamic model divides a study area into connected grids and then uses partial differential equations based on water flow to calculate the water interaction between adjacent grids tsanis and boyle 2001 paiva et al 2011 furthermore one or two dimensional hydrodynamic models have been used to spatially simulate the urban waterlogging process xie et al 2005 wang et al 2010 compared with hydrological models hydrodynamic models are more suitable for urban areas with complex underlying surfaces felder et al 2017 however the application of hydrodynamic models is limited since they are time consuming to create and analyze are only suitable for small regions and require complex data chen et al 2012 therefore new and more efficient methods will be necessary to address the shortcoming of these types of existing hydrologic and hydrodynamic models a support vector machine svm is a type of machine learning algorithm based on statistical learning theory proposed by vapnik 1999 as one of the best types of machine learning algorithms svms are efficient and easy to understand the powerful spatial analysis and data management tools of gis make svms suitable for pre processing and storing spatial factors as well as visualizing analysis or assessment results chen et al 2017 therefore the framework of integrating gis and svms has been widely used in natural hazard assessments for instance wei et al 2018 applied an svm to assess fire risk in buildings the results were in good agreement with the actual occurrence of fires in zhejiang province china lou et al 2012 used a combination of an svm and a gis to analyze the risk of tropical cyclones xu et al 2012 applied an svm and a gis in an integrated approach to assess the susceptibility of landslides caused by earthquakes in sichuan province china to analyze a slope stability samui 2008 used an svm and ultimately concluded that the classification accuracy of the svm was higher than the ann he used gis to clearly show the assessment results tien bui et al 2012 applied an integrated framework of svm and gis to a study of landslide hazard assessment the results of these studies proved the efficiency of using an svm in this field by comparing the classification accuracy of an svm with other machine learning algorithms furthermore combinations of svms with a gis have been applied many times in flood susceptibility assessment these studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using an svm in this field tehrany et al 2014 2015a 2015b hong et al 2018b therefore based on the satisfied results of svms in the susceptibility assessment of various natural hazards this paper chooses an svm as the analysis algorithm support vector machines belong to a class of machine learning methods that uses positive and negative samples to train for classifiers meanwhile svms are susceptible to noise data li et al 2013 so if inappropriate training samples are selected the classification results of svms will be greatly affected in the case of using machine learning methods to analyze a certain disaster the conventional methods used for obtaining positive samples can be summarized as an approach that is grids in the locations of the historic disaster events were treated as positive samples currently two main methods are used for selecting negative samples specifically subjective sampling and single random sampling however these sampling methods both have disadvantages researchers using the subjective sampling method will select negative samples based on personal experience such as selecting non inundated negative samples from high elevation and steep slope areas in floods studies tehrany et al 2014 2015b khosravi et al 2016 this approach can cause several factors such as elevation and slope to affect the assessment results excessively and thus weaken the effects of other factors furthermore single random sampling has been widely used for selecting negative samples this sampling method randomly selects negative samples only once from the entire study area or at locations without historical reports of disaster xu et al 2012 tien bui et al 2016 chen et al 2017 chen et al 2018a jaafari et al 2018 pham et al 2018b zhu et al 2018 hong et al 2019 pham et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the fact that an area lacks historical disaster reports does not mean the region is absolutely free of disaster events and therefore this single sampling method can result in the selection of inaccurate negative samples moreover a classifier generated only from a single group of samples without repeatedly selecting and verifying the data makes it difficult to guarantee its generalization capacity although the previous negative sample selection methods have many problems few studies have considered the effects of the sampling methods used in those studies on the classification performance of the trained classifiers therefore the deficiencies of the negative sample selection methods employed in previous studies need to be addressed based on the above discussion we can summarize the several shortcomings of previous studies first although hydrological and hydrodynamic models provide the most widely used approach in the field of urban waterlogging analysis these models have several disadvantages for example some data are difficult to obtain the models are only suitable for small scale studies and the analysis is time consuming second the methods used in some studies for selecting negative samples when using machine learning methods have shortcomings for instance the findings of some studies were influenced by subjective effects and this may generated a classifier without a high classification accuracy and generalization capacity the methods employed in the present study can resolve the shortcomings mentioned above first an svm is not limited by the specific input data used and the size of the study area as a result using the svm approach can overcome the shortcomings of using hydrologic and hydrodynamic models second this study employed a randomly repeated method to select negative samples which can not only theoretically avoid the effects of subjectivity but also avoids selecting inaccurate negative samples as much as possible this study presents an integrated spatial framework including an svm and involving a gis to spatially evaluate the possibility of waterlogging occurrence in the study area the primary objectives of the present study are as follows 1 to develop a sampling and verifying model which can select negative samples for the svm 2 to develop a spatial framework that integrates a gis and an svm 3 to assess the waterlogging susceptibility in the study area and 4 to demonstrate the advantages of the methods proposed in this study 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area guangzhou city the capital of guangdong province is located in southern guangdong province china guangzhou city has a wide variety of minerals including a unique form of granite subtropical evergreen broad leaved forest serves as the city s main vegetation type the average annual precipitation and temperature in guangzhou are about 1800 mm and in the range of 21 5 c 22 2 c respectively the lengthy monsoon season in guangzhou spans from april through september during the monsoon period the area is prone to small scale and high intensity rainstorms the study area the primary urban area of guangzhou covered about 1470 km2 in the central part of guangzhou including six districts baiyun haizhu huangpu liwan tianhe and yuexiu see fig 1 the terrain in the area falls from the higher northeastern part to the lower southwestern zones the primary urban area is the region that most frequently experiences waterlogging in guangzhou the reasons for the frequent occurrences of waterlogging in the primary urban area of guangzhou can be summarized as the following two aspects first the poor drainage pipe network directly leads to the occurrence of urban waterlogging the degraded pipe network in the old towns in the primary urban area generally has problems such as low construction standards and overtime service second with urban expansion the impervious surface expands rapidly which reduces the area of natural water and forests resulting in an increase in rainwater runoff and an increase in drainage pressure on the underground drainage pipe network meanwhile the expansion of underground city facilities has limited the space for construction of drainage pipe networks frequent occurrence of urban waterlogging in the primary urban area of guangzhou has seriously affected the local traffic and the daily lives of local people 2 2 data sources the impervious surface percentage isp and land use data were obtained from south china normal university li et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 positions of historic urban waterlogging events in the study area were obtained from the guangzhou bureau of water affairs li et al 2015 additional data were downloaded directly from the relevant websites all data sources are summarized in table 1 3 methodology 3 1 extraction of inundated areas ias extracting water bodies from optical remote sensing imagery provides a common method used to extract ias xu 2006 ticehurst et al 2014 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 cloud cover usually makes it difficult to extract ias because it blocks the view of the landscape in remote sensing images acquired during waterlogging this makes it difficult to acquire landsat and other low temporal resolution remote sensing imagery to obtain ias moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis imagery has a high temporal resolution and modis 8 and 16 day composite data is created by selecting the clearest pixels in the same location during the composite cycle therefore using these images can greatly reduce the interference created by clouds huang et al 2014 however to guarantee a satisfactory traffic flow the ias caused by rainfall on urban surfaces is normally removed by laborers within 1 2 days although modis 8 and 16 day composite data have fewer areas covered by clouds a composite image will not include some grids that are only inundated in the short term therefore due to the limitations of methods using optical remote sensing imagery we need to employ another method to delineate the ias here we used an approach based on historical data to obtain the ias we converted point layer data into a polygon layer based on the locations of historical waterlogging events which contained a total of 225 grids see fig 1 to avoid bias it is suggested that the number of positive samples should be similar to that of negative samples chen et al 2019a thus we need to obtain training data of the 225 non inundated grids the acquisition method is described in section 3 4 3 2 derivation of spatial factors because the resolution of spatial factors varied it was important to carefully determine the size of the grid units employed in the study area considering that most of the data used in this paper had a 30 m resolution the 30 30 m2 division scale can allow the values of most factors to not be affected by resampling additionally the ias were derived from point data without a spatial resolution therefore the use of a division scale of 30 m 30 m did not affect the accuracy of the ias the actual conditions related to waterlogging in the study area and the feasibility of data acquisition were carefully taken into account using recommendations in the literature wang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 tang et al 2018 six spatial factors were selected and defined as follows topographical features can influence the spatial distribution of waterlogging in general sites at lower elevation have a higher probability of being inundated because rainfall easily flows from highlands to lowlands under natural conditions meanwhile a surface with a steeper slope has a lower possibility of being inundated because rainwater can easily flow downslope tang et al 2018 the surface roughness sr is related to flash inundation by accumulating rainwater elkhrachy 2015 a surface with a higher sr is less likely to accumulate rainwater topographical factors were derived from the dem data the occurrence of waterlogging is related to soil water retention swr land with a higher swr can absorb more rainwater indicating this land has a relatively low probability of being inundated soil water retention data were derived from soil and land use data the swr factor was computed using a spatial hydrological modeling approach that was driven by the us soil conservation service curve number method chen et al 2014 the swr was calculated using eq 1 1 swr 25400 h 254 where h represents the curve number cn values which is related to land use soil infiltration and antecedent moisture conditions lower cn values indicate low runoff potential while larger values indicate increasing runoff potential a more detailed calculation process of the swr can be seen in the following references liu et al 2016 tang et al 2018 fractional vegetation cover fvc can affect the infiltration of surface rainwater which in turn affects the occurrence of waterlogging fractional vegetation cover is defined as the percentage of vegetation occupying a unit area liu et al 2012 the fvc data were derived from landsat 5 thematic mapper data before calculating the fvc we need to compute the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi value first the ndvi value can be computed by using eq 2 2 ndvi b 4 b 3 b 4 b 3 where b3 and b4 represent the red and near infrared bands respectively then the fvc was calculated using eq 3 3 fvc d d n d x d n where the range of the fvc is 0 1 and d dn and dx represent the values minimum value and maximum value of ndvi respectively buildings such as roads plazas roofs and parking lots in cities are collectively referred to as impervious surfaces and the percentage of the area of impervious surfaces per unit area of the surface is referred to impervious surface percentage isp powell et al 2008 water accumulating on the surface will infiltrate relatively slowly in an area with a high isp yu et al 2018 the range of isp is 0 1 after data processing we obtained the elevation slope sr swr fvc and isp the spatial distribution of these factors are shown in fig 2 with respect to the svm employed in the present study the purpose of classification is to speed up the convergence of the svm thereby improving its efficiency the standardization of classifying factors varies from place to place and thus we had to adopt a suitable method to classify the six spatial factors the natural breaks classification method has been used widely to classify factors with continuous values forkuo 2011 chalkias et al 2014 chen et al 2019b khosravi et al 2016 it can automatically determine the classification thresholds which makes the classification standard avoid human interference and easy to explain because all spatial factors used in this paper have continuous values the natural breaks classification method provided a suitable classification method for these factors therefore all of factors were divided into five classes using the natural breaks classification method see table 2 3 3 svm based on particle swarm optimization 3 3 1 support vector machine an svm is a supervised machine learning technique that is performed based on statistical learning theory with the aid of a training dataset an svm maps the original input data into a high dimensional feature space it finds a maximum margin of separation between classes and builds a classification hyper plane in the central area of the maximum margin pradhan 2013 next the characteristics of the new data can be used to predict the group to which a new record should belong for instance consider a training dataset of factor label pairs xi yi with xi rn yi 1 1 in the case of waterlogging x is a multi dimensional vector of input space that contains six spatial factors and the two classes 1 1 indicate the inundated and non inundated classes respectively recognizing the optimal separating hyper plane is the goal of using an svm which can separate the two classes into 1 and 1 from the training dataset for the case of linear separable data a separating hyper plane can be defined as tehrany et al 2015a 4 y i w x i a 1 Î¾ i where w a and Î¾i represent a coefficient vector that defines the orientation of the hyper plane in the feature space the offset of the hyper plane from the origin and the positive slack variables respectively hong et al 2018b more details related the svm internal calculations and formulas can be found in the literature tehrany et al 2015a hong et al 2018a pham et al 2018c the kernel function is important for an svm different kinds of kernels exist including linear polynomial radical basis function rbf and sigmoid kernels the rbf kernel can approach any nonlinear function and tends to achieve better performance zhang 2012 also when compared with the polynomial and sigmoid kernels the rbf kernel can obtain a high classification accuracy with fewer parameters which can greatly simplify its operation therefore the rbf kernel was employed for an svm in the present study the parameters that need to be determined by the rbf svm are the kernel width Ï and the regularization parameter c Ï controls the degree of nonlinearity of the svm model tien bui et al 2012 when Ï has a relatively low value the influence of a sample on the classification hyper plane is not significant c represents the tolerance of the model to the error the higher the c the lower the fault tolerance required by the model however the excessive value of c can affect the generalization capacity of an svm marjanoviÄ et al 2011 because the value of the parameters can affect the classification accuracy of an svm it is necessary to introduce parameter optimization methods to obtain the optimal parameters 3 3 2 particle swarm optimization a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm belongs to a group of evolutionary algorithms where a population of individuals or proposed solutions changes over time qian et al 2016 because a pso does not need to traverse all points in the space and does not fall into local optimal values the pso method was chosen to compute the parameters c and Ï in the case of a pso each particle or individual of the swarm is part of a vector zs that contains the parameters whose values we are trying to find in order to optimize the objective function particles positions zs and velocities vs are randomly initialized in a space of possible solutions the objective function value is then calculated for each particle and the velocities and positions are updated while taking these values into account common features of a pso are represented by position speed and fitness value and the fitness value can be obtained by using the fitness function zhou et al 2016 the algorithm updates the positions zs k and the velocities vs k of the particles in eqs 5 and 6 5 v s k 1 Ï v s k Ï 1 g k z s k Ï 2 i s k z s k 6 z s k 1 z s k v s k where k Ï gk and ls k represent the kth iteration the inertia weight the globally best particle positions and the locally best particle positions respectively Ï1 c1r1 and Ï2 c2r2 r1 and r2 represents random numbers in the range 0 1 and positive constants c1 and c2 are the personal and social learning factors respectively the particles of the swarm make up a cloud that covers the entire search space in the initial iteration and then gradually contracts in size as iterations advance performing the exploration nieto et al 2014 in the initial stages a population of particles is randomly generated and then the algorithm performs an exploration by searching for plausible zones in the last iterations the best solution is obtained fig 3 shows the flowchart of the pso svm structure 3 4 verification of classification accuracy receiver operating characteristic roc curves can serve as a popular method for conducting an accuracy assessment since they are understandable and visually attractive a roc curve is based on a series of different two category methods with the true positive rate sensitivity as the ordinate and the false positive rate 1 specificity as the abscissa the area under the curve auc refers to the area enclosed by the x axis and the roc curve the range of the auc is 0 5 1 pham et al 2018a when the auc value of a classier in a range of 0 5 0 6 0 6 0 7 0 7 0 8 and 0 8 0 9 this represents that the classifier s classification performance is poor medium good and very good respectively jaafari et al 2018 in the case of waterlogging a grid will be classified as inundated and non inundated sensitivity refers to the proportion of samples that are correctly classified as inundated while specificity refers to the proportion of samples that are correctly classified as non inundated the sensitivity and specificity can be computed by using eqs 7 and 8 7 s ensi t i v i t y p p m 8 s pecifi c i t y e e o where p and m are true positive and false negative respectively representing the number of grids that are correctly classified as inundated and non inundated respectively and e and o are true negative and false positive respectively representing the number of grids that are misclassification as inundated and non inundated respectively 3 5 sampling and verifying model to overcome shortcomings of the sampling methods mentioned in the introduction section we present a randomly repeated method to select negative non inundated training samples which can not only theoretically avoid subjective human influence but also avoid selecting inappropriate negative training samples fig 4 shows the flowchart of the sampling and verifying model used to output a most accurate classifier mac in the model n represents the number of iterations in each sampling table the sampling and verifying model randomly selected 225 groups of non inundated negative samples to form a sampling table with 225 groups of inundated positive samples according to previous references chen et al 2018b we set that 70 samples in a sampling table were randomly selected to compose the training data used to train the svm classifier the remaining 30 of the table was used to compose the testing data used to verify the classification accuracy of the trained svm classifier to guarantee the classification accuracy of the trained classifier the auc coefficient was selected as the evaluation indicator and was assigned values of 0 9 as thresholds for verifying the classifiers meanwhile to guarantee the generalization capacity of the classifier we set another rule that a classifier can be output only when its auc values of the training data and testing data are both 0 9 in this study n was set to 100 000 after n iterations the sampling and verifying model exported some classifiers that met the evaluation of requirements in general the mac is usually selected according to the principle of both the highest auc values of training data and testing data 3 6 spatial svm framework the spatial svm framework includes four modules that is data processing svm modeling susceptibility mapping and waterlogging analyzing module see fig 5 in the data processing module a multicollinearity analysis between the factors was conducted before the factor processing then all spatial datasets were projected converted and resampled to 30 30 m2 grids therefore all input layers can have the same projection and spatial extent finally the study area was divided into approximately 1 59 million grids and all factors were classified into five classes by using the natural breaks classification method after data processing we obtained a text file containing the information of inundated and non inundated grids in the svm modeling module to determine the values of the svm parameters we used the sampling and verifying model to generate a sampling table then training data with 70 data of this sampling table was imported into the pso svm function to compute the parameters c and Ï then the values c and Ï were used in the repeated sampling process a sampling and verifying model was presented for an mac and the probability of waterlogging occurrence for each grid in the study area was computed by using the mac in the susceptibility mapping module the probability of waterlogging occurrence of each grid was connected back to the arcgis spatial attribute table according to its serial number then these values were classified by the natural breaks classification method so that we obtained the waterlogging susceptibility map in the waterlogging analyzing module we tested the importance of each factor by removing a particular factor from the database then we confirmed that the sampling and verifying model can avoid the effects of subjective sampling and single random sampling this is done by showing the spatial distribution of the training data and testing data of the mac and confirming the classification accuracy and generalization capacity of the mac moreover we explored the relationship between the spatial factors and waterlogging susceptibility level by counting the area proportion of five susceptibility levels for the factors classes there are many acronyms used in this paper some are not commonly used and thus might cause confusion therefore to assist readers we have added table 3 listing all acronyms used and their meanings 4 results and discussion 4 1 multicollinearity analysis of spatial factors multicollinearity is a statistical phenomenon in which several explanatory variables in a model are highly correlated in a linear form li et al 2010 in the case of waterlogging when the factors are not properly selected a strong correlation may exist between certain factors those correlated factors should be removed chen et al 2019d therefore before using any factors for waterlogging analysis we need to conduct a multicollinearity analysis tolerance and the variance inflation factor vif are two important indices that are used when checking for multicollinearity theoretically the vif 10 or tolerance 0 1 represent a multicollinearity problem in the factors chen et al 2019c we performed a multicollinearity analysis with spss 21 software table 4 from table 4 we can find the lowest tolerance was the one calculated for slope which however is higher than 0 1 also the vif values for all the factors are 10 therefore the results of the multicollinearity analysis showed that no serious multicollinearity existed between the factors and all of the factors should be taken into consideration during the waterlogging analysis 4 2 particle swarm optimization process and the mac we used the sampling and verifying model to generate a sampling table containing 450 training samples and randomly selected 70 of the data of this sampling table to calculate the values of parameters Ï and c the adopted pso svm function was named psosvmcgforclass as developed by faruto and li 2011 with the matlab platform here we used its default setting of parameters number of maximum iterations 200 the size of number of particles 20 personal and social learning factors c1 1 5 c2 1 7 inertia weight Ï 0 6 also these pso parameter settings have been used in the study of meng et al 2012 according to the study of hong et al 2018b we limited the value of Ï and c in the range of 0 01 1 and 1 10 respectively fig 6 shows the convergence process of pso for seeking the optimal parameters after the pso calculation we obtained the values of the rbf svm parameters Ï 0 2 and c 1 we adopted the parameter settings Ï 0 2 and c 1 in the sampling and verifying process after 100 000 iterations we obtained a classifier with the auc values of the training data and testing data of 0 90 and 0 91 respectively as the mac in fact during the 100 000 sampling iterations the auc value of a classifier in the training data did reach the highest value of 0 92 but the auc value of that classifier in its testing data was only 0 77 the auc values of a classifier in the testing data did reach the highest value of 0 94 but the auc value of that classifier in its training data was only 0 82 considering that the mac should have a relatively stable classification performance in different samples these classifiers with large fluctuations in auc values under different samples cannot be selected as an mac 4 3 the function of the sampling and verifying model in this section we confirmed the function of the sampling and verifying model that is the avoidance of the effects of subjective and single random select negative samples we used elevation and slope as the background to show the spatial distribution of negative samples in the training data 167 groups of negative samples and the testing data 58 groups of negative samples respectively of the mac fig 7 from fig 7 a and b we can find that these points are evenly distributed in the study area from fig 7 c and d we also find that these points are not concentrated in areas with high elevation or steep slopes this demonstrates that the spatial distribution of non inundated samples was comprehensively affected by many factors rather than specific topographic factors however if we deliberately select negative samples at areas with a high elevation or steep slope the importance of elevation and slope factors will be excessively increased weakening the importance of other factors therefore using this sampling and verifying model can overcome the shortcomings of the subjective selection of non inundated samples and make the selected samples more reliable next we confirmed that compared with a single random sampling the sampling and verifying model can generate a classifier with a relatively high and stable classification accuracy fig 8 a provides the flowchart of this confirmation process first we used the sampling and verifying model to generate 100 000 sampling tables these tables were split at 70 and 30 for training data and testing data respectively then classifiers based on the parameters Ï 0 2 and c 1 corresponding to the training data of each sampling table were trained we used the mac and these training data based classifiers to classify the corresponding testing data and the auc values were saved through arrays to compare and visualize the auc values of the mac and training data based classifier we need to express these values by a chart however the results containing 100 000 auc values are difficult to show clearly on the line chart therefore we selected the auc values of the first 1000 samples and plotted them with a line chart fig 8 b the comparison results are as follows the number of 82 096 sampling tables have the auc values of the mac of the testing data were higher than that of the classifier generated from the sampling table s training data 282 sampling tables have the auc values of the mac of the testing data equal to that of the classifier generated from the sampling table s training data and 17 622 sampling tables have the auc values of the mac of the testing data lower than that of the classifier generated from the sampling table s training data compared with the classifier generated by a single random sampling the mac can achieve a higher and more stable classification performance among different samples therefore the results reveal that the sampling and verifying model can allow the selection of a classifier with a relatively high classification accuracy and generalization capacity 4 4 waterlogging susceptibility assessment based on the mac the probability of waterlogging occurrence in the study area was mapped with the natural breaks classification method fig 9 a the reason for using the natural breaks classification method to classify the probability values can be found in section 3 1 it can be observed that the svm based waterlogging susceptibility map was even and detailed within each class in addition no large continuous area exists in a single class which means that the svm fully considered the comprehensive effects of each factor the proportion of each area ranked at the five susceptibility levels is shown in table 5 the minimum maximum mean and standard deviation of the probability of waterlogging occurrence were 0 063 0 898 0 358 and 0 312 respectively from fig 9 a we can find that most grids were classified as the very low and very high susceptibility levels while the remaining three susceptibility levels were applied to relatively few grids the red area representing areas with very high susceptibility level in fig 9 a constitutes 28 9 of the total area and is mainly distributed in the southern and southwestern parts of the study area fig 2 indicates almost the red areas in fig 9 a have flat terrain low soil water holding capacity and sparse vegetation coverage especially in urban areas the conditions of low vegetation coverage with poor permeability caused by buildings and other urban infrastructure can easily breed and spread waterlogging disasters the very low susceptibility areas in blue which constitute 52 1 of the total area and are distributed in the northeastern part of the study area are mostly areas with lush vegetation and rugged terrain that naturally resists waterlogging in addition towns cannot be easily developed in these areas because of their local topography resulting in the good permeability of these regions in general studies of flood susceptibility assessment natural waters such as rivers were classified at the very high susceptibility level this is because natural water bodies have features of low elevation gentle slopes and low vegetation coverage to make the flood susceptibility map more realistic the regions of natural water bodies need to be removed from the map however in fig 9 a we can find that the river grids are correctly classified as very low susceptibility this is because the isp limited the probability of waterlogging occurrence in the river grids consequently the evaluation results of the svm conform to objective facts 4 5 relationship between the spatial factors and waterlogging susceptibility level based on the above analysis we can realize that the occurrence of waterlogging is comprehensively effected by all factors rather than by topographic factors such as elevation and slope counting the proportion of the area at five susceptibility levels for factor s classes can reveal the effect of each factor on the occurrence of waterlogging fig 9 b e show the proportion of the area at five susceptibility levels for each class of factors and this statistic is based on the 1 59 million grids in the study area in fig 9 b e each bar graph represents a certain factor the horizontal axis of a bar graph represents the five classes of a factor from class 1 to 5 and the ordinate represents the area proportion of a susceptibility level for a certain class of the factors fig 9 b e shows the proportions of the area at five susceptibility levels for classes of all factors vary in classes from 1 to 5 this indicates that all factors have effects on the occurrence and spatial distribution of waterlogging moreover for elevation the sum of the proportion of the area at the high and very high susceptibility levels increases from class 1 to 5 while the sum of the area proportion of low and very low susceptibility levels decreases at the same time this demonstrates that sites at lower elevations can easily become waterlogged while those at higher elevations are relatively free from being inundated across the five classes variations in swr sr fvc and isp were similar to those found for elevation meaning that a region covered by impervious surfaces with a flat terrain and with a limited water holding capacity can easily experience and facilitate waterlogging which is in line with objective facts however for slope the sum of the proportion of the area at the high and very high susceptibility levels for class 1 was slightly lower than that of class 2 the variation of the proportion of five susceptibility levels from class 1 to 5 was generally similar to that of other factors therefore the results demonstrate that the susceptibility map generated from mac can reflect the real occurrence and spatial distribution of waterlogging when a particular factor is removed from the database observing the change of auc value can test the degree of influence each factor has on the classification accuracy of the svm additionally during the 100 000 sampling process the average auc values of the training and testing data were 0 827 and 0 827 respectively we conducted the sampling and verifying model after removing a certain factor from the database table 6 from table 6 we can find that when a certain factor is removed from the database the average auc values of the training data and the testing data decreased which further indicates that each factor does affect the classification accuracy of the svm independently furthermore when the isp was removed the average auc values of the training data and testing data decreased most significantly while when the elevation was removed the average auc values of the training data and testing data decreased least significantly in fact the isp directly determines whether rainwater can penetrate or not therefore this factor has the strongest effect on the occurrence of waterlogging meanwhile the terrain in the study area is relatively flat so that the elevation have less of an effect 5 conclusions this study presents an integrate framework for using gis and an svm to spatially evaluate the waterlogging susceptibility using the primary urban area of guangzhou china as an example an svm was chosen as the algorithm for waterlogging susceptibility assessment because its advantages of simplicity objectivity and understandability the pso method was chosen to compute the parameters Ï and c of the rbf svm six spatial factors were selected and then classified into five classes by using the natural breaks classification method to overcome the defects of subjective selection of samples and single random sampling in previous studies this paper used a sampling and verifying model which can repeatedly randomly select negative training samples for the svm the results show that 1 there was no multicollinearity between the spatial factors 2 the sampling and verifying model can overcome the disadvantages of subjective and single random sampling in previous studies 3 the waterlogging susceptibility map derived from the mac can reflect the real occurrence and distribution of waterlogging disasters and 4 each factor does affect the occurrence of waterlogging and among them the isp has the strongest effect furthermore the method requires less data than previously documented methods which can be helpful in developing countries where the availability of long term intensive hydrologic monitoring data is limited this study is novel in using the sampling and verifying model to select negative training samples for an svm the results confirmed that the sampling and verifying model can allow the selection of classifiers with a relatively high classification accuracy and generalization capacity meanwhile this sampling and verifying model can also be integrated with other machine learning methods such as decision tree to train classifiers we believe our sampling method can replace the sampling methods of subjective sampling and single random sampling employed in previous studies limitations of this study are concluded as follows first the number of factors used are relatively few in the waterlogging domain the drainage pipe network data comprise an important element however we have no access to this data due to our limited authority therefore a more accurate waterlogging susceptibility map can be determined by introducing this data in future studies second the method to obtain the ias should be improved since using historical waterlogging locations to obtain positive samples is a conventional approach and thus lacks novelty in future studies a novel and easy to understand approach will be considered to obtain the ias declaration of competing

6314,urban waterlogging occurs frequently and often causes considerable damage that seriously affects human activities and the economy effectively assessing waterlogging susceptibility can reduce or even avoid the damage caused by such disasters here a support vector machine svm was chosen for waterlogging susceptibility assessment due to its simplicity objectivity and understandability the particle swarm optimization method was used to compute parameters of the svm when selecting negative samples for machine learning methods the methods of subjective selection and single random selection used in previous studies made it easy to select improper negative samples and thus affected the classification accuracy and generalization capacity of the trained classifiers to overcome these shortcomings we proposed a repeatedly random sampling and verifying model to select negative samples for an svm as such this study adopted the spatial framework of integrating gis and an svm to assess waterlogging susceptibility using the primary urban area of guangzhou as an example the results demonstrate that the waterlogging susceptibility map derived from the most accurate classifier mac can reflect the real occurrence and spatial distribution of waterlogging moreover we randomly generated 100 000 groups of samples to test the classification accuracy and generalization capacity of the mac the results show that in 82 of the samples the area under the curve value of the mac was higher than that of the randomly generated classifier this demonstrated that the sampling and verifying model can allow the selection of an mac with a relatively high and stable classification accuracy the proposed sampling method can overcome the shortcomings of negative sample selection method employed in previous studies which makes the machine learning results more accurate and reliable furthermore the method requires less data which can be helpful in developing countries where the availability of long term intensive hydrologic monitoring data is limited keywords gis most accurate classifier negative training sample selection particle swarm optimization svm 1 introduction urban rainstorm waterlogging can be defined as a stagnant water disaster in an urban area created by heavy precipitation that causes a collapse of urban traffic systems as well as enormous economic losses climate change and urban expansion frequently causes such disasters in the cities of china zhang et al 2012 yin et al 2015 such as in wuhan in july 2016 in beijing in july 2012 in changsha in july 2017 and so on assessing and predicting urban waterlogging can provide an effective way to reduce or even prevent related losses a common method used to simulate and predict the spatial distribution of urban waterlogging is to use hydrologic and hydrodynamic models quan et al 2010 based on locations of outlets the hydrologic model divides the study area into a large number of catchment sub areas then it uses experience methods to calculate the sink off and runoff of each catchment sub area and simulates inundation areas according to the spatial distribution of pipe networks smith 1993 one of the main representatives of hydrologic models the storm water management model swmm is often used in urban flood analysis bisht et al 2016 li et al 2016 however because an swmm relies heavily on pipeline data that is difficult to obtain this model has limited applicability zhang and pan 2014 the hydrodynamic model divides a study area into connected grids and then uses partial differential equations based on water flow to calculate the water interaction between adjacent grids tsanis and boyle 2001 paiva et al 2011 furthermore one or two dimensional hydrodynamic models have been used to spatially simulate the urban waterlogging process xie et al 2005 wang et al 2010 compared with hydrological models hydrodynamic models are more suitable for urban areas with complex underlying surfaces felder et al 2017 however the application of hydrodynamic models is limited since they are time consuming to create and analyze are only suitable for small regions and require complex data chen et al 2012 therefore new and more efficient methods will be necessary to address the shortcoming of these types of existing hydrologic and hydrodynamic models a support vector machine svm is a type of machine learning algorithm based on statistical learning theory proposed by vapnik 1999 as one of the best types of machine learning algorithms svms are efficient and easy to understand the powerful spatial analysis and data management tools of gis make svms suitable for pre processing and storing spatial factors as well as visualizing analysis or assessment results chen et al 2017 therefore the framework of integrating gis and svms has been widely used in natural hazard assessments for instance wei et al 2018 applied an svm to assess fire risk in buildings the results were in good agreement with the actual occurrence of fires in zhejiang province china lou et al 2012 used a combination of an svm and a gis to analyze the risk of tropical cyclones xu et al 2012 applied an svm and a gis in an integrated approach to assess the susceptibility of landslides caused by earthquakes in sichuan province china to analyze a slope stability samui 2008 used an svm and ultimately concluded that the classification accuracy of the svm was higher than the ann he used gis to clearly show the assessment results tien bui et al 2012 applied an integrated framework of svm and gis to a study of landslide hazard assessment the results of these studies proved the efficiency of using an svm in this field by comparing the classification accuracy of an svm with other machine learning algorithms furthermore combinations of svms with a gis have been applied many times in flood susceptibility assessment these studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using an svm in this field tehrany et al 2014 2015a 2015b hong et al 2018b therefore based on the satisfied results of svms in the susceptibility assessment of various natural hazards this paper chooses an svm as the analysis algorithm support vector machines belong to a class of machine learning methods that uses positive and negative samples to train for classifiers meanwhile svms are susceptible to noise data li et al 2013 so if inappropriate training samples are selected the classification results of svms will be greatly affected in the case of using machine learning methods to analyze a certain disaster the conventional methods used for obtaining positive samples can be summarized as an approach that is grids in the locations of the historic disaster events were treated as positive samples currently two main methods are used for selecting negative samples specifically subjective sampling and single random sampling however these sampling methods both have disadvantages researchers using the subjective sampling method will select negative samples based on personal experience such as selecting non inundated negative samples from high elevation and steep slope areas in floods studies tehrany et al 2014 2015b khosravi et al 2016 this approach can cause several factors such as elevation and slope to affect the assessment results excessively and thus weaken the effects of other factors furthermore single random sampling has been widely used for selecting negative samples this sampling method randomly selects negative samples only once from the entire study area or at locations without historical reports of disaster xu et al 2012 tien bui et al 2016 chen et al 2017 chen et al 2018a jaafari et al 2018 pham et al 2018b zhu et al 2018 hong et al 2019 pham et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the fact that an area lacks historical disaster reports does not mean the region is absolutely free of disaster events and therefore this single sampling method can result in the selection of inaccurate negative samples moreover a classifier generated only from a single group of samples without repeatedly selecting and verifying the data makes it difficult to guarantee its generalization capacity although the previous negative sample selection methods have many problems few studies have considered the effects of the sampling methods used in those studies on the classification performance of the trained classifiers therefore the deficiencies of the negative sample selection methods employed in previous studies need to be addressed based on the above discussion we can summarize the several shortcomings of previous studies first although hydrological and hydrodynamic models provide the most widely used approach in the field of urban waterlogging analysis these models have several disadvantages for example some data are difficult to obtain the models are only suitable for small scale studies and the analysis is time consuming second the methods used in some studies for selecting negative samples when using machine learning methods have shortcomings for instance the findings of some studies were influenced by subjective effects and this may generated a classifier without a high classification accuracy and generalization capacity the methods employed in the present study can resolve the shortcomings mentioned above first an svm is not limited by the specific input data used and the size of the study area as a result using the svm approach can overcome the shortcomings of using hydrologic and hydrodynamic models second this study employed a randomly repeated method to select negative samples which can not only theoretically avoid the effects of subjectivity but also avoids selecting inaccurate negative samples as much as possible this study presents an integrated spatial framework including an svm and involving a gis to spatially evaluate the possibility of waterlogging occurrence in the study area the primary objectives of the present study are as follows 1 to develop a sampling and verifying model which can select negative samples for the svm 2 to develop a spatial framework that integrates a gis and an svm 3 to assess the waterlogging susceptibility in the study area and 4 to demonstrate the advantages of the methods proposed in this study 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area guangzhou city the capital of guangdong province is located in southern guangdong province china guangzhou city has a wide variety of minerals including a unique form of granite subtropical evergreen broad leaved forest serves as the city s main vegetation type the average annual precipitation and temperature in guangzhou are about 1800 mm and in the range of 21 5 c 22 2 c respectively the lengthy monsoon season in guangzhou spans from april through september during the monsoon period the area is prone to small scale and high intensity rainstorms the study area the primary urban area of guangzhou covered about 1470 km2 in the central part of guangzhou including six districts baiyun haizhu huangpu liwan tianhe and yuexiu see fig 1 the terrain in the area falls from the higher northeastern part to the lower southwestern zones the primary urban area is the region that most frequently experiences waterlogging in guangzhou the reasons for the frequent occurrences of waterlogging in the primary urban area of guangzhou can be summarized as the following two aspects first the poor drainage pipe network directly leads to the occurrence of urban waterlogging the degraded pipe network in the old towns in the primary urban area generally has problems such as low construction standards and overtime service second with urban expansion the impervious surface expands rapidly which reduces the area of natural water and forests resulting in an increase in rainwater runoff and an increase in drainage pressure on the underground drainage pipe network meanwhile the expansion of underground city facilities has limited the space for construction of drainage pipe networks frequent occurrence of urban waterlogging in the primary urban area of guangzhou has seriously affected the local traffic and the daily lives of local people 2 2 data sources the impervious surface percentage isp and land use data were obtained from south china normal university li et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 positions of historic urban waterlogging events in the study area were obtained from the guangzhou bureau of water affairs li et al 2015 additional data were downloaded directly from the relevant websites all data sources are summarized in table 1 3 methodology 3 1 extraction of inundated areas ias extracting water bodies from optical remote sensing imagery provides a common method used to extract ias xu 2006 ticehurst et al 2014 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 cloud cover usually makes it difficult to extract ias because it blocks the view of the landscape in remote sensing images acquired during waterlogging this makes it difficult to acquire landsat and other low temporal resolution remote sensing imagery to obtain ias moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis imagery has a high temporal resolution and modis 8 and 16 day composite data is created by selecting the clearest pixels in the same location during the composite cycle therefore using these images can greatly reduce the interference created by clouds huang et al 2014 however to guarantee a satisfactory traffic flow the ias caused by rainfall on urban surfaces is normally removed by laborers within 1 2 days although modis 8 and 16 day composite data have fewer areas covered by clouds a composite image will not include some grids that are only inundated in the short term therefore due to the limitations of methods using optical remote sensing imagery we need to employ another method to delineate the ias here we used an approach based on historical data to obtain the ias we converted point layer data into a polygon layer based on the locations of historical waterlogging events which contained a total of 225 grids see fig 1 to avoid bias it is suggested that the number of positive samples should be similar to that of negative samples chen et al 2019a thus we need to obtain training data of the 225 non inundated grids the acquisition method is described in section 3 4 3 2 derivation of spatial factors because the resolution of spatial factors varied it was important to carefully determine the size of the grid units employed in the study area considering that most of the data used in this paper had a 30 m resolution the 30 30 m2 division scale can allow the values of most factors to not be affected by resampling additionally the ias were derived from point data without a spatial resolution therefore the use of a division scale of 30 m 30 m did not affect the accuracy of the ias the actual conditions related to waterlogging in the study area and the feasibility of data acquisition were carefully taken into account using recommendations in the literature wang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 tang et al 2018 six spatial factors were selected and defined as follows topographical features can influence the spatial distribution of waterlogging in general sites at lower elevation have a higher probability of being inundated because rainfall easily flows from highlands to lowlands under natural conditions meanwhile a surface with a steeper slope has a lower possibility of being inundated because rainwater can easily flow downslope tang et al 2018 the surface roughness sr is related to flash inundation by accumulating rainwater elkhrachy 2015 a surface with a higher sr is less likely to accumulate rainwater topographical factors were derived from the dem data the occurrence of waterlogging is related to soil water retention swr land with a higher swr can absorb more rainwater indicating this land has a relatively low probability of being inundated soil water retention data were derived from soil and land use data the swr factor was computed using a spatial hydrological modeling approach that was driven by the us soil conservation service curve number method chen et al 2014 the swr was calculated using eq 1 1 swr 25400 h 254 where h represents the curve number cn values which is related to land use soil infiltration and antecedent moisture conditions lower cn values indicate low runoff potential while larger values indicate increasing runoff potential a more detailed calculation process of the swr can be seen in the following references liu et al 2016 tang et al 2018 fractional vegetation cover fvc can affect the infiltration of surface rainwater which in turn affects the occurrence of waterlogging fractional vegetation cover is defined as the percentage of vegetation occupying a unit area liu et al 2012 the fvc data were derived from landsat 5 thematic mapper data before calculating the fvc we need to compute the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi value first the ndvi value can be computed by using eq 2 2 ndvi b 4 b 3 b 4 b 3 where b3 and b4 represent the red and near infrared bands respectively then the fvc was calculated using eq 3 3 fvc d d n d x d n where the range of the fvc is 0 1 and d dn and dx represent the values minimum value and maximum value of ndvi respectively buildings such as roads plazas roofs and parking lots in cities are collectively referred to as impervious surfaces and the percentage of the area of impervious surfaces per unit area of the surface is referred to impervious surface percentage isp powell et al 2008 water accumulating on the surface will infiltrate relatively slowly in an area with a high isp yu et al 2018 the range of isp is 0 1 after data processing we obtained the elevation slope sr swr fvc and isp the spatial distribution of these factors are shown in fig 2 with respect to the svm employed in the present study the purpose of classification is to speed up the convergence of the svm thereby improving its efficiency the standardization of classifying factors varies from place to place and thus we had to adopt a suitable method to classify the six spatial factors the natural breaks classification method has been used widely to classify factors with continuous values forkuo 2011 chalkias et al 2014 chen et al 2019b khosravi et al 2016 it can automatically determine the classification thresholds which makes the classification standard avoid human interference and easy to explain because all spatial factors used in this paper have continuous values the natural breaks classification method provided a suitable classification method for these factors therefore all of factors were divided into five classes using the natural breaks classification method see table 2 3 3 svm based on particle swarm optimization 3 3 1 support vector machine an svm is a supervised machine learning technique that is performed based on statistical learning theory with the aid of a training dataset an svm maps the original input data into a high dimensional feature space it finds a maximum margin of separation between classes and builds a classification hyper plane in the central area of the maximum margin pradhan 2013 next the characteristics of the new data can be used to predict the group to which a new record should belong for instance consider a training dataset of factor label pairs xi yi with xi rn yi 1 1 in the case of waterlogging x is a multi dimensional vector of input space that contains six spatial factors and the two classes 1 1 indicate the inundated and non inundated classes respectively recognizing the optimal separating hyper plane is the goal of using an svm which can separate the two classes into 1 and 1 from the training dataset for the case of linear separable data a separating hyper plane can be defined as tehrany et al 2015a 4 y i w x i a 1 Î¾ i where w a and Î¾i represent a coefficient vector that defines the orientation of the hyper plane in the feature space the offset of the hyper plane from the origin and the positive slack variables respectively hong et al 2018b more details related the svm internal calculations and formulas can be found in the literature tehrany et al 2015a hong et al 2018a pham et al 2018c the kernel function is important for an svm different kinds of kernels exist including linear polynomial radical basis function rbf and sigmoid kernels the rbf kernel can approach any nonlinear function and tends to achieve better performance zhang 2012 also when compared with the polynomial and sigmoid kernels the rbf kernel can obtain a high classification accuracy with fewer parameters which can greatly simplify its operation therefore the rbf kernel was employed for an svm in the present study the parameters that need to be determined by the rbf svm are the kernel width Ï and the regularization parameter c Ï controls the degree of nonlinearity of the svm model tien bui et al 2012 when Ï has a relatively low value the influence of a sample on the classification hyper plane is not significant c represents the tolerance of the model to the error the higher the c the lower the fault tolerance required by the model however the excessive value of c can affect the generalization capacity of an svm marjanoviÄ et al 2011 because the value of the parameters can affect the classification accuracy of an svm it is necessary to introduce parameter optimization methods to obtain the optimal parameters 3 3 2 particle swarm optimization a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm belongs to a group of evolutionary algorithms where a population of individuals or proposed solutions changes over time qian et al 2016 because a pso does not need to traverse all points in the space and does not fall into local optimal values the pso method was chosen to compute the parameters c and Ï in the case of a pso each particle or individual of the swarm is part of a vector zs that contains the parameters whose values we are trying to find in order to optimize the objective function particles positions zs and velocities vs are randomly initialized in a space of possible solutions the objective function value is then calculated for each particle and the velocities and positions are updated while taking these values into account common features of a pso are represented by position speed and fitness value and the fitness value can be obtained by using the fitness function zhou et al 2016 the algorithm updates the positions zs k and the velocities vs k of the particles in eqs 5 and 6 5 v s k 1 Ï v s k Ï 1 g k z s k Ï 2 i s k z s k 6 z s k 1 z s k v s k where k Ï gk and ls k represent the kth iteration the inertia weight the globally best particle positions and the locally best particle positions respectively Ï1 c1r1 and Ï2 c2r2 r1 and r2 represents random numbers in the range 0 1 and positive constants c1 and c2 are the personal and social learning factors respectively the particles of the swarm make up a cloud that covers the entire search space in the initial iteration and then gradually contracts in size as iterations advance performing the exploration nieto et al 2014 in the initial stages a population of particles is randomly generated and then the algorithm performs an exploration by searching for plausible zones in the last iterations the best solution is obtained fig 3 shows the flowchart of the pso svm structure 3 4 verification of classification accuracy receiver operating characteristic roc curves can serve as a popular method for conducting an accuracy assessment since they are understandable and visually attractive a roc curve is based on a series of different two category methods with the true positive rate sensitivity as the ordinate and the false positive rate 1 specificity as the abscissa the area under the curve auc refers to the area enclosed by the x axis and the roc curve the range of the auc is 0 5 1 pham et al 2018a when the auc value of a classier in a range of 0 5 0 6 0 6 0 7 0 7 0 8 and 0 8 0 9 this represents that the classifier s classification performance is poor medium good and very good respectively jaafari et al 2018 in the case of waterlogging a grid will be classified as inundated and non inundated sensitivity refers to the proportion of samples that are correctly classified as inundated while specificity refers to the proportion of samples that are correctly classified as non inundated the sensitivity and specificity can be computed by using eqs 7 and 8 7 s ensi t i v i t y p p m 8 s pecifi c i t y e e o where p and m are true positive and false negative respectively representing the number of grids that are correctly classified as inundated and non inundated respectively and e and o are true negative and false positive respectively representing the number of grids that are misclassification as inundated and non inundated respectively 3 5 sampling and verifying model to overcome shortcomings of the sampling methods mentioned in the introduction section we present a randomly repeated method to select negative non inundated training samples which can not only theoretically avoid subjective human influence but also avoid selecting inappropriate negative training samples fig 4 shows the flowchart of the sampling and verifying model used to output a most accurate classifier mac in the model n represents the number of iterations in each sampling table the sampling and verifying model randomly selected 225 groups of non inundated negative samples to form a sampling table with 225 groups of inundated positive samples according to previous references chen et al 2018b we set that 70 samples in a sampling table were randomly selected to compose the training data used to train the svm classifier the remaining 30 of the table was used to compose the testing data used to verify the classification accuracy of the trained svm classifier to guarantee the classification accuracy of the trained classifier the auc coefficient was selected as the evaluation indicator and was assigned values of 0 9 as thresholds for verifying the classifiers meanwhile to guarantee the generalization capacity of the classifier we set another rule that a classifier can be output only when its auc values of the training data and testing data are both 0 9 in this study n was set to 100 000 after n iterations the sampling and verifying model exported some classifiers that met the evaluation of requirements in general the mac is usually selected according to the principle of both the highest auc values of training data and testing data 3 6 spatial svm framework the spatial svm framework includes four modules that is data processing svm modeling susceptibility mapping and waterlogging analyzing module see fig 5 in the data processing module a multicollinearity analysis between the factors was conducted before the factor processing then all spatial datasets were projected converted and resampled to 30 30 m2 grids therefore all input layers can have the same projection and spatial extent finally the study area was divided into approximately 1 59 million grids and all factors were classified into five classes by using the natural breaks classification method after data processing we obtained a text file containing the information of inundated and non inundated grids in the svm modeling module to determine the values of the svm parameters we used the sampling and verifying model to generate a sampling table then training data with 70 data of this sampling table was imported into the pso svm function to compute the parameters c and Ï then the values c and Ï were used in the repeated sampling process a sampling and verifying model was presented for an mac and the probability of waterlogging occurrence for each grid in the study area was computed by using the mac in the susceptibility mapping module the probability of waterlogging occurrence of each grid was connected back to the arcgis spatial attribute table according to its serial number then these values were classified by the natural breaks classification method so that we obtained the waterlogging susceptibility map in the waterlogging analyzing module we tested the importance of each factor by removing a particular factor from the database then we confirmed that the sampling and verifying model can avoid the effects of subjective sampling and single random sampling this is done by showing the spatial distribution of the training data and testing data of the mac and confirming the classification accuracy and generalization capacity of the mac moreover we explored the relationship between the spatial factors and waterlogging susceptibility level by counting the area proportion of five susceptibility levels for the factors classes there are many acronyms used in this paper some are not commonly used and thus might cause confusion therefore to assist readers we have added table 3 listing all acronyms used and their meanings 4 results and discussion 4 1 multicollinearity analysis of spatial factors multicollinearity is a statistical phenomenon in which several explanatory variables in a model are highly correlated in a linear form li et al 2010 in the case of waterlogging when the factors are not properly selected a strong correlation may exist between certain factors those correlated factors should be removed chen et al 2019d therefore before using any factors for waterlogging analysis we need to conduct a multicollinearity analysis tolerance and the variance inflation factor vif are two important indices that are used when checking for multicollinearity theoretically the vif 10 or tolerance 0 1 represent a multicollinearity problem in the factors chen et al 2019c we performed a multicollinearity analysis with spss 21 software table 4 from table 4 we can find the lowest tolerance was the one calculated for slope which however is higher than 0 1 also the vif values for all the factors are 10 therefore the results of the multicollinearity analysis showed that no serious multicollinearity existed between the factors and all of the factors should be taken into consideration during the waterlogging analysis 4 2 particle swarm optimization process and the mac we used the sampling and verifying model to generate a sampling table containing 450 training samples and randomly selected 70 of the data of this sampling table to calculate the values of parameters Ï and c the adopted pso svm function was named psosvmcgforclass as developed by faruto and li 2011 with the matlab platform here we used its default setting of parameters number of maximum iterations 200 the size of number of particles 20 personal and social learning factors c1 1 5 c2 1 7 inertia weight Ï 0 6 also these pso parameter settings have been used in the study of meng et al 2012 according to the study of hong et al 2018b we limited the value of Ï and c in the range of 0 01 1 and 1 10 respectively fig 6 shows the convergence process of pso for seeking the optimal parameters after the pso calculation we obtained the values of the rbf svm parameters Ï 0 2 and c 1 we adopted the parameter settings Ï 0 2 and c 1 in the sampling and verifying process after 100 000 iterations we obtained a classifier with the auc values of the training data and testing data of 0 90 and 0 91 respectively as the mac in fact during the 100 000 sampling iterations the auc value of a classifier in the training data did reach the highest value of 0 92 but the auc value of that classifier in its testing data was only 0 77 the auc values of a classifier in the testing data did reach the highest value of 0 94 but the auc value of that classifier in its training data was only 0 82 considering that the mac should have a relatively stable classification performance in different samples these classifiers with large fluctuations in auc values under different samples cannot be selected as an mac 4 3 the function of the sampling and verifying model in this section we confirmed the function of the sampling and verifying model that is the avoidance of the effects of subjective and single random select negative samples we used elevation and slope as the background to show the spatial distribution of negative samples in the training data 167 groups of negative samples and the testing data 58 groups of negative samples respectively of the mac fig 7 from fig 7 a and b we can find that these points are evenly distributed in the study area from fig 7 c and d we also find that these points are not concentrated in areas with high elevation or steep slopes this demonstrates that the spatial distribution of non inundated samples was comprehensively affected by many factors rather than specific topographic factors however if we deliberately select negative samples at areas with a high elevation or steep slope the importance of elevation and slope factors will be excessively increased weakening the importance of other factors therefore using this sampling and verifying model can overcome the shortcomings of the subjective selection of non inundated samples and make the selected samples more reliable next we confirmed that compared with a single random sampling the sampling and verifying model can generate a classifier with a relatively high and stable classification accuracy fig 8 a provides the flowchart of this confirmation process first we used the sampling and verifying model to generate 100 000 sampling tables these tables were split at 70 and 30 for training data and testing data respectively then classifiers based on the parameters Ï 0 2 and c 1 corresponding to the training data of each sampling table were trained we used the mac and these training data based classifiers to classify the corresponding testing data and the auc values were saved through arrays to compare and visualize the auc values of the mac and training data based classifier we need to express these values by a chart however the results containing 100 000 auc values are difficult to show clearly on the line chart therefore we selected the auc values of the first 1000 samples and plotted them with a line chart fig 8 b the comparison results are as follows the number of 82 096 sampling tables have the auc values of the mac of the testing data were higher than that of the classifier generated from the sampling table s training data 282 sampling tables have the auc values of the mac of the testing data equal to that of the classifier generated from the sampling table s training data and 17 622 sampling tables have the auc values of the mac of the testing data lower than that of the classifier generated from the sampling table s training data compared with the classifier generated by a single random sampling the mac can achieve a higher and more stable classification performance among different samples therefore the results reveal that the sampling and verifying model can allow the selection of a classifier with a relatively high classification accuracy and generalization capacity 4 4 waterlogging susceptibility assessment based on the mac the probability of waterlogging occurrence in the study area was mapped with the natural breaks classification method fig 9 a the reason for using the natural breaks classification method to classify the probability values can be found in section 3 1 it can be observed that the svm based waterlogging susceptibility map was even and detailed within each class in addition no large continuous area exists in a single class which means that the svm fully considered the comprehensive effects of each factor the proportion of each area ranked at the five susceptibility levels is shown in table 5 the minimum maximum mean and standard deviation of the probability of waterlogging occurrence were 0 063 0 898 0 358 and 0 312 respectively from fig 9 a we can find that most grids were classified as the very low and very high susceptibility levels while the remaining three susceptibility levels were applied to relatively few grids the red area representing areas with very high susceptibility level in fig 9 a constitutes 28 9 of the total area and is mainly distributed in the southern and southwestern parts of the study area fig 2 indicates almost the red areas in fig 9 a have flat terrain low soil water holding capacity and sparse vegetation coverage especially in urban areas the conditions of low vegetation coverage with poor permeability caused by buildings and other urban infrastructure can easily breed and spread waterlogging disasters the very low susceptibility areas in blue which constitute 52 1 of the total area and are distributed in the northeastern part of the study area are mostly areas with lush vegetation and rugged terrain that naturally resists waterlogging in addition towns cannot be easily developed in these areas because of their local topography resulting in the good permeability of these regions in general studies of flood susceptibility assessment natural waters such as rivers were classified at the very high susceptibility level this is because natural water bodies have features of low elevation gentle slopes and low vegetation coverage to make the flood susceptibility map more realistic the regions of natural water bodies need to be removed from the map however in fig 9 a we can find that the river grids are correctly classified as very low susceptibility this is because the isp limited the probability of waterlogging occurrence in the river grids consequently the evaluation results of the svm conform to objective facts 4 5 relationship between the spatial factors and waterlogging susceptibility level based on the above analysis we can realize that the occurrence of waterlogging is comprehensively effected by all factors rather than by topographic factors such as elevation and slope counting the proportion of the area at five susceptibility levels for factor s classes can reveal the effect of each factor on the occurrence of waterlogging fig 9 b e show the proportion of the area at five susceptibility levels for each class of factors and this statistic is based on the 1 59 million grids in the study area in fig 9 b e each bar graph represents a certain factor the horizontal axis of a bar graph represents the five classes of a factor from class 1 to 5 and the ordinate represents the area proportion of a susceptibility level for a certain class of the factors fig 9 b e shows the proportions of the area at five susceptibility levels for classes of all factors vary in classes from 1 to 5 this indicates that all factors have effects on the occurrence and spatial distribution of waterlogging moreover for elevation the sum of the proportion of the area at the high and very high susceptibility levels increases from class 1 to 5 while the sum of the area proportion of low and very low susceptibility levels decreases at the same time this demonstrates that sites at lower elevations can easily become waterlogged while those at higher elevations are relatively free from being inundated across the five classes variations in swr sr fvc and isp were similar to those found for elevation meaning that a region covered by impervious surfaces with a flat terrain and with a limited water holding capacity can easily experience and facilitate waterlogging which is in line with objective facts however for slope the sum of the proportion of the area at the high and very high susceptibility levels for class 1 was slightly lower than that of class 2 the variation of the proportion of five susceptibility levels from class 1 to 5 was generally similar to that of other factors therefore the results demonstrate that the susceptibility map generated from mac can reflect the real occurrence and spatial distribution of waterlogging when a particular factor is removed from the database observing the change of auc value can test the degree of influence each factor has on the classification accuracy of the svm additionally during the 100 000 sampling process the average auc values of the training and testing data were 0 827 and 0 827 respectively we conducted the sampling and verifying model after removing a certain factor from the database table 6 from table 6 we can find that when a certain factor is removed from the database the average auc values of the training data and the testing data decreased which further indicates that each factor does affect the classification accuracy of the svm independently furthermore when the isp was removed the average auc values of the training data and testing data decreased most significantly while when the elevation was removed the average auc values of the training data and testing data decreased least significantly in fact the isp directly determines whether rainwater can penetrate or not therefore this factor has the strongest effect on the occurrence of waterlogging meanwhile the terrain in the study area is relatively flat so that the elevation have less of an effect 5 conclusions this study presents an integrate framework for using gis and an svm to spatially evaluate the waterlogging susceptibility using the primary urban area of guangzhou china as an example an svm was chosen as the algorithm for waterlogging susceptibility assessment because its advantages of simplicity objectivity and understandability the pso method was chosen to compute the parameters Ï and c of the rbf svm six spatial factors were selected and then classified into five classes by using the natural breaks classification method to overcome the defects of subjective selection of samples and single random sampling in previous studies this paper used a sampling and verifying model which can repeatedly randomly select negative training samples for the svm the results show that 1 there was no multicollinearity between the spatial factors 2 the sampling and verifying model can overcome the disadvantages of subjective and single random sampling in previous studies 3 the waterlogging susceptibility map derived from the mac can reflect the real occurrence and distribution of waterlogging disasters and 4 each factor does affect the occurrence of waterlogging and among them the isp has the strongest effect furthermore the method requires less data than previously documented methods which can be helpful in developing countries where the availability of long term intensive hydrologic monitoring data is limited this study is novel in using the sampling and verifying model to select negative training samples for an svm the results confirmed that the sampling and verifying model can allow the selection of classifiers with a relatively high classification accuracy and generalization capacity meanwhile this sampling and verifying model can also be integrated with other machine learning methods such as decision tree to train classifiers we believe our sampling method can replace the sampling methods of subjective sampling and single random sampling employed in previous studies limitations of this study are concluded as follows first the number of factors used are relatively few in the waterlogging domain the drainage pipe network data comprise an important element however we have no access to this data due to our limited authority therefore a more accurate waterlogging susceptibility map can be determined by introducing this data in future studies second the method to obtain the ias should be improved since using historical waterlogging locations to obtain positive samples is a conventional approach and thus lacks novelty in future studies a novel and easy to understand approach will be considered to obtain the ias declaration of competing
