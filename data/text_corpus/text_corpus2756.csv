13780,iron plaque ip on root surface has a significant effect on uptake and accumulation of heavy metals by wetland plants however the role of vinasse in modulating the relevant process still remains unclear present study hypothesizes vinasse at appropriate addition could promote ip formation and lead pb cadmium cd copper cu and zinc zn removal by acorus calamus in constructed wetlands cws for that purpose 0 0 2 and 0 4 addition of vinasse was applied in lab scale cws planted with a calamus which were conducted with low and high concentration of pb cd cu and zn wastewater respectively results indicated that increase of heavy metals concentration promoted root oxidation activity and the expression of heavy metal transport genes were increased which was the reason that vinasse promoted the formation of ip under high concentration of pb cd cu and zn while inhibited under low concentration of pb cd cu and zn the change of ip affected by vinasse had a strong effect for uptake and accumulation of pb cd cu and zn by a calamus ip facilitated the transfer of cd and zn to the aboveground part pb was mainly stored in ip while cu was mainly stored in the root redundancy analysis rda showed ip content and pb cd cu zn contents in ip played a decisive role in the heavy metal uptake and accumulation in a calamus therefore vinasse has potential to be used in cws to assist wetland plants in removing pb cd cu zn co contaminated wastewater keywords vinasse heavy metals constructed wetlands immobilization iron plaque 1 introduction industrial activities agrochemicals phosphatic fertilizers pesticides which contains heavy metals applications and exploitation of mineral resources have led to increase degradation of aquatic environment 1 previous studies had showed that there are lots of heavy metals in landfill leachate such as cadmium cd chromium cr iron fe lead pb zinc zn 2 and the metal concentrations in young and old leachate are usually different 3 mining effluent also contains a large amount of heavy metals such as pb cd copper cu zn and cr 4 moreover acid mine drainage is a major source of cu manganese mn fe and zn metal contamination in many regions of the world 5 heavy metals pb 6 cd 7 cu and zn 4 are persistent pollutant which are not easy to degrade and they have potential risks to most plants through uptake of root 8 which is the main reason harming human health and the ecological environment 9 as a kind of environmentally friendly low energy input and simple operation of wastewater treatment system 10 constructed wetlands cws have been widely used for processing various types of wastewater including removal of heavy metals from wastewater 11 12 the key of processing is to find a suitable and efficient plant for absorption of heavy metals and choose an appropriate substrate material which has better purification effect for wetland combination 13 cws can effectively remove heavy metals from waste water and has received widespread attention all over the world 14 as a kind of perennial aquatic macrophytes a calamus is widely used in cws previous studies showed that a calamus can absorb a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in water 15 and can accumulate a large amount of pb 16 cd and cu 17 in plant tissues and it can live with high concentration of cd stress 18 under the condition of cu zn pb cd pollution the content of heavy metals in a calamus follows cu zn pb cd and a calamus has higher enrichment coefficient for cd but less for pb 19 radial oxygen loss has an important effect on the uptake of heavy metals by wetland plants wetland plants can deliver oxygen to their roots through photosynthesis some for their own root respiration and the other part is released into the rhizosphere environment 20 radial oxygen loss of plant 20 and biological oxidation of microorganisms 21 oxidize fe ii to f iii which attached on root surface and substrate surface 29 it is called iron plaque ip and mainly consists of fe iii oxo hydroxides 22 since root surface is where the nutrients and contaminants enter into the plant a large amount of cations were adsorbed in the ip which led to a significant effect on uptake of both nutrients and heavy metals to plant 23 moreover the associated physical and biochemical processes in root surface is also profound influenced 6 ip has high surface areas 24 and a porous mineral structure which could absorb and immobilize a significant amount of heavy metals 25 on the other hand ip on roots may play a barrier to uptake of cationic nutrients 26 and heavy metals 27 fu et al 7 also proved that ip inhibits adsorption of other cations including heavy metals because of positive characteristics of ip which could neutralizes some negative charge it was also found that ip exists active oh functional groups which is the reason of reacting with heavy metals and other nutrient ions 24 therefore the impact of ip on plant immobilization of heavy metals has two aspects and it can inhibit or enhance uptake of heavy metals by plant 28 it is not conclusive how ip regulate the immobilization of pb cd cu and zn some previous studies indicated that ip inhibits cd transferring from underground to ground part 29 while others insisted that ip has a synergistic effect for wetland plants uptaking heavy metals 30 it was found that rice shoot cd mn and zn concentrations were strongly positively correlated with cd r2 0 98 mn r 2 0 97 and zn r 2 0 76 in ip 31 it was also found that the bioavailability of heavy metals varied with ip content 31 moreover there is a certain correlation between ip content and heavy metal concentration it was found that when the concentration of cd is 0 5 mg l 1 more iron film is formed to absorb more cd 32 pb cd are not plant nutrient cu zn is an essential element in plant but in large quantities can be toxic to plants and they enter into the plant by the same transporters of other elements including fe 33 and ca and mg 34 plant uptake of pb cd cu zn is affected by characteristic of ip and competitive adsorption of nutrients and heavy metals 33 the plant itself plays a decisive role in the absorption of heavy metals and the substrate environment in which the plant grows also affects the formation of ip and the absorption of heavy metals 35 previous study showed that biochar enhances plant growth and nutrient removal in horizontal subsurface flow cws 23 biomass materials have a natural affinity for heavy metals can be used widely to purify a wide range of wastewater containing heavy metals and mixed metal ion in recent years the adsorption of heavy metal ions in wastewater by rice husk 19 corn cob 36 sugarcane bagasse 37 grapefruit peel 30 peanut shell 38 and vinasse 39 have been studied vinasse is a kind of biomass materials and it is the main by product of alcohol and wine making industry which is rich in a large number of nutrients such as crude fiber fat amino acids lake starch minerals enzymes and a variety of microbiotin and it has the advantages of low cost and easy to obtain 40 at present the vast majority of enterprises or individuals have a relatively simple treatment method of vinasse which is basically a simple dry treatment and then sold directly as feed or fertilizer or even directly landfill 41 however the rich nutrients in vinasse are not utilized which not only causes serious waste of resources but also causes environmental pollution therefore it is urgent to turn this vinasse into a beneficial product and minimize its adverse impacts to environmental however there are few studies on the use of vinasse in cws to remove heavy metals from wastewater studies have shown that high concentrations of heavy metals can inhibit the root activity of plants 42 damage the chloroplasts of plants leading to a decrease in the intensity of photosynthesis 43 and damage the cell membrane of plants leading to an increase in membrane permeability 44 however peng et al 2016 have found that vinasse can improve the ecological environment of the substrate and promote the growth of plants 45 this is beneficial to increase plant photosynthesis and respiration which facilitates ip formation previous studies mostly focused on the effects of pb cd cu zn on plant growth adsorption of heavy metals by vinasse and its effects on plant growth but the role of vinasse in regulating ip formation and its effect for pb cd cu zn immobilization by wetland plants are poorly understood considering the multitude factors of affecting ip discussed above we hypothesized that vinasse at appropriate addition could promote formation of ip and increase pb cd cu zn immobilization by a calamus this paper is to verify the hypothesis elucidating how pb cd cu zn and vinasse couple to impact ip formation and pb cd cu zn adsorption and to determine the sorption ability of ip through scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds microscopy and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy to simulate the environment in which plant grows we used a calamus as model plant and grew it in constructed wetland pilot model filled with sand and different vinasse percent addition conducted with different concentration of pb cd cu zn wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic wastewater the composition of synthetic wastewater is presented in table 1 it contained nitrogen phosphorus and heavy metals fe pb cd cu and zn we set up three pb cd cu zn concentrations control group ck low concentration l and high concentration h nitrogen measured as nh4 2so4 deen reagent china and pb no3 2 hongxing huagong china 20 mg l 1 phosphorus measured as kh2po4 guangfu technology china 5 mg l 1 fe measured as edta fena fuchen china 30

znso4 7h2o zhiyuan china 0 20 and 40 mg l 1 2 2 lab scale cws lab scale cws were placed in an artificial greenhouse at the field observation and experimental station of farmland irrigation research institute at xinxiang henan province of china 35 19 n 113 53 e altitude 73 2 m each cws consisted of a polyethylene container 65 cm length 65 cm width 100 cm height with a metering pump the cws were filled from bottom to top with gravel 20 30 mm 10 cm depth youli building materials co ltd xinxiang china sand mixture 0 25 0 35 mm 60 cm depth youli building materials co ltd xinxiang china and the gravel and sand layers were separated by a 200 mesh nylon xianglu building materials co ltd hunan china the sand was rinsed 3 times with deionized water and air dried naturally before filling it into cws then the vinasse xianfeng pharmaceutical co ltd henan china was mixed with sand at a ratio of 0 2 or 0 4 w w and then the mixture were added into the cws for experiment the sand without vinasse was treated as control the cws were planted with a calamus 30 cm height 1 50 g fresh weight throughout the growth period the air temperature in the greenhouse varied from 15 c to 40 c to simulate the actual condition for aquatic plants growth in cws 2 3 plant preparation these emergent plant seeds were purchased from lishi flowers co ltd jiangsu china the seeds were germinated in 2019 in the same experimental environment with lab scale cws 46 similar and healthy growth seedlings were selected from the seedbed and transferred to lab scale cws 16 plants were planted in each cws one week before the experiment the constructed wetlands began to receive fresh water a week later heavy metal wastewater treatment experiments were conducted all cws had three replications 2 4 operation of cws the synthetic wastewater was conducted in the cws the 1500 l tank was used to store heavy metals contamination solution the heavy metal contamination solution was prepared every 5 days each water distribution period is the hydraulic retention time all cws were provided with water outlets at the bottom the outlets kept open cws adopted mode of continuous inflow the operation time of both the clean water and the synthetic wastewater in the cws was 5 days after 5 days the water will be discharged automatically from the outlet the design hydraulic load is 23 7 l h 1 the cws were conducted for six months starting from june 2019 through november 2019 2 5 chemical analysis for substrate sampling the cws were sacrificed for collecting substrate samples after the experiment was finished substrate of 20 cm of cws surface was collected and was used for ph value the ph value of substrate sampling was measured using a ph meter phs 25 inesa ltd shanghai china 2 6 chemical analysis for plants six month later the wetland plants in the cws were harvested for chemical analysis the surface attachment of the plant tissues were firstly soaked in 0 05 mol l 1 edta 2na solution to remove complexed cd ions on root surface and then rinsed with deionized water five times we divided the sample into two parts one part separated the root fresh leaf and withered leaf and each part was put into the oven at 105 c for 20 min and then dried at 60 c to a constant weight which were used for biomass and heavy metals determination fresh leaf was green and normally growing leaf withered leaf was yellow and dead leaf 46 for the other part we sampled root only some of the root was used for measurement of ip and heavy metals in ip which was extracted by the dithionite citrate bicarbonate dcb according to the method of taylor and crowder 1983 27 the roots were agitated in 45 ml of dcb solution and the dcb solution contained 0 27 mol l 1 sodium citrate na3c6h5o7 2h2o 0 11 mol l 1 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and 3 0 g of sodium dithionite na2s2o4 after 3 h the dcb extract solution was filtered into 100 ml volumetric flask and stabilized to 100 ml with deionized water the remained roots were rinsed with deionized water and then dried to determine the dry weight the extraction solution was analyzed for fe pb cd cu and zn concentrations using the atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas 6300 shimadzu and was converged to content in ip the concentration was expressed as the fe pb cd cu and zn content of the root root dry weight and some of the root was fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 0 1 mm of phosphate buffer ph 7 2 for surface morphology of ip by scanning electron microscopy sem servicebio inc and surface elemental analysis with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds servicebio inc under high concentration level of pb cd cu zn and basic elements and heavy metals in ip were presented in elemental maps the surface morphology and elemental analysis of vinasse were also made surface groups of vinasse were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis nicolet is50 the contents of fe pb cd cu and zn in root fresh leaf and withered leaf were detected using the atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas 32 the detection limits for fe pb cd cu and zn were 0 0001 mg l 0 00032 mg l 0 00001 mg l 0 000085 mg l and 0 00001 mg l respectively 2 7 statistical analysis the data was analyzed using dps v9 50 and the treatments were differentiated by two way anova and the tukey s test all data were subjected to homogeneity test before the turkey s multiple comparison the data presented are means and the standard deviation of three replicates rda redundancy analysis was executed between pb cd cu zn in ip substrate ph and a calamus root fresh leaf withered leaf heavy metal contents and dry weight of root and leaf by the vegan package in r version 3 3 2 3 results and discussion we used b0 b1 and b2 to represent the three treatments of vinasse at percent addition of 0 0 2 and 0 4 w w respectively and ck l and h to represent the treatments of heavy metals at concentration of zero low and high respectively in the following analysis 3 1 characteristics of vinasse used in cw vinasse showed an acidic ph with value of 3 52 structure of surface morphological and surface elemental analysis of vinasse was done by sem and eds the sem images showed an irregular and loose porous structure for vinasse moreover eds elemental analysis of vinasse expressed c o and k in highest amount with values of 47 24 45 61 and 3 46 respectively with lower contents of s p mg and cl fig 1 ftir characterization showed vinasse contained a large number of active functional groups fig 2 the broad and sharp peaks at 3275 cm 1 presents the oh functional groups the sharp peaks at 2929 cm 1 presents the asymmetric stretching vibration peak of c h while the peaks at 1033 cm 1 corresponds to skeleton vibration peak of saturated hexacycloalkane and c h plane bending vibration peak of benzene ring the broad peaks at 1746 cm 1 presents the abundance of carbonate group co it was reported that abundance of carbonate group co was strong correlated with heavy metals immobilization 46 these active functional groups may be contribution to the adsorption of metals on the surface of vinasse which led to the change of substrate ph 47 and the oh functional groups existed in ip must form a competitive relationship with oh functional groups in vinasse biomass materials can make plants grow well by reducing the toxicity of heavy metals thus increase the biomass 48 49 the biomass materials also contain the elements 50 needed for plant growth and the functional groups 51 which promote plant growth our results indicated vinasse contained elements c o mg p k that plants need to grow which was in agreement with them 3 2 dry matter weight of plant tissues fig 3 compares the roots of a calamus from all treatments it shows that increasing percent addition of vinasse from zero to 0 4 has led to a significant change in root biomass the biomass of root and leaf are shown in fig 3 as presented the impact of vinasse on plant growth appeared to be interacted with concentration of pb cd cu and zn increasing vinasse application promoted root growth moreover under the high concentration of heavy metals the root morphology has changed obviously fig 3 addition of vinasse by 0 4 under high stress of pb cd cu zn signifies a maximum increase in root growth by 389 40 however the impact of pb cd cu zn on root growth was complicated increasing pb cd cu zn stress appeared to have enhanced root growth while when the stress to a certain extent an increase in pb cd cu and zn stress appeared to have inhibited plant growth as compared to zero vinasse addition root growth was significantly increased with vinasse application for leaf growth when the concentration of pb cd cu zn was zero or high increasing vinasse application promoted leaf growth significantly while when the concentration was low vinasse application inhibited leaf growth values peaked for leaf growth was observed in ckb1 followed by hb2 302 25 and 151 86 respectively the impact of pb cd cu zn on leaf growth was the same as the root growth increasing pb cd cu zn stress appeared to have enhanced leaf growth while when the stress to a certain extent an increase in pb cd cu zn stress appeared to have inhibited leaf growth it was found that cd pollution can prevent the growth of root hair and inhibit root growth while roots curled when exposed to cu toxicity 52 pb stress can inhibit root elongation of plants 53 it was found that organic source can change cation exchange capacity and ph of environment that it exists which change the heavy metals and nutrients availability 54 increasing of heavy metals concentrations enhanced root oxidation activities fig 4 c 0 2 vinasse addition reduced the root oxidation activities while 0 4 vinasse addition increased the root oxidation activities it indicated that the effect of different amount of vinasse on ph of substrate directly affected the change of root oxidation activities and then affected the formation of ip in this study it showed that vinasse could provide high quality carbohydrate components that promoted root growth and improved root oxidation activities it may be the reason a calamus still survive under high stress of heavy matals except for the root deformation 3 3 ip formation and the content of ip ip content under different pb cd cu zn concentration and vinasse addition are shown in fig 5 a we analysed the relationship between root oxidation activities and ip content under different pb cd cu zn concentration and vinasse addition in fig 5b the impact of vinasse on ip appears to be complicated with pb cd cu and zn because an increase in pb cd cu zn concentration always led to ip content remain almost the same except for the treatment of 0 4 vinasse addition under high pb cd cu zn stress when the vinasse addition was zero and 0 2 the ip mass remained almost unchanged however when the pb cd cu zn concentration was increased to high with 0 4 vinasse percent addition the ip mass was about six times compared with other treatments under the zero and low concentration of pb cd cu zn vinasse inhibited ip formation and an increase in vinasse always led to a decrease in ip content however when pb cd cu zn concentration was high 0 4 vinasse addition seems to be optimal vinasse addition at which ip peaked it was known that formation of ip has closely positive correlation with radial oxygen loss 73 and root oxidation activities could represent radial oxygen loss from the control group without heavy metals it could be seen that the addition of vinasse did promote the root oxidation activities fig 4c moreover the increase of heavy metals concentrations also promoted the root oxidation activities but in zero and low concentration of heavy metals treatments vinasse did not promote the formation of ip under high concentration of heavy metals treatment vinasse significantly contributed to the formation of ip especially after adding 0 4 vinasse the ip content was six times more than other treatments in this case the vinasse like promoter of ip formation very beneficial to ip formation the results indicated that under the stress of heavy metals the increase of root oxidation activities was not necessarily conducive to the formation of ip and only when the root oxidation activities reached a certain value could it oxidize with fe ⅱ to form ip under high pb cd cu and zn stress 0 4 vinasse addition promoted ip formation may be related with root oxygen secretion accompanied with plant growth promoted by vinasse fig 6 shows the sem edx characterization of root of a calamus at the end of experiment for high pb cd cu zn concentration under b0 vinasse 0 b1 vinasse 0 2 b2 vinasse 0 4 which indicate the surface structural and elemental difference of roots after vinasse addition in cws fig 6 shows the ip formed and precipitated on the root surface of a calamus different colored dots in elemental map shows the exist of basic elements e g c o ca and heavy metals on the root surface of a calamus some heavy metals are not detected because their content is below the detection limit of the instrument 5 fig 6 shows there contains a large amount of c and o elements in root of a calamus which maybe indicate massive carbonate precipitation used to immobilize pb cd cu and zn in ip fig 1 shows vinasse contains a large amount of c and o elements which are the main sources of carbonate in ip it was found that microorganisms were found in the ip of root surface moreover the eosinophilic iron oxidizing bacteria and thiobacillus ferrooxidans could improve the oxidation capacity of fe thus promoting the formation of ip 55 in our experiments it maybe that vinasse facilitated the production of eosinophilic iron oxidizing bacteria and thiobacillus ferrooxidans in ip which promoted root oxidation activities not only microorganisms played a important role in the formation of ip on the root surface but also gene expression associated with fe absorption and transport also influenced ip formation it was found heavy metals and fe had the same transporters 56 they could be taken into plant by the same transporter zip and hma4 overexpression of heavy metal transport genes caused by high concentration of heavy metals concentration promoted transport and absorption of fe 57 thus promoting the formation of ip this is the reason why the iron film content increases under the stress of high concentration of heavy metals in our experiment 3 4 changes in constructed wetland substrate ph constructed wetland substrate ph was observed at the end of experiment fig 7 a and the relationship between root oxidation activities and ph were shown in fig 7b the impact of vinasse addition on constructed wetland substrate ph is intriguing 0 2 vinasse addition treatment showed a declined constructed wetland substrate ph as compared to that zero vinasse addition treatment while 0 4 vinasse addition treatment increased ph lb1 ph 7 16 treatment showed maximum reduction in substrate ph compared with the respective control lb0 ph 7 58 highest increase in constructed wetland substrate ph was observed in hb2 with an elevation of 4 65 compared with hb0 in the same vinasse percent addition on average increasing pb cd cu zn concentration from zero to high the constructed wetland substrate ph remained almost unchanged shaha et al 58 found that precipitation of metals and ion exchange and adsorption contribute to the increase of ph with acidic material the ph of vinasse is 3 52 which indicates vinasse is acidic material however vinasse improved the substrate ph because of c o are the main elements of vinasse which leads to the precipitation of metals 59 the root oxidation activities increased with the increasing of heavy metals concentrations under the treatment of the same concentration of heavy metals the change of root oxidation activities was consistent with the change of substrate ph fig 7b the addition of 0 2 vinasse reduced the root oxidation activities while the addition of 0 4 vinasse increased the root oxidation activities it indicated that the effect of different amount of vinasse on ph of substrate directly affected the change of root oxidation activities and then affected the formation of ip 3 5 concentration of pb cd cu and zn in ip fig 8 shows the concentration of pb cd cu and zn in ip under different pb cd cu zn concentrations and vinasse addition in zero vinasse addition treatment increasing pb cd cu zn concentration from zero to high decreased pb in ip while in 0 2 and 0 4 vinasse addition treatment on average increasing pb cd cu zn concentration from zero to high the pb content in ip remained almost unchanged however the addition of vinasse reduced the immobilization of pb in ip under the same pb cd cu zn concentration under the zero and low pb cd cu zn concentration the impact of vinasse addition on cd cu zn content is consistent with pb content in ip that is to say the addition of vinasse reduced pb cd cu zn content to be immobilized in ip and the pb cd cu zn content was not affected by the addition of vinasse however under high concentration of pb cd cu and zn the impact of vinasse addition on pb cd cu zn content in ip is intriguing when pb cd cu and zn concentration was high cd cu zn content in ip increased with vinasse addition first and then declined when vinasse addition exceeded 0 2 under high concentration pollution the addition of vinasse promoted the immobilization of cd cu and zn by ip and the content of cd cu and zn in ip had a certain correlation with ip content it was found that ip can immobilize heavy metals like a barrier inhibit their uptake and transport within the plants 60 in this study higher ip formation was accompanied by higher contents of cd cu and zn in ip however pb content in ip does not conform to this phenomenon hansel et al 61 found high specific surface area and oh functional groups facilitate to immobilize heavy metals by ip in this study compared with cd cu and zn pb may have lower competitiveness for oh functional groups the functional groups of ip on root surface in the presence of vinasse need to be further studied 3 6 content of pb cd cu and zn in a calamus fig 9 shows the pb cd cu and zn concentrations in root fresh leaf and withered leaf of a calamus under low and high concentration of pb cd cu zn with 0 0 2 0 4 vinasse addition under high concentration of pb cd cu zn 0 2 vinasse addition make the root pb peak regardless of vinasse addition under different concentration of pb cd cu zn majority pb was allocated in withered leaves regardless of vinasse addition cd cu zn in three parts of a calamus increased sharply with the increasing pb cd cu zn concentration in waste water and the cd and zn content in withered leaves were much higher than those in roots and fresh leaves while cu content in root was higher than that in fresh leaf and withered leaf majority of cd and zn was allocated in withered leaves and only a small fraction of cd and zn was in fresh leaf similar with cd and zn there is also a little fraction of cu existed in fresh leaf the present study shows a synergistic effect between cd and zn which is consist with nan et al 62 while someone think cd and zn act antagonism 63 therefore the interaction between zn and cd is not well established it indicated that a calamus can transfer cd and zn to the withered leaves by shedding the withered leaves to remove the heavy metals cd and zn which is a mechanism of detoxification in plants the results were consistent with zhang et al 64 however cu is different with cd and zn the present study showed that most of the cu was mainly stored in the root and was transferred to ground part to a certain extent under high concentration of pb cd cu zn 0 4 vinasse addition was more conducive to the removal of cd and cu from the withered leaves under low concentration of pb cd cu zn the effect of removing heavy metals from withered leaves was not obvious the enrichment ability of a calamus to different heavy metals is different which is the same with the results of tanaka et al 65 absorption and immobilization of heavy metals in a calamus follows the order of zn cu cd pb 3 7 pb cd cu zn fractions in ip root fresh leaf and withered leaf fig 10 assessed the pb cd cu zn fractions in ip root fresh leaf and withered leaf under different pb cd cu zn concentrations and vinasse addition a large proportion of pb was immobilized in ip it showed that maximum pb in ip was in lb1 and hb2 treatments with 86 02 and 90 57 proportion respectively at low concentrations of pb cd cu zn pb content in ip peaked under the vinasse 0 2 addition moreover pb content in old leaves peaked under the low concentration of pb cd cu zn pb pb content in ip peaked with the vinasse 0 2 addition under high concentration of pb cd cu zn vinasse combined with pb cd cu zn significantly changed the distribution of pb in a calamus the impact of vinasse on cd in a calamus is influenced by pb cd cu zn concentrations increasing the addition of vinasse reduced the content of cd in ip and root and increased the content of cd in fresh leaf and withered leaf which indicated cd in root and ip was transferred to leaf when the concentrations of pb cd cu and zn was low majority cd was allocated in the old leaf increasing the addition of vinasse from 0 2 to 0 4 the content of cd in ip becomes less and less which almost approached to zero cd in ip transferred to old leaf and root when the addition of vinasse was 0 2 and 0 4 respectively when the concentration of pb cd cu and zn was high cd accounted for a large proportion in the old leaf followed by root fresh leaf and withered leaf under low and high concentrations of pb cd cu zn on average cu accumulated mainly in root the content of cu in a calamus followed the order of root ip withered leaf fresh leaf under low and high concentrations of pb cd cu zn the content of cu in ip peaked when the vinasse addition was 0 2 different with pb cd cu majority zn was allocated in withered leaf when the concentration of pb cd cu zn was low and high with the increasing of percent addition of vinasse it resulted in the increased zn content in root and fresh leaf and reduced zn content in withered leaf it indicated that vinasse promoted the transfer of zn from ip to plant vinasse addition lead to precipitation complexation adsorption and dissolution et al which contributed to different distribution of pb cd cu zn in ip and plant tissues 47 66 it was reported that the electronegativity of vinasse became stronger with the increase of ph value of the solution and the electronegativity of vinasse became weaker after the adsorption of positively charged pb2 and zn2 our results are also in agreement with dong et al 67 who reported that the electronegativity of vinasse became stronger with the increase of ph value of the solution and the electronegativity of vinasse became weaker after the adsorption of positively charged pb2 and zn2 padmavathiamma and li 68 found cation exchange capacity and high surface area provides convenient conditions for chelation mechanism 68 therefore the chelation mechanism of vinasse in constructed wetlands is very important which affects each other with the chelation mechanism of root surface these two factors affect the distribution of heavy metals on the root surface and in the plant tissues redundancy analysis rda between pb cd cu zn in ip substrate ph and heavy metal contents in a calamus root fresh leaf withered leaf and dry weight of root and leaf showed ip content and pb cd cu zn contents in ip played a decisive role in the metal uptake and accumulation in plant tissues fig 11 the results showed the 82 2 variability in heavy metals concentration in plant tissues with effect of ip content and pb cd cu zn contents in ip cu and zn content in ip showed a strong correlation with ip content as they are in same group however pb and cd content in ip clustered in the opposite side with ip content which showed opposite behavior applied vinasse changed the behavior of substrate by changing the substrate ph thus increasing the heavy metals availability in ip recent studies have indicated that ip is closely related to uptake and transfer of heavy metals by the plants 69 wang et al 4 found that ip could decrease the accumulation of heavy metals in plant moreover recent studies have indicated that ros mediated redox signaling also resulted in reduced metals accumulation in plant tissues under alkaline condition 70 in this study the redox activity of a calamus root maybe influenced by vinasse and heavy metals otte et al 71 concluded that the ip could both enhanced and reduced zn uptake depending on the zn concentration in the environment and the amount of ip content on the root surface sr cvr and crowder 72 found ip could not inhibit uptake of cu in this study ip did not inhibit cd zn transferred to the aboveground part while cu mainly existed in the root and rarely transferred to the aboveground part under low concentration of heavy metal the content of cd and zn in ip decreased after adding vinasse and the aboveground part increased indicating that vinasse promoted the transfer of cd and zn to the aboveground part 4 conclusion this study based on lab scale cws experiments proved vinasse at right percent addition could promote ip formation under the high concentration of heavy metal pollution and pb cd cu zn removal by a calamus results indicated vinasse contained elements c o mg p k that plants need to grow and carbonate group co which is associated with the sorption of heavy metals which is the reason of the increase of root biomass under high concentration of pb cd cu zn pollution 0 4 of vinasse can effectively promote the formation of ip at the same time ip adsorption of cd cu zn reached the peak when the addition of vinasse was 0 2 a calamus can remove pb cd cu zn mainly by shedding the withered leaves vinasse promoted the transfer of cd and zn to the aboveground part cu was mainly immobilized in the root and pb was mainly in ip furthermore the addition of 0 2 vinasse reduced the ph of the substrate while the addition of 0 4 vinasse increased vinasse application changed substrate ph thus increasing the heavy metals availability in ip especially for pb therefore vinasse has potential to be used in cws to assist wetland plants in removing pb cd cu zn co contaminated wastewater but profound tests are needed to assess the long term effects of vinasse declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key research and development

13780,iron plaque ip on root surface has a significant effect on uptake and accumulation of heavy metals by wetland plants however the role of vinasse in modulating the relevant process still remains unclear present study hypothesizes vinasse at appropriate addition could promote ip formation and lead pb cadmium cd copper cu and zinc zn removal by acorus calamus in constructed wetlands cws for that purpose 0 0 2 and 0 4 addition of vinasse was applied in lab scale cws planted with a calamus which were conducted with low and high concentration of pb cd cu and zn wastewater respectively results indicated that increase of heavy metals concentration promoted root oxidation activity and the expression of heavy metal transport genes were increased which was the reason that vinasse promoted the formation of ip under high concentration of pb cd cu and zn while inhibited under low concentration of pb cd cu and zn the change of ip affected by vinasse had a strong effect for uptake and accumulation of pb cd cu and zn by a calamus ip facilitated the transfer of cd and zn to the aboveground part pb was mainly stored in ip while cu was mainly stored in the root redundancy analysis rda showed ip content and pb cd cu zn contents in ip played a decisive role in the heavy metal uptake and accumulation in a calamus therefore vinasse has potential to be used in cws to assist wetland plants in removing pb cd cu zn co contaminated wastewater keywords vinasse heavy metals constructed wetlands immobilization iron plaque 1 introduction industrial activities agrochemicals phosphatic fertilizers pesticides which contains heavy metals applications and exploitation of mineral resources have led to increase degradation of aquatic environment 1 previous studies had showed that there are lots of heavy metals in landfill leachate such as cadmium cd chromium cr iron fe lead pb zinc zn 2 and the metal concentrations in young and old leachate are usually different 3 mining effluent also contains a large amount of heavy metals such as pb cd copper cu zn and cr 4 moreover acid mine drainage is a major source of cu manganese mn fe and zn metal contamination in many regions of the world 5 heavy metals pb 6 cd 7 cu and zn 4 are persistent pollutant which are not easy to degrade and they have potential risks to most plants through uptake of root 8 which is the main reason harming human health and the ecological environment 9 as a kind of environmentally friendly low energy input and simple operation of wastewater treatment system 10 constructed wetlands cws have been widely used for processing various types of wastewater including removal of heavy metals from wastewater 11 12 the key of processing is to find a suitable and efficient plant for absorption of heavy metals and choose an appropriate substrate material which has better purification effect for wetland combination 13 cws can effectively remove heavy metals from waste water and has received widespread attention all over the world 14 as a kind of perennial aquatic macrophytes a calamus is widely used in cws previous studies showed that a calamus can absorb a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in water 15 and can accumulate a large amount of pb 16 cd and cu 17 in plant tissues and it can live with high concentration of cd stress 18 under the condition of cu zn pb cd pollution the content of heavy metals in a calamus follows cu zn pb cd and a calamus has higher enrichment coefficient for cd but less for pb 19 radial oxygen loss has an important effect on the uptake of heavy metals by wetland plants wetland plants can deliver oxygen to their roots through photosynthesis some for their own root respiration and the other part is released into the rhizosphere environment 20 radial oxygen loss of plant 20 and biological oxidation of microorganisms 21 oxidize fe ii to f iii which attached on root surface and substrate surface 29 it is called iron plaque ip and mainly consists of fe iii oxo hydroxides 22 since root surface is where the nutrients and contaminants enter into the plant a large amount of cations were adsorbed in the ip which led to a significant effect on uptake of both nutrients and heavy metals to plant 23 moreover the associated physical and biochemical processes in root surface is also profound influenced 6 ip has high surface areas 24 and a porous mineral structure which could absorb and immobilize a significant amount of heavy metals 25 on the other hand ip on roots may play a barrier to uptake of cationic nutrients 26 and heavy metals 27 fu et al 7 also proved that ip inhibits adsorption of other cations including heavy metals because of positive characteristics of ip which could neutralizes some negative charge it was also found that ip exists active oh functional groups which is the reason of reacting with heavy metals and other nutrient ions 24 therefore the impact of ip on plant immobilization of heavy metals has two aspects and it can inhibit or enhance uptake of heavy metals by plant 28 it is not conclusive how ip regulate the immobilization of pb cd cu and zn some previous studies indicated that ip inhibits cd transferring from underground to ground part 29 while others insisted that ip has a synergistic effect for wetland plants uptaking heavy metals 30 it was found that rice shoot cd mn and zn concentrations were strongly positively correlated with cd r2 0 98 mn r 2 0 97 and zn r 2 0 76 in ip 31 it was also found that the bioavailability of heavy metals varied with ip content 31 moreover there is a certain correlation between ip content and heavy metal concentration it was found that when the concentration of cd is 0 5 mg l 1 more iron film is formed to absorb more cd 32 pb cd are not plant nutrient cu zn is an essential element in plant but in large quantities can be toxic to plants and they enter into the plant by the same transporters of other elements including fe 33 and ca and mg 34 plant uptake of pb cd cu zn is affected by characteristic of ip and competitive adsorption of nutrients and heavy metals 33 the plant itself plays a decisive role in the absorption of heavy metals and the substrate environment in which the plant grows also affects the formation of ip and the absorption of heavy metals 35 previous study showed that biochar enhances plant growth and nutrient removal in horizontal subsurface flow cws 23 biomass materials have a natural affinity for heavy metals can be used widely to purify a wide range of wastewater containing heavy metals and mixed metal ion in recent years the adsorption of heavy metal ions in wastewater by rice husk 19 corn cob 36 sugarcane bagasse 37 grapefruit peel 30 peanut shell 38 and vinasse 39 have been studied vinasse is a kind of biomass materials and it is the main by product of alcohol and wine making industry which is rich in a large number of nutrients such as crude fiber fat amino acids lake starch minerals enzymes and a variety of microbiotin and it has the advantages of low cost and easy to obtain 40 at present the vast majority of enterprises or individuals have a relatively simple treatment method of vinasse which is basically a simple dry treatment and then sold directly as feed or fertilizer or even directly landfill 41 however the rich nutrients in vinasse are not utilized which not only causes serious waste of resources but also causes environmental pollution therefore it is urgent to turn this vinasse into a beneficial product and minimize its adverse impacts to environmental however there are few studies on the use of vinasse in cws to remove heavy metals from wastewater studies have shown that high concentrations of heavy metals can inhibit the root activity of plants 42 damage the chloroplasts of plants leading to a decrease in the intensity of photosynthesis 43 and damage the cell membrane of plants leading to an increase in membrane permeability 44 however peng et al 2016 have found that vinasse can improve the ecological environment of the substrate and promote the growth of plants 45 this is beneficial to increase plant photosynthesis and respiration which facilitates ip formation previous studies mostly focused on the effects of pb cd cu zn on plant growth adsorption of heavy metals by vinasse and its effects on plant growth but the role of vinasse in regulating ip formation and its effect for pb cd cu zn immobilization by wetland plants are poorly understood considering the multitude factors of affecting ip discussed above we hypothesized that vinasse at appropriate addition could promote formation of ip and increase pb cd cu zn immobilization by a calamus this paper is to verify the hypothesis elucidating how pb cd cu zn and vinasse couple to impact ip formation and pb cd cu zn adsorption and to determine the sorption ability of ip through scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds microscopy and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy to simulate the environment in which plant grows we used a calamus as model plant and grew it in constructed wetland pilot model filled with sand and different vinasse percent addition conducted with different concentration of pb cd cu zn wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic wastewater the composition of synthetic wastewater is presented in table 1 it contained nitrogen phosphorus and heavy metals fe pb cd cu and zn we set up three pb cd cu zn concentrations control group ck low concentration l and high concentration h

institute at xinxiang henan province of china 35 19 n 113 53 e altitude 73 2 m each cws consisted of a polyethylene container 65 cm length 65 cm width 100 cm height with a metering pump the cws were filled from bottom to top with gravel 20 30 mm 10 cm depth youli building materials co ltd xinxiang china sand mixture 0 25 0 35 mm 60 cm depth youli building materials co ltd xinxiang china and the gravel and sand layers were separated by a 200 mesh nylon xianglu building materials co ltd hunan china the sand was rinsed 3 times with deionized water and air dried naturally before filling it into cws then the vinasse xianfeng pharmaceutical co ltd henan china was mixed with sand at a ratio of 0 2 or 0 4 w w and then the mixture were added into the cws for experiment the sand without vinasse was treated as control the cws were planted with a calamus 30 cm height 1 50 g fresh weight throughout the growth period the air temperature in the greenhouse varied from 15 c to 40 c to simulate the actual condition for aquatic plants growth in cws 2 3 plant preparation these emergent plant seeds were purchased from lishi flowers co ltd jiangsu china the seeds were germinated in 2019 in the same experimental environment with lab scale cws 46 similar and healthy growth seedlings were selected from the seedbed and transferred to lab scale cws 16 plants were planted in each cws one week before the experiment the constructed wetlands began to receive fresh water a week later heavy metal wastewater treatment experiments were conducted all cws had three replications 2 4 operation of cws the synthetic wastewater was conducted in the cws the 1500 l tank was used to store heavy metals contamination solution the heavy metal contamination solution was prepared every 5 days each water distribution period is the hydraulic retention time all cws were provided with water outlets at the bottom the outlets kept open cws adopted mode of continuous inflow the operation time of both the clean water and the synthetic wastewater in the cws was 5 days after 5 days the water will be discharged automatically from the outlet the design hydraulic load is 23 7 l h 1 the cws were conducted for six months starting from june 2019 through november 2019 2 5 chemical analysis for substrate sampling the cws were sacrificed for collecting substrate samples after the experiment was finished substrate of 20 cm of cws surface was collected and was used for ph value the ph value of substrate sampling was measured using a ph meter phs 25 inesa ltd shanghai china 2 6 chemical analysis for plants six month later the wetland plants in the cws were harvested for chemical analysis the surface attachment of the plant tissues were firstly soaked in 0 05 mol l 1 edta 2na solution to remove complexed cd ions on root surface and then rinsed with deionized water five times we divided the sample into two parts one part separated the root fresh leaf and withered leaf and each part was put into the oven at 105 c for 20 min and then dried at 60 c to a constant weight which were used for biomass and heavy metals determination fresh leaf was green and normally growing leaf withered leaf was yellow and dead leaf 46 for the other part we sampled root only some of the root was used for measurement of ip and heavy metals in ip which was extracted by the dithionite citrate bicarbonate dcb according to the method of taylor and crowder 1983 27 the roots were agitated in 45 ml of dcb solution and the dcb solution contained 0 27 mol l 1 sodium citrate na3c6h5o7 2h2o 0 11 mol l 1 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and 3 0 g of sodium dithionite na2s2o4 after 3 h the dcb extract solution was filtered into 100 ml volumetric flask and stabilized to 100 ml with deionized water the remained roots were rinsed with deionized water and then dried to determine the dry weight the extraction solution was analyzed for fe pb cd cu and zn concentrations using the atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas 6300 shimadzu and was converged to content in ip the concentration was expressed as the fe pb cd cu and zn content of the root root dry weight and some of the root was fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 0 1 mm of phosphate buffer ph 7 2 for surface morphology of ip by scanning electron microscopy sem servicebio inc and surface elemental analysis with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds servicebio inc under high concentration level of pb cd cu zn and basic elements and heavy metals in ip were presented in elemental maps the surface morphology and elemental analysis of vinasse were also made surface groups of vinasse were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis nicolet is50 the contents of fe pb cd cu and zn in root fresh leaf and withered leaf were detected using the atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas 32 the detection limits for fe pb cd cu and zn were 0 0001 mg l 0 00032 mg l 0 00001 mg l 0 000085 mg l and 0 00001 mg l respectively 2 7 statistical analysis the data was analyzed using dps v9 50 and the treatments were differentiated by two way anova and the tukey s test all data were subjected to homogeneity test before the turkey s multiple comparison the data presented are means and the standard deviation of three replicates rda redundancy analysis was executed between pb cd cu zn in ip substrate ph and a calamus root fresh leaf withered leaf heavy metal contents and dry weight of root and leaf by the vegan package in r version 3 3 2 3 results and discussion we used b0 b1 and b2 to represent the three treatments of vinasse at percent addition of 0 0 2 and 0 4 w w respectively and ck l and h to represent the treatments of heavy metals at concentration of zero low and high respectively in the following analysis 3 1 characteristics of vinasse used in cw vinasse showed an acidic ph with value of 3 52 structure of surface morphological and surface elemental analysis of vinasse was done by sem and eds the sem images showed an irregular and loose porous structure for vinasse moreover eds elemental analysis of vinasse expressed c o and k in highest amount with values of 47 24 45 61 and 3 46 respectively with lower contents of s p mg and cl fig 1 ftir characterization showed vinasse contained a large number of active functional groups fig 2 the broad and sharp peaks at 3275 cm 1 presents the oh functional groups the sharp peaks at 2929 cm 1 presents the asymmetric stretching vibration peak of c h while the peaks at 1033 cm 1 corresponds to skeleton vibration peak of saturated hexacycloalkane and c h plane bending vibration peak of benzene ring the broad peaks at 1746 cm 1 presents the abundance of carbonate group co it was reported that abundance of carbonate group co was strong correlated with heavy metals immobilization 46 these active functional groups may be contribution to the adsorption of metals on the surface of vinasse which led to the change of substrate ph 47 and the oh functional groups existed in ip must form a competitive relationship with oh functional groups in vinasse biomass materials can make plants grow well by reducing the toxicity of heavy metals thus increase the biomass 48 49 the biomass materials also contain the elements 50 needed for plant growth and the functional groups 51 which promote plant growth our results indicated vinasse contained elements c o mg p k that plants need to grow which was in agreement with them 3 2 dry matter weight of plant tissues fig 3 compares the roots of a calamus from all treatments it shows that increasing percent addition of vinasse from zero to 0 4 has led to a significant change in root biomass the biomass of root and leaf are shown in fig 3 as presented the impact of vinasse on plant growth appeared to be interacted with concentration of pb cd cu and zn increasing vinasse application promoted root growth moreover under the high concentration of heavy metals the root morphology has changed obviously fig 3 addition of vinasse by 0 4 under high stress of pb cd cu zn signifies a maximum increase in root growth by 389 40 however the impact of pb cd cu zn on root growth was complicated increasing pb cd cu zn stress appeared to have enhanced root growth while when the stress to a certain extent an increase in pb cd cu and zn stress appeared to have inhibited plant growth as compared to zero vinasse addition root growth was significantly increased with vinasse application for leaf growth when the concentration of pb cd cu zn was zero or high increasing vinasse application promoted leaf growth significantly while when the concentration was low vinasse application inhibited leaf growth values peaked for leaf growth was observed in ckb1 followed by hb2 302 25 and 151 86 respectively the impact of pb cd cu zn on leaf growth was the same as the root growth increasing pb cd cu zn stress appeared to have enhanced leaf growth while when the stress to a certain extent an increase in pb cd cu zn stress appeared to have inhibited leaf growth it was found that cd pollution can prevent the growth of root hair and inhibit root growth while roots curled when exposed to cu toxicity 52 pb stress can inhibit root elongation of plants 53 it was found that organic source can change cation exchange capacity and ph of environment that it exists which change the heavy metals and nutrients availability 54 increasing of heavy metals concentrations enhanced root oxidation activities fig 4 c 0 2 vinasse addition reduced the root oxidation activities while 0 4 vinasse addition increased the root oxidation activities it indicated that the effect of different amount of vinasse on ph of substrate directly affected the change of root oxidation activities and then affected the formation of ip in this study it showed that vinasse could provide high quality carbohydrate components that promoted root growth and improved root oxidation activities it may be the reason a calamus still survive under high stress of heavy matals except for the root deformation 3 3 ip formation and the content of ip ip content under different pb cd cu zn concentration and vinasse addition are shown in fig 5 a we analysed the relationship between root oxidation activities and ip content under different pb cd cu zn concentration and vinasse addition in fig 5b the impact of vinasse on ip appears to be complicated with pb cd cu and zn because an increase in pb cd cu zn concentration always led to ip content remain almost the same except for the treatment of 0 4 vinasse addition under high pb cd cu zn stress when the vinasse addition was zero and 0 2 the ip mass remained almost unchanged however when the pb cd cu zn concentration was increased to high with 0 4 vinasse percent addition the ip mass was about six times compared with other treatments under the zero and low concentration of pb cd cu zn vinasse inhibited ip formation and an increase in vinasse always led to a decrease in ip content however when pb cd cu zn concentration was high 0 4 vinasse addition seems to be optimal vinasse addition at which ip peaked it was known that formation of ip has closely positive correlation with radial oxygen loss 73 and root oxidation activities could represent radial oxygen loss from the control group without heavy metals it could be seen that the addition of vinasse did promote the root oxidation activities fig 4c moreover the increase of heavy metals concentrations also promoted the root oxidation activities but in zero and low concentration of heavy metals treatments vinasse did not promote the formation of ip under high concentration of heavy metals treatment vinasse significantly contributed to the formation of ip especially after adding 0 4 vinasse the ip content was six times more than other treatments in this case the vinasse like promoter of ip formation very beneficial to ip formation the results indicated that under the stress of heavy metals the increase of root oxidation activities was not necessarily conducive to the formation of ip and only when the root oxidation activities reached a certain value could it oxidize with fe ⅱ to form ip under high pb cd cu and zn stress 0 4 vinasse addition promoted ip formation may be related with root oxygen secretion accompanied with plant growth promoted by vinasse fig 6 shows the sem edx characterization of root of a calamus at the end of experiment for high pb cd cu zn concentration under b0 vinasse 0 b1 vinasse 0 2 b2 vinasse 0 4 which indicate the surface structural and elemental difference of roots after vinasse addition in cws fig 6 shows the ip formed and precipitated on the root surface of a calamus different colored dots in elemental map shows the exist of basic elements e g c o ca and heavy metals on the root surface of a calamus some heavy metals are not detected because their content is below the detection limit of the instrument 5 fig 6 shows there contains a large amount of c and o elements in root of a calamus which maybe indicate massive carbonate precipitation used to immobilize pb cd cu and zn in ip fig 1 shows vinasse contains a large amount of c and o elements which are the main sources of carbonate in ip it was found that microorganisms were found in the ip of root surface moreover the eosinophilic iron oxidizing bacteria and thiobacillus ferrooxidans could improve the oxidation capacity of fe thus promoting the formation of ip 55 in our experiments it maybe that vinasse facilitated the production of eosinophilic iron oxidizing bacteria and thiobacillus ferrooxidans in ip which promoted root oxidation activities not only microorganisms played a important role in the formation of ip on the root surface but also gene expression associated with fe absorption and transport also influenced ip formation it was found heavy metals and fe had the same transporters 56 they could be taken into plant by the same transporter zip and hma4 overexpression of heavy metal transport genes caused by high concentration of heavy metals concentration promoted transport and absorption of fe 57 thus promoting the formation of ip this is the reason why the iron film content increases under the stress of high concentration of heavy metals in our experiment 3 4 changes in constructed wetland substrate ph constructed wetland substrate ph was observed at the end of experiment fig 7 a and the relationship between root oxidation activities and ph were shown in fig 7b the impact of vinasse addition on constructed wetland substrate ph is intriguing 0 2 vinasse addition treatment showed a declined constructed wetland substrate ph as compared to that zero vinasse addition treatment while 0 4 vinasse addition treatment increased ph lb1 ph 7 16 treatment showed maximum reduction in substrate ph compared with the respective control lb0 ph 7 58 highest increase in constructed wetland substrate ph was observed in hb2 with an elevation of 4 65 compared with hb0 in the same vinasse percent addition on average increasing pb cd cu zn concentration from zero to high the constructed wetland substrate ph remained almost unchanged shaha et al 58 found that precipitation of metals and ion exchange and adsorption contribute to the increase of ph with acidic material the ph of vinasse is 3 52 which indicates vinasse is acidic material however vinasse improved the substrate ph because of c o are the main elements of vinasse which leads to the precipitation of metals 59 the root oxidation activities increased with the increasing of heavy metals concentrations under the treatment of the same concentration of heavy metals the change of root oxidation activities was consistent with the change of substrate ph fig 7b the addition of 0 2 vinasse reduced the root oxidation activities while the addition of 0 4 vinasse increased the root oxidation activities it indicated that the effect of different amount of vinasse on ph of substrate directly affected the change of root oxidation activities and then affected the formation of ip 3 5 concentration of pb cd cu and zn in ip fig 8 shows the concentration of pb cd cu and zn in ip under different pb cd cu zn concentrations and vinasse addition in zero vinasse addition treatment increasing pb cd cu zn concentration from zero to high decreased pb in ip while in 0 2 and 0 4 vinasse addition treatment on average increasing pb cd cu zn concentration from zero to high the pb content in ip remained almost unchanged however the addition of vinasse reduced the immobilization of pb in ip under the same pb cd cu zn concentration under the zero and low pb cd cu zn concentration the impact of vinasse addition on cd cu zn content is consistent with pb content in ip that is to say the addition of vinasse reduced pb cd cu zn content to be immobilized in ip and the pb cd cu zn content was not affected by the addition of vinasse however under high concentration of pb cd cu and zn the impact of vinasse addition on pb cd cu zn content in ip is intriguing when pb cd cu and zn concentration was high cd cu zn content in ip increased with vinasse addition first and then declined when vinasse addition exceeded 0 2 under high concentration pollution the addition of vinasse promoted the immobilization of cd cu and zn by ip and the content of cd cu and zn in ip had a certain correlation with ip content it was found that ip can immobilize heavy metals like a barrier inhibit their uptake and transport within the plants 60 in this study higher ip formation was accompanied by higher contents of cd cu and zn in ip however pb content in ip does not conform to this phenomenon hansel et al 61 found high specific surface area and oh functional groups facilitate to immobilize heavy metals by ip in this study compared with cd cu and zn pb may have lower competitiveness for oh functional groups the functional groups of ip on root surface in the presence of vinasse need to be further studied 3 6 content of pb cd cu and zn in a calamus fig 9 shows the pb cd cu and zn concentrations in root fresh leaf and withered leaf of a calamus under low and high concentration of pb cd cu zn with 0 0 2 0 4 vinasse addition under high concentration of pb cd cu zn 0 2 vinasse addition make the root pb peak regardless of vinasse addition under different concentration of pb cd cu zn majority pb was allocated in withered leaves regardless of vinasse addition cd cu zn in three parts of a calamus increased sharply with the increasing pb cd cu zn concentration in waste water and the cd and zn content in withered leaves were much higher than those in roots and fresh leaves while cu content in root was higher than that in fresh leaf and withered leaf majority of cd and zn was allocated in withered leaves and only a small fraction of cd and zn was in fresh leaf similar with cd and zn there is also a little fraction of cu existed in fresh leaf the present study shows a synergistic effect between cd and zn which is consist with nan et al 62 while someone think cd and zn act antagonism 63 therefore the interaction between zn and cd is not well established it indicated that a calamus can transfer cd and zn to the withered leaves by shedding the withered leaves to remove the heavy metals cd and zn which is a mechanism of detoxification in plants the results were consistent with zhang et al 64 however cu is different with cd and zn the present study showed that most of the cu was mainly stored in the root and was transferred to ground part to a certain extent under high concentration of pb cd cu zn 0 4 vinasse addition was more conducive to the removal of cd and cu from the withered leaves under low concentration of pb cd cu zn the effect of removing heavy metals from withered leaves was not obvious the enrichment ability of a calamus to different heavy metals is different which is the same with the results of tanaka et al 65 absorption and immobilization of heavy metals in a calamus follows the order of zn cu cd pb 3 7 pb cd cu zn fractions in ip root fresh leaf and withered leaf fig 10 assessed the pb cd cu zn fractions in ip root fresh leaf and withered leaf under different pb cd cu zn concentrations and vinasse addition a large proportion of pb was immobilized in ip it showed that maximum pb in ip was in lb1 and hb2 treatments with 86 02 and 90 57 proportion respectively at low concentrations of pb cd cu zn pb content in ip peaked under the vinasse 0 2 addition moreover pb content in old leaves peaked under the low concentration of pb cd cu zn pb pb content in ip peaked with the vinasse 0 2 addition under high concentration of pb cd cu zn vinasse combined with pb cd cu zn significantly changed the distribution of pb in a calamus the impact of vinasse on cd in a calamus is influenced by pb cd cu zn concentrations increasing the addition of vinasse reduced the content of cd in ip and root and increased the content of cd in fresh leaf and withered leaf which indicated cd in root and ip was transferred to leaf when the concentrations of pb cd cu and zn was low majority cd was allocated in the old leaf increasing the addition of vinasse from 0 2 to 0 4 the content of cd in ip becomes less and less which almost approached to zero cd in ip transferred to old leaf and root when the addition of vinasse was 0 2 and 0 4 respectively when the concentration of pb cd cu and zn was high cd accounted for a large proportion in the old leaf followed by root fresh leaf and withered leaf under low and high concentrations of pb cd cu zn on average cu accumulated mainly in root the content of cu in a calamus followed the order of root ip withered leaf fresh leaf under low and high concentrations of pb cd cu zn the content of cu in ip peaked when the vinasse addition was 0 2 different with pb cd cu majority zn was allocated in withered leaf when the concentration of pb cd cu zn was low and high with the increasing of percent addition of vinasse it resulted in the increased zn content in root and fresh leaf and reduced zn content in withered leaf it indicated that vinasse promoted the transfer of zn from ip to plant vinasse addition lead to precipitation complexation adsorption and dissolution et al which contributed to different distribution of pb cd cu zn in ip and plant tissues 47 66 it was reported that the electronegativity of vinasse became stronger with the increase of ph value of the solution and the electronegativity of vinasse became weaker after the adsorption of positively charged pb2 and zn2 our results are also in agreement with dong et al 67 who reported that the electronegativity of vinasse became stronger with the increase of ph value of the solution and the electronegativity of vinasse became weaker after the adsorption of positively charged pb2 and zn2 padmavathiamma and li 68 found cation exchange capacity and high surface area provides convenient conditions for chelation mechanism 68 therefore the chelation mechanism of vinasse in constructed wetlands is very important which affects each other with the chelation mechanism of root surface these two factors affect the distribution of heavy metals on the root surface and in the plant tissues redundancy analysis rda between pb cd cu zn in ip substrate ph and heavy metal contents in a calamus root fresh leaf withered leaf and dry weight of root and leaf showed ip content and pb cd cu zn contents in ip played a decisive role in the metal uptake and accumulation in plant tissues fig 11 the results showed the 82 2 variability in heavy metals concentration in plant tissues with effect of ip content and pb cd cu zn contents in ip cu and zn content in ip showed a strong correlation with ip content as they are in same group however pb and cd content in ip clustered in the opposite side with ip content which showed opposite behavior applied vinasse changed the behavior of substrate by changing the substrate ph thus increasing the heavy metals availability in ip recent studies have indicated that ip is closely related to uptake and transfer of heavy metals by the plants 69 wang et al 4 found that ip could decrease the accumulation of heavy metals in plant moreover recent studies have indicated that ros mediated redox signaling also resulted in reduced metals accumulation in plant tissues under alkaline condition 70 in this study the redox activity of a calamus root maybe influenced by vinasse and heavy metals otte et al 71 concluded that the ip could both enhanced and reduced zn uptake depending on the zn concentration in the environment and the amount of ip content on the root surface sr cvr and crowder 72 found ip could not inhibit uptake of cu in this study ip did not inhibit cd zn transferred to the aboveground part while cu mainly existed in the root and rarely transferred to the aboveground part under low concentration of heavy metal the content of cd and zn in ip decreased after adding vinasse and the aboveground part increased indicating that vinasse promoted the transfer of cd and zn to the aboveground part 4 conclusion this study based on lab scale cws experiments proved vinasse at right percent addition could promote ip formation under the high concentration of heavy metal pollution and pb cd cu zn removal by a calamus results indicated vinasse contained elements c o mg p k that plants need to grow and carbonate group co which is associated with the sorption of heavy metals which is the reason of the increase of root biomass under high concentration of pb cd cu zn pollution 0 4 of vinasse can effectively promote the formation of ip at the same time ip adsorption of cd cu zn reached the peak when the addition of vinasse was 0 2 a calamus can remove pb cd cu zn mainly by shedding the withered leaves vinasse promoted the transfer of cd and zn to the aboveground part cu was mainly immobilized in the root and pb was mainly in ip furthermore the addition of 0 2 vinasse reduced the ph of the substrate while the addition of 0 4 vinasse increased vinasse application changed substrate ph thus increasing the heavy metals availability in ip especially for pb therefore vinasse has potential to be used in cws to assist wetland plants in removing pb cd cu zn co contaminated wastewater but profound tests are needed to assess the long term effects of vinasse declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key research and development

13781,this work evaluates the catalytic capacity of a metallurgical copper slag cs for the removal of the pesticide thiabendazole tbz in real wastewater by the heterogeneous photo fenton process at circumneutral ph under natural solar irradiation nsi the material consists mainly of magnetite and fayalite the best experimental condition was 17 mg of cs cm2 settled at the bottom of the reactor and 0 44 mm h2o2 illuminated with solar radiation under this condition 80 tbz degradation 100 μg l initial spiked concentration was reached in real wwtp secondary effluent after 120 min with 50 of h2o2 consumption the cs h2o2 nsi system produced 2 fold more hydroxyl radicals ho with respect to the cs h2o2 the cs nsi system did not produce ho radicals probably due to the fast electron hole combination reported for one of the iron oxides present in cs even though it showed a bandgap value of 2 42 ev which indicates that the material can absorb solar irradiation thus tbz was oxidized mainly through the heterogeneous photo fenton like reaction with similar degradation efficiencies after five utilization cycles this study demonstrates that cs is a chemically stable and efficient fenton type catalyst for microcontaminant degradation in wastewater keywords iron oxides thiabendazole fungicide secondary effluent wastewater 1 introduction fenton s reaction is one of the most extensively studied advanced oxidation processes aops for the degradation of organic compounds in water due to its efficiency and the general availability of the reagents involved the reaction is characterised by the creation of hydroxyl radicals ho due to hydrogen peroxide decomposition by fe ions under acidic conditions iron is soluble at ph 2 8 but it will precipitate if the ph is increased resulting in the loss of the catalyst 1 to avoid this problem catalysts have been developed which consist of iron oxides supported on mesoporous materials activated carbon 2 tio2 3 zeolites 4 clays 5 and resins 6 these materials are categorised as heterogeneous fenton like catalysts and they reduce the need for low ph and the loss of the catalyst through sludge formation the synthesis of these compounds requires long reaction times and may produce undesired residues which increases the operation costs of the heterogeneous fenton like process an interesting alternative for the application of conventional heterogeneous fenton like catalysts is the use of industrial solid residues rich in fe based minerals these wastes are produced in large volumes e g in the form of metallurgical slag produced from copper extraction previous data found in bibliography show that worldwide production of copper slag cs is approximately 68 mt 7 the main chemical elements of cs are fe si al and ca with lesser quantities of mg cu ni as and pb as well as other metals and metalloids which depend on the specific metallurgical process used the type of furnace and ore composition depending on the specific composition of the slag cs may be classified as a hazardous waste 8 nonetheless several long term studies on the toxicity and leaching under ambient conditions produced in different copper smelting plants indicate that no significant leaching of potential toxic metals is observed and that cs does not present an environmental hazard 9 10 problems associated with landfill disposal of these wastes have induced the development of alternative usages of cs such as its use in cement aggregates for mortars and concretes 11 12 for primary metal recovery 13 14 and for heterogeneous fenton like processes 15 19 the use of cs in heterogeneous photo fenton like process using solar light has not been reported to date furthermore no reports are available on its use in the degradation of recalcitrant organic microcontaminants in wastewater such as is the case of thiabendazole tbz this fungicide used in fruit and vegetable conservation 20 has been classified as a potential carcinogen 21 the aim of this research was to analyse the catalytic capacity of a copper slag cs for removing trace levels of tbz mainly by the heterogeneous solar photo fenton like process at circumneutral ph in three aqueous matrices distilled water synthetic effluent and real urban wastewater treatment plant wwtp secondary effluent the latter obtained from the municipal wwtp el bobar located in almería spain this capacity was correlated to the physicochemical properties of the slag 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterisation of the slag slag was obtained from a copper smelter located in northern mexico after crushing the cs was ball milled and sieved the 400 mesh size 37 μm fraction was used in the tests the morphology and composition of the particles was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem with a philips xl20 sem equipped with and oxford 7593 solid state edx detector optical microscopy was performed on thin slices 300 μm of cs using a zeiss axioimager pol microscope x ray diffraction xrd was performed on an empyrean diffractometer with focused cu kα radiation and a ni filter in a 2θ interval from 4 to 70 in steps of 0 003 at 40 sec per step x ray fluorescence xrf was performed on a siemens srs3000 using the ezscan software for semi quantitative chemical analysis the band gap of 40 mg of cs was determined by means of uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using an agilent cary 5000 uv vis spectrophotometer with wavelengths in the range of 200 to 800 nm using a sample holder of 10 mm width the band gap was determined by means of the tauc curve 22 textural characteristics of cs were determined by the adsorption desorption of n2 gas in a bel sorp mini ii apparatus belsorp inc japan using the bet brunauer emmet teller isotherm methodology 23 2 2 water sources three types of matrices were selected to perform the tbz degradation tests firstly a tbz solution was prepared with distilled water dw the second one corresponding to a synthetic secondary urban effluent se 24 contained 20 mg l of dissolved organic carbon doc and was prepared by adding 7 mg l nacl 60 mg l caso4 2h2o 60 mg l mgso4 4 mg l kcl 4 mg l cacl2 h2o 6 mg l of urea all products from sigma aldrich 32 mg l of peptone biolife and 22 mg l of commercial meat extract the third one was a real urban wwtp secondary effluent re collected from the municipal wwtp named el bobar almería southeast of spain whose composition is presented in table 1 the concentration of total inorganic carbon tic namely bicarbonates in the received real effluents was higher than the most common value of around 50 mg tic l found in spanish 25 therefore to make this study more representative tic concentration in real wastewater samples was partially removed with 0 1 m sulphuric acid diluted from 97 sulphuric acid j t baker to final values of around 50 mg tic l all matrices were doped with 100 μg tbz l high purity grade 99 sigma aldrich representing the total concentration of micropollutant in secondary effluents from wwtp ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 with 0 1 m koh prepared from analytic grade koh panreac spain and maintained during the treatment time 2 3 experimental set up the tbz degradation experiments under natural sunlight were conducted at the solar energy research centre ciesol located at the university of almeria spain together with universidad nacional autónoma de méxico unam cylindrical reactors of pvc 7 cm height and 16 cm diameter were used with a working maximum volume of 1 2 l of the tbz contaminated water matrices tbz removal experiments were conducted at ciesol spain first a thin layer of milled cs was deposited at the bottom of the pvc reactor next 1 l of dw se or re with 100 μg tbz was added corresponding to 5 cm of liquid depth generation of bubbles and perturbation of the cs layer were avoided then hydrogen peroxide was added to the reactor after adding the oxidant the reactor was covered and subject to orbital agitation at 150 rpm during 30 seconds for homogenization of the oxidant in the solution this agitation did not levitate the slag particles located at the bottom of the reactor at the end of this mixing time the reactor was uncovered and the system was exposed to sunlight to start the tbz degradation reaction under stirring at 150 rpm samples were collected at different reaction times from 5 to 120 min all tests were performed in duplicate as fenton s reaction is limited by the hydrogen peroxide concentration 24 26 high concentrations were used in the initial trials afterwards they were decreased stepwise to reduce the amount of residual peroxide at the end of the treatment a preliminary test was performed with 0 48 mg cs cm2 deposited at the bottom of the reactor and adding 4 4 mm of h2o2 in dw and se next a set of experiments with 17 mg cs cm2 and hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 4 4 2 94 1 5 0 88 and 0 44 mm were carried out in se afterwards 17 mg cs cm2 and h2o2 doses of 0 88 and 0 44 mm the best hydrogen peroxide doses for se were tested in re incident radiation was measured with a radiometer delta ohm lpuva02av placed on a horizontal platform an irradiance of 20 4 w m2 was quantified in the wavelength range of 327 to 384 nm the ph and temperature were measured with portable ph meter horiba and probe thermometer respectively the turbidity was measured at the end of each experiment reaching values below 5 ntu control experiments and cyclability tests were performed at unam méxico using 100 μg tbz l solution prepared in dw and the best reaction conditions dw was selected to avoid interferences such as organic matter or bicarbonates to study the individual and interaction effects of the factors in the treatment such as natural solar irradiation nsi h2o2 concentration and cs the control experiments performed were i 17 mg cs cm2 in darkness ii 17 mg cs cm2 plus nsi iii nsi iv 0 44 mm h2o2 in darkness v 0 44 mm h2o2 plus nsi and vi 0 44 mm h2o2 plus 17 mg cs cm2 in darkness ho production was determined for the photo catalytic and for the heterogeneous fenton and photo fenton tests using 0 44 mm h2o2 plus 17 mg cs cm2 and solar light with an irradiance of 39 3 w m2 incident radiation in méxico was measured with a radiometer eppley placed on a horizontal platform in the wavelength range of 320 to 400 nm these results allowed identifying the main tbz degradation mechanism finally five cyclability tests in dw were performed using the best reaction conditions of the heterogeneous photo fenton process during 60 min to estimate the cs catalytic stability in all trials cs remained at the bottom of the reactor due to its high density 2 4 analytical techniques at predetermined reaction times samples were collected by means of a syringe to avoid perturbing the cs layer and they were immediately filtered through a filter millipore with a 0 2 μm pore size the tbz concentration was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 series equipped with degasser automatic injection and a photodiode array with a reverse phase column the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water with 1 v v of formic acid an elution gradient was used with 5 acetonitrile at the start to 100 at the end in an interval of 15 min tbz retention time was 4 7 min at a wavelength of 300 nm this method has a limit of detection lod of 3 μg l h2o2 was analysed by the colorimetric method din 38402h15 at a wavelength of 410 nm using titanium oxysulphate iv with a lod of 0 24 mg l fe concentration was determined at 510 nm by the o phenantroline standardized method according to iso 6332 with a lod of 0 1 mg l in filtered samples using millipore filters with 0 2 μm pore size both the dissolved ferrous iron and the ferric species were measured with and without ascorbic acid total iron concentration including soluble and insoluble forms was measured before filtering these measurements were executed using a spectrophotometer uv vis hach unicam ii for filtering acetonitrile was used to clean the filter ratio 1 10 acetonitrile sample in order to avoid loss of tbz by adsorption 27 turbidity and conductivity were measured with a turbidity meter hanna and conductivity meter phywe respectively cod was determined with a commercial kit handle total inorganic carbon tic and doc were analysed with a shimadzu v cph toc analyser after filtering of the samples anion concentration was determined with an ionic chromatograph 881 compact ic pro metrohm usa whose eluent was a solution of 3 6 mm na2co3 and 0 8 ml min of flow rate the ho production for the photo catalysis and for the heterogeneous fenton and photo fenton processes using the optimal tbz degradation conditions 0 44 mm h2o2 and 17 mg cm2 of cs with solar light at irradiance of 39 3 w m2 was quantified by applying the salicylic acid sa trapping method with liquid chromatography 28 the principle of this indirect ho measurement is based on the quantification of the two main hydroxilated by products of sa 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid 2 5 dhba and 2 3 dihydroxybenzoic acid 2 3 dhba which were quantified with an agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatography hplc system equipped with a photo diode array detector the elution of 30 μl volume of calibration and sa treated samples was made on an ace5 c 18 ar 150 x 4 6 mm column with a mixture of methanol acetonitrile and phosphoric acid 0 1 v v at a 10 8 82 ratio v v a programmed eluent flowrate of 1 0 ml min was performed during the first 11 min and 1 5 ml min for 12 min of the analysis sa and its hydroxylated by products were detected at 236 and 246 nm respectively retention times of sa 2 3 dhba and 2 5 dhba were 23 4 9 02 and 6 63 min respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical and optical characterisation of copper slag x ray fluorescence showed the cs chemical composition with contents of 59 26 2 56 as fe2o3 26 34 1 54 as sio2 and 4 2 0 51 as al2o3 with low amounts of ti ca and mg and traces of cu cr co zn and others table 2 iron compounds the transition metal with the highest content in cs have been reported as fenton like catalysts due to their ability to decompose h2o2 into ho 29 other transition metals such as cu and zn probably will not have an important influence as fenton like catalysts due to their significantly low tm transition metal fe ratio in cs however trace elements such as cu cr and zn can inhibit recombination of the photogenerated hollow electron pairs in semiconductors or photocatalysts thus this can improve the performance of cs as photocatalyst in addition these elements can decrease the bandgap value of semiconductors which can allow the material to absorb radiation in the visible spectrum both effects can increase the production of hydroxyl radicals and thus the degradation of organic compounds 30 32 edx analysis in sem observation broadly confirms the main constituents reported based on xrf the material consists of a heterogeneous powder with angular particles fig 1 a fig 1b shows the optically active needle like fayalite crystals the layered aspect of the particles is probably due to micro twinning of the fayalite equiaxed opaque round particles embedded in the matrix correspond to magnetite the presence of these minerals was confirmed by xrd analysis as described below the xrd characterization fig 2 showed the presence of fayalite fe2sio4 pdf icsd 98 000 4353 and magnetite fe3o4 pdf icsd 98 003 5001 a semi quantitative analysis of these minerals by the rietveld method estimated a content of 63 5 and 27 5 w w respectively fayalite belongs to the olivine group of minerals and is constituted of si4 4 tetrahedrons with fe2 in the octahedral spaces 33 no publications were found with regard of its use as a heterogeneous catalyst in fenton like reactions it has been reported to show a band gap of 1 49 ev 34 to 2 ev 35 which means that it can be classified as a semiconductor and is supposed to exhibit catalytic activity in the visible light spectrum via the photo catalysis process magnetite contains both fe2 and fe3 in its structure catalytic activity in the heterogeneous fenton reaction has been associated to the fe2 occupying octahedral sites 36 and the photo catalytic capacity to its relatively low bandgap 0 1 ev 37 it has been used as a catalyst in fenton like reactions for the degradation of phenol 38 rhodamine b 39 40 and tetracycline 41 its additional advantage as catalyst is its easy recuperation by magnetic separation techniques the uv vis spectrum is shown in fig 3 a the shape of the curve corresponds to the behaviour of an indirect allowed transition it shows a strong absorbance in the 200 600 nm range associated to iron oxides 42 an absorbance peak is seen between 250 and 450 nm with a maximum at 395 nm this peak has been assigned to energetic transitions in the fe o interactions with the rest of the absorbance in the visible spectrum associated to transitions in the fe fe interactions 43 44 a band gap value of 2 42 ev was calculated using the tauc s method and data of the curve of f r hυ 2 versus photon energy for the cs fig 3b this bandgap suggests that the fayalite and magnetite as well as ti and traces of cu cr co zn present in the slag would be responsible for the semiconductor behaviour of this material which can activate a photo catalytic degradation mechanism under visible light and uv a illumination as described by sherman et al 45 and li et al 44 respectively this could be an advantage as compared to other conventional photo catalysts such as tio2 which possesses a band gap of 3 2 and 3 0 ev for the anatase and rutile phases respectively this limits the use of the latter in the uv range however iron oxides show a very fast electron hole recombination as stated by leland and bard 46 and singh et al 47 it seems that the photocatalytic efficiency of iron oxides should depend on other properties such as density of active sites crystalline and crystal structure of these compounds rather than their bandgap value 44 45 fig 2 shows that the mineralogical phases detected in cs magnetite and fayalite have a high crystallinity that can improve the photocatalytic properties of this material 44 song and zhang 48 also showed that unlike the amorphous phases a high crystallinity of mineralogical phases prevents deactivation by inhibiting the recombination of charges these authors synthesized different types of fe2o3 feooh catalysts to study the effect of surface area and crystallinity of structures on the catalytic activity of these materials for the degradation of salicylic acid in that study it was observed that the materials with the greatest crystallinity were those that had a higher degradation efficiency of salicylic acid compared to those that showed a higher percentage of amorphous structures even if their surface area was greater for the last materials fig 4 showed a type ii adsorption nitrogen isotherm for cs according to the iupac classification because at low relative pressure the formation of a monolayer of adsorbed molecules is the prevailing process whereas at high relative pressure a multilayer adsorption is observed the adsorbate thickness progressively increases until condensation pressure has been reached 23 this isotherm is characteristic of non porous materials as confirmed by observing the calculated surface area by means of the bet analysis of 0 63 m2 g and the morphology of cs particles showed in the micrograph of fig 1a thus the observed macroporosity is due to the contact between particles although the cs surface area was low high crystallinity is required rather than high surface area for photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds to prevent the recombination of electron hole h and e pairs 44 48 49 thus the efficiency of fenton catalysts to degrade pollutants can mainly depend on the crystallinity and content of iron phases density of active sites of the material 44 49 and not on their surface area this was confirmed through the results of the oxidation tests described in the next section 3 2 thiabendazole removal preliminary tests were carried out with 0 48 mg cs cm2 and 4 4 mm of h2o2 the elimination of 100 μg l tbz by means of the cs h2o2 nsi system in dw and se is presented in fig 5 a tbz degradation below the lod 3 μg l was obtained after 5 min in dw and 120 min in se residual h2o2 concentrations were similar for both cases with a consumption of only 10 which motivates an additional series of tests aimed at reducing the amount of h2o2 used in the process the relevant effect of the water matrix was clearly shown pointing out that experiments with distilled water should be carried out only to avoid interferences with the water constituents in specific studies but not for treatment assessment the second set of experiments was carried out with se using h2o2 doses of 4 4 2 94 1 5 0 88 and 0 44 mm the amount of cs was also increased to 17 mg cm2 which is the minimum amount required to completely cover the entire reactor bottom in this way the cs contact surface with the se matrix was increased allowing an optimal use of the incident sunlight these results show fig 6 a that a tbz degradation below the lod was only achieved with an addition of 4 4 mm or 2 94 mm of h2o2 in 5 min lower h2o2 doses required considerably longer reaction times and concentrations of 0 88 and 0 44 mm of oxidant caused similar tbz degradations 95 at the longest observation times of 120 min under these conditions the efficiency in terms of h2o2 consumption was considerably higher 70 and 80 respectively with 4 4 and 2 94 mm h2o2 only 20 of this reagent is used although the tbz degradation was completed after 5 min fig 6c iron concentration measurements were carried out as indicated in section 2 4 final iron content in the treated water was below lod 0 1 mg fe l in all cases at an average ph value of 6 2 0 2 this shows that the fenton and photo fenton like processes developed are heterogeneous as they did not involve lixiviated fe ions to evaluate the cs h2o2 nsi system using real matrices a set of tests was performed with different batches of a real secondary effluent re obtained from a municipal wwtp and applying the two best experimental conditions obtained in the previous experiments 17 mg cs cm2 with initial doses of 0 88 and 0 44 mm h2o2 the results are summarised in fig 6b and d degradation levels of 90 and 80 were reached after 120 min for doses of 0 88 and 0 44 mm h2o2 respectively residual h2o2 concentrations were similar to the ones in the se treatment the tbz degradation and h2o2 consumption results in se and re with doses of 0 88 and 0 44 mm h2o2 were fitted to a first order kinetic results are shown in table 3 for the se the tbz degradation rate constants are essentially the same for both peroxide doses for the re the rate constants are significantly lower than in se which indicates that other pollutants present in this matrix consume ho the rate constant for 0 44 mm h2o2 is also slightly lower than for 0 88 mm as for h2o2 consumption there was not a clear effect of the water matrix between se and re because of h2o2 reactions depend more on active iron sites availability of the cs and especially on irradiance than on the attack of hydroxyl radicals to the h2o2 molecule this is based on some reactions of the radical mechanism between iron oxides and h2o2 proposed by lin and gurol 50 the h2o2 is adsorbed on the active sites f e i i i o h of the iron oxide surface to form an inner sphere complex reaction 1 and later an electron transfer is produced to form f e i i and hydroxyl peroxyl radicals reactions 2 and 3 subsequently f e i i catalyse the decomposition of h2o2 into ho radicals reaction 4 also the oxidation of f e i i to f e i i i is produced in the presence of oxygen and by the peroxyl and hydroxyl peroxyl radicals reactions 5 and 6 50 1 f e i i i o h h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 s 2 h 2 o 2 s f e i i o 2 h h 2 o 3 f e i i o 2 h f e i i h o 2 4 h 2 o 2 f e i i f e i i i o h h o 5 f e i i o 2 f e i i i o h h o 2 6 f e i i i o h h o 2 o 2 f e i i h 2 o o h o 2 consumptions values of 70 were measured for both initial concentrations of oxidant the complexity of both media means that ho radicals can be consumed in many other reactions besides tbz degradation as this kind of radical is non selective 1 thus the slightly lower reaction rates in re are possibly related to the presence of organic matter and anions such as chlorides sulphates and nitrates which may consume ho 27 interactions between organic components and fe ions which form less reactive complexes or radicals 41 can be excluded because of the heterogeneous nature of the photocatalytic process and the fact that lixiviation of fe was not observed it is interesting to compare the results obtained in the present study with existing literature in terms of micropollutant degradation peroxide consumption and operating conditions rivas et al 51 studied the degradation of tbz in a raceway pond reactor with a liquid level of 5 cm at a ph of 2 8 1 mg l of ferrous ion and 1 5 mm h2o2 reaching complete degradation of tbz after 30 min with a consumption of 20 h2o2 similar to the results reported at high initial peroxide concentration sánchez pérez et al 52 achieved a complete degradation of the same amount of tbz with 20 mg fe2 l with excess of h2o2 in an effluent from a pilot membrane bioreactor comparing the present results with the ones obtained in the homogeneous photo fenton processes mentioned above several advantages are identified the heterogeneous photo fenton process produces an effluent at circumneutral ph and without the high fe concentrations found in the homogeneous process there is no need to separate the catalyst from the effluent as it remains at the bottom of the reactor moreover cs is a waste product hence its valorisation is interesting from an environmental point of view and its cost is low use of nsi simplifies the process with regard to other advanced oxidation processes which involve artificial uv irradiation finally it may be argued that the use of solar light and neutral ph provides slower kinetics but this observation is associated to the efforts for reducing h2o2 consumption to further reduce the cost of the process the use of a real secondary effluent as compared to a simulated effluent prepared under laboratory reduces the kinetics of the process but a high degradation level is still achieved within reasonable time this means that the process is promising for field applications the hypothesis that the degradation process is based on a heterogeneous photo fenton process requires that three factors are involved cs as the catalyst h2o2 as the oxidant and an irradiation source nsi to confirm this hypothesis control experiments were performed in dw in which one or two of these factors were not used defining six possible combinations three tests were carried out with only a single factor cs h2o2 or nsi and three with two factors cs h2o2 cs nsi and nsi h2o2 the tests in which only a single factor was used did not induce significant tbz removal as expected owing to the low specific surface of cs the adsorption process did not have a significant contribution on tbz removal a very low level of degradation 10 was seen for the combination of h2o2 nsi probably associated to a limited formation of ho radicals by the low portion of solar light below 350 nm in darkness at 30 min 30 degradation was obtained with the addition of 0 44 mm h2o2 and 17 g cs cm2 pointing out the fenton reaction with fe2 contained in the cs there was no a significant effect on the tbz degradation when 17 mg cs cm2 were exposed to nsi indicating that the semiconductor effect can be disregarded in comparison to the heterogeneous photo fenton like reaction this result can be associated to the high hole electron recombination reported for iron oxides 43 even though the cs bandgap of 2 42 ev which classifies this material as a semiconductor that makes it susceptible to be activated by sunlight irradiation to further elucidate the relative importance of the effect of irradiation ho radical production was measured for the cs nsi photo catalysis cs h2o2 heterogeneous fenton process in dark and the cs h2o2 nsi heterogeneous photo fenton reaction combinations in distilled water after 60 min no ho radical production was observed for the cs nsi system which can be associated to the very fast hole electron recombination reported for iron oxides as for cs h2o2 nsi and cs h2o2 systems the ho radical production was 22 55 μmol l with ho formation rate of 0 376 μm min compared to 10 21 μmol l with ho formation rate of 0 17 μm min in absence of nsi both productions are significantly greater than the tbz molar initial concentration approximately 0 5 μm l however an ho excess is needed for several consuming reactions of the radical mechanism between iron oxides and h2o2 proposed by lin and gurol 50 7 h o f e i i f e i i i o h 8 h o h 2 o 2 s f e i i i o h h o 2 h 2 o 9 h o h o 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 even though the former system showed a two fold ho radicals production greater than the value of the cs h2o2 the tbz degradation efficiency was three fold higher for the cs h2o2 nsi this difference is probably due to the effect of the iron reduction reaction to enhance the fenton reaction these results demonstrate that cs has the capability to catalyse the production of ho and that the heterogeneous fenton process is enhanced by the solar irradiation 3 3 cyclic cs reuse tests cycling reuse tests were performed to assess the stability of cs under repeated operation of the process cs dose 17 mg cm2 0 44 mm h2o2 fig 7 shows that with 60 min of reaction time for each test cs can be reused for at least five consecutive cycles without a significant loss of catalytic activity 80 removal compared to 82 removal with fresh material this number of reuse cycles is similar to those reported for other iron oxide nano catalysts 53 no changes in crystalline phases were found after five reuse cycles 4 conclusions this work demonstrates the high efficiency and stability of a metallurgical copper slag cs as a heterogeneous fenton type catalyst for thiabendazol degradation in traces 100 μg l in different contaminated aqueous matrices using the cs h2o2 system at circumneutral ph under nsi tbz degradation levels of 90 and 80 were achieved with h2o2 doses of 30 and 15 mg l 0 88 and 0 44 mm in a real secondary urban effluent using 17 mg cm2 of slag located at the bottom of the reactor 20 w m2 of solar irradiation and 60 min of reaction time approximately 60 of the initial h2o2 was consumed under these conditions higher doses resulted in a lower efficiency of the h2o2 consumption but higher degradation levels and faster kinetics cs showed an acceptable cyclic reuse capacity which is similar to the value reported for synthetic fenton like nano catalysts and without losing the material comparing the results obtained with the cs h2o2 nsi system to tests where nsi was not used it was found that the cs h2o2 system was only capable to degrade around 30 of the initial tbz due to the heterogeneous fenton reaction viewing the effectiveness of heterogeneous photo fenton process using cs in the removal of pesticides present in wastewater further work should be focussed to process optimization at pilot plant scale declaration of competing

13781,this work evaluates the catalytic capacity of a metallurgical copper slag cs for the removal of the pesticide thiabendazole tbz in real wastewater by the heterogeneous photo fenton process at circumneutral ph under natural solar irradiation nsi the material consists mainly of magnetite and fayalite the best experimental condition was 17 mg of cs cm2 settled at the bottom of the reactor and 0 44 mm h2o2 illuminated with solar radiation under this condition 80 tbz degradation 100 μg l initial spiked concentration was reached in real wwtp secondary effluent after 120 min with 50 of h2o2 consumption the cs h2o2 nsi system produced 2 fold more hydroxyl radicals ho with respect to the cs h2o2 the cs nsi system did not produce ho radicals probably due to the fast electron hole combination reported for one of the iron oxides present in cs even though it showed a bandgap value of 2 42 ev which indicates that the material can absorb solar irradiation thus tbz was oxidized mainly through the heterogeneous photo fenton like reaction with similar degradation efficiencies after five utilization cycles this study demonstrates that cs is a chemically stable and efficient fenton type catalyst for microcontaminant degradation in wastewater keywords iron oxides thiabendazole fungicide secondary effluent wastewater 1 introduction fenton s reaction is one of the most extensively studied advanced oxidation processes aops for the degradation of organic compounds in water due to its efficiency and the general availability of the reagents involved the reaction is characterised by the creation of hydroxyl radicals ho due to hydrogen peroxide decomposition by fe ions under acidic conditions iron is soluble at ph 2 8 but it will precipitate if the ph is increased resulting in the loss of the catalyst 1 to avoid this problem catalysts have been developed which consist of iron oxides supported on mesoporous materials activated carbon 2 tio2 3 zeolites 4 clays 5 and resins 6 these materials are categorised as heterogeneous fenton like catalysts and they reduce the need for low ph and the loss of the catalyst through sludge formation the synthesis of these compounds requires long reaction times and may produce undesired residues which increases the operation costs of the heterogeneous fenton like process an interesting alternative for the application of conventional heterogeneous fenton like catalysts is the use of industrial solid residues rich in fe based minerals these wastes are produced in large volumes e g in the form of metallurgical slag produced from copper extraction previous data found in bibliography show that worldwide production of copper slag cs is approximately 68 mt 7 the main chemical elements of cs are fe si al and ca with lesser quantities of mg cu ni as and pb as well as other metals and metalloids which depend on the specific metallurgical process used the type of furnace and ore composition depending on the specific composition of the slag cs may be classified as a hazardous waste 8 nonetheless several long term studies on the toxicity and leaching under ambient conditions produced in different copper smelting plants indicate that no significant leaching of potential toxic metals is observed and that cs does not present an environmental hazard 9 10 problems associated with landfill disposal of these wastes have induced the development of alternative usages of cs such as its use in cement aggregates for mortars and concretes 11 12 for primary metal recovery 13 14 and for heterogeneous fenton like processes 15 19 the use of cs in heterogeneous photo fenton like process using solar light has not been reported to date furthermore no reports are available on its use in the degradation of recalcitrant organic microcontaminants in wastewater such as is the case of thiabendazole tbz this fungicide used in fruit and vegetable conservation 20 has been classified as a potential carcinogen 21 the aim of this research was to analyse the catalytic capacity of a copper slag cs for removing trace levels of tbz mainly by the heterogeneous solar photo fenton like process at circumneutral ph in three aqueous matrices distilled water synthetic effluent and real urban wastewater treatment plant wwtp secondary effluent the latter obtained from the municipal wwtp el bobar located in almería spain this capacity was correlated to the physicochemical properties of the slag 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterisation of the slag slag was obtained from a copper smelter located in northern mexico after crushing the cs was ball milled and sieved the 400 mesh size 37 μm fraction was used in the tests the morphology and composition of the particles was observed by scanning electron

performed on a siemens srs3000 using the ezscan software for semi quantitative chemical analysis the band gap of 40 mg of cs was determined by means of uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using an agilent cary 5000 uv vis spectrophotometer with wavelengths in the range of 200 to 800 nm using a sample holder of 10 mm width the band gap was determined by means of the tauc curve 22 textural characteristics of cs were determined by the adsorption desorption of n2 gas in a bel sorp mini ii apparatus belsorp inc japan using the bet brunauer emmet teller isotherm methodology 23 2 2 water sources three types of matrices were selected to perform the tbz degradation tests firstly a tbz solution was prepared with distilled water dw the second one corresponding to a synthetic secondary urban effluent se 24 contained 20 mg l of dissolved organic carbon doc and was prepared by adding 7 mg l nacl 60 mg l caso4 2h2o 60 mg l mgso4 4 mg l kcl 4 mg l cacl2 h2o 6 mg l of urea all products from sigma aldrich 32 mg l of peptone biolife and 22 mg l of commercial meat extract the third one was a real urban wwtp secondary effluent re collected from the municipal wwtp named el bobar almería southeast of spain whose composition is presented in table 1 the concentration of total inorganic carbon tic namely bicarbonates in the received real effluents was higher than the most common value of around 50 mg tic l found in spanish 25 therefore to make this study more representative tic concentration in real wastewater samples was partially removed with 0 1 m sulphuric acid diluted from 97 sulphuric acid j t baker to final values of around 50 mg tic l all matrices were doped with 100 μg tbz l high purity grade 99 sigma aldrich representing the total concentration of micropollutant in secondary effluents from wwtp ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 with 0 1 m koh prepared from analytic grade koh panreac spain and maintained during the treatment time 2 3 experimental set up the tbz degradation experiments under natural sunlight were conducted at the solar energy research centre ciesol located at the university of almeria spain together with universidad nacional autónoma de méxico unam cylindrical reactors of pvc 7 cm height and 16 cm diameter were used with a working maximum volume of 1 2 l of the tbz contaminated water matrices tbz removal experiments were conducted at ciesol spain first a thin layer of milled cs was deposited at the bottom of the pvc reactor next 1 l of dw se or re with 100 μg tbz was added corresponding to 5 cm of liquid depth generation of bubbles and perturbation of the cs layer were avoided then hydrogen peroxide was added to the reactor after adding the oxidant the reactor was covered and subject to orbital agitation at 150 rpm during 30 seconds for homogenization of the oxidant in the solution this agitation did not levitate the slag particles located at the bottom of the reactor at the end of this mixing time the reactor was uncovered and the system was exposed to sunlight to start the tbz degradation reaction under stirring at 150 rpm samples were collected at different reaction times from 5 to 120 min all tests were performed in duplicate as fenton s reaction is limited by the hydrogen peroxide concentration 24 26 high concentrations were used in the initial trials afterwards they were decreased stepwise to reduce the amount of residual peroxide at the end of the treatment a preliminary test was performed with 0 48 mg cs cm2 deposited at the bottom of the reactor and adding 4 4 mm of h2o2 in dw and se next a set of experiments with 17 mg cs cm2 and hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 4 4 2 94 1 5 0 88 and 0 44 mm were carried out in se afterwards 17 mg cs cm2 and h2o2 doses of 0 88 and 0 44 mm the best hydrogen peroxide doses for se were tested in re incident radiation was measured with a radiometer delta ohm lpuva02av placed on a horizontal platform an irradiance of 20 4 w m2 was quantified in the wavelength range of 327 to 384 nm the ph and temperature were measured with portable ph meter horiba and probe thermometer respectively the turbidity was measured at the end of each experiment reaching values below 5 ntu control experiments and cyclability tests were performed at unam méxico using 100 μg tbz l solution prepared in dw and the best reaction conditions dw was selected to avoid interferences such as organic matter or bicarbonates to study the individual and interaction effects of the factors in the treatment such as natural solar irradiation nsi h2o2 concentration and cs the control experiments performed were i 17 mg cs cm2 in darkness ii 17 mg cs cm2 plus nsi iii nsi iv 0 44 mm h2o2 in darkness v 0 44 mm h2o2 plus nsi and vi 0 44 mm h2o2 plus 17 mg cs cm2 in darkness ho production was determined for the photo catalytic and for the heterogeneous fenton and photo fenton tests using 0 44 mm h2o2 plus 17 mg cs cm2 and solar light with an irradiance of 39 3 w m2 incident radiation in méxico was measured with a radiometer eppley placed on a horizontal platform in the wavelength range of 320 to 400 nm these results allowed identifying the main tbz degradation mechanism finally five cyclability tests in dw were performed using the best reaction conditions of the heterogeneous photo fenton process during 60 min to estimate the cs catalytic stability in all trials cs remained at the bottom of the reactor due to its high density 2 4 analytical techniques at predetermined reaction times samples were collected by means of a syringe to avoid perturbing the cs layer and they were immediately filtered through a filter millipore with a 0 2 μm pore size the tbz concentration was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 series equipped with degasser automatic injection and a photodiode array with a reverse phase column the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water with 1 v v of formic acid an elution gradient was used with 5 acetonitrile at the start to 100 at the end in an interval of 15 min tbz retention time was 4 7 min at a wavelength of 300 nm this method has a limit of detection lod of 3 μg l h2o2 was analysed by the colorimetric method din 38402h15 at a wavelength of 410 nm using titanium oxysulphate iv with a lod of 0 24 mg l fe concentration was determined at 510 nm by the o phenantroline standardized method according to iso 6332 with a lod of 0 1 mg l in filtered samples using millipore filters with 0 2 μm pore size both the dissolved ferrous iron and the ferric species were measured with and without ascorbic acid total iron concentration including soluble and insoluble forms was measured before filtering these measurements were executed using a spectrophotometer uv vis hach unicam ii for filtering acetonitrile was used to clean the filter ratio 1 10 acetonitrile sample in order to avoid loss of tbz by adsorption 27 turbidity and conductivity were measured with a turbidity meter hanna and conductivity meter phywe respectively cod was determined with a commercial kit handle total inorganic carbon tic and doc were analysed with a shimadzu v cph toc analyser after filtering of the samples anion concentration was determined with an ionic chromatograph 881 compact ic pro metrohm usa whose eluent was a solution of 3 6 mm na2co3 and 0 8 ml min of flow rate the ho production for the photo catalysis and for the heterogeneous fenton and photo fenton processes using the optimal tbz degradation conditions 0 44 mm h2o2 and 17 mg cm2 of cs with solar light at irradiance of 39 3 w m2 was quantified by applying the salicylic acid sa trapping method with liquid chromatography 28 the principle of this indirect ho measurement is based on the quantification of the two main hydroxilated by products of sa 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid 2 5 dhba and 2 3 dihydroxybenzoic acid 2 3 dhba which were quantified with an agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatography hplc system equipped with a photo diode array detector the elution of 30 μl volume of calibration and sa treated samples was made on an ace5 c 18 ar 150 x 4 6 mm column with a mixture of methanol acetonitrile and phosphoric acid 0 1 v v at a 10 8 82 ratio v v a programmed eluent flowrate of 1 0 ml min was performed during the first 11 min and 1 5 ml min for 12 min of the analysis sa and its hydroxylated by products were detected at 236 and 246 nm respectively retention times of sa 2 3 dhba and 2 5 dhba were 23 4 9 02 and 6 63 min respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical and optical characterisation of copper slag x ray fluorescence showed the cs chemical composition with contents of 59 26 2 56 as fe2o3 26 34 1 54 as sio2 and 4 2 0 51 as al2o3 with low amounts of ti ca and mg and traces of cu cr co zn and others table 2 iron compounds the transition metal with the highest content in cs have been reported as fenton like catalysts due to their ability to decompose h2o2 into ho 29 other transition metals such as cu and zn probably will not have an important influence as fenton like catalysts due to their significantly low tm transition metal fe ratio in cs however trace elements such as cu cr and zn can inhibit recombination of the photogenerated hollow electron pairs in semiconductors or photocatalysts thus this can improve the performance of cs as photocatalyst in addition these elements can decrease the bandgap value of semiconductors which can allow the material to absorb radiation in the visible spectrum both effects can increase the production of hydroxyl radicals and thus the degradation of organic compounds 30 32 edx analysis in sem observation broadly confirms the main constituents reported based on xrf the material consists of a heterogeneous powder with angular particles fig 1 a fig 1b shows the optically active needle like fayalite crystals the layered aspect of the particles is probably due to micro twinning of the fayalite equiaxed opaque round particles embedded in the matrix correspond to magnetite the presence of these minerals was confirmed by xrd analysis as described below the xrd characterization fig 2 showed the presence of fayalite fe2sio4 pdf icsd 98 000 4353 and magnetite fe3o4 pdf icsd 98 003 5001 a semi quantitative analysis of these minerals by the rietveld method estimated a content of 63 5 and 27 5 w w respectively fayalite belongs to the olivine group of minerals and is constituted of si4 4 tetrahedrons with fe2 in the octahedral spaces 33 no publications were found with regard of its use as a heterogeneous catalyst in fenton like reactions it has been reported to show a band gap of 1 49 ev 34 to 2 ev 35 which means that it can be classified as a semiconductor and is supposed to exhibit catalytic activity in the visible light spectrum via the photo catalysis process magnetite contains both fe2 and fe3 in its structure catalytic activity in the heterogeneous fenton reaction has been associated to the fe2 occupying octahedral sites 36 and the photo catalytic capacity to its relatively low bandgap 0 1 ev 37 it has been used as a catalyst in fenton like reactions for the degradation of phenol 38 rhodamine b 39 40 and tetracycline 41 its additional advantage as catalyst is its easy recuperation by magnetic separation techniques the uv vis spectrum is shown in fig 3 a the shape of the curve corresponds to the behaviour of an indirect allowed transition it shows a strong absorbance in the 200 600 nm range associated to iron oxides 42 an absorbance peak is seen between 250 and 450 nm with a maximum at 395 nm this peak has been assigned to energetic transitions in the fe o interactions with the rest of the absorbance in the visible spectrum associated to transitions in the fe fe interactions 43 44 a band gap value of 2 42 ev was calculated using the tauc s method and data of the curve of f r hυ 2 versus photon energy for the cs fig 3b this bandgap suggests that the fayalite and magnetite as well as ti and traces of cu cr co zn present in the slag would be responsible for the semiconductor behaviour of this material which can activate a photo catalytic degradation mechanism under visible light and uv a illumination as described by sherman et al 45 and li et al 44 respectively this could be an advantage as compared to other conventional photo catalysts such as tio2 which possesses a band gap of 3 2 and 3 0 ev for the anatase and rutile phases respectively this limits the use of the latter in the uv range however iron oxides show a very fast electron hole recombination as stated by leland and bard 46 and singh et al 47 it seems that the photocatalytic efficiency of iron oxides should depend on other properties such as density of active sites crystalline and crystal structure of these compounds rather than their bandgap value 44 45 fig 2 shows that the mineralogical phases detected in cs magnetite and fayalite have a high crystallinity that can improve the photocatalytic properties of this material 44 song and zhang 48 also showed that unlike the amorphous phases a high crystallinity of mineralogical phases prevents deactivation by inhibiting the recombination of charges these authors synthesized different types of fe2o3 feooh catalysts to study the effect of surface area and crystallinity of structures on the catalytic activity of these materials for the degradation of salicylic acid in that study it was observed that the materials with the greatest crystallinity were those that had a higher degradation efficiency of salicylic acid compared to those that showed a higher percentage of amorphous structures even if their surface area was greater for the last materials fig 4 showed a type ii adsorption nitrogen isotherm for cs according to the iupac classification because at low relative pressure the formation of a monolayer of adsorbed molecules is the prevailing process whereas at high relative pressure a multilayer adsorption is observed the adsorbate thickness progressively increases until condensation pressure has been reached 23 this isotherm is characteristic of non porous materials as confirmed by observing the calculated surface area by means of the bet analysis of 0 63 m2 g and the morphology of cs particles showed in the micrograph of fig 1a thus the observed macroporosity is due to the contact between particles although the cs surface area was low high crystallinity is required rather than high surface area for photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds to prevent the recombination of electron hole h and e pairs 44 48 49 thus the efficiency of fenton catalysts to degrade pollutants can mainly depend on the crystallinity and content of iron phases density of active sites of the material 44 49 and not on their surface area this was confirmed through the results of the oxidation tests described in the next section 3 2 thiabendazole removal preliminary tests were carried out with 0 48 mg cs cm2 and 4 4 mm of h2o2 the elimination of 100 μg l tbz by means of the cs h2o2 nsi system in dw and se is presented in fig 5 a tbz degradation below the lod 3 μg l was obtained after 5 min in dw and 120 min in se residual h2o2 concentrations were similar for both cases with a consumption of only 10 which motivates an additional series of tests aimed at reducing the amount of h2o2 used in the process the relevant effect of the water matrix was clearly shown pointing out that experiments with distilled water should be carried out only to avoid interferences with the water constituents in specific studies but not for treatment assessment the second set of experiments was carried out with se using h2o2 doses of 4 4 2 94 1 5 0 88 and 0 44 mm the amount of cs was also increased to 17 mg cm2 which is the minimum amount required to completely cover the entire reactor bottom in this way the cs contact surface with the se matrix was increased allowing an optimal use of the incident sunlight these results show fig 6 a that a tbz degradation below the lod was only achieved with an addition of 4 4 mm or 2 94 mm of h2o2 in 5 min lower h2o2 doses required considerably longer reaction times and concentrations of 0 88 and 0 44 mm of oxidant caused similar tbz degradations 95 at the longest observation times of 120 min under these conditions the efficiency in terms of h2o2 consumption was considerably higher 70 and 80 respectively with 4 4 and 2 94 mm h2o2 only 20 of this reagent is used although the tbz degradation was completed after 5 min fig 6c iron concentration measurements were carried out as indicated in section 2 4 final iron content in the treated water was below lod 0 1 mg fe l in all cases at an average ph value of 6 2 0 2 this shows that the fenton and photo fenton like processes developed are heterogeneous as they did not involve lixiviated fe ions to evaluate the cs h2o2 nsi system using real matrices a set of tests was performed with different batches of a real secondary effluent re obtained from a municipal wwtp and applying the two best experimental conditions obtained in the previous experiments 17 mg cs cm2 with initial doses of 0 88 and 0 44 mm h2o2 the results are summarised in fig 6b and d degradation levels of 90 and 80 were reached after 120 min for doses of 0 88 and 0 44 mm h2o2 respectively residual h2o2 concentrations were similar to the ones in the se treatment the tbz degradation and h2o2 consumption results in se and re with doses of 0 88 and 0 44 mm h2o2 were fitted to a first order kinetic results are shown in table 3 for the se the tbz degradation rate constants are essentially the same for both peroxide doses for the re the rate constants are significantly lower than in se which indicates that other pollutants present in this matrix consume ho the rate constant for 0 44 mm h2o2 is also slightly lower than for 0 88 mm as for h2o2 consumption there was not a clear effect of the water matrix between se and re because of h2o2 reactions depend more on active iron sites availability of the cs and especially on irradiance than on the attack of hydroxyl radicals to the h2o2 molecule this is based on some reactions of the radical mechanism between iron oxides and h2o2 proposed by lin and gurol 50 the h2o2 is adsorbed on the active sites f e i i i o h of the iron oxide surface to form an inner sphere complex reaction 1 and later an electron transfer is produced to form f e i i and hydroxyl peroxyl radicals reactions 2 and 3 subsequently f e i i catalyse the decomposition of h2o2 into ho radicals reaction 4 also the oxidation of f e i i to f e i i i is produced in the presence of oxygen and by the peroxyl and hydroxyl peroxyl radicals reactions 5 and 6 50 1 f e i i i o h h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 s 2 h 2 o 2 s f e i i o 2 h h 2 o 3 f e i i o 2 h f e i i h o 2 4 h 2 o 2 f e i i f e i i i o h h o 5 f e i i o 2 f e i i i o h h o 2 6 f e i i i o h h o 2 o 2 f e i i h 2 o o h o 2 consumptions values of 70 were measured for both initial concentrations of oxidant the complexity of both media means that ho radicals can be consumed in many other reactions besides tbz degradation as this kind of radical is non selective 1 thus the slightly lower reaction rates in re are possibly related to the presence of organic matter and anions such as chlorides sulphates and nitrates which may consume ho 27 interactions between organic components and fe ions which form less reactive complexes or radicals 41 can be excluded because of the heterogeneous nature of the photocatalytic process and the fact that lixiviation of fe was not observed it is interesting to compare the results obtained in the present study with existing literature in terms of micropollutant degradation peroxide consumption and operating conditions rivas et al 51 studied the degradation of tbz in a raceway pond reactor with a liquid level of 5 cm at a ph of 2 8 1 mg l of ferrous ion and 1 5 mm h2o2 reaching complete degradation of tbz after 30 min with a consumption of 20 h2o2 similar to the results reported at high initial peroxide concentration sánchez pérez et al 52 achieved a complete degradation of the same amount of tbz with 20 mg fe2 l with excess of h2o2 in an effluent from a pilot membrane bioreactor comparing the present results with the ones obtained in the homogeneous photo fenton processes mentioned above several advantages are identified the heterogeneous photo fenton process produces an effluent at circumneutral ph and without the high fe concentrations found in the homogeneous process there is no need to separate the catalyst from the effluent as it remains at the bottom of the reactor moreover cs is a waste product hence its valorisation is interesting from an environmental point of view and its cost is low use of nsi simplifies the process with regard to other advanced oxidation processes which involve artificial uv irradiation finally it may be argued that the use of solar light and neutral ph provides slower kinetics but this observation is associated to the efforts for reducing h2o2 consumption to further reduce the cost of the process the use of a real secondary effluent as compared to a simulated effluent prepared under laboratory reduces the kinetics of the process but a high degradation level is still achieved within reasonable time this means that the process is promising for field applications the hypothesis that the degradation process is based on a heterogeneous photo fenton process requires that three factors are involved cs as the catalyst h2o2 as the oxidant and an irradiation source nsi to confirm this hypothesis control experiments were performed in dw in which one or two of these factors were not used defining six possible combinations three tests were carried out with only a single factor cs h2o2 or nsi and three with two factors cs h2o2 cs nsi and nsi h2o2 the tests in which only a single factor was used did not induce significant tbz removal as expected owing to the low specific surface of cs the adsorption process did not have a significant contribution on tbz removal a very low level of degradation 10 was seen for the combination of h2o2 nsi probably associated to a limited formation of ho radicals by the low portion of solar light below 350 nm in darkness at 30 min 30 degradation was obtained with the addition of 0 44 mm h2o2 and 17 g cs cm2 pointing out the fenton reaction with fe2 contained in the cs there was no a significant effect on the tbz degradation when 17 mg cs cm2 were exposed to nsi indicating that the semiconductor effect can be disregarded in comparison to the heterogeneous photo fenton like reaction this result can be associated to the high hole electron recombination reported for iron oxides 43 even though the cs bandgap of 2 42 ev which classifies this material as a semiconductor that makes it susceptible to be activated by sunlight irradiation to further elucidate the relative importance of the effect of irradiation ho radical production was measured for the cs nsi photo catalysis cs h2o2 heterogeneous fenton process in dark and the cs h2o2 nsi heterogeneous photo fenton reaction combinations in distilled water after 60 min no ho radical production was observed for the cs nsi system which can be associated to the very fast hole electron recombination reported for iron oxides as for cs h2o2 nsi and cs h2o2 systems the ho radical production was 22 55 μmol l with ho formation rate of 0 376 μm min compared to 10 21 μmol l with ho formation rate of 0 17 μm min in absence of nsi both productions are significantly greater than the tbz molar initial concentration approximately 0 5 μm l however an ho excess is needed for several consuming reactions of the radical mechanism between iron oxides and h2o2 proposed by lin and gurol 50 7 h o f e i i f e i i i o h 8 h o h 2 o 2 s f e i i i o h h o 2 h 2 o 9 h o h o 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 even though the former system showed a two fold ho radicals production greater than the value of the cs h2o2 the tbz degradation efficiency was three fold higher for the cs h2o2 nsi this difference is probably due to the effect of the iron reduction reaction to enhance the fenton reaction these results demonstrate that cs has the capability to catalyse the production of ho and that the heterogeneous fenton process is enhanced by the solar irradiation 3 3 cyclic cs reuse tests cycling reuse tests were performed to assess the stability of cs under repeated operation of the process cs dose 17 mg cm2 0 44 mm h2o2 fig 7 shows that with 60 min of reaction time for each test cs can be reused for at least five consecutive cycles without a significant loss of catalytic activity 80 removal compared to 82 removal with fresh material this number of reuse cycles is similar to those reported for other iron oxide nano catalysts 53 no changes in crystalline phases were found after five reuse cycles 4 conclusions this work demonstrates the high efficiency and stability of a metallurgical copper slag cs as a heterogeneous fenton type catalyst for thiabendazol degradation in traces 100 μg l in different contaminated aqueous matrices using the cs h2o2 system at circumneutral ph under nsi tbz degradation levels of 90 and 80 were achieved with h2o2 doses of 30 and 15 mg l 0 88 and 0 44 mm in a real secondary urban effluent using 17 mg cm2 of slag located at the bottom of the reactor 20 w m2 of solar irradiation and 60 min of reaction time approximately 60 of the initial h2o2 was consumed under these conditions higher doses resulted in a lower efficiency of the h2o2 consumption but higher degradation levels and faster kinetics cs showed an acceptable cyclic reuse capacity which is similar to the value reported for synthetic fenton like nano catalysts and without losing the material comparing the results obtained with the cs h2o2 nsi system to tests where nsi was not used it was found that the cs h2o2 system was only capable to degrade around 30 of the initial tbz due to the heterogeneous fenton reaction viewing the effectiveness of heterogeneous photo fenton process using cs in the removal of pesticides present in wastewater further work should be focussed to process optimization at pilot plant scale declaration of competing

13782,bioaugmentation is a promising eco friendly and economical technique it also aims at enhancing the efficiency of wastewater treatments moreover this technique which is based on microorganisms performs an important function in the removal of contaminants from water therefore the main objective of this study was isolation and identification of novel bacteria responsible of chromium removal and then the treatment of tannery effluent through this process using the isolated strains in fact the isolation was from a composite tannery effluent regarding the bioaugmentation test tannery effluents were inoculated with biomass and were incubated at 37 c for 30 h a consortium and different bacterial concentrations were studied to show their effects throughout incubation several samples were taken to determine the bacterial growth total and hexavalent chromium as a result bacillus sp enterobactera erogenes and bacillus pumilus were isolated and their bioremediation capacity was shown especially their removal capacity of chromium thus these isolated strains could be novel chromium resistant bacteria for each strain total chromium removal achieved 60 using the bacterial concentration of 2 this removal increased to 80 with the concentration 6 as for cr vi its removal increased from 60 to more than 96 when the bacterial concentration increases from 2 to 6 otherwise cr t and cr vi removals were around 60 70 for the consortium consequently the bacterial concentration 6 had a strong significant effect on chromium removals the isolated strains had statistically the same effect on chromium removals whereas the consortium did not have a significant effect on chromium removals keywords chromium tannery effluent bioaugmentation bacillussp enterobacter aerogenes bacillus pumilus 1 introduction chromium is one of the most toxic heavy metals because of its form vi 1 in fact the hexavalent chromium is classified as group a human carcinogen 2 chromium is mainly released from many industries such as tanneries for that tannery wastewaters are considered as the worst environmental problem that harms the human and animal health thus the treatment of tannery effluents is essential before their final release into the environment various conventional physicochemical processes are performed to treat these tannery effluents among these processes precipitation coagulation flocculation electrocoagulation filtration and oxidation processes have been successfully studied 3 nevertheless these mentioned processes have many inconvenience such as low efficiency high operational and investment costs operational complexity and not eco friendly 4 regarding biological techniques the activated sludge process the sequencing batch reactor membrane bioreactors and anaerobic processes have some operational limits the presence of heavy metals particularly the chromium is among these limits so it is a necessity to develop another alternative inexpensive and eco friendly technique to remove chromium from tannery effluents in the recent years biosorption and bioaugmentation methods are noticed as being more attractive low cost efficient and eco friendly 5 through these both processes microorganisms play an important role in the removal of contaminants such as heavy metals living and dead microorganisms can be used in biosorption method wherein these microorganisms are considered as materiel of adsorption 6 moreover these microorganisms can replace the activated carbon and then reduce process cost this method depends on cell wall compositions such as polysaccharides which include amino carboxy phosphate and sulphate groups 7 according to previous study biosorption method was applied to remove chromium using natural microorganisms 8 9 or as bio nanocomposite material which were synthesized from microorganisms 10 furthermore chromium uptake by biosorption depends on some mechanisms namely adsorption ion exchange chelation and complexation 11 on the other hand bioaugmentation involves the use of living microorganisms 12 this method is based on the metabolic capabilities of microorganisms for the detoxification of several compounds including chromium 13 therefore microorganisms can resist to chromium through some mechanisms among which figure biosorption bioaccumulation enzymatic reduction sos response and enzymatic dna repair system etc 14 so these mechanisms can be an effective way to remove chromium toxicity likewise bioaugmentaion can be applied in situ using autochthonous microorganisms 15 or in ex situ using allochthonous microorganisms 16 otherwise the literature has shown various studies on chromium removal by biosorption whereas few studies on chromium removal by bioaugmentation were assessed in addition bioaugmentation process can be applied with another biological process to enhance its performance taking into account what has been mentioned above the main objective of this present study was the isolation and identification of novel resistant chromium strains from tannery effluent more particularly this study focuses on the treatment of these tannery effluents by bioaugmentation using the isolated strains 2 materials and methods 2 1 tannery effluents tannery wastewater was collected from a modern tannery located in industrial area doukkarat in fez city morocco the composite sample

the isolation and purification of isolated strains was made from the collected tannery effluent using the ordinary medium of luria bertani lb after purification inoculums of each strain were carried out by seeding the lb medium with the purified colonies moreover the mixed culture or the consortium c was prepared by inoculating the medium with all strains 2 3 bioaugmentation process at lab scale at lab scale bioaugmentation process was performerd using the batch mode in flasks of 250 ml a volume of inoculums was added to a volume of tannery effluents to get an envisaged concentration and a useful volume of 100 ml the incubation was performed within a rotary shaker at 150 rpm and at temperature of 37 c for 30 h a negative test t was incubated under the same conditions but without inoculums to reveal the bioremediation capacity of our strains bacterial concentrations were 2 4 and 6 v v for each strain and consortium c as well 2 4 analytical method in parallel to the incubation time several samples were progressively taken to determine the bacterial growth it was followed by measuring optical density od using the wavelength ʎ of 600 nm after that the samples were centrifuged

concentrations on cr t and cr vi removals and on bacterial growth as well alpha level is 0 05 furthermore t test was also carried out to check which bacterial concentration or which strain was different these tests were performed in microsoft office excel 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological and microscopic characterization of strains three strains were isolated k1 k2 and k3 from the tannery effluents for morphological characterization of colonies they were all white and opaque in addition k1 had an irregular and flatform k2 had a circular and convex form whereas k3 had a circular and flatform gram stain showed that the three strains k1 k2 and k3 had a bacillus form and k1 and k3 were gram positive bacteria whereas k2 was a gram negative bacterium 3 2 bioaugmentation test 3 2 1 evolution of bacterial growth during the first 20 h of incubation the three strains k1 k2 and k3 and the consortium had good growth fig 1 a d this could be explained by the resistance of these bacteria to the chromium present in these effluents the tannery effluents characterized by a high cod amount 5212 12 mg o2 l 1 table 1 it could reveal its richness in nutrients and particularly carbon source however these effluents contain also a large concentration of total and hexavalent chromium therefore this chromium concentration did not prevent the bacterial growth and then this could powerfully show that our isolated strains are chromium resistant bacteria fig 1 shows that bacterial growth increases as the strain or consortium concentration increase as well nevertheless the bacterial growth was higher for each strain relative to the consortium using the three strain concentrations this could be the result of antibiosis between the three strains within the consortium where one or more produced a toxic substance and subsequently the destruction of other strains in addition k1 strain showed strong growth compared to k2 and k3 for the three used concentrations whereas k2 and k3 had almost the same evolution growth fig 1 b d anova one way test showed that there was not a significant effect on bacterial growth between these strains and their consortium as well p value 0 05 for bacterial concentrations anova one way test revealed a significant effect of these concentrations on bacterial growth p value 0 05 likewise t test showed that the bacterial concentration 6 differ significantly from 2 and 4 p value 0 05 3 2 2 chromium evolution the following results of the total and hexavalent chromium are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively consequently a decrease in the chromium amount was observed throughout the incubation period for all strain consortium and their concentrations however cr t and cr vi concentrations remained stable over time within the negative test t this could reveal that the chromium removal was by our strains and not by chemical reaction despite bacterial growth the decrease in cr t and cr vi concentrations was continued until the end of incubation time figs 2 and 3 this could show that this decrease did not relate to bacterial growth otherwise the decrease of total and hexavalent chromium was not that higher using the consortium this could also be due to the antibiosis between the three strains however the removals of cr t and cr vi were higher using k1 although k2 and k3 showed also high chromium abatement figs 2 and 3 for k1 the abatement rates of total chromium were 63 7 87 78 and 91 9 for 2 4 and 6 respectively as for the hexavalent chromium removals they were 72 61 97 68 and 98 44 respectively for 2 4 and 6 concerning both cr t and cr vi anova two way test indicated that factor 1 bacterial concentration and factor 2 strains and consortium had a significant effect on total and hexavalent chromium removals p value 0 05 for both factors furthermore this effect was combined because the p value of interaction between these two factors was less than 0 05 according to t test each bacterial concentration had a significant impact on chromium removals but the concentration 6 had a strong effect statistically than 2 and 4 basing on t test p value was very lower than 0 05 for isolated strains and consortium and according to t test these three strains k1 k2 and k3 did not differ significantly p value 0 05 but the consortium differed significantly than each strain 3 3 molecular identification of strains the fasta format of strain genes were analyzed using the database of blastn software the identification was based on the score the percentage of similarity or identity and the percentage query cover which should exceed 96 thus k1 k2 and k3 could be bacillus sp enterobacter aerogenes and bacillus pumilus respectively with a query cover of 97 these results were strongly consistent with gram staining results therefore bacillus sp gave the best abatement rates of total and hexavalent chromium chromium is a heavy metal in which oxidation of this metal gives several forms but the hexavalent and trivalent forms are most stable in the environment in addition the cr iii can be spontaneously oxidized to cr vi form whereas the cr vi may be reduced to cr iii form through many factors therefore in the environment the less toxic form cr iii can be easily oxidized to highly toxic form cr vi 21 regarding the literature several studies showed the chromium removals through microorganisms in particular bacteria they have also shown the resistance of many bacteria versus hexavalent chromium this resistance could be in different ways 21 a adhesion of cr vi on the membrane s cells by a chemical bond this bond could be between this metal and functional groups of cell wall such as proteins glycolipids polysaccharides etc b cr vi could transform into cr iii upon its adsorption on the wall s cell this conversion can also catalyze by chromate reductase 22 c on the membrane s cell the conversion of cr vi to cr iii can be made spontaneously spontaneous conversion phenomena d cr vi ions can be actively transported across microbial membranes through sulphate transporters e the specific metal binding proteins can help hexavalent chromium to be transported inside the microbial cell then the cr vi could be reduced to cr iii passing by unstable oxidative forms cr v and cr iv f cr vi can also accumulate within the biological membrane g cr vi can serve as a terminal electron acceptor in the respiratory chain and can involve proteins from cytochrome families as cytochrome b and cytochrome c this can happen in the absence of oxygen or other endogenous reserves like nadh or nadph 23 in conclusion the hexavalent chromium can be removed through adsorption on cells wall biosorption plus it could be removed by accumulation inside the cells bioaccumulation and or transformation to another less toxic form biotransformation as well gram positive and gram negative bacteria can convert hexavalent to trivalent chromium which is a less toxic form so they can remove cr vi by biosorption or biotransformation 24 furthermore some studies have shown the removal of cr v by biosorption using bacillus in which they have used living and dead cells 25 26 additionally the mechanisms of chromium removals were biosorption biotransformation and or bioaccumulation for genus bacillus 24 26 another study has also shown the reduction capacity of hexavalent chromium by enterobacter which could convert cr vi to cr iii by chromate reductase this conversion was maximal at ph 7 and 37 c 27 according to another study genus bacillus could produce and release a toxin and then this could confirm the antibiosis effect between the three strains within the consortium 28 concurrently the bioaugmentation process using bacillus sp enterobacter aerogenes or bacillus pumilus for treatment of tannery effluents could be a good future solution to remove chromium from these effluents 4 conclusion three strains were isolated from the tannery effluents these strains were bacillus sp enterobacter aerogenes and bacillus pumilus after molecular identification on the other hand the treatment of tannery effluents was by the bioaugmentation process using different bacterial concentrations 2 4 and 6 of these isolated strains and their consortium this treatment revealed the high bioremediation capacity of these three strains besides it showed the powerful resistance of these strains versus the chromium particularly cr vi moreover bacillus sp enterobacter aerogenes and bacillus pumilus gave high removals of total and hexavalent chromium which exceed 60 using the concentration 2 and attainted 96 using the concentration 6 for all isolated bacteria therefore the bacterial concentration of 6 affected strongly on abatement rate of chromium but the consortium did not have a significant effect on chromium removals on the other hand bacterial concentrations and strain type had a combined effect on bioaugmentation performance in conclusion these isolated strains can be applied for the treatment of tannery wastewater in situ basing on autochthonous bioaugmentation or as allochthonous microorganisms within another biological treatment to increase its efficiency particularly the sequencing batch reactor declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the national center for scientific and technical research cnrst for the crucial facilities and support provided to carry out the molecular identification of our strains 
13782,bioaugmentation is a promising eco friendly and economical technique it also aims at enhancing the efficiency of wastewater treatments moreover this technique which is based on microorganisms performs an important function in the removal of contaminants from water therefore the main objective of this study was isolation and identification of novel bacteria responsible of chromium removal and then the treatment of tannery effluent through this process using the isolated strains in fact the isolation was from a composite tannery effluent regarding the bioaugmentation test tannery effluents were inoculated with biomass and were incubated at 37 c for 30 h a consortium and different bacterial concentrations were studied to show their effects throughout incubation several samples were taken to determine the bacterial growth total and hexavalent chromium as a result bacillus sp enterobactera erogenes and bacillus pumilus were isolated and their bioremediation capacity was shown especially their removal capacity of chromium thus these isolated strains could be novel chromium resistant bacteria for each strain total chromium removal achieved 60 using the bacterial concentration of 2 this removal increased to 80 with the concentration 6 as for cr vi its removal increased from 60 to more than 96 when the bacterial concentration increases from 2 to 6 otherwise cr t and cr vi removals were around 60 70 for the consortium consequently the bacterial concentration 6 had a strong significant effect on chromium removals the isolated strains had statistically the same effect on chromium removals whereas the consortium did not have a significant effect on chromium removals keywords chromium tannery effluent bioaugmentation bacillussp enterobacter aerogenes bacillus pumilus 1 introduction chromium is one of the most toxic heavy metals because of its form vi 1 in fact the hexavalent chromium is classified as group a human carcinogen 2 chromium is mainly released from many industries such as tanneries for that tannery wastewaters are considered as the worst environmental problem that harms the human and animal health thus the treatment of tannery effluents is essential before their final release into the environment various conventional physicochemical processes are performed to treat these tannery effluents among these processes precipitation coagulation flocculation electrocoagulation filtration and oxidation processes have been successfully studied 3 nevertheless these mentioned processes have many inconvenience such as low efficiency high operational and investment costs operational complexity and not eco friendly 4 regarding biological techniques the activated sludge process the sequencing batch reactor membrane bioreactors and anaerobic processes have some operational limits the presence of heavy metals particularly the chromium is among these limits so it is a necessity to develop another alternative inexpensive and eco friendly technique to remove chromium from tannery effluents in the recent years biosorption and bioaugmentation methods are noticed as being more attractive low cost efficient and eco friendly 5 through these both processes microorganisms play an important role in the removal of contaminants such as heavy metals living and dead microorganisms can be used in biosorption method wherein these microorganisms are considered as materiel of adsorption 6 moreover these microorganisms can replace the activated carbon and then reduce process cost this method depends on cell wall compositions such as polysaccharides which include amino carboxy phosphate and sulphate groups 7 according to previous study biosorption method was applied to remove chromium using natural microorganisms 8 9 or as bio nanocomposite material which were synthesized from microorganisms 10 furthermore chromium uptake by biosorption depends on some mechanisms namely adsorption ion exchange chelation and complexation 11 on the other hand bioaugmentation involves the use of living microorganisms 12 this method is based on the metabolic capabilities of microorganisms for the detoxification of several compounds including chromium 13 therefore microorganisms can resist to chromium through some mechanisms among which figure biosorption bioaccumulation enzymatic reduction sos response and enzymatic dna repair system etc 14 so these mechanisms can be an effective way to remove chromium toxicity likewise bioaugmentaion can be applied in situ using autochthonous microorganisms 15 or in ex situ using allochthonous microorganisms 16 otherwise the literature has shown various studies on chromium removal by biosorption whereas few studies on chromium removal by bioaugmentation were assessed in addition bioaugmentation process can be applied with another biological process to enhance its performance taking into account what has been mentioned above the main objective of this present study was the isolation and identification of novel resistant chromium strains from tannery effluent more particularly this study focuses on the treatment of these tannery effluents by bioaugmentation using the isolated strains 2 materials and methods 2 1 tannery effluents tannery wastewater was collected from a modern tannery located in industrial area doukkarat in fez city morocco the composite sample

the isolation and purification of isolated strains was made from the collected tannery effluent using the ordinary medium of luria bertani lb after purification inoculums of each strain were carried out by seeding the lb medium with the purified colonies moreover the mixed culture or the consortium c was prepared by inoculating the medium with all strains 2 3 bioaugmentation process at lab scale at lab scale bioaugmentation process was performerd using the batch mode in flasks of 250 ml a volume of inoculums was added to a volume of tannery effluents to get an envisaged concentration and a useful volume of 100 ml the incubation was performed within a rotary shaker at 150 rpm and at temperature of 37 c for 30 h a negative test t was incubated under the same conditions but without inoculums to reveal the bioremediation capacity of our strains bacterial concentrations were 2 4 and 6 v v for each strain and consortium c as well 2 4 analytical method in parallel to the incubation time several samples were progressively taken to determine the bacterial growth it was followed by measuring optical density od using the wavelength ʎ of 600 nm after that the samples were centrifuged at 7000 rpm during 15 min to eliminate the biomass and then the supernatant was analyzed to follow residual cr vi and cr t cr vi was analyzed spectrophotometrically selecta spain at 540 nm using 1 5

13783,a system that represents a semi continuous aerobic moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr was used for the treatment of synthetic fischer tropsch ft wastewater contaminated with short chain alcohols scas and volatile fatty acids vfas the point of zero charge pzc of the carriers used in the mbbr system was found to occur at ph 7 9 the aerobic system for the treatment of ft synthetic wastewater was found to be efficient and it reduced the chemical oxygen demand cod by up to 93 4 at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 days the organic loading rate was kept constant at cod 67 9 g l biodegradation kinetics revealed that 71 of the cod was removed within 9 hours in addition the biodegradation of scas and vfas correlated well with the first order kinetic model and an r2 value of 0 94 and a rate constant of 0 137 h 1 were achieved the half life time of the scas and vfas was found to be 5 07 h given the stubborn nature of compounds found in the ft wastewater results emanating from this study augurs well for the biodegradation and treatment of ft wastewaters contaminated with organic compounds keywords biofilm bioremediation kinetics fischer tropsch wastewater moving bed biofilm reactor 1 introduction the fischer tropsch ft technology is a process for converting hydrogen and carbon monoxide into a range of products such as light hydrocarbons liquid petroleum gas lpg diesel naphta and wax 1 2 for every ton of synthetic crude oil produced from the ft process 1 1 1 3 tons of wastewater is generated which is the largest volume liquid product generated from any process 3 4 typical ft effluent wastewater is comprised of four types of organic pollutants namely short chain alcohols 76 7 cod volatile fatty acids 10 7 cod long chain alcohols 8 2 cod and hydrocarbons 4 5 cod 5 6 the current study investigated the biodegradation of volatile organic compounds vocs found in ft wastewater which is produced in enormous quantities as high as 300 m3 h and have a high organic strength of about 30 g l 4 6 when discharged into water bodies the untreated water has detrimental effects on the aquatic life due to high organic matter content and low ph therefore it is not feasible to dispose of untreated water into the environment 7 8 the low ph and high strength chemical oxygen demand cod wastewater inhibit the growth of useful microorganisms in water exposure to water contaminated with organic compounds pose serious risks to human animal and aquatic life when treated to acceptable cod levels the wastewater can be safely discharged into the environment or be reused as process water within the ft plant several approaches for the kinetic analysis of vocs include the macro and microkinetic approaches which relate to microbial growth rate and biodegradation rate of the organic compounds respectively 9 the current study focuses on the latter microkinetic approach which in this study involves an investigation of the rate of degradation of scas and vfas occurring in ft wastewater macro and microkinetic analyses have been conducted with vocs with a profile that is similar to that of compounds found in ft wastewater 9 13 the microkinetic approach was used to address the kinetics of biomass formation during the degradation of compounds such as vfas acetate propionate n butyrate 10 a similar approach was adopted by avalos et al 9 for the degradation of methanol and toluene both studies revealed that the rate of biomass formation depends on temperature microbial species involved during biodegradation and the chemical profile of the substrate the macrokinetics approach was not adopted for this because this study is aimed at promoting biofilm formation which enhances the biodegradation of compounds since most bacterial cells are capable of forming biofilms only a limited number of cells are typically suspended in the media and thus make it difficult to determine biomass formation very few researchers e g 11 12 14 have adopted the microkinetic approach to study degradation kinetics of vocs found in ft or similar wastewaters after studying the biodegradation kinetics of acetic acid and other compounds chidambara et al 11 revealed that the simpler compounds i e acetic acid are degraded first and thereafter followed by the more complex compounds similar results have also been reported by aguilar et al 14 following an investigation of the anaerobic degradation of acetic acid n butyric acid i butyric acid and propionic acid majone et al 6 did not consider the biodegradation kinetics of the compounds found in the ft wastewater when studying the bioremediation of ft wastewater but instead focused on the production of methane gas on the other hand beccari et al 5 focused exclusively on the degradation of acetic acid and propionic acid in ft wastewater thus leaving a huge knowledge gap on the degradation of other important compounds occurring in ft effluent similar to majone et al 6 and beccari et al 5 other previous studies on the treatment of ft and other types of wastewaters have not paid much attention to the rate of disappearance biodegradation kinetics of the compounds in the wastewater the current study is therefore aimed at developing an aerobic semi continuous moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr that can be used for the treatment of ft synthetic wastewater to the best of the researcher s knowledge no studies have been undertaken on the application of an mbbr system in the biodegradation and eventual removal of scas and vfas from ft wastewaters in addition information on the use of a semi continuous mbbr system seems to be sparse as compared with the continuous flow configuration specifically a bioremediation kinetic analysis of the compounds found in the synthetic ft wastewater will be conducted the biodegradation kinetics is a key factor in understanding the biodegradation process because other than being used to determine the rate of biodegradation reaction it provides a tool for exercising control over the biodegradation process 12 in essence biodegradation kinetics provides information on the concentration of the contaminant at a given time and allows the prediction of the level of the pollutants that is likely to be present in a future period to this end the current study builds on previous work carried out by researchers such as beccari et al 5 and majone et al 6 which failed to consider key biodegradation kinetics factors that allow the elucidation of the process for the biodegradation of organic contaminants occurring in ft effluent these factors include reactor size dilution factors and nutrient removal efficiency of the system adopted for the biodegradation process it is envisaged that such information will assist in determining the rate at which the targeted organic pollutants occurring in ft effluent are degraded and thus enhance development and implementation of the treatment technology that is being proposed in this research study 2 methods unless stated otherwise all the chemicals were supplied by sigma aldrich south africa 2 1 sample collection for inoculum enrichment sludge was collected from blesbokspriut wetland in johannesburg south

florida campus south africa and thereafter stored overnight at 4 c an aliquot of the sludge 1 0 ml was enriched in nutrient broth for 24 hours and used as inoculum for biodegradation studies 2 2

short chain alcohols scas was prepared by adding the compounds listed in table 1 to 1 l of the previously prepared msm containing the metal solution 2 4 determination of point of zero charge guezennec et al 15 has reported that biofilm formation is greatly affected by ph therefore point of zero charge pzc a ph depended parameter that describes the point at which the electrical charge density on a surface is zero was used to study biofilm formation 16 pzc relates to the phenomenon of adsorption and adhesion of materials when two materials suspended in a liquid need to be attached through adsorption or adhesion the ph of the liquid solution at which the two materials attract each other is determined by the pzc of the two materials 17 18 the pzc is usually measured using the ph drift method 17 18 to determine the pzc of the anoxkaldnes ab plastic biofilm carriers each of the four conical flasks were filled with 0 01 m nacl solution 50 ml using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl solutions the ph of the solutions in each of the flasks was adjusted to 2 7 6 0 8 0 and 10 7 respectively and recorded as initial ph after adjusting the ph 7 0 g anoxkaldnes ab plastic biofilm carriers diameter 1 cm height 0 7 cm were added to each flask the flasks were sealed with foil to avoid co2 contamination and thereafter placed in an incubator incoshake 353 supplied by labotech at 30 c and shaken at

anoxkaldnes ab plastic biofilm carriers 10 mm in diameter and 8 mm in height which were used for the attachment of microorganisms for the mbbr inoculum 7 ml previously grown in 100 ml of autoclaved nutrient broth was added to each of the flasks the flasks were shaken 100 rpm in an incubator 35 c incoshake 353 supplied by labotech until the biofilm was observed each of the two flasks were labelled as test and substrate control sc respectively and used for downstream studies 2 6 experimental set up in addition to the test and sc flasks two other controls namely i inoculum control ic and ii inoculum and substrate control isc were prepared as shown in table 2 to maintain the same conditions all flasks contained 7 0 g anoxkaldnestm carriers however the carriers in the test and sc already had biofilm the flasks prepared in triplicates were shaken 150 rpm in an incubator at 25 c a sample 2 ml was collected from each of the flasks every two days for cod analysis measurements of

values that span the range being measured for the duration of the entire study the flasks were operated on a fed batch semi continuous system whereby 17 5 ml solution was removed from each flask

inoculum to attach to the carriers the point of zero charge pzc of the carriers was determined using the ph drift method fig 1 illustrates the results obtained from the study the obtained pzc of 7 9 for the carriers see fig 1 suggests that for the carriers to have an electrical charge density of zero the solution they are suspended in ought to have a ph close to 7 9 which may be regarded as eco friendly as it is close to neutral maintaining a ph of 7 9 in the mbbr will ensure efficient biofilm formation which will result in efficient treatment of the ft wastewater adjusting ph and maintaining it at neutral levels aids in degradation since acidic conditions may have inhibitory effects on the organisms responsible for degradation of targeted pollutants 19 20 previous work indicates that the adhesion of bacillus sp which is the dominant species in the bioremediation of vfas and scas tends to decrease with an increase in ph 21 22 this is because the number of positive charges on the adhesion material decreases with increasing ph making the electrostatic attraction between the material and bacteria to decrease and thus resulting in poor adhesion 21 furthermore liu et al 21 have reported that adhesion of bacillus sp onto any material is better achieved at ph 4 5 8 0 which is within the pzc range of 7 9 obtained in this study nevertheless the pzc value of 7 9 is still very close to the threshold of ph 8 0 suggesting that careful attention needs to be paid so that the ph of the wastewater being treated does not exceed 8 0 other organisms that were identified in the study are from the class of β proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria proteobacteria prefer to live in biofilms and α β and γ proteobacteria are the most dominant bacteria found in biofilms forming in drinking water pipeline 23 α and β proteobacteria have been reported to be the most dominant genome in domestic showerheads 24 the widespread common occurrence of biofilm is supported by results emanating from this study whereby biofilm was observed within 14 days of experimental start up of an mbbr system on a broader perspective the majority of bacterial cells have a strongly negatively charged surface 25 therefore to create good forces of attraction the surface of the material on which bacteria attaches needs to be positively charged in accordance with a study by liu et al 21 the baseline ph of the mbbr was set at 4 5 and the upper limit was set at 7 9 in congruence with the pzc obtained in this study within the proposed ph range of 4 5 7 9 the carriers have a strong positive surface charge and bacteria has a strong negative charge resulting in strong attractive forces 15 the determination of pzc is an important aspect of bioremediation and biofilm studies since it assists in maintaining the correct ph for microbial adhesion maintaining a favourable ph environment in the mbbr will enhance efficient bacteria adherence onto the surface of the support 3 2 biofilm formation after shaking the flasks as described in section 2 5 for about a week biofilm was observed on the surface of the carriers where the colour of the carriers changed from white to yellowish and a layer of biofilm was observed on the inner part of the carriers as shown in fig 2 when adhered onto a surface the layer of bacteria is referred to as biofilm and this is one of the strategies that microorganisms use to form a biodegradation enhancing community biofilms can form on any type of material such as rubber plastic stainless steel copper and others the process of biofilm formation is influenced by environmental factors such as nutrients availability ph levels temperature moisture surface properties of the material to be attached to and most importantly time an established biofilm is distinguished by microbial cells and an extracellular polymeric substance eps matrix cells within a biofilm can communicate through quorum sensing qs and quorum quenching qq 26 27 these two mechanisms qs and qq are widely used during biological wastewater treatment because of the role they play in colonization biofilm formation bacterial aggregation and biotransformation of pollutants 27 the formation of biofilm in wastewater treatment facilities can assist in improving the treatment levels because when in the form of a biofilm bacteria can easily climatize to existing conditions such as high organic loads resulting in better treatment efficiency 28 results emanating from the current study suggest that the inoculum received enough nutrients and the environment ph and temperature was conducive to the formation of biofilm 3 3 cod reduction per hydraulic retention time cod can be defined as the amount of oxygen consumed during the oxidation of organic compounds during aerobic conditions according to isso 6060 cod is defined as the mass concentration of oxygen that is equivalent to the amount of dichromate consumed by dissolved and suspended matter when a water or sludge sample is treated with that oxidant under defined conditions 29 amongst other advantages cod has a shorter run time is more reliable and easier to operate making it the preferred choice of determining pollutant removal from wastewater 30 31 to determine the efficiency of the 3 4 days hydraulic retention time hrt experiments were carried out in triplicates and the average value of cod and the standard deviation were recorded the cod removal was calculated using equation 1 1 c o d r e m o v a l c o d i c o d f c o d i 100 where codi is the initial cod g l after adding fresh ft synthetic wastewater to the flasks and codf is the cod g l at the end of the hrt 3 4 days fig 3 illustrates the results obtained save for days 12 17 over 60 of cod was removed per retention time with the highest cod removal percentage 94 6 being achieved during days 54 57 these results suggest that the aerobic mbbr system can reduce the cod in ft synthetic wastewater furthermore although the microorganisms used in the study were isolated from a natural wetland they have the ability to adapt to different environments such as ft wastewater the lowest cod removal in the entire study was recorded during days 12 17 this could be as a result of variations in population dynamics of the organisms involved during bioremediation as well environmental perturbations mentioned by chidambara et al 11 it is well known that nutrient utilisation i e cod reduction is greatly affected by variations in microbial population and dynamics 32 in addition environmental factors such as ph temperature organic load and mixing may affect the microbial population in a system thus resulting in reduced pollutant removal efficiency 33 therefore the current system can be improved by introducing an additional treatment stage that can remove excess nutrients from the wastewater to make it suitable for discharge into water bodies by further lowering the cod to 75 mg l 34 35 to evaluate the effectiveness of the current mbbr a comparative analysis of codf values obtained in this study and permissible cod values for industries to discharge into south african municipal drainage systems was undertaken and plotted in fig 4 the cod readings show an oscillating behaviour which are ascribed to the onset of possible environmental perturbations when the flasks were left open these perturbations include the addition of foreign microorganisms in the system which could easily affect the efficiency of the system despite the organic load in the system having been kept constant 17 5 ml synthetic ft wastewater with 67 9 g l cod the cod removal was not constant and may have accounted for nutrient accumulation at some point a similar observation was made by chidambara et al 11 after studying the biodegradation of acetic benzoic and other organic acids in an open reactor except for day 25 the cod of the synthetic wastewater in the current study reduced to 1 g l following treatment of the synthetic wastewater at an hrt of 3 4 days the reduced cod value is close to the municipal limit of 0 5 g l fig 4 shows that there are periods when the effluent cod that is above the permissible municipal threshold of 0 5 g l was obtained e g 0 87 and 1 02 cod values were recorded for the days 14 18 and 24 31 respectively however this study has shown improved effluent cod levels as compared to previous studies done by majone et al 6 and beccari et al 5 who reported higher effluent concentrations of 2 4 g l and 6 5 g l respectively once again the need for the introduction of an additional treatment step in the wastewater treatment terrain to lower the cod further before discharging into municipal water systems or environmental water bodies cannot be over emphasised 3 4 kinetic studies kinetic studies were conducted using test flasks to determine the rate of disappearance of a selection of compounds present in the synthetic wastewater after adding 17 5 ml of fresh synthetic wastewater cod 67 9 g l to 700 ml msm see table 2 the cod was determined at 0 hours codi and various time intervals t since all the experiments were carried out in triplicate the mean cod value and standard deviation were calculated and reported as shown in table 3 as mentioned earlier cod removal percentage was calculated using equation 1 it was observed that 71 of the cod was removed during the first 9 hours thereafter the removal rate decreased significantly with remaining 22 4 being removed over a period of 90 hours this is ascribed to the difference in the ability of the microorganisms to degrade various compounds although vfas have been reported to be toxic to most microorganisms and are generally stubborn in nature a fairly respectable removal rate of 71 was achieved in the total cod of the ft synthetic wastewater the high removal rate of cod is attributed to the presence scas in the ft synthetic wastewater which are known to promote the degradation vfas 36 lindahl and co workers have demonstrated that the diffusion of acetic acid was 65 higher when alcohols were added to the media when compared to the control which had no alcohols 37 this is because cells that grow in a medium containing the two substrates vfas and alcohols tend to have a higher consumption rate of adenosine triphosphate atp which is induced by acetate and proton efflux as opposed to cells that are grown solely in acetic acid in the attempt to study biodegradation kinetics data from the first 9 hours of biodegradation i e the steepest point of the biodegradation plot were used for analysis the biodegradation first order and second order kinetic models were used to determine the best model to describe the data the first and second order kinetic models were expressed using equations 2 and 3 respectively 38 2 l n c k 1 t a 3 1 c k 2 t b where c is the concentration cod of the synthetic wastewater in the reaction vessel g l k1 and k2 are the biodegradation rate constants respectively h 1 t is time h 1 and a and b are model constants a plot of the logarithm of synthetic wastewater concentration vs time ln c v s t for first order and 1 c v s t for second order gives information on the rate of biodegradation where k is represented by the slope of the plot the data from table 3 was used to plot the first and second order biodegradation kinetic curves which are illustrated in fig 5 generally the appropriate model to describe kinetics of each system is determined based on the comparison of the square regression r2 value and the standard deviation 38 in this study the r2 values of 0 94 and 0 84 were obtained the first and second order kinetic models respectively the first order kinetic model correlated very strongly with the data since the r2 value was found to be the closest to 1 this implies that the experimental data is best described by the first order kinetic model it is recommended that future studies be done on the effect of experimental parameters such as temperature and substrate concentration on kinetic modelling 3 5 error analysis of kinetic studies in addition to determining the r2 value of the two models an error analysis was done to further differentiate between the models and thus emphasise the model that best describes the studied system three error functions that is root mean square rms sum of absolute errors eabs and average relative error are were applied as described by farahat el gendy 38 the data based on the error analysis is presented in table 4 the lower the value of the error analysis the better the correlation of the data to the model the presented data indicate that the data best fits the first order kinetic model which agrees with the r2 value obtained from the bioremediation kinetics 3 6 biodegradation half life times the biological half life refers to the time it takes for a compound to lose half of its amount and is calculated using equation 4 12 4 t 1 2 l n 2 k where t1 2 is the biological half life h and k is the rate constant h 1 using the rate constant k obtained from the first order kinetic model in figure 5a 0 1366 h 1 it was found that the half life time for the degradation of the compounds found in the synthetic wastewater is 5 07 h hrapovic rowe 39 have found the degradation of vfa to be very slow with anything between 140 and 180 days being reported a half life of 5 07 for a selection of organic compounds which is reported herein augurs and show great promise the degradation of scas and vfas especially in view of the fact that degradation of vfas has been considered to be a problematic research area these results imply that the use of an aerobic mbbr using the selected inoculum provides an alternative and viable option for the treatment ft wastewaters 4 conclusions efficient bioremediation of scas and vfas occurring in ft wastewater using an aerobic mbbr system was successfully demonstrated to achieve biofilm in the mbbr system the ph in the system should to be maintained at below 7 9 using an hrt of 3 4 days the system was able to remove up to 94 of the cod in the wastewater therefore the mbbr shows great potential for treating ft wastewater since the effluent from the system had a cod of less than 1 g l which is very close to the municipal cod permissible limit of 0 5 g l this technology can be accompanied by an additional treatment stage for polishing wastewater which would render the treated wastewater fit for discharge into municipal or environmental water systems kinetic modelling revealed that the removal of scas and vfas is best described by the first order biodegradation kinetic model and a half life time of about 5 h was obtained the fit of the biodegradation kinetic model to the first order kinetic was corroborated using model error analysis results generated herein indicates that a simple aerobic system can be used for the treatment of ft wastewater since the compounds occurring in this type of wastewater are readily biodegradable author s contribution the author carried out laboratory experiments and wrote the paper ethical approval this article does not contain any studies with human

13783,a system that represents a semi continuous aerobic moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr was used for the treatment of synthetic fischer tropsch ft wastewater contaminated with short chain alcohols scas and volatile fatty acids vfas the point of zero charge pzc of the carriers used in the mbbr system was found to occur at ph 7 9 the aerobic system for the treatment of ft synthetic wastewater was found to be efficient and it reduced the chemical oxygen demand cod by up to 93 4 at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 days the organic loading rate was kept constant at cod 67 9 g l biodegradation kinetics revealed that 71 of the cod was removed within 9 hours in addition the biodegradation of scas and vfas correlated well with the first order kinetic model and an r2 value of 0 94 and a rate constant of 0 137 h 1 were achieved the half life time of the scas and vfas was found to be 5 07 h given the stubborn nature of compounds found in the ft wastewater results emanating from this study augurs well for the biodegradation and treatment of ft wastewaters contaminated with organic compounds keywords biofilm bioremediation kinetics fischer tropsch wastewater moving bed biofilm reactor 1 introduction the fischer tropsch ft technology is a process for converting hydrogen and carbon monoxide into a range of products such as light hydrocarbons liquid petroleum gas lpg diesel naphta and wax 1 2 for every ton of synthetic crude oil produced from the ft process 1 1 1 3 tons of wastewater is generated which is the largest volume liquid product generated from any process 3 4 typical ft effluent wastewater is comprised of four types of organic pollutants namely short chain alcohols 76 7 cod volatile fatty acids 10 7 cod long chain alcohols 8 2 cod and hydrocarbons 4 5 cod 5 6 the current study investigated the biodegradation of volatile organic compounds vocs found in ft wastewater which is produced in enormous quantities as high as 300 m3 h and have a high organic strength of about 30 g l 4 6 when discharged into water bodies the untreated water has detrimental effects on the aquatic life due to high organic matter content and low ph therefore it is not feasible to dispose of untreated water into the environment 7 8 the low ph and high strength chemical oxygen demand cod wastewater inhibit the growth of useful microorganisms in water exposure to water contaminated with organic compounds pose serious risks to human animal and aquatic life when treated to acceptable cod levels the wastewater can be safely discharged into the environment or be reused as process water within the ft plant several approaches for the kinetic analysis of vocs include the macro and microkinetic approaches which relate to microbial growth rate and biodegradation rate of the organic compounds respectively 9 the current study focuses on the latter microkinetic approach which in this study involves an investigation of the rate of degradation of scas and vfas occurring in ft wastewater macro and microkinetic analyses have been conducted with vocs with a profile that is similar to that of compounds found in ft wastewater 9 13 the microkinetic approach was used to address the kinetics of biomass formation during the degradation of compounds such as vfas acetate propionate n butyrate 10 a similar approach was adopted by avalos et al 9 for the degradation of methanol and toluene both studies revealed that the rate of biomass formation depends on temperature microbial species involved during biodegradation and the chemical profile of the substrate the macrokinetics approach was not adopted for this because this study is aimed at promoting biofilm formation which enhances the biodegradation of compounds since most bacterial cells are capable of forming biofilms only a limited number of cells are typically suspended in the media and thus make it difficult to determine biomass formation very few researchers e g 11 12 14 have adopted the microkinetic approach to study degradation kinetics of vocs found in ft or similar wastewaters after studying the biodegradation kinetics of acetic acid and other compounds chidambara et al 11 revealed that the simpler compounds i e acetic acid are degraded first and thereafter followed by the more complex compounds similar results have also been reported by aguilar et al 14 following an investigation of the anaerobic degradation of acetic acid n butyric acid i butyric acid and propionic acid majone et al 6 did not consider the biodegradation kinetics of the compounds found in the ft wastewater when studying the bioremediation of ft wastewater but instead focused on the production of methane gas on the other hand beccari et al 5 focused exclusively on the degradation of acetic acid and propionic acid in ft wastewater thus leaving a huge knowledge gap on the degradation of other important compounds occurring in ft effluent similar to majone et al 6 and beccari et al 5 other previous studies on the treatment of ft and other types of wastewaters have not paid much attention to the rate of disappearance biodegradation kinetics of the compounds in the wastewater the current study is therefore aimed at developing an aerobic semi continuous moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr that can be used for the treatment of ft synthetic wastewater to the best of the researcher s knowledge no studies have been undertaken on the application of an mbbr system in the biodegradation and eventual removal of scas and vfas from ft wastewaters in addition information on the use of a semi continuous mbbr system seems to be sparse as compared with the continuous flow configuration specifically a bioremediation kinetic analysis of the compounds found in the synthetic ft wastewater will be conducted the biodegradation kinetics is a key factor in understanding the biodegradation process because other than being used to determine the rate of biodegradation reaction it provides a tool for exercising control over the biodegradation process 12 in essence biodegradation kinetics provides information on the concentration of the contaminant at a given time and allows the prediction of the level of the pollutants that is likely to be present in a future period to this end the current study builds on previous work carried out by researchers such as beccari et al 5 and majone et al 6 which failed to consider key biodegradation kinetics factors that allow the elucidation of the process for the biodegradation of organic contaminants occurring in ft effluent these factors include reactor size dilution factors and nutrient removal efficiency of the system adopted for the biodegradation process it is envisaged that such information will assist in determining the rate at which the targeted organic pollutants occurring in ft effluent are degraded and thus enhance development and implementation of the treatment technology that is being proposed in this research study 2 methods unless stated otherwise all the chemicals were supplied by sigma aldrich south africa 2 1 sample collection for inoculum enrichment sludge was collected from blesbokspriut wetland in johannesburg south africa 26 35 59 5 s 28 17 23 9 e using sterile 500 ml schott duran bottles the samples were transported in a cooler box with ice packs to the laboratories of the university of south africa unisa florida campus south africa and thereafter stored overnight at 4 c an aliquot of the sludge 1 0 ml was enriched in nutrient broth for 24 hours and used as inoculum for biodegradation studies 2 2

solution mixture was diluted to 4 1 l using distilled water and used for downstream studies 2 3 preparation of synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewater comprising of volatile fatty acids vfas and short chain alcohols scas was prepared by adding the compounds listed in table 1 to 1 l of the previously prepared msm containing the metal solution 2 4 determination of point of zero charge guezennec et al 15 has reported that biofilm formation is greatly affected by ph therefore point of zero charge pzc a ph depended parameter that describes the point at which the electrical charge density on a surface is zero was used to study biofilm formation 16 pzc relates to the phenomenon of adsorption and adhesion of materials when two materials suspended in a liquid need to be attached through adsorption or adhesion the ph of the liquid solution at which the two materials attract each other is determined by the pzc of the two materials 17 18 the pzc is usually measured using the ph drift method 17 18 to determine the pzc of the anoxkaldnes ab plastic biofilm carriers each of the four conical flasks were filled with 0 01 m nacl solution 50 ml using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl solutions the ph of the solutions in each of the flasks was adjusted to 2 7 6 0 8 0 and 10 7 respectively and recorded as initial ph after adjusting the ph 7 0 g anoxkaldnes ab plastic biofilm carriers diameter 1 cm height 0 7 cm were added to each flask the flasks were sealed with foil to avoid co2 contamination and thereafter placed in an incubator incoshake 353 supplied by labotech at 30 c and shaken at 100 rpm after 48 h the final ph of the contents of each flask was recorded the results were used to produce the plot of p h i n i t i a l v s p h f i n a l the point of intersection between p h i n i

anoxkaldnes ab plastic biofilm carriers 10 mm in diameter and 8 mm in height which were used for the attachment of microorganisms for the mbbr inoculum 7 ml previously grown in 100 ml of autoclaved nutrient broth was added to each of the flasks the flasks were shaken 100 rpm in an incubator 35 c incoshake 353 supplied by labotech until the biofilm was observed each of the two flasks were labelled as test and substrate control sc respectively and used for downstream studies 2 6 experimental set up in addition to the test and sc flasks two other controls namely i inoculum control ic and ii inoculum and substrate control isc were prepared as shown in table 2 to maintain the same conditions all flasks contained 7 0 g anoxkaldnestm carriers however the carriers in the test and sc already had biofilm the flasks prepared in triplicates were shaken 150 rpm in an incubator at 25 c a sample 2 ml was collected from each of the flasks every two days for cod analysis measurements of ph were taken by immersing the ph electrode into each flask until a steady reading was reached prior to using the ph meter the ph electrode was calibrated with standard buffer solutions with known ph values that span the range being measured for the duration of the entire study the flasks were operated on a fed batch semi continuous system whereby 17 5 ml solution was removed from each flask

kinetic studies kinetic studies were conducted using test flasks to determine the rate of disappearance of a selection of compounds present in the synthetic wastewater after adding 17 5 ml of fresh synthetic wastewater cod 67 9 g l to 700 ml msm see table 2 the cod was determined at 0 hours codi and various time intervals t since all the experiments were carried out in triplicate the mean cod value and standard deviation were calculated and reported as shown in table 3 as mentioned earlier cod removal percentage was calculated using equation 1 it was observed that 71 of the cod was removed during the first 9 hours thereafter the removal rate decreased significantly with remaining 22 4 being removed over a period of 90 hours this is ascribed to the difference in the ability of the microorganisms to degrade various compounds although vfas have been reported to be toxic to most microorganisms and are generally stubborn in nature a fairly respectable removal rate of 71 was achieved in the total cod of the ft synthetic wastewater the high removal rate of cod is attributed to the presence scas in the ft synthetic wastewater which are known to promote the degradation vfas 36 lindahl and co workers have demonstrated that the diffusion of acetic acid was 65 higher when alcohols were added to the media when compared to the control which had no alcohols 37 this is because cells that grow in a medium containing the two substrates vfas and alcohols tend to have a higher consumption rate of adenosine triphosphate atp which is induced by acetate and proton efflux as opposed to cells that are grown solely in acetic acid in the attempt to study biodegradation kinetics data from the first 9 hours of biodegradation i e the steepest point of the biodegradation plot were used for analysis the biodegradation first order and second order kinetic models were used to determine the best model to describe the data the first and second order kinetic models were expressed using equations 2 and 3 respectively 38 2 l n c k 1 t a 3 1 c k 2 t b where c is the concentration cod of the synthetic wastewater in the reaction vessel g l k1 and k2 are the biodegradation rate constants respectively h 1 t is time h 1 and a and b are model constants a plot of the logarithm of synthetic wastewater concentration vs time ln c v s t for first order and 1 c v s t for second order gives information on the rate of biodegradation where k is represented by the slope of the plot the data from table 3 was used to plot the first and second order biodegradation kinetic curves which are illustrated in fig 5 generally the appropriate model to describe kinetics of each system is determined based on the comparison of the square regression r2 value and the standard deviation 38 in this study the r2 values of 0 94 and 0 84 were obtained the first and second order kinetic models respectively the first order kinetic model correlated very strongly with the data since the r2 value was found to be the closest to 1 this implies that the experimental data is best described by the first order kinetic model it is recommended that future studies be done on the effect of experimental parameters such as temperature and substrate concentration on kinetic modelling 3 5 error analysis of kinetic studies in addition to determining the r2 value of the two models an error analysis was done to further differentiate between the models and thus emphasise the model that best describes the studied system three error functions that is root mean square rms sum of absolute errors eabs and average relative error are were applied as described by farahat el gendy 38 the data based on the error analysis is presented in table 4 the lower the value of the error analysis the better the correlation of the data to the model the presented data indicate that the data best fits the first order kinetic model which agrees with the r2 value obtained from the bioremediation kinetics 3 6 biodegradation half life times the biological half life refers to the time it takes for a compound to lose half of its amount and is calculated using equation 4 12 4 t 1 2 l n 2 k where t1 2 is the biological half life h and k is the rate constant h 1 using the rate constant k obtained from the first order kinetic model in figure 5a 0 1366 h 1 it was found that the half life time for the degradation of the compounds found in the synthetic wastewater is 5 07 h hrapovic rowe 39 have found the degradation of vfa to be very slow with anything between 140 and 180 days being reported a half life of 5 07 for a selection of organic compounds which is reported herein augurs and show great promise the degradation of scas and vfas especially in view of the fact that degradation of vfas has been considered to be a problematic research area these results imply that the use of an aerobic mbbr using the selected inoculum provides an alternative and viable option for the treatment ft wastewaters 4 conclusions efficient bioremediation of scas and vfas occurring in ft wastewater using an aerobic mbbr system was successfully demonstrated to achieve biofilm in the mbbr system the ph in the system should to be maintained at below 7 9 using an hrt of 3 4 days the system was able to remove up to 94 of the cod in the wastewater therefore the mbbr shows great potential for treating ft wastewater since the effluent from the system had a cod of less than 1 g l which is very close to the municipal cod permissible limit of 0 5 g l this technology can be accompanied by an additional treatment stage for polishing wastewater which would render the treated wastewater fit for discharge into municipal or environmental water systems kinetic modelling revealed that the removal of scas and vfas is best described by the first order biodegradation kinetic model and a half life time of about 5 h was obtained the fit of the biodegradation kinetic model to the first order kinetic was corroborated using model error analysis results generated herein indicates that a simple aerobic system can be used for the treatment of ft wastewater since the compounds occurring in this type of wastewater are readily biodegradable author s contribution the author carried out laboratory experiments and wrote the paper ethical approval this article does not contain any studies with human

distribution systems dwds understanding the effects of interspecific interactions on biofilm formation potential and chlorine resistance could improve future disinfection strategies and prevent the spread of infectious water borne diseases the present study first investigated biofilm formation of 10 bacterial groups with two mixed bacterial strains isolated from a simulated dwds over different incubation times 24 h 48 h and 72 h and then evaluated chlorine resistance of the 72 h incubated biofilms under residual 0 3 0 6 1 2 4 and 10 mg l chlorine concentrations the acidovorax acinetobacter sphingomonas bacillus sphingomonas acidovorax and acidovorax microbacterium groups exhibited high biofilm formation potential which could be attributed to synergism interactions the acinetobacter microbacterium sphingomonas microbacterium and sphingomonas acinetobacter groups exhibited weak or moderate biofilm formation potential which could be attributed to competition interactions the acidovorax bacillus bacillus acinetobacter and bacillus microbacterium groups exhibited moderate biofilm formation potential which could be attributed to the neutralism interactions the chlorine resistance of most of the dual species biofilms associated with sphingomonas sp and bacillus cereus was higher than those of the corresponding single species biofilms considering the interspecific interactions between the microbacterium laevaniforms and four other species were mainly either neutralism or competition interactions the chlorine resistance of the group associated with m laevaniforms could be inhibited to some extent the specific structures e g extracellular polymeric substances and spores of dual species biofilm had a greater influence on chlorine resistance than interspecific interactions there were diverse interspecific interactions synergism could promote chlorine resistance in dual species biofilm neutralism had minimal effect on the chlorine resistance while competition could reduce the chlorine resistance and the reduction in chlorine resistance could be mitigated if there were specific morphological structures in the biofilm such as spores keywords biofilm drinking water distribution systems dual species chlorine resistance interspecific interactions 1 introduction characterizing microbial communities and ensuring the microbiological safety of drinking water is a major public health challenge in drinking water distribution systems dwds microorganisms can occur in the bulk water planktonic bacteria and along pipe walls loose deposits and biofilm bacteria 1 most of the bacterial biomass is present in biofilms in which active bacteria account for about 95 of all bacteria 2 biofilms formed in dwds can consume disinfectant and increase the bacterial resistance to disinfection resulting in bacterial regrowth leading to color turbidity odor and corrosion problems higher pathogen concentrations and outbreaks of water borne diseases 2 3 generally the disinfection strategies for drinking water are based on disinfecting bulk water samples however this is an insufficient basis to inhibit the microbial contamination caused by biofilms in a dwds 4 given that microorganisms in a biofilm will resuspend into the bulk water 5 an effective strategy for monitoring and controlling biofilm development in dwds is highly desirable thanks to widely used high throughput genetic sequencing the microbial diversity of biofilms in dwds has been revealed the phyla associated with the proteobacteria α β and γ proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes are ubiquitous in dwds and the genera sphingomonas pseudomonas acidovorax brevundimonas acinetobacter methylobacterium microbacterium and bacillus also are ubiquitous in dwds 6 10 some microorganisms can be pathogens or opportunistic pathogens such as legionella spp pseudomonas aeruginosa acinetobacter baumannii and bacillus sp among others 11 12 these microorganisms directly cause a risk of water borne infectious diseases to users of a dwds unless the microbes are removed by the water purification process disinfected or inactivated 2 11 in fact even if advanced water treatment technology is adopted the risk of microbial disease in drinking water cannot be ignored such microbial communities can survive extreme conditions such as oligotrophic environments and in dwds with high chlorine residual concentrations 13 complex interactions occur among species in microbial communities some of which are beneficial to one or all interacting groups and some of which are deleterious or have no influence on either groups 14 the interactions between bacterial species may have profound impacts on the initial stages of biofilm formation and growth 5 resident microorganisms interact with each other in either synergistic neutralist or competitive manners which affect biofilm biomass functionality and resistance when compared with single species biofilms 15 18 because of such positive negative or negligible effects the microbial communities in dwds could maintain ecological equilibria 14 19 in an actual dwds the biofilms are usually consisted of complex communities 20 these mixed biofilms communities could exist as dual complexes although various complexity existed between dual species biofilms and multi species biofilms in the actual dwds a variety of complex relationships involving interspecies and intraspecies interactions exhibited in above biofilms 18 21 in addition the mechanism of multi species biofilm formation remain unclear 17 19 21 dual species biofilms could be considered to represent simplified multi species interactions and could be used to study how interspecific interactions influence biofilm formation 15 16 18 19 21 it has been reported that dual species biofilms acinetobacter sp and pseudomonas putida could be more stable and have greater biomass than single species biofilms due to the interactions between species 16 however there are numerous competitive interactions that result in decreased biofilm productivity for all or some interacting members dai et al 18 reported that the presence of stenotrophomonas maltophilia inhibited escherichia coli biofilm formation and it had significantly 65 95 lower biomass than pure e coli biofilm cultures consequently competition could be exploited as a biological control strategy in dwds by inhibiting the growth of some pathogenic microorganisms based on the growth attributes of some non pathogenic microorganisms 22 23 in addition there could be keystone microbes in dwds whose presence or absence could alter the population density or diversity in dwds significantly some studies on microbial ecology in dwds have found that microbial community diversity and interspecific interactions also influence microbial resistance to disinfectants 6 24 26 simoes et al 25 reported that dual species biofilms of bacillus cereus and pseudomonas fluorescens were more resistant to antimicrobials than corresponding single species biofilms nevertheless inconsistent findings have been reported for example lindsay et al 26 observed that b cereus increased the sensitivity of mixed biofilm of p fluorescens and b cereus to disinfectants such as chlorine dioxide the results suggest that the interspecific interactions vary which could affect resistance to disinfectants therefore there is a growing need to investigate the impact of interspecies interactions on the biofilm formation and their architecture 27 28 in addition some researchers have proposed that the microbial niche in dwds could be used to control some pathogenic bacteria via competition and antagonistic interactions 22 29 therefore studying the interactions among different microbial strains in dwds biofilms could facilitate the understanding of the persistence of microorganisms including pathogens and could facilitate the development of novel approaches of controlling opportunistic pathogens in dwds 22 the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of interspecific interactions on biofilm formation potential and evaluate chlorine resistance of dual species biofilm in dwds five bacterial strains used in the present study were isolated from a previous simulated dwds 30 five bacterial strains were divided into 10 groups with two mixed species the dual species biofilm formation was investigated at different incubation times 24 h 48 h and 72 h generally biofilm formation could reach a relatively stable state after 72 h inoculation in microtiter plates 16 20 31 the 72 h incubated dual species biofilms were treated with different residual chlorine concentrations 0 3 0 6 1 2 4 and 10 mg l and the chlorine resistance of different dual species biofilms analyzed and compared furthermore the effects of interspecific interactions on biofilm formation potential and chlorine resistance were compared biofilm studies in situ are not common due to the complex systems in the dwds and difficult accessibility 20 consequently the in vitro biofilm formation assays performed in 96 well microtiter plates are common in biofilm studies 16 20 as there is still in an early phase in the study of dual species biofilms of bacteria found in dwds the results of the present study could provide valuable insights on the ability of these microorganisms to interact with each other in initial biofilm formation and chlorine resistance 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains five bacterial strains were isolated from a previous simulated dwds with cast iron and 304 stainless steel materials and the biofilms incubated for 3 months at 1 mg l 3 mg l and 4 2 mg l residual chlorine concentration 30 those bacterial strains were chosen for being representative of drinking water bacteria due to their ability to form complex biofilms table s1 summarizes the basic information about the five tested bacterial strains sphingomonas sp acidovorax defluvii acinetobacter sp bacillus cereus and microbacterium laevaniformans the bacteria affiliated with proteobacteria were gram negative g while the bacteria affiliated with firmicutes and actinobacteridae were gram positive g all sequences of tested bacterial strains were deposited in genbank of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi under accession numbers mt279967 to mt279971 all bacteria were rod shaped and differed only in morphology short long straight and irregular 2 2 biofilm formation microtiter plates are the most commonly used in vitro assays for studying biofilm formation including dwds microorganisms under strict laboratory conditions 20 32 despite their shortcomings in reproducing the conditions found in dwds i e hydrodynamic polystyrene microplates are frequently used as standard bioreactor systems to study adhesion and biofilm formation of bacteria isolated from dwds 20 32 33 biofilm formation was conducted using the microtiter plate method 20

potential the biofilm formation potential is mainly determined based on the od570 value of the biofilm biomass the determination method described by stepanovic et al 34 was used as follows the 3 fold standard deviation 3sd greater than the average od570 value of the negative control was defined as the cut off value odc based on the critical value of odc the biofilm formation potential was divided

g a t i v e c o n t r o l 100 chick watson model c w model is the most cited and classical model 43 according to this model the inactivation is directly proportional to the concentration of bacteria as a first order reaction further the general expression for this model is expressed as below 44 2 log10 nt n 0 kcn t where n 0 is the number of microorganisms at time t 0 nt is the number of vital microorganisms at time t k is the rate constant for the inactivation of a particular microorganism c is the concentration of a disinfectant t is the contact time n is the fitting parameter for non first order behavior in many cases n is equal to 1 and therefore the inactivation of the corresponding microorganisms is a first order process for a specific biofilm chlorination treatment group the chlorine concentration can be considered constant during the chlorination period of 1 h consequently cnt ct constant 44 therefore the chick watson kinetic can be derived as 3 k log10 nt n 0 ct where k is the inactivation rate constant for the inactivation of the 10 groups of dual species bacteria the lower inactivation rate constant k illustrates the higher resistance to disinfection 45 the biofilm biomass reduction and biofilm activity reduction were defined as 100 when the absorbance was less than that of the negative control the inactivation of a biofilm was expressed as the base 10 logarithm of bacterial count of the positive control log10 n 0 when its bacterial count was lower than the detection limit of the r2a plate count 5 cfu ml 2 7 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was applied by the method described by vaz moreira 46 and modified data of biofilm biomass biofilm activity and hpc r2a over different incubation time were compared using analysis of variance anova and a post hoc tukey test the relationship between biofilm biomass and hpc r2a in 72 h incubated biofilms was assessed based on a pearson correlation analysis statistical calculations were based on a confidence level 95 assuming a significance level for the separation set at p 0 05 these analysis were supported by spss software 16 0 for windows 3 results and discussion 3 1 biofilm biomass and biofilm formation potential of dual species fig 1 presents the biofilm biomass of mixed species 10 groups incubated for 24 h 48 h and 72 h as illustrated in fig 1 incubation time influenced the

gradually with an increase in incubation time in addition the biofilm formation potential of the other six groups increased gradually with an increase in incubation time 3 2 specific respiratory activity of dual species biofilm according to the results fig s1 biofilm activity od490 determined using the xtt menadione method was limited due to low values low discrimination ability and large errors and therefore in the present study dual species biofilm activity was described as the specific respiratory activity of biofilm using od490 570 od490 od570 fig 2 illustrates the specific respiratory activity of dual species biofilm incubated for 24 h 48 h and 72 h according to fig 2 incubation time influenced the specific respiratory activity of acidovorax acinetobacter acidovorax

respiratory activity of bacillus acinetobacter group at 24 h was significantly p 0 05 higher than the specific respiratory activity at 48 h and 72 h although there was no significant p 0 05 difference in specific respiratory activity between 48 h and 72 h excluding sphingomonas acinetobacter and sphingomonas microbacterium groups which had the highest specific respiratory activity at 48 h and the lowest at 24 h all other eight groups had the highest specific respiratory activity at 24 h among the eight groups above the specific respiratory activity of group acidovorax microbacterium decreased first and then increased with an increase in incubation time while that of other seven groups gradually decreased with an increase in incubation time in the initial stages 24 h there were significant differences in specific respiratory activity among all 10 groups p 0 05 while there were no significant differences among the 10 groups p 0 05 with an increase in incubation time in the later stages

microbacterium group 3 3 bacteria counts of dual species biofilm bacterial biofilm was incubated for 72 h in the present study due to the high workload associated with plate counting fig 3 shows the hpc of dual species biofilm incubated for 72 h as illustrated in fig 3 the hpc of the acidovorax acinetobacter group was 8 04 106 cfu cm2 which was significantly p 0 05 higher than those of the other nine groups conversely the hpc of the sphingomonas bacillus sphingomonas acidovorax bacillus acinetobacter and sphingomonas acinetobacter groups was 3 5 106 cfu cm2 6 2 106 cfu cm2 which were significantly p 0 05 higher than those of five other groups the hpcs of all the other five groups were less than 2 106 cfu cm2 among them the hpc of the acidovorax acinetobacter group with the greatest being about 40 fold that of the acidovorax microbacterium group which had the lowest hpc based on the results of further analysis the biofilm biomass and the bacteria counts of dual species biofilm exhibited a significantly moderate positive correlation r 0 57 p 0 001 a particular experimental group under the same treatments and incubation conditions was performed while different triplicate samples and measurement methods were taken consequently significantly moderate positive correlation results with little difference were also convincing similar findings for dual species biofilm in the dwds were reported 16 17 20 3 4 interspecific interactions analysis the co occurrence of competition and synergism has been elucidated in dwds from a microbial ecology perspective in numerous studies 14 18 dual species biofilms acinetobacter sp and pseudomonas putida could be more stable and have greater biomass when compared to the corresponding single species biofilms due to the interactions between species 16 similarly laganenka et al 47 demonstrated that the cell counts of a dual species e coli and enterococcus faecalis biofilm were significantly higher when compared to those of corresponding single species biofilms however high competition could lead to decreased biofilm productivity for all or some of the interacting species makovcova et al 17 observed that total biomass volume in staphylococcus aureus and a gram negative bacteria decreased in dual species biofilms excluding in a co culture of s aureus and e coli after 24 h when compared to s aureus single species biofilms numerous drinking water bacteria acidovorax spp sphingomonas spp pseudomonas spp bacillus spp acinetobacter spp flavobacterium spp stenotrophomonas maltophilia aeromonas hydrophila and burkholderia cepacia have been reported to have the capacity to produce bacteriocin or bacteriocin like substances to inhibit the growth of legionella pneumophila 22 48 49 the microorganisms in the dwds biofilm could adapt to the environment through the uneven distribution and interactions in microbial communities 18 33 nutrient competition is one of the major drivers of species evolution in the microbial world 14 some microorganisms could outcompete other microbes more effectively due to a superior capacity to exploit some nutrients 5 14 in general when the biomass or hpc of dual species biofilm are greater than the sum of two single species biofilms under similar incubation conditions it can be considered synergism while when the biomass or hpc is equivalent it can be considered neutralism and when it is less than the sum it can be considered competition 14 19 37 as illustrated in figs 1 and 3 in 10 groups of dual species biofilm both the biomass and the hpcs of the acidovorax acinetobacter sphingomonas bacillus and sphingomonas acidovorax groups were adequately large at 4 8 fold the sum of two single species biofilms and was therefore considered synergism the biomass and the hpc of the acidovorax microbacterium group were twice the sum of two single species biofilms and therefore was also considered synergism the biomass and the hpcs of the acinetobacter microbacterium were lower than the sum of the two single species biofilms consequently the case was also considered competition the biomass of sphingomonas microbacterium and sphingomonas acinetobacter groups was slightly higher than the sum obtained following incubation for 24 h and less than the sum obtained following incubation for 48 h and 72 h the observations suggest neutralism at the initial stage followed by competition the biomass and the hpc of the acidovorax bacillus bacillus acinetobacter and bacillus microbacterium groups were equivalent with their sum and they interactions were therefore considered neutralism with regard to the biofilm activity and the specific respiratory activity as illustrated in fig 2 the activity in the 10 groups was basically lower than those of the corresponding single species or their sums therefore biofilm activity and the specific respiratory activity could not elucidate the interspecific interactions in addition fig 4 illustrated the sem images of biofilm spatial structure and interactions at 72 h incubation the acidovorax acinetobacter sphingomonas bacillus sphingomonas acidovorax and acidovorax microbacterium groups exhibited synergism interactions which evidenced cell to cell connections using fibril like structures white tips fig 4 ⅰ ⅲ ⅶ ⅸ 17 among these four groups the sphingomonas bacillus group formed strongly adherent and compact biofilms which cells were embedded in a large amount of possible eps red arrows fig 4 ⅸ 17 the acidovorax acinetobacter group formed significantly thick cell aggregates across the surface which was also observed amorphous matrix red arrows fig 4 ⅰ the sphingomonas acidovorax group have relatively homogeneous aggregation biofilm propensity which cells was embedded in an amorphous matrix possibly eps red arrows fig 4 ⅶ the acidovorax microbacterium group possessed high aggregation propensity fig 4 ⅲ the acinetobacter microbacterium sphingomonas microbacterium sphingomonas acinetobacter and bacillus microbacterium groups all developed weak loose biofilms fig 4 ⅳ ⅵ ⅷ ⅹ the bacillus acinetobacter group possessed moderate aggregation propensity fig 4 ⅴ the acidovorax bacillus group formed large cell density homogeneous monolayer biofilm which was also observed fibril like structures white tips fig 4 ⅱ the acidovorax bacillus group could exhibit synergism in an iron matrix or materials 50 considering bacillus sp is an iron reducing bacterium while the acidovorax sp is an iron oxidizing bacteria 50 51 considering the lack of an iron compound in the culture matrix and materials the acidovorax bacillus group did not exhibit any interspecific synergism in the present study and exhibited a neutral relationship because of complex webs of interactions multiple or dual species biofilm interactions are frequently influenced by their environments such as nutrient conditions incubation time hydraulic conditions biofilm structure and spatial location 14 18 24 3 5 biofilm biomass reduction in dual species chlorination experiments were carried out for 60 min at different residual chlorine 0 3 mg l 0 6 mg l 1 mg l 2 mg l 4 mg l and 10 mg l concentrations in the present study table 1 lists the initial biofilm biomass and hpc of dual species 10 groups before disinfection fig 5 presents the removal rate of biofilm biomass of 10 groups at different residual chlorine concentrations according to fig 5 the removal rate of biofilm biomass of 10 groups was significantly p 0 05 affected by all the residual chlorine concentrations excluding 1 mg l among the 10 groups studied sphingomonas acinetobacter group exhibited the highest chlorine resistance at 0 3 mg l residual chlorine when residual chlorine was increased to 0 6 mg l or higher sphingomonas bacillus exhibited the highest chlorine resistance comparably sphingomonas acinetobacter group was the most sensitive at 1 mg l while acinetobacter microbacterium group was the most sensitive at other residual chlorine concentrations compared to the findings our previous study in submission the chlorine resistance levels of most of dual species biofilms were higher than those of single species biofilms at low residual chlorine concentrations less than 0 6 mg l the chlorine resistance levels of dual species biofilms associated with acinetobacter sp and acidovorax defluvii were higher than those of the single species biofilms at relatively high residual chlorine concentrations 1 mg l or higher the sphingomonas associated with bacillus had a higher level of chlorine resistance while three other single species biofilms associated with bacillus had lower chlorine resistance levels when compared to the findings our previous study on single species biofilms in submission the chlorine resistance levels of most dual species biofilms associated with sphingomonas sp were higher than those of the single species biofilms among 10 groups excluding acidovorax acinetobacter and sphingomonas bacillus groups the removal rates of biofilm biomass of the other eight groups were not influenced significantly p 0 05 by residual chlorine concentrations 2 mg l or higher in addition the removal rates of biofilm biomass of sphingomonas bacillus were significantly p 0 05 different at residual chlorine concentrations of 4 mg l and 10 mg l similarly the removal rates of biofilm biomass of the acidovorax acinetobacter group was significantly p 0 05 different at residual chlorine concentrations of 2 mg l and 4 mg l in general the order of chlorine resistance of 10 groups was sphingomonas bacillus group sphingomonas acidovorax group sphingomonas acinetobacter group sphingomonas microbacterium group bacillus acinetobacter group bacillus microbacterium group acidovorax acinetobacter group acidovorax bacillus group acidovorax microbacterium group acinetobacter microbacterium group based on the results of further analysis the biofilm biomass reductions and the biofilm biomass of dual species exhibited a significantly moderate positive correlation r 0 59 p 0 001 only at a residual chlorine concentration of 0 3 mg l while there were no significant p 0 05 correlations at other residual chlorine concentrations based on the results of our previous study in submission due to the low biofilm activity determined using the xtt menadione method the assessment of inhibition rate of biofilm activity of the chlorination experiments using the xtt menadione method is not recommended 3 6 inactivation of dual species biofilm the inactivation rate constants of dual species biofilm for 60 min were investigated under different residual chlorine concentrations in the present study table 1 lists the initial hpcs of dual species biofilm 10 groups before disinfection fig 6 illustrates the inactivation rate constants of biofilm biomass in the 10 groups at different residual chlorine concentrations as presented in fig 6 and table 1 the biofilm biomass inactivation rate constant in sphingomonas bacillus group was somewhat higher than that of the sphingomonas acidovorax group at a residual chlorine concentration of 0 6 mg l which were 0 00861 min 1 and 0 00834 min 1 respectively while that of sphingomonas bacillus group was the lowest 0 00271 0 0137 min 1 at other residual chlorine concentrations the acinetobacter microbacterium group had the highest inactivation rate constant of biofilm biomass at residual chlorine concentrations of 0 6 mg l 1 mg l and 10 mg l which were 0 0274 min 1 0 0201 min 1 and 0 00575 min 1 respectively in addition the acidovorax acinetobacter group had the highest inactivation rate constant of biofilm biomass at residual chlorine concentrations of 2 mg l and 4 mg l which were 0 0167 min 1 and 0 0122 min 1 respectively at low residual chlorine concentrations 0 3 mg l the acidovorax bacillus group had the highest inactivation rate constant of biofilm biomass 0 0357 min 1 similar to the results obtained using the crystal violet cv method the chlorine resistance levels of dual species biofilms associated with acinetobacter sp all increased when compared to that of acinetobacter sp as single species biofilm at different residual chlorine concentrations in addition the chlorine resistance levels of most dual species biofilms associated with m laevaniforms and a defluvii were higher than those of the corresponding single species biofilms while the chlorine resistance of most of the dual species biofilms associated with b cereus and sphingomonas sp were lower than those of the corresponding single species biofilms the inactivation rate constant of 10 groups increased mainly with an increase in residual chlorine concentrations different from the results based on the cv method the inactivation rate constant of biofilm biomass based on the plate counting method hpc r2a was significantly p 0 05 different at high residual chlorine concentrations of 2 mg l or higher similar to the results by cv method the order of chlorine resistance of 10 groups was sphingomonas bacillus group acidovorax bacillus group sphingomonas acidovorax group sphingomonas microbacterium group sphingomonas acinetobacter group bacillus microbacterium group bacillus acinetobacter group acidovorax microbacterium group acidovorax acinetobacter group acinetobacter microbacterium group 3 7 eps and spore counts of dual species biofilm eem spectra are used to identify fluorescent compounds present in eps as a rapid and sensitive technique eem fluorescence spectroscopy is a useful tool for studying the physicochemical properties of eps which fluorescence characteristics are greatly related to their structure and functional groups in molecules 52 fig 7 illustrates eem spectra of eps extracted from 10 group of dual species biofilm before and after disinfection according to fig 7 the main regions were allocated to aromatic proteins ex 250 nm em 380 nm and soluble microbial products ex 250 340 nm em 380 nm 53 similarly many researchers demonstrated that the two peaks assigned to aromatic proteins and soluble microbial products are major fluorescent compounds presented in eps extracted from the early stage 1 36 days biofilms 54 56 as presented in fig 7 among the 10 groups of dual species biofilms before disinfection the sphingomonas bacillus and sphingomonas acidovorax groups exhibited higher spectral fluorescence intensity red fluorescence region both in two above peaks than that of eight other groups which might mean that the two groups of biofilms produced higher amount of eps 56 the eem spectra of eps were declined remarkably after disinfection and damaged cells exhibited rough and shrunken appearance and deformation or cellular debris in the 10 groups after disinfection figure s2 according to the results the eps excretions of the dual species biofilms of synergism with sphingomonas sp were higher than that of other dual species biofilms the interspecific interactions biomass eps excretion thickness and compactness of biofilms were all correlated with the chlorine resistance of dual species biofilms figs 1 3 4 and 6 synergism could tend to be a denser and thicker biofilm more eps excretion which would limit diffusion of disinfectants through the biofilm matrix consequently synergism of dual species biofilms was often accompanied by high chlorine resistance 57 to better understand the some specific structural mechanism of chlorine resistance the vegetative cell counts and spore counts of 10 groups of dual species biofilm before and after disinfection were determined fig 8 spores can withstand the effects of disinfectants owing principally to the cumulative effect of spores in respect of their structure chemistry and biochemistry 63 64 as presented in figs 8 and s2 red circle the spores were only present in the dual species biofilm associated with bacillus the spore counts of dual species biofilm associated with bacillus were less than 472 cfu cm2 before disinfection and the proportion of spores was low 0 012 while spore counts increased significantly and was larger than 7244 cfu cm2 after disinfection and the proportion of spores was 38 07 70 2 among them the sphingomonas bacillus group had the most spores 3 05 105 cfu cm2 but had the lowest proportion 38 07 the bacillus microbacterium group had the least spores 3 05 105 cfu cm2 but had the highest proportion 70 2 this means that in the bacillus microbacterium group bacillus cereus contributed significantly to chlorine resistance in the acidovorax bacillus and bacillus acinetobacter groups bacillus cereus also contributed more than 50 to chlorine resistance 3 8 effects of interspecific interactions on biofilm formation potential and chlorine resistance the present study also examined the chlorine resistance of 10 groups of dual species biofilm according to the results the interspecific interactions between m laevaniforms and four other species were largely neutralism or competition consequently chlorine resistance of the groups associated with m laevaniforms could be inhibited to some extent based on the observations of our previous study in submission b cereus and sphingomonas sp exhibited high chlorine resistance in single species biofilm and they maintained a high competitive advantage under chlorine stress in the environment gomes et al 58 observed that the disinfection 2 v v tego 2000 resistance of an e coli and pantoea agglomerans dual species biofilm was significantly higher than in the corresponding single species biofilm in addition kocot et al 29 demonstrated that a p aeruginosa atcc 27853 and s aureus fi 2 dual species biofilm was more resistant to chlorine based disinfectants than the corresponding single species biofilms however other studies have reported different results behnke et al 59 found that the chlorine resistance of a burkholderia cepacia and p aeruginosa mixed incubation in chemostat was significantly lower than that in the corresponding single species biofilms and was accompanied by the obvious growth inhibition of p aeruginosa the biomass and hpc of mixed biofilms increased under synergism conditions similarly chlorine resistance increases due to the cell to cell signaling in biofilms by boosting the transcription of genes associated with oxidative stress tolerance shifting composition and viscosity of the eps or influence biofilm structure and the spatial distribution of different species 5 29 59 while the biomass and hpc of mixed biofilms decrease under competition conditions the dual species biofilm compete with each other leading to degeneration and losses on both species subsequently the self compatibility decreases and the species that are more adapted for the environment persist 19 from the above results we can conclude the effects of interspecific interactions on biofilm formation in dwds and chlorine resistance fig 9 as illustrated in fig 6 the effects of interspecific interactions could be summarized into three types a the synergism of dual species biofilm exhibited high biofilm formation potential and could promote the chlorine resistance of dual species biofilms when both single species biofilms had high chlorine resistance the dual species biofilm exhibited the greatest chlorine resistance the resistance could be attributed mainly to some specific structures in the single species such as eps and spores b neutralism in dual species biofilm exhibited medium biofilm formation potential in general the chlorine resistance was maintained at the original levels associated with the single species c dual species biofilms with competition interactions exhibited weak biofilm formation potential and chlorine resistance when the single species had high chlorine resistance capacity the chlorine resistance of the dual species biofilm would be improved in summary 1 the specific structures of single species cells had a greater influence on chlorine resistance than interspecific interactions and different specific morphological structures have varying degrees of influence with eps having a greater influence than spores 2 the interspecific interactions synergism neutralism and competition resulted in diverse levels of chlorine resistance synergism could promote chlorine resistance in dual species biofilm neutralism had minimal effect on chlorine resistance conversely competition could decrease chlorine resistance although the reduction in chlorine resistance could be mitigated if there were cells with specific morphological structures in the dual species biofilms 4 conclusions the acidovorax acinetobacter sphingomonas bacillus sphingomonas acidovorax and acidovorax microbacterium groups had high biofilm formation potential which could be attributed to the synergism of dual species biofilms the acinetobacter microbacterium sphingomonas microbacterium and sphingomonas acinetobacter groups exhibited weak or medium biofilm formation potential which could be attributed to the competition within dual species biofilms the acidovorax bacillus bacillus acinetobacter and bacillus microbacterium groups exhibited medium biofilm formation potential attributable to neutralism within dual species biofilms considering the interspecific interactions between m laevaniforms and four other species were mainly neutralism or competition interactions the chlorine resistance of the groups associated with m laevaniforms could be inhibited to some extent the specific morphological structures such as eps and spores in dual species biofilms had a greater influence on chlorine resistance than interspecific interactions and the interspecific interactions had diverse effects on chlorine resistance synergism could promote chlorine resistance neutralism had minimal effects on chlorine resistance while competition could reduce chlorine resistance while the reduction in chlorine resistance could be mitigated if there were cells with specific morphological structures in the dual species biofilm the results of the present study were considered as the first step towards understanding the complex interactions occurring in the actual dwds chlorine resistance of the complex biofilm should be raised concern and there is an urgent need to develop effective disinfection strategies for biofilm

distribution systems dwds understanding the effects of interspecific interactions on biofilm formation potential and chlorine resistance could improve future disinfection strategies and prevent the spread of infectious water borne diseases the present study first investigated biofilm formation of 10 bacterial groups with two mixed bacterial strains isolated from a simulated dwds over different incubation times 24 h 48 h and 72 h and then evaluated chlorine resistance of the 72 h incubated biofilms under residual 0 3 0 6 1 2 4 and 10 mg l chlorine concentrations the acidovorax acinetobacter sphingomonas bacillus sphingomonas acidovorax and acidovorax microbacterium groups exhibited high biofilm formation potential which could be attributed to synergism interactions the acinetobacter microbacterium sphingomonas microbacterium and sphingomonas acinetobacter groups exhibited weak or moderate biofilm formation potential which could be attributed to competition interactions the acidovorax bacillus bacillus acinetobacter and bacillus microbacterium groups exhibited moderate biofilm formation potential which could be attributed to the neutralism interactions the chlorine resistance of most of the dual species biofilms associated with sphingomonas sp and bacillus cereus was higher than those of the corresponding single species biofilms considering the interspecific interactions between the microbacterium laevaniforms and four other species were mainly either neutralism or competition interactions the chlorine resistance of the group associated with m laevaniforms could be inhibited to some extent the specific structures e g extracellular polymeric substances and spores of dual species biofilm had a greater influence on chlorine resistance than interspecific interactions there were diverse interspecific interactions synergism could promote chlorine resistance in dual species biofilm neutralism had minimal effect on the chlorine resistance while competition could reduce the chlorine resistance and the reduction in chlorine resistance could be mitigated if there were specific morphological structures in the biofilm such as spores keywords biofilm drinking water distribution systems dual species chlorine resistance interspecific interactions 1 introduction characterizing microbial communities and ensuring the microbiological safety of drinking water is a major public health challenge in drinking water distribution systems dwds microorganisms can occur in the bulk water planktonic bacteria and along pipe walls loose deposits and biofilm bacteria 1 most of the bacterial biomass is present in biofilms in which active bacteria account for about 95 of all bacteria 2 biofilms formed in dwds can consume disinfectant and increase the bacterial resistance to disinfection resulting in bacterial regrowth leading to color turbidity odor and corrosion problems higher pathogen concentrations and outbreaks of water borne diseases 2 3 generally the disinfection strategies for drinking water are based on disinfecting bulk water samples however this is an insufficient basis to inhibit the microbial contamination caused by biofilms in a dwds 4 given that microorganisms in a biofilm will resuspend into the bulk water 5 an effective strategy for monitoring and controlling biofilm development in dwds is highly desirable thanks to widely used high throughput genetic sequencing the microbial diversity of biofilms in dwds has been revealed the phyla associated with the proteobacteria α β and γ proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes are ubiquitous in dwds and the genera sphingomonas pseudomonas acidovorax brevundimonas acinetobacter methylobacterium microbacterium and bacillus also are ubiquitous in dwds 6 10 some microorganisms can be pathogens or opportunistic pathogens such as legionella spp pseudomonas aeruginosa acinetobacter baumannii and bacillus sp among others 11 12 these microorganisms directly cause a risk of water borne infectious diseases to users of a dwds unless the microbes are removed by the water purification process disinfected or inactivated 2 11 in fact even if advanced water treatment technology is adopted the risk of microbial disease in drinking water cannot be ignored such microbial communities can survive extreme conditions such as oligotrophic environments and in dwds with high chlorine residual concentrations 13 complex interactions occur among species in microbial communities some of which are beneficial to one or all interacting groups and some of which are deleterious or have no influence on either groups 14 the interactions between bacterial species may have profound impacts on the initial stages of biofilm formation and growth 5 resident microorganisms interact with each other in either synergistic neutralist or competitive manners which affect biofilm biomass functionality and resistance when compared with single species biofilms 15 18 because of such positive negative or negligible effects the microbial communities in dwds could maintain ecological equilibria 14 19 in an actual dwds the biofilms are usually consisted of complex communities 20 these mixed biofilms communities could exist as dual complexes although various complexity existed between dual species biofilms and multi species biofilms in the actual dwds a variety of complex relationships involving interspecies and intraspecies interactions exhibited in above biofilms 18 21 in addition the mechanism of multi species biofilm formation remain unclear 17 19 21 dual species biofilms could be considered to represent simplified multi species interactions and could be used to study how interspecific interactions influence biofilm formation 15 16 18 19 21 it has been reported that dual species biofilms acinetobacter sp and pseudomonas putida could be more stable and have greater biomass than single species biofilms due to the interactions between species 16 however there are numerous competitive interactions that result in decreased biofilm productivity for all or some interacting members dai et al 18 reported that the presence of stenotrophomonas maltophilia inhibited escherichia coli biofilm formation and it had significantly 65 95 lower biomass than pure e coli biofilm cultures consequently competition could be exploited as a biological control strategy in dwds by inhibiting the growth of some pathogenic microorganisms based on the growth attributes of some non pathogenic microorganisms 22 23 in addition there could be keystone microbes in dwds whose presence or absence could alter the population density or diversity in dwds significantly some studies on microbial ecology in dwds have found that microbial community diversity and interspecific interactions also influence microbial resistance to disinfectants 6 24 26 simoes et al 25 reported that dual species biofilms of bacillus cereus and pseudomonas fluorescens were more resistant to antimicrobials than corresponding single species biofilms nevertheless inconsistent findings have been reported for example lindsay et al 26 observed that b cereus increased the sensitivity of mixed biofilm of p fluorescens and b cereus to disinfectants such as chlorine dioxide the results suggest that the interspecific interactions vary which could affect resistance to disinfectants therefore there is a growing need to investigate the impact of interspecies interactions on the biofilm formation and their architecture 27 28 in addition some researchers have proposed that the microbial niche in dwds could be used to control some pathogenic bacteria via competition and antagonistic interactions 22 29 therefore studying the interactions among different microbial strains in dwds biofilms could facilitate the understanding of the persistence of microorganisms including pathogens and could facilitate the development of novel approaches of controlling opportunistic pathogens in dwds 22 the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of interspecific interactions on biofilm formation potential and evaluate chlorine resistance of dual species biofilm in dwds five bacterial strains used in the present study were isolated from a previous simulated dwds 30 five bacterial strains were divided into 10 groups with two mixed species the dual species biofilm formation was investigated at different incubation times 24 h 48 h and 72 h generally biofilm formation could reach a relatively stable state after 72 h inoculation in microtiter plates 16 20 31 the 72 h incubated dual species biofilms were treated with different residual chlorine concentrations 0 3 0 6 1 2 4 and 10 mg l and the chlorine resistance of different dual species biofilms analyzed and compared furthermore the effects of interspecific interactions on biofilm formation potential and chlorine resistance were compared biofilm studies in situ are not common due to the complex systems in the dwds and difficult accessibility 20 consequently the in vitro biofilm formation assays performed in 96 well microtiter plates are common in biofilm studies 16 20 as there is still in an early phase in the study of dual species biofilms of bacteria found in dwds the results of the present study could provide valuable insights on the ability of these microorganisms to interact with each other in initial biofilm formation and chlorine resistance 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains five bacterial strains were isolated from a previous simulated dwds with cast iron and 304 stainless steel materials and the biofilms incubated for 3 months at 1 mg l 3 mg l and 4 2 mg l residual chlorine concentration 30 those bacterial strains were chosen for being representative of drinking water bacteria due to their ability to form complex biofilms table s1 summarizes the basic information about the five tested bacterial strains sphingomonas sp acidovorax defluvii acinetobacter sp bacillus cereus and microbacterium laevaniformans the bacteria affiliated with proteobacteria were gram negative g while the bacteria affiliated with firmicutes and actinobacteridae were gram positive g all sequences of tested bacterial strains were deposited in genbank of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi under accession numbers mt279967 to

biofilm formation including dwds microorganisms under strict laboratory conditions 20 32 despite their shortcomings in reproducing the conditions found in dwds i e hydrodynamic polystyrene microplates

as a first order reaction further the general expression for this model is expressed as below 44 2 log10 nt n 0 kcn t where n 0 is the number of microorganisms at time t 0 nt is the number of vital microorganisms at time t k is the rate constant for the inactivation of a particular microorganism c is the concentration of a disinfectant t is the contact time n is the fitting parameter for non first order behavior in many cases n is equal to 1 and therefore the inactivation of the corresponding microorganisms is a first order process for a specific biofilm chlorination treatment group the chlorine concentration can be considered constant during the chlorination period of 1 h consequently cnt ct constant 44 therefore the chick watson kinetic can be derived as 3 k log10 nt n 0 ct where k is the inactivation rate constant for the inactivation of the 10 groups of dual species bacteria the lower inactivation rate constant k illustrates the higher resistance to disinfection 45 the biofilm biomass reduction and biofilm activity reduction were defined as 100 when the absorbance was less than that of the negative control the inactivation of a biofilm was expressed as the base 10 logarithm of bacterial count of the positive control log10 n 0 when its bacterial count was lower than the detection limit of the r2a plate count 5 cfu ml 2 7 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was applied by the method described by vaz moreira 46 and modified data of biofilm biomass biofilm activity and hpc r2a over different incubation time were compared using analysis of variance anova and a post hoc tukey test the relationship between biofilm biomass and hpc r2a in 72 h incubated biofilms was assessed based on a pearson correlation analysis statistical calculations were based on a confidence level 95 assuming a significance level for the separation set at p 0 05 these analysis were supported by spss software 16 0 for windows 3 results and discussion 3 1 biofilm biomass and biofilm formation potential of dual species fig 1 presents the biofilm biomass of mixed species 10 groups incubated for 24 h 48 h and 72 h as illustrated in fig 1 incubation time influenced the biofilm biomass of acidovorax acinetobacter and acinetobacter microbacterium groups significantly p 0 05 while incubation time did not significantly influence the biomass of eight other groups p 0 05

biomass of bacillus acinetobacter and sphingomonas acinetobacter decreased at the primary stage and then increased with the prolongation of incubation time with the maxima achieved at 72 h and 24 h respectively the biofilm biomass of acidovorax microbacterium and sphingomonas microbacterium groups exhibited an opposite trend increase first and then decrease and attained the maximum at 48 h the biofilm biomass of the sphingomonas bacillus group reduced gradually with the prolongation of incubation time and the maximum was observed at 24 h the variety of dual species biofilm formation was

dual species based on incubation time biofilm formation potential can be divided into four groups no biofilm formation potential weak biofilm formation potential moderate biofilm formation potential and high biofilm formation potential 34 as presented in fig 1 both sphingomonas bacillus and acidovorax microbacterium groups exhibited moderate biofilm formation potential during all the incubation periods in the 24 h incubation the sphingomonas bacillus group already had a high biofilm formation potential acidovorax microbacterium group exhibited moderate biofilm formation potential acidovorax acinetobacter group exhibited no biofilm formation potential and the other seven groups exhibited weak biofilm formation potential in the 48 h incubation the sphingomonas bacillus and acidovorax

and the acidovorax acinetobacter acidovorax microbacterium and sphingomonas acidovorax groups exhibited high biofilm formation potential the biofilm formation potential of bacillus microbacterium sphingomonas microbacterium and sphingomonas acinetobacter groups was constant with an increase in incubation time while the biofilm formation potential of sphingomonas bacillus group decreased gradually with an increase in incubation time in addition the biofilm formation potential of the other six groups increased gradually with an increase in incubation time 3 2 specific respiratory activity of dual species biofilm according to the results fig s1 biofilm activity od490 determined using the xtt menadione method was limited due to low values low discrimination ability and large errors and therefore in the present study dual species biofilm activity was described as the specific respiratory activity of biofilm using od490 570 od490 od570 fig 2 illustrates the specific respiratory activity of dual species biofilm incubated for 24 h 48 h and 72 h according to fig 2 incubation time influenced the specific respiratory activity of acidovorax acinetobacter acidovorax bacillus acinetobacter microbacterium bacillus acinetobacter bacillus microbacterium and sphingomonas microbacterium groups significantly p 0 05 while the specific respiratory activity of acidovorax acinetobacter sphingomonas bacillus acidovorax microbacterium sphingomonas acidovorax and sphingomonas acinetobacter groups was not influenced significantly p 0 05 by incubation time the specific respiratory activity of bacillus acinetobacter group at 24 h was significantly p 0 05 higher than the specific respiratory activity at 48 h and 72 h although there was no significant p 0 05 difference in specific respiratory activity between 48 h and 72 h excluding sphingomonas acinetobacter and sphingomonas microbacterium groups which had the highest specific respiratory activity at 48 h and the lowest at 24 h all other eight groups had the highest specific respiratory activity at 24 h among the eight groups above the specific respiratory activity of group acidovorax microbacterium decreased first and then increased with an increase in incubation time while that of other seven groups gradually decreased with an increase in incubation time in the initial stages 24 h there were significant differences in specific respiratory activity among all 10 groups p 0 05 while there were no significant differences among the 10 groups p 0 05 with an increase in incubation time in the later stages 48 h and 72 h the specific respiratory activity of the acinetobacter microbacterium group at 24 h was significantly p 0 05 higher than in the other nine groups and that of sphingomonas microbacterium and sphingomonas acinetobacter groups were significantly p 0 05 lower than those of the other eight groups the order of specific respiratory activity at 24 h was acinetobacter microbacterium group acidovorax acinetobacter group bacillus acinetobacter group acidovorax microbacterium group sphingomonas bacillus group acidovorax bacillus group bacillus microbacterium group sphingomonas acidovorax group sphingomonas acinetobacter group sphingomonas microbacterium group the order of specific respiratory activity at 48 h was acidovorax microbacterium group sphingomonas bacillus group acinetobacter microbacterium group bacillus acinetobacter group acidovorax acinetobacter group sphingomonas acidovorax group sphingomonas microbacterium group acidovorax bacillus group sphingomonas acinetobacter group bacillus microbacterium group the order of specific respiratory activity at 72 h was acidovorax microbacterium group sphingomonas bacillus group sphingomonas microbacterium group acinetobacter microbacterium group sphingomonas acinetobacter group sphingomonas acidovorax group acidovorax acinetobacter group bacillus acinetobacter group acidovorax bacillus group bacillus microbacterium group 3 3 bacteria counts of dual species biofilm bacterial biofilm was incubated for 72 h in the present study due to the high workload associated with plate counting fig 3 shows the hpc of dual species biofilm incubated for 72 h as illustrated in fig 3 the hpc of the acidovorax acinetobacter group was 8 04 106 cfu cm2 which was significantly p 0 05 higher than those of the other nine groups conversely the hpc of the sphingomonas bacillus sphingomonas acidovorax bacillus acinetobacter and sphingomonas acinetobacter groups was 3 5 106 cfu cm2 6 2 106 cfu cm2 which were significantly p 0 05 higher than those of five other groups the hpcs of all the other five groups were less than 2 106 cfu cm2 among them the hpc of the acidovorax acinetobacter group with the greatest being about 40 fold that of the acidovorax microbacterium group which had the lowest hpc based on the results of further analysis the biofilm biomass and the bacteria counts of dual species biofilm exhibited a significantly moderate positive correlation r 0 57 p 0 001 a particular experimental group under the same treatments and incubation conditions was performed while different triplicate samples and measurement methods were taken consequently significantly moderate positive correlation results with little difference were also convincing similar findings for dual species biofilm in the dwds were reported 16 17 20 3 4 interspecific interactions analysis the co occurrence of competition and synergism has been elucidated in dwds from a microbial ecology perspective in numerous studies 14 18 dual species biofilms acinetobacter sp and pseudomonas putida could be more stable and have greater biomass when compared to the corresponding single species biofilms due to the interactions between species 16 similarly laganenka et al 47 demonstrated that the cell counts of a dual species e coli and enterococcus faecalis biofilm were significantly higher when compared to those of corresponding single species biofilms however high competition could lead to decreased biofilm productivity for all or some of the interacting species makovcova et al 17 observed that total biomass volume in staphylococcus aureus and a gram negative bacteria decreased in dual species biofilms excluding in a co culture of s aureus and e coli after 24 h when compared to s aureus single species biofilms numerous drinking water bacteria acidovorax spp sphingomonas spp pseudomonas spp bacillus spp acinetobacter spp flavobacterium spp stenotrophomonas maltophilia aeromonas hydrophila and burkholderia cepacia have been reported to have the capacity to produce bacteriocin or bacteriocin like substances to inhibit the growth of legionella pneumophila 22 48 49 the microorganisms in the dwds biofilm could adapt to the environment through the uneven distribution and interactions in microbial communities 18 33 nutrient competition is one of the major drivers of species evolution in the microbial world 14 some microorganisms could outcompete other microbes more effectively due to a superior capacity to exploit some nutrients 5 14 in general when the biomass or hpc of dual species biofilm are greater than the sum of two single species biofilms under similar incubation conditions it can be considered synergism while when the biomass or hpc is equivalent it can be considered neutralism and when it is less than the sum it can be considered competition 14 19 37 as illustrated in figs 1 and 3 in 10 groups of dual species biofilm both the biomass and the hpcs of the acidovorax acinetobacter sphingomonas bacillus and sphingomonas acidovorax groups were adequately large at 4 8 fold the sum of two single species biofilms and was therefore considered synergism the biomass and the hpc of the acidovorax microbacterium group were twice the sum of two single species biofilms and therefore was also considered synergism the biomass and the hpcs of the acinetobacter microbacterium were lower than the sum of the two single species biofilms consequently the case was also considered competition the biomass of sphingomonas microbacterium and sphingomonas acinetobacter groups was slightly higher than the sum obtained following incubation for 24 h and less than the sum obtained following incubation for 48 h and 72 h the observations suggest neutralism at the initial stage followed by competition the biomass and the hpc of the acidovorax bacillus bacillus acinetobacter and bacillus microbacterium groups were equivalent with their sum and they interactions were therefore considered neutralism with regard to the biofilm activity and the specific respiratory activity as illustrated in fig 2 the activity in the 10 groups was basically lower than those of the corresponding single species or their sums therefore biofilm activity and the specific respiratory activity could not elucidate the interspecific interactions in addition fig 4 illustrated the sem images of biofilm spatial structure and interactions at 72 h incubation the acidovorax acinetobacter sphingomonas bacillus sphingomonas acidovorax and acidovorax microbacterium groups exhibited synergism interactions which evidenced cell to cell connections using fibril like structures white tips fig 4 ⅰ ⅲ ⅶ ⅸ 17 among these four groups the sphingomonas bacillus group formed strongly adherent and compact biofilms which cells were embedded in a large amount of possible eps red arrows fig 4 ⅸ 17 the acidovorax acinetobacter group formed significantly thick cell aggregates across the surface which was also observed amorphous matrix red arrows fig 4 ⅰ the sphingomonas acidovorax group have relatively homogeneous aggregation biofilm propensity which cells was embedded in an amorphous matrix possibly eps red arrows fig 4 ⅶ the acidovorax microbacterium group possessed high aggregation propensity fig 4 ⅲ the acinetobacter microbacterium sphingomonas microbacterium sphingomonas acinetobacter and bacillus microbacterium groups all developed weak loose biofilms fig 4 ⅳ ⅵ ⅷ ⅹ the bacillus acinetobacter group possessed moderate aggregation propensity fig 4 ⅴ the acidovorax bacillus group formed large cell density homogeneous monolayer biofilm which was also observed fibril like structures white tips fig 4 ⅱ the acidovorax bacillus group could exhibit synergism in an iron matrix or materials 50 considering bacillus sp is an iron reducing bacterium while the acidovorax sp is an iron oxidizing bacteria 50 51 considering the lack of an iron compound in the culture matrix and materials the acidovorax bacillus group did not exhibit any interspecific synergism in the present study and exhibited a neutral relationship because of complex webs of interactions multiple or dual species biofilm interactions are frequently influenced by their environments such as nutrient conditions incubation time hydraulic conditions biofilm structure and spatial location 14 18 24 3 5 biofilm biomass reduction in dual species chlorination experiments were carried out for 60 min at different residual chlorine 0 3 mg l 0 6 mg l 1 mg l 2 mg l 4 mg l and 10 mg l concentrations in the present study table 1 lists the initial biofilm biomass and hpc of dual species 10 groups before disinfection fig 5 presents the removal rate of biofilm biomass of 10 groups at different residual chlorine concentrations according to fig 5 the removal rate of biofilm biomass of 10 groups was significantly p 0 05 affected by all the residual chlorine concentrations excluding 1 mg l among the 10 groups studied sphingomonas acinetobacter group exhibited the highest chlorine resistance at 0 3 mg l residual chlorine when residual chlorine was increased to 0 6 mg l or higher sphingomonas bacillus exhibited the highest chlorine resistance comparably sphingomonas acinetobacter group was the most sensitive at 1 mg l while acinetobacter microbacterium group was the most sensitive at other residual chlorine concentrations compared to the findings our previous study in submission the chlorine resistance levels of most of dual species biofilms were higher than those of single species biofilms at low residual chlorine concentrations less than 0 6 mg l the chlorine resistance levels of dual species biofilms associated with acinetobacter sp and acidovorax defluvii were higher than those of the single species biofilms at relatively high residual chlorine concentrations 1 mg l or higher the sphingomonas associated with bacillus had a higher level of chlorine resistance while three other single species biofilms associated with bacillus had lower chlorine resistance levels when compared to the findings our previous study on single species biofilms in submission the chlorine resistance levels of most dual species biofilms associated with sphingomonas sp were higher than those of the single species biofilms among 10 groups excluding acidovorax acinetobacter and sphingomonas bacillus groups the removal rates of biofilm biomass of the other eight groups were not influenced significantly p 0 05 by residual chlorine concentrations 2 mg l or higher in addition the removal rates of biofilm biomass of sphingomonas bacillus were significantly p 0 05 different at residual chlorine concentrations of 4 mg l and 10 mg l similarly the removal rates of biofilm biomass of the acidovorax acinetobacter group was significantly p 0 05 different at residual chlorine concentrations of 2 mg l and 4 mg l in general the order of chlorine resistance of 10 groups was sphingomonas bacillus group sphingomonas acidovorax group sphingomonas acinetobacter group sphingomonas microbacterium group bacillus acinetobacter group bacillus microbacterium group acidovorax acinetobacter group acidovorax bacillus group acidovorax microbacterium group acinetobacter microbacterium group based on the results of further analysis the biofilm biomass reductions and the biofilm biomass of dual species exhibited a significantly moderate positive correlation r 0 59 p 0 001 only at a residual chlorine concentration of 0 3 mg l while there were no significant p 0 05 correlations at other residual chlorine concentrations based on the results of our previous study in submission due to the low biofilm activity determined using the xtt menadione method the assessment of inhibition rate of biofilm activity of the chlorination experiments using the xtt menadione method is not recommended 3 6 inactivation of dual species biofilm the inactivation rate constants of dual species biofilm for 60 min were investigated under different residual chlorine concentrations in the present study table 1 lists the initial hpcs of dual species biofilm 10 groups before disinfection fig 6 illustrates the inactivation rate constants of biofilm biomass in the 10 groups at different residual chlorine concentrations as presented in fig 6 and table 1 the biofilm biomass inactivation rate constant in sphingomonas bacillus group was somewhat higher than that of the sphingomonas acidovorax group at a residual chlorine concentration of 0 6 mg l which were 0 00861 min 1 and 0 00834 min 1 respectively while that of sphingomonas bacillus group was the lowest 0 00271 0 0137 min 1 at other residual chlorine concentrations the acinetobacter microbacterium group had the highest inactivation rate constant of biofilm biomass at residual chlorine concentrations of 0 6 mg l 1 mg l and 10 mg l which were 0 0274 min 1 0 0201 min 1 and 0 00575 min 1 respectively in addition the acidovorax acinetobacter group had the highest inactivation rate constant of biofilm biomass at residual chlorine concentrations of 2 mg l and 4 mg l which were 0 0167 min 1 and 0 0122 min 1 respectively at low residual chlorine concentrations 0 3 mg l the acidovorax bacillus group had the highest inactivation rate constant of biofilm biomass 0 0357 min 1 similar to the results obtained using the crystal violet cv method the chlorine resistance levels of dual species biofilms associated with acinetobacter sp all increased when compared to that of acinetobacter sp as single species biofilm at different residual chlorine concentrations in addition the chlorine resistance levels of most dual species biofilms associated with m laevaniforms and a defluvii were higher than those of the corresponding single species biofilms while the chlorine resistance of most of the dual species biofilms associated with b cereus and sphingomonas sp were lower than those of the corresponding single species biofilms the inactivation rate constant of 10 groups increased mainly with an increase in residual chlorine concentrations different from the results based on the cv method the inactivation rate constant of biofilm biomass based on the plate counting method hpc r2a was significantly p 0 05 different at high residual chlorine concentrations of 2 mg l or higher similar to the results by cv method the order of chlorine resistance of 10 groups was sphingomonas bacillus group acidovorax bacillus group sphingomonas acidovorax group sphingomonas microbacterium group sphingomonas acinetobacter group bacillus microbacterium group bacillus acinetobacter group acidovorax microbacterium group acidovorax acinetobacter group acinetobacter microbacterium group 3 7 eps and spore counts of dual species biofilm eem spectra are used to identify fluorescent compounds present in eps as a rapid and sensitive technique eem fluorescence spectroscopy is a useful tool for studying the physicochemical properties of eps which fluorescence characteristics are greatly related to their structure and functional groups in molecules 52 fig 7 illustrates eem spectra of eps extracted from 10 group of dual species biofilm before and after disinfection according to fig 7 the main regions were allocated to aromatic proteins ex 250 nm em 380 nm and soluble microbial products ex 250 340 nm em 380 nm 53 similarly many researchers demonstrated that the two peaks assigned to aromatic proteins and soluble microbial products are major fluorescent compounds presented in eps extracted from the early stage 1 36 days biofilms 54 56 as presented in fig 7 among the 10 groups of dual species biofilms before disinfection the sphingomonas bacillus and sphingomonas acidovorax groups exhibited higher spectral fluorescence intensity red fluorescence region both in two above peaks than that of eight other groups which might mean that the two groups of biofilms produced higher amount of eps 56 the eem spectra of eps were declined remarkably after disinfection and damaged cells exhibited rough and shrunken appearance and deformation or cellular debris in the 10 groups after disinfection figure s2 according to the results the eps excretions of the dual species biofilms of synergism with sphingomonas sp were higher than that of other dual species biofilms the interspecific interactions biomass eps excretion thickness and compactness of biofilms were all correlated with the chlorine resistance of dual species biofilms figs 1 3 4 and 6 synergism could tend to be a denser and thicker biofilm more eps excretion which would limit diffusion of disinfectants through the biofilm matrix consequently synergism of dual species biofilms was often accompanied by high chlorine resistance 57 to better understand the some specific structural mechanism of chlorine resistance the vegetative cell counts and spore counts of 10 groups of dual species biofilm before and after disinfection were determined fig 8 spores can withstand the effects of disinfectants owing principally to the cumulative effect of spores in respect of their structure chemistry and biochemistry 63 64 as presented in figs 8 and s2 red circle the spores were only present in the dual species biofilm associated with bacillus the spore counts of dual species biofilm associated with bacillus were less than 472 cfu cm2 before disinfection and the proportion of spores was low 0 012 while spore counts increased significantly and was larger than 7244 cfu cm2 after disinfection and the proportion of spores was 38 07 70 2 among them the sphingomonas bacillus group had the most spores 3 05 105 cfu cm2 but had the lowest proportion 38 07 the bacillus microbacterium group had the least spores 3 05 105 cfu cm2 but had the highest proportion 70 2 this means that in the bacillus microbacterium group bacillus cereus contributed significantly to chlorine resistance in the acidovorax bacillus and bacillus acinetobacter groups bacillus cereus also contributed more than 50 to chlorine resistance 3 8 effects of interspecific interactions on biofilm formation potential and chlorine resistance the present study also examined the chlorine resistance of 10 groups of dual species biofilm according to the results the interspecific interactions between m laevaniforms and four other species were largely neutralism or competition consequently chlorine resistance of the groups associated with m laevaniforms could be inhibited to some extent based on the observations of our previous study in submission b cereus and sphingomonas sp exhibited high chlorine resistance in single species biofilm and they maintained a high competitive advantage under chlorine stress in the environment gomes et al 58 observed that the disinfection 2 v v tego 2000 resistance of an e coli and pantoea agglomerans dual species biofilm was significantly higher than in the corresponding single species biofilm in addition kocot et al 29 demonstrated that a p aeruginosa atcc 27853 and s aureus fi 2 dual species biofilm was more resistant to chlorine based disinfectants than the corresponding single species biofilms however other studies have reported different results behnke et al 59 found that the chlorine resistance of a burkholderia cepacia and p aeruginosa mixed incubation in chemostat was significantly lower than that in the corresponding single species biofilms and was accompanied by the obvious growth inhibition of p aeruginosa the biomass and hpc of mixed biofilms increased under synergism conditions similarly chlorine resistance increases due to the cell to cell signaling in biofilms by boosting the transcription of genes associated with oxidative stress tolerance shifting composition and viscosity of the eps or influence biofilm structure and the spatial distribution of different species 5 29 59 while the biomass and hpc of mixed biofilms decrease under competition conditions the dual species biofilm compete with each other leading to degeneration and losses on both species subsequently the self compatibility decreases and the species that are more adapted for the environment persist 19 from the above results we can conclude the effects of interspecific interactions on biofilm formation in dwds and chlorine resistance fig 9 as illustrated in fig 6 the effects of interspecific interactions could be summarized into three types a the synergism of dual species biofilm exhibited high biofilm formation potential and could promote the chlorine resistance of dual species biofilms when both single species biofilms had high chlorine resistance the dual species biofilm exhibited the greatest chlorine resistance the resistance could be attributed mainly to some specific structures in the single species such as eps and spores b neutralism in dual species biofilm exhibited medium biofilm formation potential in general the chlorine resistance was maintained at the original levels associated with the single species c dual species biofilms with competition interactions exhibited weak biofilm formation potential and chlorine resistance when the single species had high chlorine resistance capacity the chlorine resistance of the dual species biofilm would be improved in summary 1 the specific structures of single species cells had a greater influence on chlorine resistance than interspecific interactions and different specific morphological structures have varying degrees of influence with eps having a greater influence than spores 2 the interspecific interactions synergism neutralism and competition resulted in diverse levels of chlorine resistance synergism could promote chlorine resistance in dual species biofilm neutralism had minimal effect on chlorine resistance conversely competition could decrease chlorine resistance although the reduction in chlorine resistance could be mitigated if there were cells with specific morphological structures in the dual species biofilms 4 conclusions the acidovorax acinetobacter sphingomonas bacillus sphingomonas acidovorax and acidovorax microbacterium groups had high biofilm formation potential which could be attributed to the synergism of dual species biofilms the acinetobacter microbacterium sphingomonas microbacterium and sphingomonas acinetobacter groups exhibited weak or medium biofilm formation potential which could be attributed to the competition within dual species biofilms the acidovorax bacillus bacillus acinetobacter and bacillus microbacterium groups exhibited medium biofilm formation potential attributable to neutralism within dual species biofilms considering the interspecific interactions between m laevaniforms and four other species were mainly neutralism or competition interactions the chlorine resistance of the groups associated with m laevaniforms could be inhibited to some extent the specific morphological structures such as eps and spores in dual species biofilms had a greater influence on chlorine resistance than interspecific interactions and the interspecific interactions had diverse effects on chlorine resistance synergism could promote chlorine resistance neutralism had minimal effects on chlorine resistance while competition could reduce chlorine resistance while the reduction in chlorine resistance could be mitigated if there were cells with specific morphological structures in the dual species biofilm the results of the present study were considered as the first step towards understanding the complex interactions occurring in the actual dwds chlorine resistance of the complex biofilm should be raised concern and there is an urgent need to develop effective disinfection strategies for biofilm
