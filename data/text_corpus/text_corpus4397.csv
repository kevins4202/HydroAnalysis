21985,although road based freight transport has large external costs it currently dominates the hinterland cargo transport sector in europe an increase of the automation levels of inland cargo vessels could advance their competitiveness hence unlocking more sustainable inland cargo transport moreover these improvements could pave the way for a potential future paradigm shift towards unmanned inland cargo vessels therefore this study investigates the design of an experimental platform in order to study the feasibility and current or future limitations of unmanned inland cargo vessels to explore this design the following three questions were handled i how to design an industrially relevant research vessel ii how can an unmanned inland cargo vessel interact with or perceive its environment and iii how to control an unmanned or autonomous inland cargo vessel the answers to these design questions delivered the blueprint to construct a first prototype of an unmanned inland cargo vessel this prototype performed a set of outdoor experiments to verify and validate the made design choices the successful execution of these experiments demonstrates that this vessel can serve as an experimental platform for further technological research regarding more automated or unmanned inland cargo vessels and provide fruitful insights for other research domains keywords autonomous unmanned inland

currently road based freight transport dominates the european hinterland transport sector enveloping roughly 75 of the cargo flow expressed in tonnes km tkm and it has been doing so for the last 25 years european commission 2019 given the fact that road based freight transport currently suffers from congestion together with the increased restrictions on its emissions a solution needs to be found to sustainably cope with the projected rise in cargo flow in the upcoming decades for example the belgian federal planning bureau estimates a total cargo growth of 27 tonnes in the period between 2015 and 2040 caused by a 5 rise of national transport and a 39 rise of international transport over belgian territory under the assumption of unchanged policies similarly they estimate an increase of 32 tkm of goods transported over inland waterways laine et al 2019 these projected cargo growths show both the magnitude and internationality of the transport problem at hand it is for this reason that the european commission has set the ambitious goal to push 30 tkm of road freight transport longer than 300 km to rail and water borne transport between 2011 and 2030 and likewise 50 tkm by 2050 kallas 2011 this envisaged transformation of the multi modal transport network leverages the knowledge that the average external costs accidents air pollution climate noise and congestion for inland waterway transport are significantly lower than for road transport al enezy et al 2017 van essen et al 2011 to illustrate this cost difference note that the average total cost hence including external costs for inland waterway transport equalled an estimated 3 9 eurcent tkm in europe in 2016 which was almost half of the similar road costs which amounted to 6 6 eurcent tkm van essen 2018 where both numbers additionally include well to tank and habitat damage costs although inland waterway transport seems to be a more sustainable alternative to road transport it currently suffers from an outflow of small vessels of the european class type i and ii often referred to as cemt i and ii where cemt is a french abbreviation for conférence européenne des ministres de transport cemt 1992 some of the main reasons for this recorded outflow are i a lack of technological improvements ii a reduction of new young skippers and iii high crew costs which can rise up to 60 of the transportation cost sys and vanelslander 2011 this diminishing fleet of small vessels could cause a discrepancy with the philosophy of the european commission to shift cargo loads to the inland waterway transport consequently to accomplish the conceptualised modal shift this projected gap between the increasing need of inland waterway transport and the acknowledged outflow of cemt i ii vessels might need to be filled the authors believe that an increase in the automation levels of inland cargo vessels could be part of the solution to increase the sustainability of the multi modal transport network of the european hinterland furthermore this improvement could unlock the possibility of unmanned inland cargo vessels which could induce a paradigm shift in this transport sector to be able to study this possibility of unmanned inland cargo vessels the authors think that an industrially relevant experimental test platform will generate vital information therefore they explored the question of how to design an experimental platform to study the feasibility and current or future limitations of unmanned inland cargo vessels evidently not all research challenges can be known up front nor can all possible solutions be properly accommodated on one research vessel therefore this paper focusses on three key technological design aspects industrial relevance vessel environment interactions and the motion control of the vessel note that some of the research results for an unmanned vessel can be transferred to its manned counterparts in order to increase their automation level be aware that the technological achievability of this industrial platform alone cannot judge the economical feasibility of unmanned inland cargo vessels in general nevertheless the authors believe that this platform will form an indispensable piece in the potential future automation puzzle for example in a recent study regarding potential business cases for more automated inland waterway transport verberght and van hassel 2019 state that defining the automated or unmanned vessel remains quite challenging and open for debate which impacts the accuracy of the cost analyses hence the experimental results of this study could be used to investigate the economical feasibility on a higher level of resolution and the same principle could hold for different research domains looking into automated or unmanned inland shipping the remainder of this paper continues as follows section 2 outlines the current research field regarding unmanned or autonomous surface vessels usvs or asvs identifies some of the key technological challenges for unmanned inland cargo vessels and details the three aforementioned key design aspects of this paper which the three following sections will discuss subsequently section 3 handles the industrial relevance of the research vessel section 4 discusses its interactions with the environment and section 5 explains the chosen motion control implementation afterwards section 6 discusses the first experiments conducted with the constructed vessel finally section 7 concludes the aforementioned topics and uncovers some of the potential technological future research areas for unmanned inland cargo vessels 2 usv research field and challenges 2 1 usv research field the advancements in platforms sensors onboard computing power and communication systems have reached critical maturity levels over the last two decades benjamin 2016 and additional improvements occurred for the implementation of guidance navigation and control gnc subsystems fossen 1994 fossen 2002 do and pan 2009 fossen 2011 which help to form the intelligent backbone of a usv the combination of these developments gradually unlocks more potential for semi or fully autonomous surface vehicles which has resulted in the growth of five main usv categories i scientific research ii environmental missions iii ocean resource exploration iv military use and v other applications as defined by liu et al 2016 they also noted the scarcity of usvs in the commercial markets which could be explained by their continuous competition with their manned analogues or with other robotic platforms savitz et al 2013 concerning the more cargo oriented usv research moreira and guedes soares 2011 conducted research on a scale model sea going vessel to perform manoeuvring tests autonomously without a specific focus on the industrial use or design of the vessel itself furthermore within the concept study of the recent revolt project which aims at safe efficient and environment friendly short sea shipping midjas 2018 a scale model has been built with no specific focus on the industrial robustness of the model it is also noteworthy that one of the conclusions of the munin maritime unmanned navigation through intelligence in networks project munin 2016 was that inland cargo vessels might be plausible first movers for unmanned cargo shipping if suitable business models could be found this idea originates from the presumed lower legal and technological complexity of inland cargo shipping compared to deep sea cargo shipping rødseth 2015 2 2 technological challenges for inland usvs although the technological complexity might be assumed to be lower at first glance the overall challenges for unmanned inland shipping are not trivial for instance inland ships suffer from a spatially more restricted complex navigational environment and have no help of tugs to manoeuvre liu et al 2015 moreover the horizontal and vertical confinements of the waterway have a significant influence on the hydrodynamic behaviour of a vessel pompée 2015 and bank effects occur when sailing close to a quay or other infrastructures lataire et al 2018 the identification of these hydrodynamic effects is paramount for advanced gnc modules but not available for smaller inland vessels liu et al 2017 furthermore the usability of these gnc modules for inland navigation needs to be investigated and further developments might be necessary likewise the perception of the environment of an inland vessel needs to be explored and crucial information will need to be shared over and fetched from the automatic identification system ais and the river information system ris vallant and hofmann wellenhof 2008 2 3 technological design aspects for inland usvs in order to be able to study these inland specific technological challenges for unmanned inland cargo vessels an industrially relevant research vessel has to be designed and constructed which envelops the aim of this study this aim can be tailored down into the following three research questions answered by the following three sections i how to make a research platform for an unmanned inland cargo vessel industrially relevant ii how can an unmanned inland cargo vessel interact with or perceive its environment iii how to control an unmanned inland cargo vessel 3 industrial relevance when designing an experimental platform that has the ambition to explore unmanned inland cargo shipping its design needs to have a certain level of industrial relevance in order for it to generate useful data or insights four main design choices that resulted in an increase of industrial relevance were made i the vessel type and size ii the actuation system iii the component selection and iv the modular design in both hardware and software 3 1 vessel type and size two industrial developments for inland vessels drove the decision of the vessel type and size discussed by section 3 1 3 on the one hand the european watertruck project introduces a fresh batch of inland vessels reviewed by section 3 1 1 and on the other hand a growing research and industrial interest for urban cargo vessels has been triggered in europe explained by section 3 1 2 3 1 1 industrial watertruck project an attempt to bridge the gap between the growth of inland cargo transport and the outflow of small inland vessels has been made by the european watertruck project european commission 2018b which is situated in the broader trans european transport network ten t european commission 2018a framework this watertruck project envisages an increased flexibility in waterborne transport by introducing a modular fleet of both barges and push boats which can easily be coupled or decoupled in a truck or train like fashion not only does this modularity provide the on demand configuration of ship fleets it also decouples sailing and transshipment time further reducing the crew costs on board in its first phase the watertruck project will introduce 31 new barges and push boats 12 unpropelled barges 16 self propelled barges and 3 push boats of cemt type i ii the final deliverable aims to expand this fleet to 500 vessels in the cemt range i to iv european commission 2018b 3 1 2 vessels for urban transport evidently a smaller vessel can penetrate deeper in the european hinterland and could even enter certain urban areas nevertheless urban waterborne freight transport remains complex to organise and needs further research however smaller scale cargo transport has been shown to be a workable alternative in urban areas in several european cities janjevic and ndiaye 2014 for example in 1996 the city of utrecht the netherlands introduced a boat of length 18 80 m beam of 4 26 m and a maximum draft of 1 10 m to cope with the increasingly difficult road based urban city logistics due to their narrow road ways and a second boat was introduced in 2010 with an electric power supply maes et al 2012 additionally caris et al 2014 suggested that further research could support an increased integration of inland waterway transport into urban distribution networks which could also help a further integration of inland waterway transport in the inter modal supply chain 3 1 3 experimental platform geometry given the above mentioned fresh batch of cemt i ii vessels on the one hand and the growing research interest in urban freight transport over inland waterways on the other hand the experimental platform geometry design was chosen to be a scale model of a self propelled cemt i sp cemt i watertruck vessel by taking a scale factor of 8 the vessel can serve as a research platform to both study the sp cemt i fleet and to investigate some of the possibilities of urban waterway logistics table 1 lists the geometrical similarity between the sp cemt i and its scale model named the cogge 1 1 as a tribute to karel lodewijk cogge who helped flooding the plains of the yser during the first world war to keep the german troops at a distance and fig 1 shows this geometry of the sp cemt i or cogge together with its body fixed reference frame where the x axis points to the bow y axis to starboard and the z axis downwards additionally fig 2 a depicts a convoy of four cemt i barges being pushed by a manned push boat and b shows the ku leuven scale model of such a self propelled barge deployed as a usv it is impossible to physically board the cogge hence making it a usv by raw definition nevertheless it would be possible to board and steer its real size counterpart this discrepancy in operational modes may lead to some confusion between unmanned and autonomous as both adjectives are not mutually exclusive in this context similarly the literature regarding surface vehicles often discusses both asvs and usvs interchangeably bertram 2008 manley 2008 campbell et al 2012 liu et al 2016 moreover the exact meaning of autonomous is often vaguely described as it inherently entails different levels which may be context dependent rødseth and nordahl 2018 proposed definitions to further clarify the surface vehicle nomenclature taking into account both ship specific situations e g having a temporarily unmanned bridge on a manned vessel and different levels of autonomy fig 3 lists these autonomy levels ranging from direct physical control by the crew to fully autonomous i e unmanned without supervision together with their interactions with the vessels in this study as visualised the real size sp cemt i can be both an asv when it has crew on board and a usv when there is none moreover both vessels will be remotely steerable also making them remotely operated vehicles rovs 3 2 actuation system two key aspects motivated the actuation system selection with a focus on industrial relevance i the system should be used by existing or future inland cargo vessels and ii if possible the system should be generic both criteria were met by scaling down the propulsion system of the watertruck sp cemt i barges these barges have a novel actuation configuration enveloping a 360 degrees rotatable steering grid thruster in the bow in conjunction with a 360 degrees rotatable 4 channel thruster in the stern firstly this over actuated propulsion system is currently used by the real scale vessels and it unlocks the possibility to perform more complex manoeuvres and subsequent advanced motion control philosophies and secondly such an over actuated system can be used to mimic an under actuated system by digitally disabling or limiting certain control parameters making it a modular and generic actuation system peeters et al 2019 discuss this novel actuation combination nested inside the cogge and this section will summarise the most relevant parts from their study in order to understand the full vessel design the propulsion system is completely integrated in the hull i e no parts protrude the vessel this nested configuration generates lower manoeuvring limitations in the often spatially restricted inland waterways fig 4 shows a transparent view of the vessel with its bow and stern thruster which are discussed in section 3 2 1 and section 3 2 2 respectively 3 2 1 bow thruster the bow thruster has a kaplan series propeller without nozzle with a diameter of d b 100 m m a blade area ratio of b a 0 65 and a pitch diameter ratio of p d 0 95 this horizontally oriented propeller i e its rotational axis stands almost perpendicular to the calm water plane draws in water from underneath the hull and afterwards this water flow exits the actuator according to the orientation of the internal steering grid angle θ i b an abstract representation of this working principle is show by fig 5 for θ i b 0 and 90 for this bow thruster it is assumed that θ i b and the output angle θ o b of its resulting thrust force t b always align i e θ i b θ o b hence the chosen angle convention immediately gives the orientation of t b as the water flow exits the actuator in the opposite direction fig 6 shows the measured thrust forces linearly extrapolated at different rotational speeds of its propeller n b and different θ i b these data were measured without an enveloping ship hull and without any ship velocity hence external hull losses and wake influences are not incorporated a significant loss in t b emerges at θ i b θ o b 150 180 which might be explained by the possible occurrence of a closed loop system of circulating water as the outlet angle θ o b of the exiting water stream is oriented towards the propeller 3 2 2 stern thruster the stern actuation operates with a slightly larger but geometrically similar propeller of diameter d s 150 m m fig 7 demonstrates the basic working principle of this actuation system half a sphere with an opening of approximately 85 stands above the propeller and can be controlled by its internal angle θ i s in order to orient the outflow of water through one of the four channels or through a superposition of two experimental data were fetched with the stern thruster nested inside half a ship hull transversal cut at midship at zero velocity in a towing tank hence the main external hull losses were incorporated and no wake influences were present fig 8 depicts the arising thrust forces at different propeller speeds n s and different θ i s which were measured on both the longitudinal axis t x s and the transversal axis t y s of the actuation system the data indicate two main non linearities one at θ i s 60 120 for t x s and the other at θ i s 150 180 for t x y the resulting stern thrust force t s and its output angle θ o s can be calculated as follows 1 t s n s θ i s t x s n s θ i s 2 t y s n s θ i s 2 θ o s arctan t y s t x s the mapping of the resulting θ o s on the requested θ i s as shown by fig 9 shows that the abovementioned non linearities have a large effect on the orientation of t s as these constant thrust zones reappear at the same angle intervals 60 120 and 150 180 the exact cause of this non linearity is hard to uncover but some of the likely contributors seem to be i the difference in length and shape of the four channels ii the potentially remaining angular velocity of the water inside the system and iii the internal reflections of the water stream in the xy plane when θ i s 0 90 180 or 90 3 3 component selection the selection of robust industrial and marine grade components where possible further increased the industrial relevance of the vessel table 2 reflects these design choices by listing the main components of the cogge and its associated shoreside infrastructure and fig 10 shows their location on the cogge as can be seen both the control hardware programmable logic controller industrial computer industrial router and the sensors have an industrial level that could be transferred to a real size vessel in this manner the cogge can experiment with a configuration that could be used by real size inland vessels during their normal operations the power supply to feed all these components consists of two batteries although the lower energy density of the current battery technology introduces a significant weight and price penalty compared to a fuel based system it was judged to be more convenient to use for the scale model for three main reasons i less noise and vibrations ii no local emissions near researchers and iii the vessel can be charged by a 220 230 v ac power supply in a few hours a detailed implementation of this charge system can be found in the appendix this fully electric drive train causes a difference between the cogge and the first batch of sp cemt i vessels which can use a hybrid system enveloping both batteries and diesel generators to power their electrical engines this hybrid system aligns with the growing research field looking into hybrid propulsion systems for vessels kalikatzarakis et al 2018 which might cause a change in the default drive train layouts of future vessels 3 4 modular hardware and software the fourth and final industrially relevant design aspect was achieved by focussing on a modular system design on both the hardware and software level by doing so the final construction of the cogge remains flexible as different hardware components could be tried out in the future or added to the current design and different autonomy software could control the vessel or different motion control philosophies could run in the current autonomy software 3 4 1 modular hardware three main subsystems form the overarching hardware and subsequent communication architecture an actuation control subsystem a sensor and autonomy subsystem and a shoreside subsystem fig 11 illustrates their vital inter and intra communication links the actuation control subsystem houses a second level of modularity induced by the nested plc topology this plc controls the lowest level desired actuation system states i e n b n s θ i b and θ i s and these states can be communicated to the plc via currently three devices i the remote control over a radio link ii a web interface over mobile or wireless internet and iii the onboard industrial computer over a modbus tcp ip connection after the reception of these desired system states the plc will communicate these states to their appropriate actuation system drivers which will then using their internal control loops drive these states to their desired value in this fashion two motor drives control n b and n s a stepper motor with an integrated encoder controls θ i b whereas the stepper motor for θ i s and its complementary encoder are currently two separated entities but they will be replaced by one entity in the future which will be added on the can fieldbus furthermore this cascaded configuration makes the plc the heart of the vessel and exploits its industrial robustness to control the desired system states this lay out achieves an increased level of operational redundancy which is paramount for industrial applications the industrial computer forms the core of the sensor and autonomy subsystem on the one hand it receives the sensor information currently gnss global navigation satellite system imu inertial measurements unit camera and lidar laser imaging detection and ranging and on the other hand it runs the autonomy software see section 3 4 2 which can use this sensor information to provide the motion control see section 5 of the cogge the third and final hardware subsystem accumulates all the shoreside infrastructure which currently consists of the rugged shoreside laptop and a remote control the latter provides the possibility for manual control of the vessel as it is not possible to board the cogge whereas the shoreside laptop provides further visual feedback as it can communicate with the onboard processes the remote control has two physical joysticks to steer the propeller speeds and control angles of the actuation systems note that these variables can also be set via a web interface 3 4 2 modular software an autonomy system nested on the i pc can also control the vessel instead of a human modularity and genericness formed two of the key design choices for the selection of this autonomy software therefore an open source cross platform software suite was chosen named mission oriented operations suite moos newman 2005 this moos software provides internal asynchronous publish subscribe communication between moos applications moosapps which are small modular software entities c via its database moosdb and can be used for robotic research in general encompassing this moos core benjamin et al 2010 wrote a marine oriented expansion of this software called moos interval programming or moos ivp which takes advantage of the backseat driver paradigm this backseat paradigm separates the vehicle navigation and control parts from its autonomy system making the latter research platform independent this paradigm implementation further increases the modularity and genericness of the control architecture of the cogge furthermore on the cogge the control architecture consists of three cascaded levels coined high middle and low level control which will be discussed in section 5 4 environment interactions an unmanned or automated vessel needs to perceive and interact with its environment in order to navigate for the purpose of understanding the environmental settings in which the vessel could sail the authors made the following arbitrary differentiation based on the present obstacles where obstacles envelop both the waterway infrastructure such as bridges locks quays waterway cross section and other vessels i static known obstacles ii static unknown obstacles iii dynamic known obstacles and iv dynamic unknown obstacles here the adjective known means that information geometry position orientation potential velocity about the object is available and the opposite holds for the unknown objects from the moment that one object in the environment is unknown or dynamic the environment changes to its associated description it is readily understood that other environmental differentiations could be made depending on the preferred level of analysis of the researcher these four environments seem to demand different sensor capabilities from the vessel on the one hand and different risk and safety analyses on the other hand the former should provide the vessel with both navigational information and perception of its ambient environment respectively discussed in the subsequent sections 4 1 and 4 2 an in depth discussion of the latter falls out of the scope of this study nevertheless observe that there is movement in this research area for example megumi and susumu 2019 investigated how to introduce autonomous maritime vessels into the existing international maritime organisation imo regulations and thieme et al 2018 investigated the applicability of 64 existing ship risk models for ship ship collisions ship structure collisions and groundings for autonomous marine vessels the latter concluded that for a more detailed system evaluation more information regarding the usv concept needs to be known valdez banda et al 2019 complementarily noted the major challenge of ensuring the safety of a usv in its operational context given the limited experience with functioning usvs therefore they analysed the safety hazards for two ferries in their current operational modes and in their potential autonomous deployments finally the inclusion of a shore control centre to monitor or remotely steer a usv further complicates the risk analyses by introducing human system interactions unfortunately here too a deficiency in the amount of research considering such human system interactions and potential human failures was noted by abilio ramos et al 2019 consequently they studied how humans in a shore control centre could form a key component for successful collision avoidance by uncovering their potential tasks and the impact of the possible human failures to perform these considering that a common denominator over these recent usv risks analyses seems to be the scarcity of operational usv concepts the developments in this study aim to provide these data and insights to nurture future developments in this area accordingly the risk assessments of our study were mainly focused on the lower technical level i e implementing levels of redundancy in the vessel hardware selecting industrially robust components having the ability to remotely control the vessel and implementing emergency stops in addition the relatively small weight and slow manoeuvring speeds add to a higher safety during the conducted experiments apart from these technical safety measures the flemish waterway administrator and by extent the flemish government have taken an active role in the discussions regarding safety and regulations during the experiments conducted with our scale model vessel they achieved this role by defining monitoring and continuously optimizing a legal framework for testing and demonstration purposes with autonomous inland vessels 4 1 navigational information the navigational information such as position orientation velocity etc can be fetched by a standalone gnss sensor or a gnss and an imu separately or an imu with integrated gnss corrections although the vessel desires a high accuracy from these sensors the preciseness of their measurements can be influenced in practical applications due to environmental noise sensor drift and sensor faults liu et al 2016 moreover the quality of gnss signals will drop in the vicinity of tall buildings wang et al 2012 or in the case of inland vessels imperfect gnss signals will occur in the neighbourhood of bridges locks quays or other large vessels unfortunately these are the situations where the highest accuracy would be desired a first solution to diminish the effect of sensor faults and the impact of environmental noise is to install state of the art marine grade sensors doing so a gnss and imu of which the specifications are discussed in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 were selected and installed the fusion of their data forms a second solution to increase their performance currently an extended kalman filter ekf based on the vessel kinematics improves the accuracy of the navigational data our future work aims at including the hydrodynamics of the vessel in a model based ekf as for example in caccia et al 2008 tran et al 2014 4 2 environment perception complementary to the necessity of accurate navigational information an unmanned vessel needs to be aware of its surroundings which the authors divided into the aforementioned four separate cases i e i iv in the ideal environment of known static obstacles and low or no environmental disturbances an imu and gnss should suffice to autonomously navigate the vessel however in order to perceive an unknown static object and its relative distance a stereo camera lidar radar radio detection and ranging or a similar range measuring sensor has to be installed lidar and or stereo camera based object detection has been a growing research field for indoor environments and the current research also expands towards larger outdoor environments often forcing the sensor to collect data at a greater distance with a lower density grant et al 2019 although several successful studies have demonstrated the simultaneous localisation and mapping of an agent in a static environment and some studies even implemented obstacle avoidance e g hsu and shiu 2019 zhang and singh 2017 mousazadeh et al 2018 costa et al 2016 it remains to be investigated which sensor set and their minimum required specifications is deemed necessary to achieve this goal on the inland waterways for cargo vessels moreover a supplementary challenge arises with the addition of dynamic objects as these also move or navigate in the ambient area and thus collision needs to be avoided an implementation of a colreg compliant collision avoidance for dynamic objects can be found in benjamin 2017 here the autonomous fleet can share navigational information with other autonomous vessels using the same nested moos ivp software hence making all the dynamic objects known given the fact that the cogge uses the moos ivp software the usability of its obstacle avoidance implementation for inland waterways will be investigated via simulations in future work given the modularity of the software design other collision avoidance strategies could also be implemented another example of an environment with known dynamic objects can be found in the hull to hull h2h navigation project kotzé et al 2019 berge et al 2019 which also involves test cases with the cogge in this project vessels share their navigational information and its uncertainty over a proprietary communication channel in order to perform close proximity encounters see section 6 4 in addition some navigational information of known dynamic obstacles can be fetched from the ais data nevertheless in reality not all vessels use their ais nor do all vessels have such a system and different smaller waterway users can enter the operational environment of an unmanned vessel unlocking the need of the detection and tracking of unknown dynamic objects in comparison with their terrestrial and aerial robotic counterparts there seem to be two main differences on the one hand most of the to be tracked objects tend to be larger in size exhibiting slower dynamics which could lower the complexity of tracking these objects however on the other hand this also means that the objects have higher inertias and thus slower response times so the collision avoidance algorithms will need to operate and predict over a longer time horizon this is a non trivial task that needs to build its foundation on the results of i iii and consequently its complexity falls out of the scope of this study 4 3 selected sensors for the cogge during the first research stages good weather conditions are presumed for the sensor selection later on the additional complexity of bad weather conditions can be added keeping this assumption in mind and based on the ongoing research mentioned above the authors currently plan to investigate the usability of the sensor sets listed in table 3 for the different environments the following sections describe the selected onboard sensors gnss imu lidar and stereo cameras and some intermediate results can be studied further down in section 6 the h2h proprietary communication protocols and media are not yet finalised nor is an ais currently installed thus both systems will not be discussed in detail bear in mind that it is not unlikely that additional sensors will be added in the future depending on the findings and possible limitations of the current sensor sets on top of that the achieved results in these environments can also help the development of more automated manned vessels for example these developments in the perception of the environment could guide augment or replace certain tasks currently performed by the onboard crew 4 3 1 gnss the installed asterx u marine gnss sensor septentrio 2017 can operate in temperatures ranging from 30 to 65 c and has an ip67 rated housing making it a robust sensor for inland vessels on the cogge it uses two mushroom antennas separated by a baseline of approximately 4 44 m to receive multi frequency and multi constellation gnss signals this way it can benefit from the more accurate european galileo constellation while still being able to use additional constellations to boost its convergence time and accuracy li et al 2015 furthermore it includes a ultra high frequency radio bluetooth wifi and a cellular modem this cellular connection allows for the reception of real time kinematic rtk corrections langley 1998 for the gnss signals drastically improving the accuracy of its navigational data table 4 summarises the impact of these rtk corrections on the performance of this sensor together with other accuracies as shown the correction accuracy depends on the distance between the sensor and the nearest rtk base station for example for the horizontal position the absolute accuracy results in 0 6 cm 0 05 cm per km of distance from the base station flanders currently has 45 base stations installed ensuring a dense coverage and freely provides these rtk corrections over mobile internet via the flemish positioning service flepos 2019 4 3 2 imu the ekinox 2 e imu sensor can operate in the temperature range of 40 to 75 c and has an ip68 rating 24 h submersible at 2 m sbg 2018 this imu uses three gyroscopes and three accelerometers to measure the angular velocities and linear accelerations of the vessel moreover it can provide additional information regarding the position orientation and linear speeds of the vessel by means of single or double time integration an internal kinematic ekf can be used to compensate for the imu drift shown by fig 12 the internal ekf predicts states at 200 hz based on the integration of its gyroscopes and accelerometers and these states get a corrective step at 1 hz provided by gnss data from the asterx u an ekinox 2 e software module first checks the integrity of this gnss data and pulls it through its proprietary error model before sending it to the ekf the line of sight between the tracked satellites and the gnss mushrooms will be disturbed and potentially blocked when for example passing a bridge consequently it is of paramount importance for an unmanned vessel to still receive reliable navigational information during this time span table 5 demonstrates two examples of the importance of the ekf by listing its accuracy in function of the elapsed time since a corrective gnss signal was received 0s 10s and 30s logically the accuracy diminishes the longer a gnss outage lasts nevertheless the ekinox 2 e is still capable to produce useful data during these shorter outages which align with the typical time of passing under a bridge furthermore the imu computes and publishes the accuracies of its predicted states so that an autonomy system could take this into account 4 3 3 lidar the opal 1000 lidar has no external moving parts sits in an ip67 housing and can operate in 40 to 40 c neptec 2019 the laser scanner measures a panoramic field of view of 360 in the horizontal plane and 45 in the vertical plane at a maximum rate of 300 000 pulses per second with a maximum range of 1000 m it can penetrate obscurants such as dust snow rain fog and smoke by using its patented algorithm which uses 7 pulses to measure one point moreover it can also be connected to and synced with the imu and gnss in order to perform scans while the vessel is moving 4 3 4 cameras a computer vision technology company named vision provided the tailored stereo camera system vision 2019 this system consists of two industrial cameras positioned on the port and starboard side of the bow sensor rail most conventional commercially available systems have a maximum distance of 40 cm between both cameras whereas on the cogge they have a baseline of 60 cm which provides an optimal depth sight at a distance of approximately 15 20 m i e 3 4 times the length of our scale model these cameras have a frame rate of 22 frames per second a pixel class of 5 megapixel and a power over ethernet connection which simplifies the power and communication requirements when creating stereoscopic images it is crucial that the images provided by both cameras are taken simultaneously hence in the current set up the cameras are connected to each other via a proprietary wire allowing one camera to trigger the other camera on receipt of the command to record an image the camera software suite controls the cameras and allows the user to fine tune the settings of the cameras to optimize their exposure in addition the software supplied by vision enables the extraction of 3 dimensional point cloud data from a stereo camera image specifically configured for an inland waterway environment this is to be used in conjunction with the point cloud data produced by the lidar but raw camera images will also be used to aid environment perception and obstacle detection 5 motion control as explained in section 3 4 2 three levels of control make up the total software design for the motion control of the vessel fig 13 summarises the main interactions between these three low middle and high control levels for an example configuration when the cogge follows a list of waypoints these three control levels are further clarified by sections 5 1 5 2 and 5 3 with reference to fig 13 5 1 high level control the high level control covers the top level route planning for example the determination of the route to be taken between two cities currently an in house developed waypoint generator forms a static list of waypoints between a configured start and endpoint on a river or canal this developed generator uses the openstreetmaps openstreetmap contributors 2019 database in order to fetch the global coordinates from the chosen waterway the generator places waypoints in the middle of the waterway and the maximum distance between two consecutive waypoints can be specified by the user finally the result can be downloaded as a plain text file and be used as to be tracked waypoints by the middle level control 5 2 middle level control the moos ivp autonomy system provides the foundation for the middle level control for the cogge three main components form the core of this autonomy system a collection of moosapps the autonomy decision making ivp helm which is a moosapp on its own and the moosdb for their communication to configure the ivp helm the user can write or use a set of behaviors that the vessel should follow for example follow waypoints and maintain a certain speed these behaviors have ivp functions defined by the user which span over their decision space e g heading speed moreover the user can also decide when a particular behavior should occur by configuring the mission modes the ivp helm will calculate the optimal system states depending on the different behaviors and their weighted ivp functions more in depth information can be found in benjamin et al 2010 continuing with the illustrative configuration of fig 13 the ivp helm could be configured to for example solely follow waypoints by using the moos ivp waypoint following behavior this behavior needs a list of waypoints to follow which in this case will be provided by the aforementioned high level control next the ivp helm needs navigational information e g the current heading and speed to calculate the desired heading and speed for the cogge to reach the following waypoint this information flow illustrates the backseat control paradigm the autonomy decision making ivp helm only needs navigational information form the vessel at hand which he can treat as a black box and will then based on its internal behavior configuration provide the desired systems states for this vessel nevertheless in the control architecture of the cogge the navigation and control modules are no black boxes but also consist of several moosapps such as drivers for the sensors and the low level motion controller therefore the virtual hierarchical separation line between middle and low level control has been drawn at the level of the moosdb as some part of the autonomy system the ivp helm and its surroundings form the middle level control and other parts low level motion controller and sensor drivers form the low level control and vehicle navigation system 5 3 low level control the low level control diminishes the error between the desired and current system states e g the heading and speed the former states are produced by the middle level control and the latter are provided by the gnss and imu sensors currently a conventional proportional integral derivative pid controller is implemented as a moosapp to control the heading and total speed of the vessel hence to control the cogge in two degrees of freedom on the water plane the pid controller is a well known simple and robust controller often used in maritime applications although more advanced controllers exist which take the kinematics into account as discussed in for example do and pan 2009 and fossen 2011 nevertheless the performance of this pid controller can be used as a benchmark for the future implementation of more sophisticated control philosophies finally the plc receives the output of the pid controller i e the desired control system states n b n s θ i b θ i s communicates with their respective drivers and sends back their current values see section 3 4 1 6 results and discussion this section analyses some of the first experiments conducted with the cogge first section 6 1 demonstrates a few open loop experiments to uncover some of the basic hydrodynamic capabilities of the vessel these trials were performed on the small lake of rotselaar belgium afterwards the subsequent sections discuss a few different environment interactions in the aforementioned differentiated cases i ii and iii 6 1 open loop rotselaar lake 6 1 1 straight sailing during the first open loop tests the cogge showed an asymmetric course behaviour when the vessel was commanded to sail straight e g giving solely the stern an rpm i e n s 0 and n b θ i b θ i s 0 it seemed to show a repetitive asymmetric behaviour which turned the vessel to starboard presently it is hard to discover the exact cause of this behaviour a first empirical solution was to place a honeycomb like flow straightener in the longitudinal direction of the stern side outlet of the stern thruster to straighten its exiting water flow when sailing straight ahead fig 14 displays the effect of this flow straightener on the straight line sailing capacity of the vessel the black lines show the first experiments without flow straightener whereas the red lines show similar experiments but with the flow straightener inserted in the stern outlet note how the black lines show a high curvature due to the asymmetric behaviour whereas the red lines show a more linear sailing behaviour over longer spatial slots the differences in length between all curves are due to different requested propeller speeds and time spans of the missions the installation of this flow straightener significantly improved the straight line stability of the vessel which can also be felt when the remote control is used to steer the vessel 6 1 2 pseudo spiral manoeuvre to investigate the possible turning rates of the cogge a pseudo spiral manoeuvre was performed this manoeuvre slightly differs form the dieudonné spiral manoeuvre dieudonné 1953 as the vessel only turned into one direction and there was a constant settling time between the rudder impulses the uncertainty of the spatial necessities for a full spiral manoeuvre pushed the decision to initially only perform such a pseudo spiral manoeuvre the manoeuvre was performed fully autonomous with the following desired settings n s 1000 r p m θ i s 0 n b 2500 r p m and θ i b varying between 4 8 20 40 60 80 hence the stern thruster was oriented to propel the vessel forward with the flow straightener installed and the bow thruster was used to steer by using a constant propeller speed but changing its outlet angle fig 15 a lists these desired system states during the whole mission as visible an arbitrarily settling time of 10 s was used this time span was chosen to be rather short in order to have the space to perform the mission but it can be increased in future tests for the same reason the first angle change occurred right from the start introducing some start up effects in the data as the vessel itself also needed to accelerate in the future a longer start up time could be introduced fig 15 b plots the measured course from the gnss and the recorded yaw rates from the imu the latter were filtered with a centered moving average filter of window size 50 finally fig 15 c plots the sailed trajectory 6 2 environment i known static obstacles 6 2 1 autonomous sailing on the yzer river the first autonomous unmanned closed loop tests were performed on the yser in nieuwpoort belgium in the context of the efro european fund for regional development project autonoom varen in de westhoek this efro project investigated the legal and technical necessities to perform a pilot demonstration of autonomous sailing with a scale model of an inland vessel in a confined demonstration area afterwards the project conducted such tests of which the described tests in this section were the first ones these preliminary tests used the control hierarchy described in section 5 moreover the map shown in the waypoint generator of fig 13 actually shows some of the generated waypoints for these experiments after the generation of the waypoints list and the implementation of the ivp helm to follow these consecutive waypoints the low level controller needs to be configured the angle of the bow thruster provided the steering mechanism for the vessel whereas the stern thruster was kept a static neutral angle this set up aligns with the configuration of section 6 1 2 and had the following settings n s 1250 r p m θ i s 0 n b 2400 r p m and θ i b 90 90 as control variable the ivp helm provided the desired heading to follow the waypoints and the imu gave the current heading the error between both headings was controlled with a manually tuned pi control on θ i b with a proportional gain factor k p 2 and an integral gain factor k i 0 2 s 1 with an integral limit of 0 7 in order to avoid integral wind up fig 16 summarises two parts of autonomous sailing on the yser a b and c show a fragment of a straight part on the yser whereas d e and f show a sample of a bend of the yser whilst passing under a bridge these two samples are also visible on the map of fig 13 where the red line is the highway bridge under which the vessel sailed in d the plotted waypoints of a and d have a higher density than the waypoints of fig 13 as for the latter the amount of visible waypoints was decreased to increase the readability of the figure next plots b and e show the measured propeller speeds on the one hand and the measured control angle θ i b on the other hand finally c and f show the desired heading published by the ivp helm and the current heading fetched from the imu note that these headings are shown within the boundaries of 180 180 which causes the sudden change from 180 to 180 in f as demonstrated by these six subplots the vessel was able to follow the waypoints on both a straight and curved trajectory 6 3 environment ii unknown static obstacles 6 3 1 lidar scans fig 17 illustrates a static scan with an exposure of 5 min at the small inland leisure harbour of leuven belgium where the lidar was placed on the shoreside on the left side of this image a few moored leisure craft can be seen fig 18 shows the accumulated data of an approximately 1 min scan while the vessel was slowly sailing the left hand side plots the raw lidar data using a color code from red to blue to denote the decreasing intensity of the measured points and thus increasing distance relative to the lidar the right hand side of the figure plots the manual overlay of the lidar data now in black on the local geographical map of the lake of rotselaar where these data were fetched hence for this configuration the lidar was mounted on the vessel and had access to the imu data during the exposure time a wind surfing class was also present on the water which resulted in the ghost points on the water close to the top of the image 6 3 2 stereo camera images fig 19 depicts two simultaneously taken images of the stereo camera system the visible railway bridge lies at the coordinates 50 54 01 5 n 4 42 23 9 e as mentioned in section 4 3 4 these images can be used to extract depth data of the surrounding environment the images were taken on a rainy day where water droplets eventually made it onto the lenses resulting in the blurred result this effect of the weather shows the importance of using more than one perception system and hints at the future research challenges when the effects of bad weather conditions are added 6 3 3 in operation communication data rates the following data rates indicate the measured data consumptions during the experiments discussed in section 6 evidently they depend on the configuration of certain sensor parameters in order to avoid confusion two separate network loops can be detailed i the local network i e communication between the sensors and the onboard i pc and ii wireless vessel to shore communication i e where certain data could be transmitted between the onboard i pc and the shoreside r pc in the first case both the gnss and imu consume less than 1 mbps megabit per second the lidar uses approximately 5 mbps when it spins on one sixth of its maximum frequency and given that each camera can produce 5 megapixel images at 22 frames per second they could theoretically each approximately produce a maximum data rate of 330 mbps which they can each transmit over a category seven ethernet cable in the second case when one wants to stream some of these data wirelessly to another device there are currently two options available via the onboard router using the cellular network or using a wireless local area network wlan note that this router has a theoretical maximum bandwidth of 150 mbps on top of that the current cellular 4g network has a claimed maximum bandwidth of 100 mbps however this number is highly environment dependent and a conservative bandwidth of 5 15 mbps was noticed to be more representative for the possible regime data rates at our testing locations during the experiments there was always a wireless communication between the onboard moos processes and the moos processes on a remote laptop which triggered and monitored their onboard counterparts the frequency and the content of these vessel to shore communications can be chosen and was never larger than 1 mbps hence it was always possible to transmit these data over the cellular network the authors plan to add a second separated local network to route all the data coming from the perception sensors together with a second i pc to process all these data and a second router to transmit this data if desired 6 4 environment iii known dynamic obstacles in the european horizon 2020 project hull to hull h2h the cogge will be deployed in an environment with known dynamic objects kotzé et al 2019 this h2h concept uses uncertainty zones to visualise the relative positioning between h2h compliant vessels berge et al 2019 this project is a cooperation between kongsberg seatex as no sintef ocean as no sintef digital no mampaey offshore industries nl and ku leuven be the h2h project has received funding from the european gnss agency under the european union s horizon 2020 research and innovation programme grant agreement no 775998 7 conclusions and future work this paper discussed the design of an experimental platform which aims to help study the feasibility and current or future limitations of unmanned inland cargo vessels the authors believe that the developed platform can provide indispensable technological information which can steer the investigation of possible business cases for more automated or unmanned inland cargo vessels to achieve this goal the focus was put on the three following design aspects i industrial relevance the newly introduced fleet of self propelled watertruck barges inspired the design of the scale model and its size fits the research potential for urban water freight transport furthermore the over actuated propulsion system which has two 360 degrees steerable thrusters offers the possibility of advanced motion control philosophies while it can also serve to mimic under actuated propulsion systems in addition the selection of marine grade industrially robust state of the art sensors offer insights for vessels in real operation and could even be transferred to a real size vessel with minimal necessary changes finally the focus on modularity in both the hardware and software design offers redundancy genericness and facilitates further research ii interactions with the environment the perception of and the interaction with different environments were split into four cases handling known or unknown static or dynamic obstacles afterwards the technological challenges for these environments were examined which resulted in the selected sensor sets and their specifications complementary preliminary results for environments i ii and iii were presented iii motion control the cascaded motion control philosophy consisting of three levels provides the flexibility to study different implementations of these distinct levels moreover the instrumented backseat driver paradigm makes the decision making part of the motion control vessel independent an experiment conducted on the yzer river illustrated the successful implementation of the cascaded motion control design ranging from the human scheduling input to the lowest actuation control signals controlled by the plc in conclusion the integration of these design aspects resulted in the blueprint for an unmanned inland cargo vessel which successfully performed preliminary unmanned and autonomous experiments although these experiments were fruitful further improvements will be key to study the potential of operating unmanned inland cargo vessels therefore some of the on going research of the authors is currently oriented towards i the modelling and identification of both propulsion systems with a special focus on the thrust deduction losses due to the fact that both propellers are completely nested inside the hull and rotate in a plane parallel with the calm water plane ii the identification of hydrodynamic motion models which could serve as plant or control models depending on their complexity iii the development of advanced low middle and high level motion controllers where the full flexibility and or identification of the actuation system at hand can be used iv the further development of the perception of the environment on the basis of the selected sensor sets moreover additional sensors can be added in the future such as a weather station speed over water sensor or radar v the alignment and integration of the developed solutions with the existing ais and ris this future work list does not exhaust all the technological challenges that lie ahead but demonstrates their vast amount in order to achieve increasingly automated or even unmanned inland cargo vessels nevertheless this study validated a first working example of an unmanned inland cargo vessel operating in a priori known environment with static obstacles and provided preliminary results and

21985,although road based freight transport has large external costs it currently dominates the hinterland cargo transport sector in europe an increase of the automation levels of inland cargo vessels could advance their competitiveness hence unlocking more sustainable inland cargo transport moreover these improvements could pave the way for a potential future paradigm shift towards unmanned inland cargo vessels therefore this study investigates the design of an experimental platform in order to study the feasibility and current or future limitations of unmanned inland cargo vessels to explore this design the following three questions were handled i how to design an industrially relevant research vessel ii how can an unmanned inland cargo vessel interact with or perceive its environment and iii how to control an unmanned or autonomous inland cargo vessel the answers to these design questions delivered the blueprint to construct a first prototype of an unmanned inland cargo vessel this prototype performed a set of outdoor experiments to verify and validate the made design choices the successful execution of these experiments demonstrates that this vessel can serve as an experimental

currently road based freight transport dominates the european hinterland transport sector enveloping roughly 75 of the cargo flow expressed in tonnes km tkm and it has been doing so for the last 25 years european commission 2019 given the fact that road based freight transport currently suffers from congestion together with the increased restrictions on its emissions a solution needs to be found to sustainably cope with the projected rise in cargo flow in the upcoming decades for example the belgian federal planning bureau estimates a total cargo growth of 27 tonnes in the period between 2015 and 2040 caused by a 5 rise of national transport and a 39 rise of international transport over belgian territory under the assumption of unchanged policies similarly they estimate an increase of 32 tkm of goods transported over inland waterways laine et al 2019 these projected cargo growths show both the magnitude and internationality of the transport problem at hand it is for this reason that the european commission has set the ambitious goal to push 30 tkm of road freight transport longer than 300 km to rail and water borne transport between 2011 and 2030 and likewise 50 tkm by 2050 kallas 2011 this envisaged transformation of the multi modal transport network leverages the knowledge that the average external costs accidents air pollution climate noise and congestion for inland waterway transport are significantly lower than for road transport al enezy et al 2017 van essen et al 2011 to illustrate this cost difference note that the average total cost hence including external costs for inland waterway transport equalled an estimated 3 9 eurcent tkm in europe in 2016 which was almost half of the similar road costs which amounted to 6 6 eurcent tkm van essen 2018 where both numbers additionally include well to tank and habitat damage costs although inland waterway transport seems to be a more sustainable alternative to road transport it currently suffers from an outflow of small vessels of the european class type i and ii often referred to as cemt i and ii where cemt is a french abbreviation for conférence européenne des ministres de transport cemt 1992 some of the main reasons for this recorded outflow are i a lack of technological improvements ii a reduction of new young skippers and iii high crew costs which can rise up to 60 of the transportation cost sys and vanelslander 2011 this diminishing fleet of small vessels could cause a discrepancy with the philosophy of the european commission to shift cargo loads to the inland waterway transport consequently to accomplish the conceptualised modal shift this projected gap between the increasing need of inland waterway transport and the acknowledged outflow of cemt i ii vessels might need to be filled the authors believe that an increase in the automation levels of inland cargo vessels could be part of the solution to increase the sustainability of the multi modal transport network of the european hinterland furthermore this improvement could unlock the possibility of unmanned inland cargo vessels which could induce a paradigm shift in this transport sector to be able to study this possibility of unmanned inland cargo vessels the authors think that an industrially relevant experimental test platform will generate vital information therefore they explored the question of how to design an experimental platform to study the feasibility and current or future limitations of unmanned inland cargo vessels evidently not all research challenges can be known up front nor can all possible solutions be properly accommodated on one research vessel therefore this paper focusses on three key technological design aspects industrial relevance vessel environment interactions and the motion control of the vessel note that some of the research results for an unmanned vessel can be transferred to its manned counterparts in order to increase their automation level be aware that the technological achievability of this industrial platform alone cannot judge the economical feasibility of unmanned inland cargo vessels in general nevertheless the authors believe that this platform will form an indispensable piece in the potential future automation puzzle for example in a recent study regarding potential business cases for more automated inland waterway transport verberght and van hassel 2019 state that defining the automated or unmanned vessel remains quite challenging and open for debate which impacts the accuracy of the cost analyses hence the experimental results of this study could be used to investigate the economical feasibility on a higher level of resolution and the same principle could hold for different research domains looking into automated or unmanned inland shipping the remainder of this paper continues as follows section 2 outlines the current research field regarding unmanned or autonomous surface vessels usvs or asvs identifies some of the key technological challenges for unmanned inland cargo vessels and details the three aforementioned key design aspects of this paper which the three following sections will discuss subsequently section 3 handles the industrial relevance of the research vessel section 4 discusses its interactions with the environment and section 5 explains the chosen motion control implementation afterwards section 6 discusses the first experiments conducted with the constructed vessel finally section 7 concludes the aforementioned topics and uncovers some of the potential technological future research areas for unmanned inland cargo vessels 2 usv research field and challenges 2 1 usv research field the advancements in platforms sensors onboard computing power and communication systems have reached critical maturity levels over the last two decades benjamin 2016 and additional improvements occurred for the implementation of guidance navigation and control gnc subsystems fossen 1994 fossen 2002 do and pan 2009 fossen 2011 which help to form the intelligent backbone of a usv the combination of these developments gradually unlocks more potential for semi or fully autonomous surface vehicles which has resulted in the growth of five main usv categories i scientific research ii environmental missions iii ocean resource exploration iv military use and v other applications as defined by liu et al 2016 they also noted the scarcity of usvs in the commercial markets which could be explained by their continuous competition with their manned analogues or with other robotic platforms savitz et al 2013 concerning the more cargo oriented usv research moreira and guedes soares 2011 conducted research on a scale model sea going vessel to perform manoeuvring tests autonomously without a specific focus on the industrial use or design of the vessel itself furthermore within the concept study of the recent revolt project which aims at safe efficient and environment friendly short sea shipping midjas 2018 a scale model has been built with no specific focus on the industrial robustness of the model it is also noteworthy that one of the conclusions of the munin maritime unmanned navigation through intelligence in networks project munin 2016 was that inland cargo vessels might be plausible first movers for unmanned cargo shipping if suitable business models could be found this idea originates from the presumed lower legal and technological complexity of inland cargo shipping compared to deep sea cargo shipping rødseth 2015 2 2 technological challenges for inland usvs although the technological complexity might be assumed to be lower at first glance the overall challenges for unmanned inland shipping are not trivial for instance inland ships suffer from a spatially more restricted complex navigational environment and have no help of tugs to manoeuvre liu et al 2015 moreover the horizontal and vertical confinements of the waterway have a significant influence on the hydrodynamic behaviour of a vessel pompée 2015 and bank effects occur when sailing close to a quay or other infrastructures lataire et al 2018 the identification of these hydrodynamic effects is paramount for advanced gnc modules but not available for smaller inland vessels liu et al 2017 furthermore the usability of these gnc modules for inland navigation needs to be investigated and further developments might be necessary likewise the perception of the environment of an inland vessel needs to be explored and crucial information will need to be shared over and fetched from the automatic identification system ais and the river information system ris vallant and hofmann wellenhof 2008 2 3 technological design aspects for inland usvs in order to be able to study these inland specific technological challenges for unmanned inland cargo vessels an industrially relevant research vessel has to be designed and constructed which envelops the aim of this study this aim can be tailored down into the following three research questions answered by the following three sections i how to make a research platform for an unmanned inland cargo vessel industrially relevant ii how can an unmanned inland cargo vessel interact with or perceive its environment iii how to control an unmanned inland cargo vessel 3 industrial relevance when designing an experimental platform that has the ambition to explore unmanned inland cargo shipping its design needs to have a certain level of industrial relevance in order for it to generate useful data or insights four main design choices that resulted in an increase of industrial relevance were made i the vessel type and size ii the actuation system iii the component selection and iv the modular design in both hardware and software 3 1 vessel type and size two industrial developments for inland vessels drove the decision of the vessel type and size discussed by section 3 1 3 on the one hand the european watertruck project introduces a fresh batch of inland vessels reviewed by section 3 1 1 and on the other hand a growing research and industrial interest for urban cargo vessels has been triggered in europe explained by section 3 1 2 3 1 1 industrial watertruck project an attempt to bridge the gap between the growth of inland cargo transport and the outflow of small inland vessels has been made by the european watertruck project european commission 2018b which is situated in the broader trans european transport network ten t european commission 2018a framework this watertruck project envisages an increased flexibility in waterborne transport by introducing a modular fleet of both barges and push boats which can easily be coupled or decoupled in a truck or train like fashion not only does this modularity provide the on demand configuration of ship fleets it also decouples sailing and transshipment time further reducing the crew costs on board in its first phase the watertruck project will introduce 31 new barges and push boats 12 unpropelled barges 16 self propelled barges and 3 push boats of cemt type i ii the final deliverable aims to expand this fleet to 500 vessels in the cemt range i to iv european commission 2018b 3 1 2 vessels for urban transport evidently a smaller vessel can penetrate deeper in the european hinterland and could even enter certain urban areas nevertheless urban waterborne freight transport remains complex to organise and needs further research however smaller scale cargo transport has been shown to be a workable alternative in urban areas in several european cities janjevic and ndiaye 2014 for example in 1996 the city of utrecht the netherlands introduced a boat of length 18 80 m beam of 4 26 m and a maximum draft of 1 10 m to cope with the increasingly difficult road based urban city logistics due to their narrow road ways and a second boat was introduced in 2010 with an electric power supply maes et al 2012 additionally caris et al 2014 suggested that further research could support an increased integration of inland waterway transport into urban distribution networks which could also help a further integration of inland waterway transport in the inter modal supply chain 3 1 3 experimental platform geometry given the above mentioned fresh batch of cemt i ii vessels on the one hand and the growing research interest in urban freight transport over inland waterways on the other hand the experimental platform geometry design was chosen to be a scale model of a self propelled cemt i sp cemt i watertruck vessel by taking a scale factor of 8 the vessel can serve as a research platform to both study the sp cemt i fleet and to investigate some of the possibilities of urban waterway logistics table 1 lists the geometrical similarity between the sp cemt i and its scale model named the cogge 1 1 as a tribute to karel lodewijk cogge who helped flooding the plains of the yser during the first world war to keep the german troops at a distance and fig 1 shows this geometry of the sp cemt i or cogge together with its body fixed reference frame where the x axis points to the bow y axis to starboard and the z axis downwards additionally fig 2 a depicts a convoy of four cemt i barges being pushed by a manned push boat and b shows the ku leuven scale model of such a self propelled barge deployed as a usv it is impossible to physically board the cogge hence making it a usv by raw definition nevertheless it would be possible to board and steer its real size counterpart this discrepancy in operational modes may lead to some confusion between unmanned and autonomous as both adjectives are not mutually exclusive in this context similarly the literature regarding surface vehicles often discusses both asvs and usvs interchangeably bertram 2008 manley 2008 campbell et al 2012 liu et al 2016 moreover the exact meaning of autonomous is often vaguely described as it inherently entails different levels which may be context dependent rødseth and nordahl 2018 proposed definitions to further clarify the surface vehicle nomenclature taking into account both ship specific situations e g having a temporarily unmanned bridge on a manned vessel and different levels of autonomy fig 3 lists these autonomy levels ranging from direct physical control by the crew to fully autonomous i e unmanned without supervision together with their interactions with the vessels in this study as visualised the real size sp cemt i can be both an asv when it has crew on board and a usv when there is none moreover both vessels will be remotely steerable also making them remotely operated vehicles rovs 3 2 actuation system two key aspects motivated the actuation system selection with a focus on industrial relevance i the system should be used by existing or future inland cargo vessels and ii if possible the system should be generic both criteria were met by scaling down the propulsion system of the watertruck sp cemt i barges these barges have a novel actuation configuration enveloping a 360 degrees rotatable steering grid thruster in the bow in conjunction with a 360 degrees rotatable 4 channel thruster in the stern firstly this over actuated propulsion system is currently used by the real scale vessels and it unlocks the possibility to perform more complex manoeuvres and subsequent advanced motion control philosophies and secondly such an over actuated system can be used to mimic an under actuated system by digitally disabling or limiting certain control parameters making it a modular and generic actuation system peeters et al 2019 discuss this novel actuation combination nested inside the cogge and this section will summarise the most relevant parts from their study in order to understand the full vessel design the propulsion system is completely integrated in the hull i e no parts protrude the vessel this nested configuration generates lower manoeuvring limitations in the often spatially restricted inland waterways fig 4 shows a transparent view of the vessel with its bow and stern thruster which are discussed in section 3 2 1 and section 3 2 2 respectively 3 2 1 bow thruster the bow thruster has a kaplan series propeller without nozzle with a diameter of d b 100 m m a blade area ratio of b a 0 65 and a pitch diameter ratio of p d 0 95 this horizontally oriented propeller i e its rotational axis stands almost perpendicular to the calm water plane draws in water from underneath the hull and afterwards this water flow exits the actuator according to the orientation of the internal steering grid angle θ i b an abstract representation of this working principle is show by fig 5 for θ i b 0 and 90 for this bow thruster it is assumed that θ i b and the output angle θ o b of its resulting thrust force t b always align i e θ i b θ o b hence the chosen angle convention immediately gives the orientation of t b as the water flow exits the actuator in the opposite direction fig 6 shows the measured thrust forces linearly extrapolated at different rotational speeds of its propeller n b and different θ i b these data were measured without an enveloping ship hull and without any ship velocity hence external hull losses and wake influences are not incorporated a significant loss in t b emerges at θ i b θ o b 150 180 which might be explained by the possible occurrence of a closed loop system of circulating water as the outlet angle θ o b of the exiting water stream is oriented towards the propeller 3 2 2 stern thruster the stern actuation operates with a slightly larger but geometrically similar propeller of diameter d s 150 m m fig 7 demonstrates the basic working principle of this actuation system half a sphere with an opening of approximately 85 stands above the propeller and can be controlled by its internal angle θ i s in order to orient the outflow of water through one of the four channels or through a superposition of two experimental data were fetched with the stern thruster nested inside half a ship hull transversal cut at midship at zero velocity in a towing tank hence the main external hull losses were incorporated and no wake influences were present fig 8 depicts the arising thrust forces at different propeller speeds n s and different θ i s which were measured on both the longitudinal axis t x s and the transversal axis t y s of the actuation system the data indicate two main non linearities one at θ i s 60 120 for t x s and the other at θ i s 150 180 for t x y the resulting stern thrust force t s and its output angle θ o s can be calculated as follows 1 t s n s θ i s t x s n s θ i s 2 t y s n s θ i s 2 θ o s arctan t y s t x s the mapping of the resulting θ o s on the requested θ i s as shown by fig 9 shows that the abovementioned non linearities have a large effect on the orientation of t s as these constant thrust zones reappear at the same angle intervals 60 120 and 150 180 the exact cause of this non linearity is hard to uncover but some of the likely contributors seem to be i the difference in length and shape of the four channels ii the potentially remaining angular velocity of the water inside the system and iii the internal reflections of the water stream in the xy plane when θ i s 0 90 180 or 90 3 3 component selection the selection of robust industrial and marine grade components where possible further increased the industrial relevance of the vessel table 2 reflects these design choices by listing the main components of the cogge and its associated shoreside infrastructure and fig 10 shows their location on the cogge as can be seen both the control hardware programmable logic controller industrial computer industrial router and the sensors have an industrial level that could be transferred to a real size vessel in this manner the cogge can experiment with a configuration that could be used by real size inland vessels during their normal operations the power supply to feed all these components consists of two batteries although the lower energy density of the current battery technology introduces a significant weight and price penalty compared to a fuel based system it was judged to be more convenient to use for the scale model for three main reasons i less noise and vibrations ii no local emissions near researchers and iii the vessel can be charged by a 220 230 v ac power supply in a few hours a detailed implementation of this charge system can be found in the appendix this fully electric drive train causes a difference between the cogge and the first batch of sp cemt i vessels which can use a hybrid system enveloping both batteries and diesel generators to power their electrical engines this hybrid system aligns with the growing research field looking into hybrid propulsion systems for vessels kalikatzarakis et al 2018 which might cause a change in the default drive train layouts of future vessels 3 4 modular hardware and software the fourth and final industrially relevant design aspect was achieved by focussing on a modular system design on both the hardware and software level by doing so the final construction of the cogge remains flexible as different hardware components could be tried out in the future or added to the current design and different autonomy software could control the vessel or different motion control philosophies could run in the current autonomy software 3 4 1 modular hardware three main subsystems form the overarching hardware and subsequent communication architecture an actuation control subsystem a sensor and autonomy subsystem and a shoreside subsystem fig 11 illustrates their vital inter and intra communication links the actuation control subsystem houses a second level of modularity induced by the nested plc topology this plc controls the lowest level desired actuation system states i e n b n s θ i b and θ i s and these states can be communicated to the plc via currently three devices i the remote control over a radio link ii a web interface over mobile or wireless internet and iii the onboard industrial computer over a modbus tcp ip connection after the reception of these desired system states the plc will communicate these states to their appropriate actuation system drivers which will then using their internal control loops drive these states to their desired value in this fashion two motor drives control n b and n s a stepper motor with an integrated encoder controls θ i b whereas the stepper motor for θ i s and its complementary encoder are currently two separated entities but they will be replaced by one entity in the future which will be added on the can fieldbus furthermore this cascaded configuration makes the plc the heart of the vessel and exploits its industrial robustness to control the desired system states this lay out achieves an increased level of operational redundancy which is paramount for industrial applications the industrial computer forms the core of the sensor and autonomy subsystem on the one hand it receives the sensor information currently gnss global navigation satellite system imu inertial measurements unit camera and lidar laser imaging detection and ranging and on the other hand it runs the autonomy software see section 3 4 2 which can use this sensor information to provide the motion control see section 5 of the cogge the third and final hardware subsystem accumulates all the shoreside infrastructure which currently consists of the rugged shoreside laptop and a remote control the latter provides the possibility for manual control of the vessel as it is not possible to board the cogge whereas the shoreside laptop provides further visual feedback as it can communicate with the onboard processes the remote control has two physical joysticks to steer the propeller speeds and control angles of the actuation systems note that these variables can also be set via a web interface 3 4 2 modular software an autonomy system nested on the i pc can also control the vessel instead of a human modularity and genericness formed two of the key design choices for the selection of this autonomy software therefore an open source cross platform software suite was chosen named mission oriented operations suite moos newman 2005 this moos software provides internal asynchronous publish subscribe communication between moos applications moosapps which are small modular software entities c via its database moosdb and can be used for robotic research in general encompassing this moos core benjamin et al 2010 wrote a marine oriented expansion of this software called moos interval programming or moos ivp which takes advantage of the backseat driver paradigm this backseat paradigm separates the vehicle navigation and control parts from its autonomy system making the latter research platform independent this paradigm implementation further increases the modularity and genericness of the control architecture of the cogge furthermore on the cogge the control architecture consists of three cascaded levels coined high middle and low level control which will be discussed in section 5 4 environment interactions an unmanned or automated vessel needs to perceive and interact with its environment in order to navigate for the purpose of understanding the environmental settings in which the vessel could sail the authors made the following arbitrary differentiation based on the present obstacles where obstacles envelop both the waterway infrastructure such as bridges locks quays waterway cross section and other vessels i static known obstacles ii static unknown obstacles iii dynamic known obstacles and iv dynamic unknown obstacles here the adjective known means that information geometry position orientation potential velocity about the object is available and the opposite holds for the unknown objects from the moment that one object in the environment is unknown or dynamic the environment changes to its associated description it is readily understood that other environmental differentiations could be made depending on the preferred level of analysis of the researcher these four environments seem to demand different sensor capabilities from the vessel on the one hand and different risk and safety analyses on the other hand the former should provide the vessel with both navigational information and perception of its ambient environment respectively discussed in the subsequent sections 4 1 and 4 2 an in depth discussion of the latter falls out of the scope of this study nevertheless observe that there is movement in this research area for example megumi and susumu 2019 investigated how to introduce autonomous maritime vessels into the existing international maritime organisation imo regulations and thieme et al 2018 investigated the applicability of 64 existing ship risk models for ship ship collisions ship structure collisions and groundings for autonomous marine vessels the latter concluded that for a more detailed system evaluation more information regarding the usv concept needs to be known valdez banda et al 2019 complementarily noted the major challenge of ensuring the safety of a usv in its operational context given the limited experience with functioning usvs therefore they analysed the safety hazards for two ferries in their current operational modes and in their potential autonomous deployments finally the inclusion of a shore control centre to monitor or remotely steer a usv further complicates the risk analyses by introducing human system interactions unfortunately here too a deficiency in the amount of research considering such human system interactions and potential human failures was noted by abilio ramos et al 2019 consequently they studied how humans in a shore control centre could form a key component for successful collision avoidance by uncovering their potential tasks and the impact of the possible human failures to perform these considering that a common denominator over these recent usv risks analyses seems to be the scarcity of operational usv concepts the developments in this study aim to provide these data and insights to nurture future developments in this area accordingly the risk assessments of our study were mainly focused on the lower technical level i e implementing levels of redundancy in the vessel hardware selecting industrially robust components having the ability to remotely control the vessel and implementing emergency stops in addition the relatively small weight and slow manoeuvring speeds add to a higher safety during the conducted experiments apart from these technical safety measures the flemish waterway administrator and by extent the flemish government have taken an active role in the discussions regarding safety and regulations during the experiments conducted with our scale model vessel they achieved this role by defining monitoring and continuously optimizing a legal framework for testing and demonstration purposes with autonomous inland vessels 4 1 navigational information the navigational information such as position orientation velocity etc can be fetched by a standalone gnss sensor or a gnss and an imu separately or an imu with integrated gnss corrections although the vessel desires a high accuracy from these sensors the preciseness of their measurements can be influenced in practical applications due to environmental noise sensor drift and sensor faults liu et al 2016 moreover the quality of gnss signals will drop in the vicinity of tall buildings wang et al 2012 or in the case of inland vessels imperfect gnss signals will occur in the neighbourhood of bridges locks quays or other large vessels unfortunately these are the situations where the highest accuracy would be desired a first solution to diminish the effect of sensor faults and the impact of environmental noise is to install state of the art marine grade sensors doing so a gnss and imu of which the specifications are discussed in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 were selected and installed the fusion of their data forms a second solution to increase their performance currently an extended kalman filter ekf based on the vessel kinematics improves the accuracy of the navigational data our future work aims at including the hydrodynamics of the vessel in a model based ekf as for example in caccia et al 2008 tran et al 2014 4 2 environment perception complementary to the necessity of accurate navigational information an unmanned vessel needs to be aware of its surroundings which the authors divided into the aforementioned four separate cases i e i iv in the ideal environment of known static obstacles and low or no environmental disturbances an imu and gnss should suffice to autonomously navigate the vessel however in order to perceive an unknown static object and its relative distance a stereo camera lidar radar radio detection and ranging or a similar range measuring sensor has to be installed lidar and or stereo camera based object detection has been a growing research field for indoor environments and the current research also expands towards larger outdoor environments often forcing the sensor to collect data at a greater distance with a lower density grant et al 2019 although several successful studies have demonstrated the simultaneous localisation and mapping of an agent in a static environment and some studies even implemented obstacle avoidance e g hsu and shiu 2019 zhang and singh 2017 mousazadeh et al 2018 costa et al 2016 it remains to be investigated which sensor set and their minimum required specifications is deemed necessary to achieve this goal on the inland waterways for cargo vessels moreover a supplementary challenge arises with the addition of dynamic objects as these also move or navigate in the ambient area and thus collision needs to be avoided an implementation of a colreg compliant collision avoidance for dynamic objects can be found in benjamin 2017 here the autonomous fleet can share navigational information with other autonomous vessels using the same nested moos ivp software hence making all the dynamic objects known given the fact that the cogge uses the moos ivp software the usability of its obstacle avoidance implementation for inland waterways will be investigated via simulations in future work given the modularity of the software design other collision avoidance strategies could also be implemented another example of an environment with known dynamic objects can be found in the hull to hull h2h navigation project kotzé et al 2019 berge et al 2019 which also involves test cases with the cogge in this project vessels share their navigational information and its uncertainty over a proprietary communication channel in order to perform close proximity encounters see section 6 4 in addition some navigational information of known dynamic obstacles can be fetched from the ais data nevertheless in reality not all vessels use their ais nor do all vessels have such a system and different smaller waterway users can enter the operational environment of an unmanned vessel unlocking the need of the detection and tracking of unknown dynamic objects in comparison with their terrestrial and aerial robotic counterparts there seem to be two main differences on the one hand most of the to be tracked objects tend to be larger in size exhibiting slower dynamics which could lower the complexity of tracking these objects however on the other hand this also means that the objects have higher inertias and thus slower response times so the collision avoidance algorithms will need to operate and predict over a longer time horizon this is a non trivial task that needs to build its foundation on the results of i iii and consequently its complexity falls out of the scope of this study 4 3 selected sensors for the cogge during the first research stages good weather conditions are presumed for the sensor selection later on the additional complexity of bad weather conditions can be added keeping this assumption in mind and based on the ongoing research mentioned above the authors currently plan to investigate the usability of the sensor sets listed in table 3 for the different environments the following sections describe the selected onboard sensors gnss imu lidar and stereo cameras and some intermediate results can be studied further down in section 6 the h2h proprietary communication protocols and media are not yet finalised nor is an ais currently installed thus both systems will not be discussed in detail bear in mind that it is not unlikely that additional sensors will be added in the future depending on the findings and possible limitations of the current sensor sets on top of that the achieved results in these environments can also help the development of more automated manned vessels for example these developments in the perception of the environment could guide augment or replace certain tasks currently performed by the onboard crew 4 3 1 gnss the installed asterx u marine gnss sensor septentrio 2017 can operate in temperatures ranging from 30 to 65 c and has an ip67 rated housing making it a robust sensor for inland vessels on the cogge it uses two mushroom antennas separated by a baseline of approximately 4 44 m to receive multi frequency and multi constellation gnss signals this way it can benefit from the more accurate european galileo constellation while still being able to use additional constellations to boost its convergence time and accuracy li et al 2015 furthermore it includes a ultra high frequency radio bluetooth wifi and a cellular modem this cellular connection allows for the reception of real time kinematic rtk corrections langley 1998 for the gnss signals drastically improving the accuracy of its navigational data table 4 summarises the impact of these rtk corrections on the performance of this sensor together with other accuracies as shown the correction accuracy depends on the distance between the sensor and the nearest rtk base station for example for the horizontal position the absolute accuracy results in 0 6 cm 0 05 cm per km of distance from the base station flanders currently has 45 base stations installed ensuring a dense coverage and freely provides these rtk corrections over mobile internet via the flemish positioning service flepos 2019 4 3 2 imu the ekinox 2 e imu sensor can operate in the temperature range of 40 to 75 c and has an ip68 rating 24 h submersible at 2 m sbg 2018 this imu uses three gyroscopes and three accelerometers to measure the angular velocities and linear accelerations of the vessel moreover it can provide additional information regarding the position orientation and linear speeds of the vessel by means of single or double time integration an internal kinematic ekf can be used to compensate for the imu drift shown by fig 12 the internal ekf predicts states at 200 hz based on the integration of its gyroscopes and accelerometers and these states get a corrective step at 1 hz provided by gnss data from the asterx u an ekinox 2 e software module first checks the integrity of this gnss data and pulls it through its proprietary error model before sending it to the ekf the line of sight between the tracked satellites and the gnss mushrooms will be disturbed and potentially blocked when for example passing a bridge consequently it is of paramount importance for an unmanned vessel to still receive reliable navigational information during this time span table 5 demonstrates two examples of the importance of the ekf by listing its accuracy in function of the elapsed time since a corrective gnss signal was received 0s 10s and 30s logically the accuracy diminishes the longer a gnss outage lasts nevertheless the ekinox 2 e is still capable to produce useful data during these shorter outages which align with the typical time of passing under a bridge furthermore the imu computes and publishes the accuracies of its predicted states so that an autonomy system could take this into account 4 3 3 lidar the opal 1000 lidar has no external moving parts sits in an ip67 housing and can operate in 40 to 40 c neptec 2019 the laser scanner measures a panoramic field of view of 360 in the horizontal plane and 45 in the vertical plane at a maximum rate of 300 000 pulses per second with a maximum range of 1000 m it can penetrate obscurants such as dust snow rain fog and smoke by using its patented algorithm which uses 7 pulses to measure one point moreover it can also be connected to and synced with the imu and gnss in order to perform scans while the vessel is moving 4 3 4 cameras a computer vision technology company named vision provided the tailored stereo camera system vision 2019 this system consists of two industrial cameras positioned on the port and starboard side of the bow sensor rail most conventional commercially available systems have a maximum distance of 40 cm between both cameras whereas on the cogge they have a baseline of 60 cm which provides an optimal depth sight at a distance of approximately 15 20 m i e 3 4 times the length of our scale model these cameras have a frame rate of 22 frames per second a pixel class of 5 megapixel and a power over ethernet connection which simplifies the power and communication requirements when creating stereoscopic images it is crucial that the images provided by both cameras are taken simultaneously hence in the current set up the cameras are connected to each other via a proprietary wire allowing one camera to trigger the other camera on receipt of the command to record an image the camera software suite controls the cameras and allows the user to fine tune the settings of the cameras to optimize their exposure in addition the software supplied by vision enables the extraction of 3 dimensional point cloud data from a stereo camera image specifically configured for an inland waterway environment this is to be used in conjunction with the point cloud data produced by the lidar but raw camera images will also be used to aid environment perception and obstacle detection 5 motion control as explained in section 3 4 2 three levels of control make up the total software design for the motion control of the vessel fig 13 summarises the main interactions between these three low middle and high control levels for an example configuration when the cogge follows a list of waypoints these three control levels are further clarified by sections 5 1 5 2 and 5 3 with reference to fig 13 5 1 high level control the high level control covers the top level route planning for example the determination of the route to be taken between two cities currently an in house developed waypoint generator forms a static list of waypoints between a configured start and endpoint on a river or canal this developed generator uses the openstreetmaps openstreetmap contributors 2019 database in order to fetch the global coordinates from the chosen waterway the generator places waypoints in the middle of the waterway and the maximum distance between two consecutive waypoints can be specified by the user finally the result can be downloaded as a plain text file and be used as to be tracked waypoints by the middle level control 5 2 middle level control the moos ivp autonomy system provides the foundation for the middle level control for the cogge three main components form the core of this autonomy system a collection of moosapps the autonomy decision making ivp helm which is a moosapp on its own and the moosdb for their communication to configure the ivp helm the user can write or use a set of behaviors that the vessel should follow for example follow waypoints and maintain a certain speed these behaviors have ivp functions defined by the user which span over their decision space e g heading speed moreover the user can also decide when a particular behavior should occur by configuring the mission modes the ivp helm will calculate the optimal system states depending on the different behaviors and their weighted ivp functions more in depth information can be found in benjamin et al 2010 continuing with the illustrative configuration of fig 13 the ivp helm could be configured to for example solely follow waypoints by using the moos ivp waypoint following behavior this behavior needs a list of waypoints to follow which in this case will be provided by the aforementioned high level control next the ivp helm needs navigational information e g the current heading and speed to calculate the desired heading and speed for the cogge to reach the following waypoint this information flow illustrates the backseat control paradigm the autonomy decision making ivp helm only needs navigational information form the vessel at hand which he can treat as a black box and will then based on its internal behavior configuration provide the desired systems states for this vessel nevertheless in the control architecture of the cogge the navigation and control modules are no black boxes but also consist of several moosapps such as drivers for the sensors and the low level motion controller therefore the virtual hierarchical separation line between middle and low level control has been drawn at the level of the moosdb as some part of the autonomy system the ivp helm and its surroundings form the middle level control and other parts low level motion controller and sensor drivers form the low level control and vehicle navigation system 5 3 low level control the low level control diminishes the error between the desired and current system states e g the heading and speed the former states are produced by the middle level control and the latter are provided by the gnss and imu sensors currently a conventional proportional integral derivative pid controller is implemented as a moosapp to control the heading and total speed of the vessel hence to control the cogge in two degrees of freedom on the water plane the pid controller is a well known simple and robust controller often used in maritime applications although more advanced controllers exist which take the kinematics into account as discussed in for example do and pan 2009 and fossen 2011 nevertheless the performance of this pid controller can be used as a benchmark for the future implementation of more sophisticated control philosophies finally the plc receives the output of the pid controller i e the desired control system states n b n s θ i b θ i s communicates with their respective drivers and sends back their current values see section 3 4 1 6 results and discussion this section analyses some of the first experiments conducted with the cogge first section 6 1 demonstrates a few open loop experiments to uncover some of the basic hydrodynamic capabilities of the vessel these trials were performed on the small lake of rotselaar belgium afterwards the subsequent sections discuss a few different environment interactions in the aforementioned differentiated cases i ii and iii 6 1 open loop rotselaar lake 6 1 1 straight sailing during the first open loop tests the cogge showed an asymmetric course behaviour when the vessel was commanded to sail straight e g giving solely the stern an rpm i e n s 0 and n b θ i b θ i s 0 it seemed to show a repetitive asymmetric behaviour which turned the vessel to starboard presently it is hard to discover the exact cause of this behaviour a first empirical solution was to place a honeycomb like flow straightener in the longitudinal direction of the stern side outlet of the stern thruster to straighten its exiting water flow when sailing straight ahead fig 14 displays the effect of this flow straightener on the straight line sailing capacity of the vessel the black lines show the first experiments without flow straightener whereas the red lines show similar experiments but with the flow straightener inserted in the stern outlet note how the black lines show a high curvature due to the asymmetric behaviour whereas the red lines show a more linear sailing behaviour over longer spatial slots the differences in length between all curves are due to different requested propeller speeds and time spans of the missions the installation of this flow straightener significantly improved the straight line stability of the vessel which can also be felt when the remote control is used to steer the vessel 6 1 2 pseudo spiral manoeuvre to investigate the possible turning rates of the cogge a pseudo spiral manoeuvre was performed this manoeuvre slightly differs form the dieudonné spiral manoeuvre dieudonné 1953 as the vessel only turned into one direction and there was a constant settling time between the rudder impulses the uncertainty of the spatial necessities for a full spiral manoeuvre pushed the decision to initially only perform such a pseudo spiral manoeuvre the manoeuvre was performed fully autonomous with the following desired settings n s 1000 r p m θ i s 0 n b 2500 r p m and θ i b varying between 4 8 20 40 60 80 hence the stern thruster was oriented to propel the vessel forward with the flow straightener installed and the bow thruster was used to steer by using a constant propeller speed but changing its outlet angle fig 15 a lists these desired system states during the whole mission as visible an arbitrarily settling time of 10 s was used this time span was chosen to be rather short in order to have the space to perform the mission but it can be increased in future tests for the same reason the first angle change occurred right from the start introducing some start up effects in the data as the vessel itself also needed to accelerate in the future a longer start up time could be introduced fig 15 b plots the measured course from the gnss and the recorded yaw rates from the imu the latter were filtered with a centered moving average filter of window size 50 finally fig 15 c plots the sailed trajectory 6 2 environment i known static obstacles 6 2 1 autonomous sailing on the yzer river the first autonomous unmanned closed loop tests were performed on the yser in nieuwpoort belgium in the context of the efro european fund for regional development project autonoom varen in de westhoek this efro project investigated the legal and technical necessities to perform a pilot demonstration of autonomous sailing with a scale model of an inland vessel in a confined demonstration area afterwards the project conducted such tests of which the described tests in this section were the first ones these preliminary tests used the control hierarchy described in section 5 moreover the map shown in the waypoint generator of fig 13 actually shows some of the generated waypoints for these experiments after the generation of the waypoints list and the implementation of the ivp helm to follow these consecutive waypoints the low level controller needs to be configured the angle of the bow thruster provided the steering mechanism for the vessel whereas the stern thruster was kept a static neutral angle this set up aligns with the configuration of section 6 1 2 and had the following settings n s 1250 r p m θ i s 0 n b 2400 r p m and θ i b 90 90 as control variable the ivp helm provided the desired heading to follow the waypoints and the imu gave the current heading the error between both headings was controlled with a manually tuned pi control on θ i b with a proportional gain factor k p 2 and an integral gain factor k i 0 2 s 1 with an integral limit of 0 7 in order to avoid integral wind up fig 16 summarises two parts of autonomous sailing on the yser a b and c show a fragment of a straight part on the yser whereas d e and f show a sample of a bend of the yser whilst passing under a bridge these two samples are also visible on the map of fig 13 where the red line is the highway bridge under which the vessel sailed in d the plotted waypoints of a and d have a higher density than the waypoints of fig 13 as for the latter the amount of visible waypoints was decreased to increase the readability of the figure next plots b and e show the measured propeller speeds on the one hand and the measured control angle θ i b on the other hand finally c and f show the desired heading published by the ivp helm and the current heading fetched from the imu note that these headings are shown within the boundaries of 180 180 which causes the sudden change from 180 to 180 in f as demonstrated by these six subplots the vessel was able to follow the waypoints on both a straight and curved trajectory 6 3 environment ii unknown static obstacles 6 3 1 lidar scans fig 17 illustrates a static scan with an exposure of 5 min at the small inland leisure harbour of leuven belgium where the lidar was placed on the shoreside on the left side of this image a few moored leisure craft can be seen fig 18 shows the accumulated data of an approximately 1 min scan while the vessel was slowly sailing the left hand side plots the raw lidar data using a color code from red to blue to denote the decreasing intensity of the measured points and thus increasing distance relative to the lidar the right hand side of the figure plots the manual overlay of the lidar data now in black on the local geographical map of the lake of rotselaar where these data were fetched hence for this configuration the lidar was mounted on the vessel and had access to the imu data during the exposure time a wind surfing class was also present on the water which resulted in the ghost points on the water close to the top of the image 6 3 2 stereo camera images fig 19 depicts two simultaneously taken images of the stereo camera system the visible railway bridge lies at the coordinates 50 54 01 5 n 4 42 23 9 e as mentioned in section 4 3 4 these images can be used to extract depth data of the surrounding environment the images were taken on a rainy day where water droplets eventually made it onto the lenses resulting in the blurred result this effect of the weather shows the importance of using more than one perception system and hints at the future research challenges when the effects of bad weather conditions are added 6 3 3 in operation communication data rates the following data rates indicate the measured data consumptions during the experiments discussed in section 6 evidently they depend on the configuration of certain sensor parameters in order to avoid confusion two separate network loops can be detailed i the local network i e communication between the sensors and the onboard i pc and ii wireless vessel to shore communication i e where certain data could be transmitted between the onboard i pc and the shoreside r pc in the first case both the gnss and imu consume less than 1 mbps megabit per second the lidar uses approximately 5 mbps when it spins on one sixth of its maximum frequency and given that each camera can produce 5 megapixel images at 22 frames per second they could theoretically each approximately produce a maximum data rate of 330 mbps which they can each transmit over a category seven ethernet cable in the second case when one wants to stream some of these data wirelessly to another device there are currently two options available via the onboard router using the cellular network or using a wireless local area network wlan note that this router has a theoretical maximum bandwidth of 150 mbps on top of that the current cellular 4g network has a claimed maximum bandwidth of 100 mbps however this number is highly environment dependent and a conservative bandwidth of 5 15 mbps was noticed to be more representative for the possible regime data rates at our testing locations during the experiments there was always a wireless communication between the onboard moos processes and the moos processes on a remote laptop which triggered and monitored their onboard counterparts the frequency and the content of these vessel to shore communications can be chosen and was never larger than 1 mbps hence it was always possible to transmit these data over the cellular network the authors plan to add a second separated local network to route all the data coming from the perception sensors together with a second i pc to process all these data and a second router to transmit this data if desired 6 4 environment iii known dynamic obstacles in the european horizon 2020 project hull to hull h2h the cogge will be deployed in an environment with known dynamic objects kotzé et al 2019 this h2h concept uses uncertainty zones to visualise the relative positioning between h2h compliant vessels berge et al 2019 this project is a cooperation between kongsberg seatex as no sintef ocean as no sintef digital no mampaey offshore industries nl and ku leuven be the h2h project has received funding from the european gnss agency under the european union s horizon 2020 research and innovation programme grant agreement no 775998 7 conclusions and future work this paper discussed the design of an experimental platform which aims to help study the feasibility and current or future limitations of unmanned inland cargo vessels the authors believe that the developed platform can provide indispensable technological information which can steer the investigation of possible business cases for more automated or unmanned inland cargo vessels to achieve this goal the focus was put on the three following design aspects i industrial relevance the newly introduced fleet of self propelled watertruck barges inspired the design of the scale model and its size fits the research potential for urban water freight transport furthermore the over actuated propulsion system which has two 360 degrees steerable thrusters offers the possibility of advanced motion control philosophies while it can also serve to mimic under actuated propulsion systems in addition the selection of marine grade industrially robust state of the art sensors offer insights for vessels in real operation and could even be transferred to a real size vessel with minimal necessary changes finally the focus on modularity in both the hardware and software design offers redundancy genericness and facilitates further research ii interactions with the environment the perception of and the interaction with different environments were split into four cases handling known or unknown static or dynamic obstacles afterwards the technological challenges for these environments were examined which resulted in the selected sensor sets and their specifications complementary preliminary results for environments i ii and iii were presented iii motion control the cascaded motion control philosophy consisting of three levels provides the flexibility to study different implementations of these distinct levels moreover the instrumented backseat driver paradigm makes the decision making part of the motion control vessel independent an experiment conducted on the yzer river illustrated the successful implementation of the cascaded motion control design ranging from the human scheduling input to the lowest actuation control signals controlled by the plc in conclusion the integration of these design aspects resulted in the blueprint for an unmanned inland cargo vessel which successfully performed preliminary unmanned and autonomous experiments although these experiments were fruitful further improvements will be key to study the potential of operating unmanned inland cargo vessels therefore some of the on going research of the authors is currently oriented towards i the modelling and identification of both propulsion systems with a special focus on the thrust deduction losses due to the fact that both propellers are completely nested inside the hull and rotate in a plane parallel with the calm water plane ii the identification of hydrodynamic motion models which could serve as plant or control models depending on their complexity iii the development of advanced low middle and high level motion controllers where the full flexibility and or identification of the actuation system at hand can be used iv the further development of the perception of the environment on the basis of the selected sensor sets moreover additional sensors can be added in the future such as a weather station speed over water sensor or radar v the alignment and integration of the developed solutions with the existing ais and ris this future work list does not exhaust all the technological challenges that lie ahead but demonstrates their vast amount in order to achieve increasingly automated or even unmanned inland cargo vessels nevertheless this study validated a first working example of an unmanned inland cargo vessel operating in a priori known environment with static obstacles and provided preliminary results and

21986,recognition and understanding of ship mobility pattern have great significance for intelligent maritime applications i e route discovery and anomaly detection besides a number of pattern discovery techniques currently derived from ship trajectory topic modeling popular in the field of natural language processing may provide a novel way to detect implicit patters underlying massive ship trajectories treated as documents this paper is motivated to apply a semantic analysis method to explore potential mobility patterns from ship trajectories in inland river by combining semantic transformation and topic model a coarse grained semantic transformation model is firstly defined to translate each ship trajectory into a document containing a series of sequential motion words a motion word is generally a synthetic semantic representation of three trajectory features location course and speed all ship trajectories can then be examined and analyzed as a document corpus a classic topic model i e latent dirichlet allocation lda is employed to explore hidden ship mobility patterns from trajectory document corpus the effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through a case study at wuhan waterway located at middle stream of yangtze river in china keywords ship mobility pattern topic modeling automatic identification system trajectory analysis 1 introduction ships are the major objects of water traffic activities recognition and understanding of ship mobility pattern have great significance for intelligent maritime applications pallotta et al 2013 scrofani et al 2015 such as ship navigation safeguarding marine risk assessment route customization and optimization etc traditional methods of ship behavior recognition through artificial observation have characteristics of time consuming high cost difficulty and limited supervision scope moreover behavior recognition results depend on background knowledge and professional experiences of maritime administrator guillarme and lerouvreur 2013 zhang and tang 2015 the increasingly growing of ship type and ship quantity leads to a powerful challenge of water traffic safety for maritime supervisors manual observation methods in both efficiency and precision cannot meet the needs of maritime situation awareness and safety supervision thanks to healthy development of maritime information construction many available monitoring sensors like ais automatic identification system and vts vessel traffic service have been broadly deployed to monitor the ship behavior and traffic safety massive trajectory datasets recording ship movements with multiple navigation characteristics have been collected these trajectories provide a novel way to explore the laws of ship movements and identify valuable mobility patterns by data analysis applying data driving method instead of manual observation will expand the breadth and depth of ship mobility pattern recognition rong et al 2015 and also improve the availability of ship trajectory dataset ma et al 2014 therefore how to effectively detect various ship mobility patterns from large scale trajectory data has become an important issue in the field of maritime transportation a variety of methods have been put forward to identify ship mobility pattern from trajectory data plenty of quantitative methods based on numeric calculation such as statistical analysis bayesian network and machine learning can classify different ship movements explicitly from a given trajectory dataset their results can clearly show the categories of ship movements but fail to interpret or describe the meaning of each movement pattern in addition it is increasingly difficult to perform model parameter training and selection as data volume grows which has a great effect on the accuracy and completeness of results then a group of scholars migrate visualization analysis to explore ship mobility patterns from trajectories in an interactive way visual symbols instead of numeric values are used to provide more intuitive representation of ship trajectories from multiple dimensions in this way human experience will be imported to discover and describe ship movement patterns and their meanings or characteristics visualization analysis method poses a higher requirement on human interaction and professional experiences the results are therefore open up to human subjectivity to deal with the problems above some researchers try to introduce knowledge discovery methods to automatically obtain meaningful mobility patterns from ship trajectory a number of ontology modeling and inference approaches dragos 2016 vandecasteele and napoli 2012 have been successfully applied to identify maritime patterns and detect anomaly behavior from ship trajectory data but it will take much effort to carry out knowledge modeling in a word there is a lack of balance between the explicable mobility patterns and modeling effort in existing methods topic model is a popular method of latent semantic extraction in the field of natural language processing it is widely used to extract topic information from textual document the topic can provide a good description of the characteristics of the corresponding document moreover less effort will be made to topic modeling compared to ontology modeling and other knowledge discovery methods as a result recent studies recently apply topic model to explore the thematic information from massive taxi trajectories chu et al 2014 huang et al 2017 the scholars make an analog between taxi trajectories and textual documents raw taxi gps trajectories have been translated into street name based taxi movement documents by matching gps points to urban streets then topic model can be used to uncover latent topic information from taxi movement documents each topic is actually a mobility pattern which provides a semantic description of taxi movement motivated by previous works this study proposes a semantic analysis method to identify mobility patterns of ship trajectories in the inland river by combining semantic transformation and topic model semantic transformation is responsible for translating raw ship trajectories into available text documents by definition of semantic descriptions of three trajectory features location speed and course after that topic model can be employed to capture semantic relationships among trajectory text documents and detect various document topics each document topic stands as a different kind of ship mobility pattern the reason why semantic analysis is used at the inland river scale is that the scenario of ships navigating in the confined inland channel is relatively similar to that of taxicabs running in the restricted motor vehicle lanes ship behaviors in the inland river are relatively regular and are easy to be translated into structured trajectory documents for topic modeling analysis the contribution of this study is to explore a lightweight but effective method of identifying mobility pattern from ship trajectory which embody the principle of balance between modeling effort and meaningful result the rest of the paper is organized as follows section ii reviewed related works of ship pattern recognition section iii illustrates semantic transformation method of ship trajectory that can be then represented by textual symbols instead of numeric values section iv introduces topic modeling of ship trajectory after semantic transformation section v presents the results analysis of case study in wuhan finally section vi draws the main conclusions 2 related works there are a number of pattern discovery and anomaly detection methods currently derived from trajectory data including statistical model bayesian network neural network visualization analysis and semantic analysis the basic idea of statistical model assumes that ship movements follow some kinds of probabilistic distributions tao et al 2018 and can be statistically obtained by probability estimation such as gaussian model and kernel density estimation ship movement is a complicated process restricted by multiple conditions including navigation environment navigation regulations etc it is difficult to depict ship motion with single probabilistic distribution mixed probabilistic distribution like gaussian mixture model has therefore been advocated to match ship motion in some researches a challenge is the determination of probabilistic distribution quantity that has direct influence of the accuracy of ship movement representation the methods mentioned above are mainly oriented towards ship trajectory data at a specific time considering the change of ship motion some scholars explore to apply dynamic modeling methods to estimate ship motion patterns such as gaussian process obradović et al 2014 extremum value theory smith et al 2013 incremental learning etc these approaches have abilities of detecting variation of ship motion to a certain extent but need spend more effort on modeling work in a word statistical based methods are in fact classification algorithms by evaluating similarities of statistical characteristics of ship trajectories the results of which lack of interpretation the method based on bayesian network represents probabilistic relationships between ship movements with a directed acyclic graph conditional probability inference is then applied to discover the general characteristics of ship movements and identify abnormal behaviors with the advantage of this approach is the integration of multiple datasets like weather time ship attributes trajectories etc facilitate the completeness and understanding of ship motion recognition mascaro et al 2014 such network is suitable to discovery of common movement patterns of massive ships but insensitive to identification of individual ship behavior but how to build valid bayesian network with volumes of trajectory data needs further researches zhang and tang 2015 compared to bayesian network neural network can better match ship movement for its good ability for nonlinear function approximation it can be used to find ship mobility pattern and identify abnormal behavior by comparing difference of ship movement at different times moreover it is capable of learning complicated classification conditions to conclude some hidden patterns the problem of this manner is its training process in a black box sort of way makes the results not easy to be understand to deal with the limitation of methods above visualization analysis method is employed to explore potential pattern knowledge from trajectories with various visual elements and representations andrienko et al 2017a riveiro et al 2017 raw ship trajectories as their statistical characteristics will be mapped into different geographic elements thematic maps or statistical diagrams to show dominant features ship mobility patterns can be directly viewed and analyzed with human interactive operations this manner introduces human cognition and experience to explore hidden ship motion patterns with visualization representation the results are therefore easily to be understanding but depend on useful visual scheme designed by users semantic analysis is another idea to identify accessible ship motion patterns based on context information riveiro et al 2018 svanberg et al 2019 such as navigation environment traffic flow hydrometeorological condition etc in this way maritime knowledge base referring to ship movements should be built and formal representation beforehand ship trajectory and its characteristics will be transformed into a series of concepts with attributes and relationships between them the available modeling technologies include ontology rule etc after that ship motion rules can be obtained through knowledge reasoning process i e genetic algorithm chen et al 2014 the datacron project as part of european union s horizon 2020 program has proposed the datacron semantic model and apply it to maritime domains and air traffic management atm andrienko and andrienko 2018 andrienko et al 2017b georgiou et al 2018 sideridis et al 2016 the project uses semantic technology to manage and integrate the heterogeneous archival data and streaming data sources the complex event detection abnormal behavior recognition and behavior forecasting using semantic methods are illustrated in the proposed datarcon model in land transportation domain there are also some semantic models focusing on the mobility pattern interpretation of different moving objects including cars bikes and pedestrians vanneschi et al 2015 integrated semantics into genetic programming and get good result on the ship trajectory prediction such idea has the advantage of integrating external knowledge to characterize ship behavior and distinguish different meanings of ship trajectories with similar movements but it needs to spend so much on the construction of knowledge database in a word statistical method and network based method have not been able to provide meaningful and understandable results visualization analysis method improves the interpretation on characteristics of ship movements but primarily relies on human operation and recognition semantic analysis method provides an novel way to identify accessible ship mobility patterns but limited to high cost of knowledge modeling in this paper topic modeling technology is applied to detect potential ship mobility patterns with less effort in an inland river in this application scene most of ships have to navigate in restricted waterways with stated rules it is a waste of resources to build complex semantic analysis model this study explores a balance between modeling effort and knowledge acquisition by migrating two algorithms semantic transformation and topic model in semantic transformation process many powerful models like spatial grid model and cone direction model used in gis geographic information science have been applied to deal with ship movements in inland river waterway in topic modeling process lda model a relatively simple model in semantic analysis has been to classify and represent different ship movements with less effort 3 trajectory segmentation and semantic transformation raw ship trajectories consist of a series of sequential sample points at different times each sample point records an instantaneous state of ship movement with multiple numeric characteristics including geographic coordinates gps timestamp sog speed of ground cog course of ground etc however these quantitative values make managers difficult to intuitively recognize and understand meanings of ship movements in this section a semantic transformation model is proposed to produce textual semantic description for ship movement instead of numeric values especially three individual transition processes are designed to extract semantic information from ship geo location sog and cog each transition process will generate a meaningful motion word to represent the specific feature then ship movement at each time will be represented by a vector of motion words which are available for topic modeling 3 1 two staged trajectory segmentation a ship trajectory may be a long and complex path in geometric feature and contain several different mobility patterns before semantic transformation stop move conceptual model is adopted to translate raw long trajectory into a set of continuous sub trajectories each sub trajectory indicates an individual ship movement between different ship stops this paper designs a two stage process for trajectory segmentation as show fig 1 in water traffic environment wind and flow have great effect on movements of both sailing ship and moored ship when a ship shuts down the engine it may still have very low speed and changed course so it is difficult to identify moves and stops of a trajectory directly based on values of movement characteristics at first stage this paper applies a cluster method called cb smot clustering based stops and moves of trajectories palma et al 2008 to identify stop marks from ship trajectory based on speed variation that is sample points in the trajectory whose speeds are lower than a given threshold for a minimal amount of time will be considered as stops then raw trajectory can be partitioned to a set of sub trajectories and groups of stop marks it is worth that this method adopts a distance measure to compute neighbors of each sample point and generate stop marks having enough neighbors as a result it is very sensitive to position drifting in the trajectory especially when a ship keeps in stop state a long position drifting will have serious effects on the clustering result to deal with this problem a distance cleansing rule is used to identify and remove inaccurate sample points in the trajectory for two consecutive points a and b the linear distance d a b can be got with their geo location coordinates that is d a b x a x b 2 y a y b 2 assuming that the ship is conducting an entire circle motion the maximum movement path should be semicircle arc a b ˆ the length of arc a b ˆ can be calculated with formula l a b ˆ π 0 5 l a b l a b is the maximum length of straight path from a to b and l a b v m δ t in which v m indicates the larger value of speeds of two points and δ t is the time interval if d a b has a greater value than l a b ˆ a position drifting may exist and point b should be removed at second stage sub trajectories will be further divided into a set of segments based on direction variation in a trajectory corner reflects the direction change of ship movement a great change of direction means a different movement compared to previous one given three consecutive points a b and c a trajectory corner can be defined as the vector angle of two vectors a b and b c that is θ cos 1 a b b c a b b c sample points in the trajectory would be viewed as subsection points where the corner angle θ is greater than a given threshold value with subsection points sub trajectories can be divided into groups of trajectory segments 3 2 extracting semantics from trajectory segments raw ship trajectories are represented as a tuple of numeric values in general however these numeric trajectories cannot be used directly for topic modeling the reason is that topic modeling not only requires textual documents as the data source but also calls for meaningful words to produce the documents in raw ship trajectories the numeric characteristics of ship location speed and course are less meaningful for human as a result textual transformation of raw ship trajectories is necessary this section will introduce how to extract semantics from raw trajectory segments of particular interest is the semantic information of ship location speed and course by semantic extraction raw numeric representation of ship trajectory can be translated into textual representation of ship movement for the following topic modeling fig 2 illustrates the process of semantic extraction of ship movement features in the process spatial grid codes and ships are combined to create so called place names to describe semantic information of ship location fuzzy sets of velocity and direction based on geographic information theory are also designed to describe semantic information of ship speed and course ship location semantic location feature marks position information of ship movement in navigable waters raw trajectory location denoted as geographic coordinates represents the meaning of space rather than ship movement different ship movements pass through the same space will generate varying semantic information for instance fishing ship and cargo ship located in fishing area mean normal work and abnormal trouble respectively this paper integrates geocoding of water with area ship type to characterize the meaning of ship location feature water area is conveniently divided into an m by n grid of non overlapped square cells as show fig 2 b each cell is recorded as c i j i and j denote row code and col code respectively then semantic description of location feature can be represented by a composition of row code col code and ship type that is s e x k y k r o w c o l t y p e let target water area be a geographic area covering 16km 8 km the partition grid is 1km 1 km and the number of ship type in collected trajectories is 5 there will be altogether 16 8 5 different semantic descriptions of ship location feature ship course semantic course feature records changes in direction while ship moves to different locations numeric course angle cannot provide intuitive cognition of direction of ship travel this paper utilizes a cone based direction model to extract semantic information of course feature as shown fig 2 c ship heading is divided to eight cone directions and each fan shape section contains a 45 degree range divided by a central axis a list of symbols have been created to as semantic expression of cone directions denoted as c o n e d i r e a s t s o u t h w e s t n o r t h s o u t h e a s t s o u t h w e s t n o r t h e a s t n o r t h w e s t for arbitrary sample point its course value will be compared to angle range of each cone direction and labelled with the matched direction symbol then semantic description of course feature can be represented as s e c k c o n e d i r ship speed semantic speed feature indicates how fast a ship travels in navigable water a ship will be considered to remain stationary if its speed value is less than 1kn in general in contrast a ship with speed more than 1kn should be in the navigation state an absolute speed value however cannot tell the variation of the pace of moving along trajectory this paper evaluates velocity value and its change to extract the meaning of ship speed feature the velocity change is issued once current v n o w deviates by more than α the formula v n o w v p r e v n o w value of speed difference between adjacent sample points to the average speed at a certain time when velocity change is less than a given threshold a ship may remain in stationary or cruising depending on its instant speed approaches zero or not in contrast a power driven ship will show greater velocity change than threshold value no matter it keeps acceleration or deceleration therefore four symbols can be defined to semantically describe ship speed change denoted as s p d c r u i s e a c c e l e r a t i o n d e c e l e r a t i o n s t a t i o n a r y for a sample point its speed value will be compared to that of previous point and be matched with corresponding semantic symbol then semantic description of speed feature can be represented as s e v k s p d 4 topic modeling of ship trajectory topic model originated from nature language process is put forward to cluster documents based on semantic similarity rather than word similarity it believes that there is a semantic feature space between bottomed word space and document space at the top which is defined as topic so named topic is similar to clustering center in traditional clustering methods i e dbscan the meaning of a topic represents main idea or thematic information of a sentence a paragraph or a document in topic model each document d i is represented as a finite mixture of an underlying set of topics called document topic distribution d i t 1 t 2 t n each topic is also characterized by a distribution of words named a topic word distribution t i w 1 w 2 w m both document topic and topic word follow the dirichlet distribution different words occurring frequently in documents will be clustered into the same topic and the implication of which depends on word meanings for ship a long trajectory can be viewed as a document consisting of multiple mobility topics each topic is depicted by a group of motion words here motion word is actually a snapshot of ship motion state a group of snapshots thus can reflect some mobility patterns of ship fig 3 provides an analogy with discovering movement patterns from ship trajectories and learning topics from documents in this study latent dirichlet allocation lda a widely used topic model is utilized to analyze and identify movement patterns from ship trajectory after semantic transformation 4 1 textual representation of trajectory raw ship trajectories are represented as a tuple of numeric values such geometrical representation however is not suitable for textual document oriented topic modeling based on semantic transformation introduced in section 4 we can obtain textual representation of ship trajectory by construction of trajectory dictionary trajectory dictionary defines a set of motion words used to depict ship motion state in writing each motion word is a comprehensive expression of ship location semantic ship speed semantic and ship course semantic denoted as m w r o w c o l t y p e c o n e d i r s p d according to the quantization process of these three features there can be a total of n p n v n c motion words in the trajectory dictionary here n p is the number of words depicting ship location features it depends on the size of research area and granularity of grid for space partition as well as ship categories n v and n c are constant number of words depicting ship speed feature and ship course feature in this article these two values vary with detailed semantic modeling methods on velocity and direction in this paper two relatively coarse gained semantic modeling method are used to deal with ship speed and ship course in a practical application the specific number of motion words depends on application scene and the request of expression ability of topic model trajectory document is a literal expression of continuous ship movements with a group of motion words a trajectory document can be represented as a list of motion words generally there are two ways to build ship trajectory document one way is to take individual ship as a target and create trajectory document based on continuous movements of the ship in a period the obtained document is a collection of individual ship behaviors performed in multiple places at different time it benefits the discovery of similarities of different ship movements and the exploration of common trajectory patterns another way takes individual tiny area as a target movements of all ship in which contribute to the generation of trajectory document the target area can be a region of interest defined by user or a basic space unit of particular space partition model i e grid model this way is suitable to discover functional or geographic similarities of regions through ship activities in this article the first way is adopted to produce trajectory documents by replacing raw ship movements with motion words 4 2 lda topic model latent dirichlet allocation lda is a widely used topic model with the capacity to capture multiple topics and deduce the effective topic features fig 4 represents probabilistic graphical model of lda feng and fu 2018 grey circles represent the observable variables and white circles are variables boxes represent collections of variables in the figure k is the number of topics n is the number of words in the document m is the number of documents to analyze α is the dirichlet prior concentration parameter of the per document topic distribution and β is the same parameter of the per topic word distribution these two corpus level parameters are only sampled once for total documents ϕ k is the word distribution for topic k and θ i is the topic distribution for document i w i j denotes the j th word in the i th document z i j represents the topic assignment for the word w i j in lda a ship trajectory dataset is assumed as a collection of m trajectory document denoted as d t d 1 t d 2 t d m each trajectory document t d is represented as a limited series of motion words that is t d m w 1 m w 2 m w n where m w k is the k th motion word in the series obviously trajectory documents have similar movements will share motion words of the same category such a category of motion words semantically indicates a type of ship movement pattern which means a topic of ship trajectory according to this assumption the process of generating a trajectory document td for a ship trajectory dataset d is as follows step 1 calculating multi nominal distribution of topics based on dirichlet distribution that is θ d i r α where α is the dirichlet prior concentration parameter and θ is the parameter of multi nominal distribution of generating topics step 2 generating a topic based on multi nominal distribution parameter θ that is z n m u l t i n o m i a l θ step 3 selecting a movement word mw n from multi nominal distribution p m w n z n β based on the generated topic z n that is m w n p m w n z n β step 4 constantly repeating step 2 and step 3 to generate a trajectory document td in the above process each ship trajectory document td will be modeled as a composition of k topics which is known as a fixed value each topic z k is modeled as a multinomial distribution of v motion words denoted as β k β k 1 β k 2 β k v where β k i p m w i z k means conditional probability of each movement word mw i in a given topic z k so that parameter β can be represented as a k v matrix and parameter α referring to dirichlet distribution of ship trajectory dataset can be expressed as α α 1 α 2 α k each α k p z k means probability of specific potential topic z k by applying lda model to trajectory documents with suitable parameters two outcome probability distributions can be obtained that are trajectory topic probability distribution and topic movement word probability distribution trajectory topic probability distribution a ship trajectory may have one or more mobility patterns that are topics each topic z k contributes to a ship trajectory t d j to a different degree denoted as p z k d j a trajectory s probabilities over all topics should sum up to 1 i e z k d j 1 topic movement word probability distribution each mobility pattern topic is in fact a probability distribution of movement words denoted as z k p m w 1 z k p m w i z k p w n z k in which p w i z k represents the probability of a movement word m w i generating the topic z k if a threshold probability δ is defined all movement words with probabilities larger than the threshold value could be considered as representative movement for the mobility pattern topic z k 5 experiment and result analysis 5 1 experimental area and data to validate the proposed methodology a case study was conducted at wuhan waterway located at middle stream of the yangtze river china the selected research area is similar to a rectangle covering a geographic extent from 114 15 36 e to 114 19 48 e 30 32 49 n to 30 36 36 n fig 5 this area is an intersection waterway of the han river and the yangtze river in wuhan ship trajectory data has been collected from total 9422 ships in this region in jan 2014 some ships possess incomplete ship attributes which cannot be used to generate movement words in direct to enrich ship attributes ship type information has been complemented by resources on web sites based on a customized crawler and manual calibration based on the method proposed in 4 2 the whole area was meshed into many equivalent grid units 46 x 51 grid cells of size 152 8 m can be produced and applied for semantic transformation of ship location combined with symbols of speed and course there are total 300 288 motion words generated for topic modeling of ship trajectories in this region for each ship ship trajectory records were sorted by sampling time and then went through a process of semantic transformation as a result a long voyage of a ship can be viewed as a trajectory document written by motion words time by time table 1 shows examples of textual representation of three different ship trajectories including cargo tanker and other type of ship for each ship a series of motion words in order of time contributes to the corresponding trajectory document after that stanford topic modeling toolbox is used to build an lda model for all ship trajectories in this experiment the topic number is set to 10 during the training of lda model cvb0 algorithm was adopted to estimate the prior parameters in this application cvb0 in the toolbox is used to train the lda model with 1 000 iterations the topic smoothing threshold is set to 0 01 all of the parameters are optimized with 50 iterations for each mobility pattern topic the topic movement word threshold value δ is set to 1 or 0 01 in order to identify representative movements finally two valuable probability distributions can be obtained and investigated to discover meaningful ship mobility patterns and their characteristics table 2 illustrates some examples of topic probability distribution in motion words each topic contains a group of motion words with different occurrence frequency the more times a motion word appears in a topic the greater contributions it offers to generate this mobility pattern topic than other topics if a threshold probability is defined all motion words with probabilities larger than the threshold could be considered as representative words for the topic in the table four marked topics have been listed with their representative words all representative words of each topic are in order of frequency table 3 illustrates probability distributions of three different ship trajectories in total 10 topics it can be observed that a ship trajectory may have one or more mobility pattern topics each mobility pattern topic contributes to a ship trajectory to a different degree probabilities of a ship trajectory over all topics should sum up to 1 in the table topic 3 contributes to ship mmsi 413777357 with 43 44 of its movement words and topic 5 contributes to the rest of words ship mmsi 400816773 has participated in as many as 5 topics that indicates this ship adopts flexible operations in different movements in contrast ship 413771827 is mainly involved in topic 3 and slightly takes part in mobility pattern of topic 1 and topic 5 5 2 results analysis to better understand lda results topics can be spatially visualized as a collection of representative movement words fig 6 shows spatial distributions of all ten mobility pattern topics visual elements such as shape size color are used to display topics and movement words in the figure each topic is assigned to a specific color movement word in the topic is represented by a directional triangle ship symbol with a tail at specific location ship symbol size indicates the ship type which depends on ship type code specified in the ais message standard the length of symbol tail represents the ship speed long length medium length and short length represent acceleration cruise and deceleration respectively distributions of movement words in all topics can clearly show mobility patterns and dynamics of ship traffic in this water area firstly five representative topics have been extracted to paint a more explicit picture in which there are four remarkable mobility patterns at the intersection waterway of the han river and the yangtze river as shown in fig 7 the first two mobility patterns are two inverse movements in the yangtze river the topic 0 in purple color represents the movements of upstream vessels that keep the speed and direction steady when they go through the channel of the yangtze river upstream vessels mostly run along the coast of the yangtze river based on spatial distribution of the topic in contrast downstream vessels prior to navigate in the middle of the channel of the yangtze river which can be viewed from the topic 1 in brown color and the topic 3 in navy this pattern demonstrates that downstream vessels will utilize the force of water to sail since their movement directions are similar to the water flow direction of the yangtze river the other two mobility patterns are two inverse movements between the yangtze river and the han river the topic 9 in dark cyan displays how to navigate upstream from the yangtze river to the han river we can observe that the number of movement words located in the han river is much less than that in the yangtze river it is assumed that vessels may adopt more common movements in the han river than that in the yangtze river due to narrower channel boundary and lower water level the topic 8 in yellow color shows the movement voyaging downstream from the han river to lower reaches of the yangtze river when vessel comes to the yangtze river it also likes to navigate in the middle of the yangtze river for energy saving next all topics indicating the movements of upbound vessels have been put together to identify mobility patterns and valuable information as shown in fig 8 the topic 0 purple triangle the topic 2 blue triangle and the topic 4 pink triangle show three different movements of upstream cargos in the yangtze river the topic 7 orange triangle shows common movements of upstream containers in the yangtze river it can be viewed that containers going upstream move close to the middle of the channel due to the limitation of water level in contrast cargos choose to sail along the coast to reduce resistance of current cargos sometimes may be forced to turning into the middle of the channel because there may be a reach or wharf located in the coast in the topic 2 and topic 4 there are explicit course variances of cargo movements because of a ferry terminal an interesting discovery is that some movements are shared by two or three topics to avoid the visual occlusion of the same movement the authors have turned off the tail layers of the topic 0 and the topic 2 on top level of visualization after that it can be found that there are overlapped ship triangles at multiple locations such as mw 1 in fig 8 firstly there are many similar movement words like mw1 between the topic 0 and the topic 7 these movement words have the same location speed course but different ship types it can be inferred that both container and cargo may have the same movement at this area this phenomenon is not alone the topic 2 and topic 4 also have many shared movement words that have been rendered as blue ship triangles with pink tails like mw2 in fig 8 it may indicate a common mobility pattern shared by different cargos moreover authors have found that movement word mw 3 contributes to three topics including topic 2 topic 4 and topic 7 combined with background image we know that there is an inland dock nearby this movement word may be resulted from unberthing operation of ship after berthing both container and cargos possess this movement the following will show the picture of all topics representing the movements of downstream vessels in the yangtze river as shown in fig 9 the topic 1 brown triangle the topic 3 navy triangle the topic 5 blueviolet triangle and the topic 6 green triangle show similar movement trend with different routes of downstream cargos in the yangtze river ship movements in all topics try to take advantage of water flow to obtain external propulsion and choose to sail in the middle of the yangtze river as a result there are many common movement words shared by multiple topics for ease of analysis the tail layers of the topic 1 and the topic 3 on top level of visualization have been turned off it can be observed that shared movement words almost locate in the middle of the channel which are highlighted with yellow circles in addition the topic 1 and the topic 3 have no common movement words and generate a sense of spatial continuity both two topics have some shared movement words with the topic 5 at different locations it can be inferred that the topic 1 and the topic 3 together represent the movements of the same cargo type the topic 5 shows the movements of anther cargo type it is worth noting that the topic 6 is a mixed mobility pattern of cargo and container since different size green triangles can be observed in consequence applying topic modeling technology to ship trajectory is helpful and useful to explore hidden mobility patterns the results can be transformed and visualized to pieces of evidence to make the inference and interpretation compared to previous geometric methods such semantic method can provide textual representation of modeling results be easier to understand 6 conclusion this paper proposed a semantic analysis methodology to identify pattern knowledge from ship trajectories which facilitates the maritime administrators to master the characteristics of maritime traffic flow and identify abnormal behavior a semantic transformation process is firstly applied to translate raw ship trajectory into textual trajectory document by semantic descriptions of three trajectory features including ship location semantic ship course semantic and ship speed semantic each textual trajectory document is depicted by a series of motion words consisting of three trajectory feature semantics after that topic modeling technology lda is introduced to explore semantic similarities of trajectories and conclude potential thematical information to illustrate the methodology we gave a case study on trajectory topic modeling at an intersection waterway wuhan china multiple topics of ship movements have been extracted from raw ais trajectory data with the help of visualization ship motion pattern of each topic can be clearly viewed and analyzed experiment results illustrate that the proposed method is effective to trajectory pattern recognition and can provide well understood motion patterns it should be noted that there is only semantic information of few trajectory features used for topic modeling analysis in this study more information especially external environment and rules should be analyzed and imported to enrich semantic of raw trajectory in further work which is helpful to provide more meaningful interpretations of ship motion patterns author contributions section liang huang conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing yuanqiao

21986,recognition and understanding of ship mobility pattern have great significance for intelligent maritime applications i e route discovery and anomaly detection besides a number of pattern discovery techniques currently derived from ship trajectory topic modeling popular in the field of natural language processing may provide a novel way to detect implicit patters underlying massive ship trajectories treated as documents this paper is motivated to apply a semantic analysis method to explore potential mobility patterns from ship trajectories in inland river by combining semantic transformation and topic model a coarse grained semantic transformation model is firstly defined to translate each ship trajectory into a document containing a series of sequential motion words a motion word is generally a synthetic semantic representation of three trajectory features location course and speed all ship trajectories can then be examined and analyzed as a document corpus a classic topic model i e latent dirichlet allocation lda is employed to explore hidden ship mobility patterns from trajectory document corpus the effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through a case study at wuhan waterway located at middle stream of yangtze river in china keywords ship mobility pattern topic modeling automatic identification system trajectory analysis 1 introduction ships are the major objects of water traffic activities recognition and understanding of ship mobility pattern have great significance for intelligent maritime applications pallotta et al 2013 scrofani et al 2015 such as ship navigation safeguarding marine risk assessment route customization and optimization etc traditional methods of ship behavior recognition through artificial observation have characteristics of time consuming high cost difficulty and limited supervision scope moreover behavior recognition results depend on background knowledge and professional experiences of maritime administrator guillarme and lerouvreur 2013 zhang and tang 2015 the increasingly growing of ship type and ship quantity leads to a powerful challenge of water traffic safety for maritime supervisors manual observation methods in both efficiency and precision cannot meet the needs of maritime situation awareness and safety supervision thanks to healthy development of maritime information construction many available monitoring sensors like ais automatic identification system and vts vessel traffic service have been broadly deployed to monitor the ship behavior and traffic safety massive trajectory datasets recording ship movements with multiple navigation characteristics have been collected these trajectories provide a novel way to explore the laws of ship movements and identify valuable mobility patterns by data analysis applying data driving method instead of manual observation will expand the breadth and depth of ship mobility pattern recognition rong et al 2015 and also improve the availability of ship trajectory dataset ma et al 2014 therefore how to effectively detect various ship mobility patterns from large scale trajectory data has become an important issue in the field of maritime transportation a variety of methods have been put forward to identify ship mobility pattern from trajectory data plenty of quantitative methods based on numeric calculation such as statistical analysis bayesian network and machine learning can classify different ship movements explicitly from a given trajectory dataset their results can clearly show the categories of ship movements but fail to interpret or describe the meaning of each movement pattern in addition it is increasingly difficult to perform model parameter training and selection as data volume grows which has a great effect on the accuracy and completeness of results then a group of scholars migrate visualization analysis to explore ship mobility patterns from trajectories in an interactive way visual symbols instead of numeric values are used to provide more intuitive representation of ship trajectories from multiple dimensions in this way human experience will be imported to discover and describe ship movement patterns and their meanings or characteristics visualization analysis method poses a higher requirement on human interaction and professional experiences the results are therefore open up to human subjectivity to deal with the problems above some researchers try to introduce knowledge discovery methods to automatically obtain meaningful mobility patterns from ship trajectory a number of ontology modeling and inference approaches dragos 2016 vandecasteele and napoli 2012 have been successfully applied to identify maritime patterns and detect anomaly behavior from ship trajectory data but it will take much effort to carry out knowledge modeling in a word there is a lack of balance between the explicable mobility patterns and modeling effort in existing methods topic model is a popular method of latent semantic extraction in the field of natural language processing it is widely used to extract topic information from textual document the topic can provide a good description of the characteristics of the corresponding document moreover less effort will be made to topic modeling compared to ontology modeling and other knowledge discovery methods as a result recent studies recently apply topic model to explore the thematic information from massive taxi trajectories chu et al 2014 huang et al 2017 the scholars make an analog between taxi trajectories and textual documents raw taxi gps trajectories have been translated into street name based taxi movement documents by matching gps points to urban streets then topic model can be used to uncover latent topic information from taxi movement documents each topic is actually a mobility pattern which provides a semantic description of taxi movement motivated by previous works this study proposes a semantic analysis method to identify mobility patterns of ship trajectories in the inland river by combining semantic transformation and topic model semantic transformation is responsible for translating raw ship trajectories into available text documents by definition of semantic descriptions of three trajectory features location speed and course after that topic model can be employed to capture semantic relationships among trajectory text documents and detect various document topics each document topic stands as a different kind of ship mobility pattern the reason why semantic analysis is used at the inland river scale is that the scenario of ships navigating in the confined inland channel is relatively similar to that of taxicabs running in the restricted motor vehicle lanes ship behaviors in the inland river are relatively regular and are easy to be translated into structured trajectory documents for topic modeling analysis the contribution of this study is to explore a lightweight but effective method of identifying mobility pattern from ship trajectory which embody the principle of balance between modeling effort and meaningful result the rest of the paper is organized as follows section ii reviewed related works of ship pattern recognition section iii illustrates semantic transformation method of ship trajectory that can be then represented by textual symbols instead of numeric values section iv introduces topic modeling of ship trajectory after semantic transformation section v presents the results analysis of case study in wuhan finally section vi draws the main conclusions 2 related works there are a number of pattern discovery and anomaly detection methods currently derived from trajectory data including statistical model bayesian network neural network visualization analysis and semantic analysis the basic idea of statistical model assumes that ship movements follow some kinds of probabilistic distributions tao et al 2018 and can be statistically obtained by probability estimation such as gaussian model and kernel density estimation ship movement is a complicated process restricted by multiple conditions including navigation environment navigation regulations etc it is difficult to depict ship motion with single probabilistic distribution mixed probabilistic distribution like gaussian mixture model has therefore been advocated to match ship motion in some researches a challenge is the determination of probabilistic distribution quantity that has direct influence of the accuracy of ship movement representation the methods mentioned above are mainly oriented towards ship trajectory data at a specific time considering the change of ship motion some scholars explore to apply dynamic modeling methods to estimate ship motion patterns such as gaussian process obradović et al 2014 extremum value theory smith et al 2013 incremental learning etc these approaches have abilities of detecting variation of ship motion to a certain extent but need spend more effort on modeling work in a word statistical based methods are in fact classification algorithms by evaluating similarities of statistical characteristics of ship trajectories the results of which lack of interpretation the method based on bayesian network represents probabilistic relationships between ship movements with a directed acyclic graph conditional probability inference is then applied to discover the general characteristics of ship movements and identify abnormal behaviors with the advantage of this approach is the integration of multiple datasets like weather time ship attributes trajectories etc facilitate the completeness and understanding of ship motion recognition mascaro et al 2014 such network is suitable to discovery of common movement patterns of massive ships but insensitive to identification of individual ship behavior but how to build valid bayesian network with volumes of trajectory data needs further researches zhang and tang 2015 compared to bayesian network neural network can better match ship movement for its good ability for nonlinear function approximation it can be used to find ship mobility pattern and identify abnormal behavior by comparing difference of ship movement at different times moreover it is capable of learning complicated classification conditions to conclude some hidden patterns the problem of this manner is its training process in a black box sort of way makes the results not easy to be understand to deal with the limitation of methods above visualization analysis method is employed to explore potential pattern knowledge from trajectories with various visual elements and representations andrienko et al 2017a riveiro et al 2017 raw ship trajectories as their statistical characteristics will be mapped into different geographic elements thematic maps or statistical diagrams to show dominant features ship mobility patterns can be directly viewed and analyzed with human interactive operations this manner introduces human cognition and experience to explore hidden ship motion patterns with visualization representation the results are therefore easily to be understanding but depend on useful visual scheme designed by users semantic analysis is another idea to identify accessible ship motion patterns based on context information riveiro et al 2018 svanberg et al 2019 such as navigation environment traffic flow hydrometeorological condition etc in this way maritime knowledge base referring to ship movements should be built and formal representation beforehand ship trajectory and its characteristics will be transformed into a series of concepts with attributes and relationships between them the available modeling technologies include ontology rule etc after that ship motion rules can be obtained through knowledge reasoning process i e genetic algorithm chen et al 2014 the datacron project as part of european union s horizon 2020 program has proposed the datacron semantic model and apply it to maritime domains and air traffic management atm andrienko and andrienko 2018 andrienko et al 2017b georgiou et al 2018 sideridis et al 2016 the project uses semantic technology to manage and integrate the heterogeneous archival data and streaming data sources the complex event detection abnormal behavior recognition and behavior forecasting using semantic methods are illustrated in the proposed datarcon model in land transportation domain there are also some semantic models focusing on the mobility pattern interpretation of different moving objects including cars bikes and pedestrians vanneschi et al 2015 integrated semantics into genetic programming and get good result on the ship trajectory prediction such idea has the advantage of integrating external knowledge to characterize ship behavior and distinguish different meanings of ship trajectories with similar movements but it needs to spend so much on the construction of knowledge database in a word statistical method and network based method have not been able to provide meaningful and understandable results visualization analysis method improves the interpretation on characteristics of ship movements but primarily relies on human operation and recognition semantic analysis method provides an novel way to identify accessible ship mobility patterns but limited to high cost of knowledge modeling in this paper topic modeling technology is applied to detect potential ship mobility patterns with less effort in an inland river in this application scene most of ships have to navigate in restricted waterways with stated rules it is a waste of resources to build complex semantic analysis model this study explores a balance between modeling effort and knowledge acquisition by migrating two algorithms semantic transformation and topic model in semantic transformation process many powerful models like spatial grid model and cone direction model used in gis geographic information science have been applied to deal with ship movements in inland river waterway in topic modeling process lda model a relatively simple model in semantic analysis has been to classify and represent different ship movements with less effort 3 trajectory segmentation and semantic transformation raw ship trajectories consist of a series of sequential sample points at different times each sample point records an instantaneous state of ship movement with multiple numeric characteristics including geographic coordinates gps timestamp sog speed of ground cog course of ground etc however these quantitative values make managers difficult to intuitively recognize and understand meanings of ship movements in this section a semantic transformation model is proposed to produce textual semantic description for ship movement instead of numeric values especially three individual transition processes are designed to extract semantic information from ship geo location sog and cog each transition process will generate a meaningful motion word to represent the specific feature then ship movement at each time will be represented by a vector of motion words which are available for topic modeling 3 1 two staged trajectory segmentation a ship trajectory may be a long and complex path in geometric feature and contain several different mobility patterns before semantic transformation stop move conceptual model is adopted to translate raw long trajectory into a set of continuous sub trajectories each sub trajectory indicates an individual ship movement between different ship stops this paper designs a two stage process for trajectory segmentation as show fig 1 in water traffic environment wind and flow have great effect on movements of both sailing ship and moored ship when a ship shuts down the engine it may still have very low speed and changed course so it is difficult to identify moves and stops of a trajectory directly based on values of movement characteristics at first stage this paper applies a cluster method called cb smot clustering based stops and moves of trajectories palma et al 2008 to identify stop marks from ship trajectory based on speed variation that is sample points in the trajectory whose speeds are lower than a given threshold for a minimal amount of time will be considered as stops then raw trajectory can be partitioned to a set of sub trajectories and groups of stop marks it is worth that this method adopts a distance measure to compute neighbors of each sample point and generate stop marks having enough neighbors as a result it is very sensitive to position drifting in the trajectory especially when a ship keeps in stop state a long position drifting will have serious effects on the clustering result to deal with this problem a distance cleansing rule is used to identify and remove inaccurate sample points in the trajectory for two consecutive points a and b the linear distance d a b can be got with their geo location coordinates that is d a b x a x b 2 y a y b 2 assuming that the ship is conducting an entire circle motion the maximum movement path should be semicircle arc a b ˆ the length of arc a b ˆ can be calculated with formula l a b ˆ π 0 5 l a b l a b is the maximum length of straight path from a to b and l a b v m δ t in which v m indicates the larger value of speeds of two points and δ t is the time interval if d a b has a greater value than l a b ˆ a position drifting may exist and point b should be removed at second stage sub trajectories will be further divided into a set of segments based on direction variation in a trajectory corner reflects the direction change of ship movement a great change of direction means a different movement compared to previous one given three consecutive points a b and c a trajectory corner can be defined as the vector angle of two vectors a b and b c that is θ cos 1 a b b c a b b c sample points in the trajectory would be viewed as subsection points where the corner angle θ is greater than a given threshold value with subsection points sub trajectories can be divided into groups of trajectory segments 3 2 extracting semantics from trajectory segments raw ship trajectories are represented as a tuple of numeric values in general however these numeric trajectories cannot be used directly for topic modeling the reason is that topic modeling not only requires textual documents as the data source but also calls for meaningful words to produce the documents in raw ship trajectories the numeric characteristics of ship location speed and course are less meaningful for human as a result textual transformation of raw ship trajectories is necessary this section will introduce how to extract semantics from raw trajectory segments of particular interest is the semantic information of ship location speed and course by semantic extraction raw numeric representation of ship trajectory can be translated into textual representation of ship movement for the following topic modeling fig 2 illustrates the process of semantic extraction of ship movement features in the process spatial grid codes and ships are combined to create so called place names to describe semantic information of ship location fuzzy sets of velocity and direction based on geographic information theory are also designed to describe semantic information of ship speed and course ship location semantic location feature marks position information of ship movement in navigable waters raw trajectory location denoted as geographic coordinates represents the meaning of space rather than ship movement different ship movements pass through the same space will generate varying semantic information for instance fishing ship and cargo ship located in fishing area mean normal work and abnormal trouble respectively this paper integrates geocoding of water with area ship type to characterize the meaning of ship location feature water area is conveniently divided into an m by n grid of non overlapped square cells as show fig 2 b each cell is recorded as c i j i and j denote row code and col code respectively then semantic description of location feature can be represented by a composition of row code col code and ship type that is s e x k y k r o w c o l t y p e let target water area be a geographic area covering 16km 8 km the partition grid is 1km 1 km and the number of ship type in collected trajectories is 5 there will be altogether 16 8 5 different semantic descriptions of ship location feature ship course semantic course feature records changes in direction while ship moves to different locations numeric course angle cannot provide intuitive cognition of direction of ship travel this paper utilizes a cone based direction model to extract semantic information of course feature as shown fig 2 c ship heading is divided to eight cone directions and each fan shape section contains a 45 degree range divided by a central axis a list of symbols have been created to as semantic expression of cone directions denoted as c o n e d i r e a s t s o u t h w e s t n o r t h s o u t h e a s t s o u t h w e s t n o r t h e a s t n o r t h w e s t for arbitrary sample point its course value will be compared to angle range of each cone direction and labelled with the matched direction symbol then semantic description of course feature can be represented as s e c k c o n e d i r ship speed semantic speed feature indicates how fast a ship travels in navigable water a ship will be considered to remain stationary if its speed value is less than 1kn in general in contrast a ship with speed more than 1kn should be in the navigation state an absolute speed value however cannot tell the variation of the pace of moving along trajectory this paper evaluates velocity value and its change to extract the meaning of ship speed feature the velocity change is issued once current v n o w deviates by more than α the formula v n o w v p r e v n o w value of speed difference between adjacent sample points to the average speed at a certain time when velocity change is less than a given threshold a ship may remain in stationary or cruising depending on its instant speed approaches zero or not in contrast a power driven ship will show greater velocity change than threshold value no matter it keeps acceleration or deceleration therefore four symbols can be defined to semantically describe ship speed change denoted as s p d c r u i s e a c c e l e r a t i o n d e c e l e r a t i o n s t a t i o n a r y for a sample point its speed value will be compared to that of previous point and be matched with corresponding semantic symbol then semantic description of speed feature can be represented as s e v k s p d 4 topic modeling of ship trajectory topic model originated from nature language process is put forward to cluster documents based on semantic similarity rather than word similarity it believes that there is a semantic feature space between bottomed word space and document space at the top which is defined as topic so named topic is similar to clustering center in traditional clustering methods i e dbscan the meaning of a topic represents main idea or thematic information of a sentence a paragraph or a document in topic model each document d i is represented as a finite mixture of an underlying set of topics called document topic distribution d i t 1 t 2 t n each topic is also characterized by a distribution of words named a topic word distribution t i w 1 w 2 w m both document topic and topic word follow the dirichlet distribution different words occurring frequently in documents will be clustered into the same topic and the implication of which depends on word meanings for ship a long trajectory can be viewed as a document consisting of multiple mobility topics each topic is depicted by a group of motion words here motion word is actually a snapshot of ship motion state a group of snapshots thus can reflect some mobility patterns of ship fig 3 provides an analogy with discovering movement patterns from ship trajectories and learning topics from documents in this study latent dirichlet allocation lda a widely used topic model is utilized to analyze and identify movement patterns from ship trajectory after semantic transformation 4 1 textual representation of trajectory raw ship trajectories are represented as a tuple of numeric values such geometrical representation however is not suitable for textual document oriented topic modeling based on semantic transformation introduced in section 4 we can obtain textual representation of ship trajectory by construction of trajectory dictionary trajectory dictionary defines a set of motion words used to depict ship motion state in writing each motion word is a comprehensive expression of ship location semantic ship speed semantic and ship course semantic denoted as m w r o w c o l t y p e c o n e d i r s p d according to the quantization process of these three features there can be a total of n p n v n c motion words in the trajectory dictionary here n p is the number of words depicting ship location features it depends on the size of research area and granularity of grid for space partition as well as ship categories n v and n c are constant number of words depicting ship speed feature and ship course feature in this article these two values vary with detailed semantic modeling methods on velocity and direction in this paper two relatively coarse gained semantic modeling method are used to deal with ship speed and ship course in a practical application the specific number of motion words depends on application scene and the request of expression ability of topic model trajectory document is a literal expression of continuous ship movements with a group of motion words a trajectory document can be represented as a list of motion words generally there are two ways to build ship trajectory document one way is to take individual ship as a target and create trajectory document based on continuous movements of the ship in a period the obtained document is a collection of individual ship behaviors performed in multiple places at different time it benefits the discovery of similarities of different ship movements and the exploration of common trajectory patterns another way takes individual tiny area as a target movements of all ship in which contribute to the generation of trajectory document the target area can be a region of interest defined by user or a basic space unit of particular space partition model i e grid model this way is suitable to discover functional or geographic similarities of regions through ship activities in this article the first way is adopted to produce trajectory documents by replacing raw ship movements with motion words 4 2 lda topic model latent dirichlet allocation lda is a widely used topic model with the capacity to capture multiple topics and deduce the effective topic features fig 4 represents probabilistic graphical model of lda feng and fu 2018 grey circles represent the observable variables and white circles are variables boxes represent collections of variables in the figure k is the number of topics n is the number of words in the document m is the number of documents to analyze α is the dirichlet prior concentration parameter of the per document topic distribution and β is the same parameter of the per topic word distribution these two corpus level parameters are only sampled once for total documents ϕ k is the word distribution for topic k and θ i is the topic distribution for document i w i j denotes the j th word in the i th document z i j represents the topic assignment for the word w i j in lda a ship trajectory dataset is assumed as a collection of m trajectory document denoted as d t d 1 t d 2 t d m each trajectory document t d is represented as a limited series of motion words that is t d m w 1 m w 2 m w n where m w k is the k th motion word in the series obviously trajectory documents have similar movements will share motion words of the same category such a category of motion words semantically indicates a type of ship movement pattern which means a topic of ship trajectory according to this assumption the process of generating a trajectory document td for a ship trajectory dataset d is as follows step 1 calculating multi nominal distribution of topics based on dirichlet distribution that is θ d i r α where α is the dirichlet prior concentration parameter and θ is the parameter of multi nominal distribution of generating topics step 2 generating a topic based on multi nominal distribution parameter θ that is z n m u l t i n o m i a l θ step 3 selecting a movement word mw n from multi nominal distribution p m w n z n β based on the generated topic z n that is m w n p m w n z n β step 4 constantly repeating step 2 and step 3 to generate a trajectory document td in the above process each ship trajectory document td will be modeled as a composition of k topics which is known as a fixed value each topic z k is modeled as a multinomial distribution of v motion words denoted as β k β k 1 β k 2 β k v where β k i p m w i z k means conditional probability of each movement word mw i in a given topic z k so that parameter β can be represented as a k v matrix and parameter α referring to dirichlet distribution of ship trajectory dataset can be expressed as α α 1 α 2 α k each α k p z k means probability of specific potential topic z k by applying lda model to trajectory documents with suitable parameters two outcome probability distributions can be obtained that are trajectory topic probability distribution and topic movement word probability distribution trajectory topic probability distribution a ship trajectory may have one or more mobility patterns that are topics each topic z k contributes to a ship trajectory t d j to a different degree denoted as p z k d j a trajectory s probabilities over all topics should sum up to 1 i e z k d j 1 topic movement word probability distribution each mobility pattern topic is in fact a probability distribution of movement words denoted as z k p m w 1 z k p m w i z k p w n z k in which p w i z k represents the probability of a movement word m w i generating the topic z k if a threshold probability δ is defined all movement words with probabilities larger than the threshold value could be considered as representative movement for the mobility pattern topic z k 5 experiment and result analysis 5 1 experimental area and data to validate the proposed methodology a case study was conducted at wuhan waterway located at middle stream of the yangtze river china the selected research area is similar to a rectangle covering a geographic extent from 114 15 36 e to 114 19 48 e 30 32 49 n to 30 36 36 n fig 5 this area is an intersection waterway of the han river and the yangtze river in wuhan ship trajectory data has been collected from total 9422 ships in this region in jan 2014 some ships possess incomplete ship attributes which cannot be used to generate movement words in direct to enrich ship attributes ship type information has been complemented by resources on web sites based on a customized crawler and manual calibration based on the method proposed in 4 2 the whole area was meshed into many equivalent grid units 46 x 51 grid cells of size 152 8 m can be produced and applied for semantic transformation of ship location combined with symbols of speed and course there are total 300 288 motion words generated for topic modeling of ship trajectories in this region for each ship ship trajectory records were sorted by sampling time and then went through a process of semantic transformation as a result a long voyage of a ship can be viewed as a trajectory document written by motion words time by time table 1 shows examples of textual representation of three different ship trajectories including cargo tanker and other type of ship for each ship a series of motion words in order of time contributes to the corresponding trajectory document after that stanford topic modeling toolbox is used to build an lda model for all ship trajectories in this experiment the topic number is set to 10 during the training of lda model cvb0 algorithm was adopted to estimate the prior parameters in this application cvb0 in the toolbox is used to train the lda model with 1 000 iterations the topic smoothing threshold is set to 0 01 all of the parameters are optimized with 50 iterations for each mobility pattern topic the topic movement word threshold value δ is set to 1 or 0 01 in order to identify representative movements finally two valuable probability distributions can be obtained and investigated to discover meaningful ship mobility patterns and their characteristics table 2 illustrates some examples of topic probability distribution in motion words each topic contains a group of motion words with different occurrence frequency the more times a motion word appears in a topic the greater contributions it offers to generate this mobility pattern topic than other topics if a threshold probability is defined all motion words with probabilities larger than the threshold could be considered as representative words for the topic in the table four marked topics have been listed with their representative words all representative words of each topic are in order of frequency table 3 illustrates probability distributions of three different ship trajectories in total 10 topics it can be observed that a ship trajectory may have one or more mobility pattern topics each mobility pattern topic contributes to a ship trajectory to a different degree probabilities of a ship trajectory over all topics should sum up to 1 in the table topic 3 contributes to ship mmsi 413777357 with 43 44 of its movement words and topic 5 contributes to the rest of words ship mmsi 400816773 has participated in as many as 5 topics that indicates this ship adopts flexible operations in different movements in contrast ship 413771827 is mainly involved in topic 3 and slightly takes part in mobility pattern of topic 1 and topic 5 5 2 results analysis to better understand lda results topics can be spatially visualized as a collection of representative movement words fig 6 shows spatial distributions of all ten mobility pattern topics visual elements such as shape size color are used to display topics and movement words in the figure each topic is assigned to a specific color movement word in the topic is represented by a directional triangle ship symbol with a tail at specific location ship symbol size indicates the ship type which depends on ship type code specified in the ais message standard the length of symbol tail represents the ship speed long length medium length and short length represent acceleration cruise and deceleration respectively distributions of movement words in all topics can clearly show mobility patterns and dynamics of ship traffic in this water area firstly five representative topics have been extracted to paint a more explicit picture in which there are four remarkable mobility patterns at the intersection waterway of the han river and the yangtze river as shown in fig 7 the first two mobility patterns are two inverse movements in the yangtze river the topic 0 in purple color represents the movements of upstream vessels that keep the speed and direction steady when they go through the channel of the yangtze river upstream vessels mostly run along the coast of the yangtze river based on spatial distribution of the topic in contrast downstream vessels prior to navigate in the middle of the channel of the yangtze river which can be viewed from the topic 1 in brown color and the topic 3 in navy this pattern demonstrates that downstream vessels will utilize the force of water to sail since their movement directions are similar to the water flow direction of the yangtze river the other two mobility patterns are two inverse movements between the yangtze river and the han river the topic 9 in dark cyan displays how to navigate upstream from the yangtze river to the han river we can observe that the number of movement words located in the han river is much less than that in the yangtze river it is assumed that vessels may adopt more common movements in the han river than that in the yangtze river due to narrower channel boundary and lower water level the topic 8 in yellow color shows the movement voyaging downstream from the han river to lower reaches of the yangtze river when vessel comes to the yangtze river it also likes to navigate in the middle of the yangtze river for energy saving next all topics indicating the movements of upbound vessels have been put together to identify mobility patterns and valuable information as shown in fig 8 the topic 0 purple triangle the topic 2 blue triangle and the topic 4 pink triangle show three different movements of upstream cargos in the yangtze river the topic 7 orange triangle shows common movements of upstream containers in the yangtze river it can be viewed that containers going upstream move close to the middle of the channel due to the limitation of water level in contrast cargos choose to sail along the coast to reduce resistance of current cargos sometimes may be forced to turning into the middle of the channel because there may be a reach or wharf located in the coast in the topic 2 and topic 4 there are explicit course variances of cargo movements because of a ferry terminal an interesting discovery is that some movements are shared by two or three topics to avoid the visual occlusion of the same movement the authors have turned off the tail layers of the topic 0 and the topic 2 on top level of visualization after that it can be found that there are overlapped ship triangles at multiple locations such as mw 1 in fig 8 firstly there are many similar movement words like mw1 between the topic 0 and the topic 7 these movement words have the same location speed course but different ship types it can be inferred that both container and cargo may have the same movement at this area this phenomenon is not alone the topic 2 and topic 4 also have many shared movement words that have been rendered as blue ship triangles with pink tails like mw2 in fig 8 it may indicate a common mobility pattern shared by different cargos moreover authors have found that movement word mw 3 contributes to three topics including topic 2 topic 4 and topic 7 combined with background image we know that there is an inland dock nearby this movement word may be resulted from unberthing operation of ship after berthing both container and cargos possess this movement the following will show the picture of all topics representing the movements of downstream vessels in the yangtze river as shown in fig 9 the topic 1 brown triangle the topic 3 navy triangle the topic 5 blueviolet triangle and the topic 6 green triangle show similar movement trend with different routes of downstream cargos in the yangtze river ship movements in all topics try to take advantage of water flow to obtain external propulsion and choose to sail in the middle of the yangtze river as a result there are many common movement words shared by multiple topics for ease of analysis the tail layers of the topic 1 and the topic 3 on top level of visualization have been turned off it can be observed that shared movement words almost locate in the middle of the channel which are highlighted with yellow circles in addition the topic 1 and the topic 3 have no common movement words and generate a sense of spatial continuity both two topics have some shared movement words with the topic 5 at different locations it can be inferred that the topic 1 and the topic 3 together represent the movements of the same cargo type the topic 5 shows the movements of anther cargo type it is worth noting that the topic 6 is a mixed mobility pattern of cargo and container since different size green triangles can be observed in consequence applying topic modeling technology to ship trajectory is helpful and useful to explore hidden mobility patterns the results can be transformed and visualized to pieces of evidence to make the inference and interpretation compared to previous geometric methods such semantic method can provide textual representation of modeling results be easier to understand 6 conclusion this paper proposed a semantic analysis methodology to identify pattern knowledge from ship trajectories which facilitates the maritime administrators to master the characteristics of maritime traffic flow and identify abnormal behavior a semantic transformation process is firstly applied to translate raw ship trajectory into textual trajectory document by semantic descriptions of three trajectory features including ship location semantic ship course semantic and ship speed semantic each textual trajectory document is depicted by a series of motion words consisting of three trajectory feature semantics after that topic modeling technology lda is introduced to explore semantic similarities of trajectories and conclude potential thematical information to illustrate the methodology we gave a case study on trajectory topic modeling at an intersection waterway wuhan china multiple topics of ship movements have been extracted from raw ais trajectory data with the help of visualization ship motion pattern of each topic can be clearly viewed and analyzed experiment results illustrate that the proposed method is effective to trajectory pattern recognition and can provide well understood motion patterns it should be noted that there is only semantic information of few trajectory features used for topic modeling analysis in this study more information especially external environment and rules should be analyzed and imported to enrich semantic of raw trajectory in further work which is helpful to provide more meaningful interpretations of ship motion patterns author contributions section liang huang conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing yuanqiao

as a result of technical progress in recent years msvs have been widely applied to ocean engineering such as sea investigation military tasks maritime rescue and so on srensen 2011 fossen 2002 guaranteeing that msvs can autonomously track a predefined trajectory or follow a prescribed path has become a research hot spot nevertheless msvs sailing in a harsh ocean environment suffer from external disturbances induced by winds waves and ocean currents due to the fact that a great challenge is posed to the controller design trajectory tracking control has attracted increasing attention from marine engineering and control community behal et al 2002 yu et al 2019a hu et al 2019c b a wang and han 2018 dai et al 2019 with the rapid development of the modern control theory many promising control methods have been applied to trajectory tracking of marine vessels it is well known that sliding mode control smc has desirable capacity to reject uncertainties and disturbances in a robust way it could be employed to nonlinear control cui et al 2016 2017 yan and yu 2018 yang et al 2019 2018 sun et al 2018 du et al 2019a ding et al 2019b wang et al 2016 2019 nevertheless the smc based approach might give rise to actuator chattering in loria et al 2000 fossen and berge 1997 pettersen and nijmeijer 1998 and lefeber et al 2003 the tracking errors converged to the origin based on backstepping control without actuator chattering in recent years with the rise of intelligent control algorithms fuzzy logic control and neural network control have been employed to marine vehicle control xiang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 yu et al 2017 2019b by resorting to their inherent approximation capabilities unknown nonlinear dynamics was estimated online sun and guo 2016 bai et al 2019 additionally a novel nonlinear disturbance observers for a class of nonlinear systems is developed in ding et al 2019a it is noteworthy that the fastest convergence rate is exponential convergence in all those works as can be summarized in yu and long 2015 li et al 2015 du et al 2015 sun et al 2013 2011 yang et al 2017 du et al 2019b 2014 considering time optimal control and anti disturbance performance finite time control arises naturally which can make control system states converge to the equilibrium with better robustness in finite time and keep there then after in contrast with the finite time stability as an advanced improvement of the global finite time control the fixed time stability was proposed and based on the following two points polyakov 2011 zuo 2015 du et al 2019c 1 control systems are globally finite time stable 2 the convergence time is bounded and independent on the initial condition since the fixed time control can provide a transition time independently of operation domain and sustain the convergence time without re tuning the control parameters levant 2013 moreover it is difficult or impossible for most systems to obtain the initial states in practical applications li and cai 2017 in consequence the fixed time control performance is superior to the finite time one in li and cai 2017 a fixed time nonsingular terminal sliding mode control scheme is proposed with matched lumped disturbances in tian et al 2017 a fixed time continuous output feedback control scheme was presented for a double integrator system based on homogeneity and lyapunov theories in basin et al 2016 fixed time differentiators were studied for nonlinear system at present in addition to the aforementioned theoretical achievements a series of fixed time control results have been applied to other fields such as hypersonic missile control basin et al 2017 brunovsky system control ni et al 2017 msvs motion control zhang et al 2019c b additionally in practice as one of the most important nonsmooth nonlinearities af usually appear in many msvs meanwhile it degrades control system performance and even leads to unsafety hence it is grateful to suppress unknown af during the navigation wang and han 2016 chen et al 2016 in guo and zhang 2019 a fixed time disturbance observer ftdo is proposed to deal with actuator dead zones and disturbances in gao and guo 2019 an ftdo is introduced to estimate the compound disturbance in zhang et al 2019a 2018 an fxeso is devised to estimate the lumped disturbances including uncertain parameters external disturbances and actuator faults respectively nevertheless a parameter t u is selected with trial and error by referring to ni et al 2017 and the sliding mode controller leads to singularity in addition to fxesos mentioned above an asymptotic observer is also studied in cui et al 2010 note that velocities are not always measured during the actual voyages due to considerations of costs weights and sensor failures and so on in zhang et al 2019a 2018 and cui et al 2010 in spite of unmeasured velocities being solved it is still a hot topic therefore it is meaningful to consider the above obstacles with af motivated by these a novel fixed time velocity free sliding mode control scheme without singularity subject to af disturbances and unmodelled dynamics is applied to an msv to track a desired trajectory the major contributions of this paper are summarized as below i an fxeso is designed to estimate system states and lumped disturbances including af disturbances and unmodelled dynamics in fixed time compared with fxesos in zhang et al 2019a 2018 the proposed fxeso can avoid tuning the parameter t u with trial and error by referring to ni et al 2017 ii a novel fixed time velocity free sliding mode control scheme based on the fxeso is proposed the proposed scheme can guarantee an msv track a desired trajectory accurately and the tracking errors can converge to the origin in fixed time in comparison with zhang et al 2019a the proposed controller is without singularity meanwhile the convergence time is independent of the variable and the tracking errors can converge to the origin the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 some notations and useful preliminaries are presented in section 3 the mathematical models of an msv are introduced and the control problem is set up in section 4 coordinate transformation is utilized and an fxeso is proposed in section 5 consider af unmodelled dynamics and disturbances we design a fixed time velocity free sliding mode trajectory tracking control scheme based on the fxeso with a rigorous proof of closed loop fixed time stability in section 6 the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach are demonstrated by simulations and comparisons conclusions are contained in section 7 2 notations and preliminaries 2 1 notations 1 for a given vector 2 denotes the vector euclidean

the rotation matrix r ψ is expressed as 8 r ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 where r ψ r ψ s r s r is expressed as 9 s r 0 r 0 r 0 0 0 0 0 the total control torque with af li et al 2017 can be

the following 14 η e η η d w w d w e w e w w d r ψ m 1 τ n χ w d 4 2 design of fxeso it is stressed that unknown unmodelled dynamics external disturbances and af will weaken the trajectory tracking performance for the purpose of enhancing robustness of an msv during the navigation an fxeso is proposed as follows 15 η ˆ w ˆ μ 1 s i g α 1 e 1 ε 1 s i g β 1 e 1 w ˆ r ψ m 1 τ n χ ˆ μ 2 s i g α 2 e 1

theorem 1 if an fxeso is designed as 15 for system 14 and the observer gains are selected such that the following matrices are hurwitz then η w and χ can be estimated within a fixed time by η ˆ w ˆ and χ ˆ respectively p 1 μ 1 1 0 μ 2 0 1 μ 3 0 0 p 2 ε 1 1 0 ε 2 0 1 ε 3 0 0 proof detailed proof of the theorem can be seen in zhang et al 2019c remark 1 as reported in ni et al 2017 the parameter t u for the fxeso in zhang et al 2019a 2018 is typically selected through trial and error therefore the proposed fxeso can avoid the circumstance and achieve a more succinct structure 5 fxeso based fixed time velocity free sliding mode trajectory tracking control the block diagram of the algorithm based system is shown in fig 2 5 1 design of a fixed time singularity free sliding mode manifold in this subsection based on 15 the fixed time singularity free sliding mode manifold motivated by zuo 2015 is expressed as follows 16 s η e s i g γ 2 k η e w ˆ e where w ˆ e w ˆ w d k η e diag k 1 η e 1

converge with zero errors within a fixed time t 2 proof if s 0 then we can obtain below 17 η e i s i g γ 2 k η e i w ˆ e i 17 can be rewritten as follows 18 η e i s i g γ 2 w ˆ e i λ 1 η e i γ 1 1 γ 2

we can conclude 19 η e i 1 λ 1 η e i γ 1 1 γ 2 λ 2 γ 2 s i g γ 2 w ˆ e i in order to simplify 19 we make the following changes 20 s i g 1 γ 2 η e i 1 λ 1 η e i γ 1 1 γ 2 λ 2 w ˆ e i sgn w ˆ e i 1 λ 1 η e i γ 1 1 γ 2 λ 2 w ˆ e i accordingly we have 21 w ˆ e i s i g 1 γ 2 η e i λ 1 η e i γ 1 1 γ 2 λ 2 λ 1 η e i γ 1 sgn η e i λ 2 η e i 1 γ 2 sgn η e i λ 1 s i g γ 1 η e i λ 2 s i g 1 γ 2 η e i by referring to theorem 1 21 can be rewritten as follows 22 w e i λ 1 s i g γ 1 η e i λ 2 s i g 1 γ 2 η e i according to lemma 3 w e i and η e i can converge to zero with a fixed time and the convergence time is expressed as 23 t 2 1 λ 1 γ 1 1 γ 2 λ 2 γ 2 1 this completes the proof of theorem 2 remark 2 note that the proposed sliding mode manifold 16 is combined by the fxeso meanwhile it is not necessarily required to obtain the actual velocity tracking errors which is difficult to obtain during the navigation hence w e is constructed by the fxeso and replaced by w ˆ e 5 2 fixed time fault tolerant control design in this paper by combining an fxeso 15 and a sliding mode manifold 16 a fixed time sliding mode controller is proposed as follows 24 τ n m r 1 k γ s k γ 2 η e diag ρ w e i γ 2

there exists a fact ρ w e i γ 2 1 θ w e i 1 γ 2 1 as w e i 0 theorem 3 the fixed time sliding mode controller 24 can make the tracking errors converge to the origin within a fixed time t after the exact estimation of the lumped disturbances and the sliding mode manifold s 0 moreover the convergence time is independent on the initial values of an msv proof a lyapunov candidate function is conducted as 25 v 0 1 2 s t s taking the time derivative of 25 and combining 16 we have 26 v 0 s t η e γ 2 diag k i η e i w ˆ e i γ 2 1 k η e w ˆ e i k η e w ˆ e i s t η e γ 2 diag k i η e i w ˆ e i γ

diag k i γ 2 η e i diag w e i γ 2 1 k γ s k γ 2 η e diag ρ w e i γ 2 1 θ diag w e i 1 γ 2 s i g ξ s s i g ζ s s and then 30 can be rewritten as follows 31 v 0 s t γ 2 k θ γ s diag ρ w e i γ 2 1 s i g ξ s s i g ζ s s subsequently 32 v 0 γ 2 k θ γ s i 1 3 ρ w e i γ 2 1 s i ξ 1 γ 2 k θ γ s i 1 3 ρ w e i γ 2 1 s i ζ 1 γ 2 k θ γ s i 1 3 ρ w e i γ 2 1 s i 2 due to 0 γ s 1 the following can be expressed as 33 v 0 γ 2 k θ i 1 3 ρ w e i γ 2 1 s i ξ 1 γ 2 k θ i 1 3 ρ w e i γ 2 1 s i ζ 1 according to lemma 2 we have 34 v 0 γ 2 k θ min ρ w e i γ 2 1 1 3 ξ 1 2 1 2 v 0 ξ 1 2 γ 2 k θ min ρ w e i γ 2 1 2 v 0 ς 1 2 where ξ 1 2 1 and 0 ς 1 2 1 notice that ρ w e i γ 2 1 0 if w e i 0 for the convenience of the proof the system states η e i ℜ and w e i ℜ are divided into two different areas i e ω 1 η e i w e i w e i γ 2 1 ι and ω 2 η e i w e i w e i γ 2 1 ι if the system states are in ω 1 that is w e i γ 2 1 ι holds then the following inequality is given as follows 35 v 0 a v 0 ξ 1 2 b v 0 ς 1 2 where a γ 2 k θ 1 3 ξ 1 2 1 2 ξ 1 2 and b γ 2 k θ 2 ς 1 2 in the light of lemma 1 we can conclude that the sliding mode manifold can converge to zero or enter ω 2 within a fixed time and the convergence time is bounded by 36 t 3 2 a ξ 1 2 b 1 ς if the system states are in ω 2 that is 0 ρ w e i γ 2 1 1 holds when w e i 0 then it can be manifested similarly from 34 that the sliding mode surface s 0 is still an attractor next according to zuo 2015 it is to prove that η e i axis is not attractive except for the origin it is shown that in close proximity to η e i axis the control input 24 can express as 37 τ n m r 1 k γ s k γ 2 η e s i g ξ s s i g ζ s s χ ˆ w d accordingly the following can be expressed when w e 0 38 w e k γ s k γ 2 η e s i g ξ s s i g ζ s s according to 38 if s 0 then w e 0 if s 0 then w e 0 therefore the system states will transgress ω 2 into ω 1 monotonically according to zuo 2015 there is a constant ε o 0 for a given o 0 to specify the time margin for the system trajectory to pass through ω 2 where o ι 1 γ 2 1 hence the total convergence time is bounded by t t 1 t 2 t 3 ε o this completes the proof of theorem 3 remark 3 a fixed time control scheme is proposed without singularity however in zhang et al 2019a it is worth noticing that k i e 1 i κ 1 e 1 i 1 1 γ 2 κ 2 e 1 i 2 1 γ 2 λ 2 2 κ 1 1 1 γ 2 e 1 i 1 γ 2 κ 2 2 1 γ 2 e 1 i 1 1 γ 2 z 2 i when e 1 i ε 0 as e 1 i 0 e 1 i 1 γ 2 1 γ 2 2 is infinitely large hence it may give rise to singularity meanwhile the convergence time is independent of the variable and the tracking errors can converge to the origin 6 simulation and comparison studies 6 1 simulations and comparisons of af s influence on control system in order to explore the af s influence on control system the following three scenarios will be compared in the simulations meanwhile simulation studies are carried out on cybership ii 1 the designed control law τ n in 24 is combined by χ ˆ with the estimations for unmodelled dynamics disturbances and af we define the proposed scheme as fxsm 1 2 the comparative control law τ c o m in 39 is combined by γ ˆ without the estimation for af to understand the effect on system performance it is worth noting that af exists in the vessel system we define the comparative scheme as fxsm 2 39 τ c o m m r 1 k γ s k γ 2 η e diag ρ w e i γ 2 1 θ diag w e i 1 γ 2 s i g ξ s s i g ζ s s γ ˆ z w d

as a result of technical progress in recent years msvs have been widely applied to ocean engineering such as sea investigation military tasks maritime rescue and so on srensen 2011 fossen 2002 guaranteeing that msvs can autonomously track a predefined trajectory or follow a prescribed path has become a research hot spot nevertheless msvs sailing in a harsh ocean environment suffer from external disturbances induced by winds waves and ocean currents due to the fact that a great challenge is posed to the controller design trajectory tracking control has attracted increasing attention from marine engineering and control community behal et al 2002 yu et al 2019a hu et al 2019c b a wang and han 2018 dai et al 2019 with the rapid development of the modern control theory many promising control methods have been applied to trajectory tracking of marine vessels it is well known that sliding mode control smc has desirable capacity to reject uncertainties and disturbances in a robust way it could be employed to nonlinear control cui et al 2016 2017 yan and yu 2018 yang et al 2019 2018 sun et al 2018 du et al 2019a ding et al 2019b wang et al 2016 2019 nevertheless the smc based approach might give rise to actuator chattering in loria et al 2000 fossen and berge 1997 pettersen and nijmeijer 1998 and lefeber et al 2003 the tracking errors converged to the origin based on backstepping control without actuator chattering in recent years with the rise of intelligent control algorithms fuzzy logic control and neural network control have been employed to marine vehicle control xiang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 yu et al 2017 2019b by resorting to their inherent approximation capabilities unknown nonlinear dynamics was estimated online sun and guo 2016 bai et al 2019 additionally a novel nonlinear disturbance observers for a class of nonlinear systems is developed in ding et al 2019a it is noteworthy that the fastest convergence rate is exponential convergence in all those works as can be summarized in yu and long 2015 li et al 2015 du et al 2015 sun et al 2013 2011 yang et al 2017 du et al 2019b 2014 considering time optimal control and anti disturbance performance finite time control arises naturally which can make control system states converge to the equilibrium with better robustness in finite time and keep there then after in contrast with the finite time stability as an advanced improvement of the global finite time control the fixed time stability was proposed and based on the following two points polyakov 2011 zuo 2015 du et al 2019c 1 control systems are globally finite time stable 2 the convergence time is bounded and independent on the initial condition since the fixed time control can provide a transition time independently of operation domain and sustain the convergence time without re tuning the control parameters levant 2013 moreover it is difficult or impossible for most systems to obtain the initial states in practical applications li and cai 2017 in consequence the fixed time control performance is superior to the finite time one in li and cai 2017 a fixed time nonsingular terminal sliding mode control scheme is proposed with matched lumped disturbances in tian et al 2017 a fixed time continuous output feedback control scheme was presented for a double integrator system based on homogeneity and lyapunov theories in basin et al 2016 fixed time differentiators were studied for nonlinear system at present in addition to the aforementioned theoretical achievements a series of fixed time control results have been applied to other fields such as hypersonic missile control basin et al 2017 brunovsky system control ni et al 2017 msvs motion control zhang et al 2019c b additionally in practice as one of the most important nonsmooth nonlinearities af usually appear in many msvs meanwhile it degrades control system performance and even leads to unsafety hence it is grateful to suppress unknown af during the navigation wang and han 2016 chen et al 2016 in guo and zhang 2019 a fixed time disturbance observer ftdo is proposed to deal with actuator dead zones and disturbances in gao and guo 2019 an ftdo is introduced to estimate the compound disturbance in zhang et al 2019a 2018 an fxeso is devised to estimate the lumped disturbances including uncertain parameters external disturbances and actuator faults respectively nevertheless a parameter t u is selected with trial and error by referring to ni et al 2017 and the sliding mode controller leads to singularity in addition to fxesos mentioned above an asymptotic observer is also studied in cui et al 2010 note that velocities are not always measured during the actual voyages due to considerations of costs weights and sensor failures and so on in zhang et al 2019a 2018 and cui et al 2010 in spite of unmeasured velocities being solved it is still a hot topic therefore it is meaningful to consider the above obstacles with af motivated by these a novel fixed time velocity free sliding mode control scheme without singularity subject to af disturbances and unmodelled dynamics is applied to an msv to track a desired trajectory the major contributions of this paper are summarized as below i an fxeso is designed to estimate system states and lumped disturbances including af disturbances and unmodelled dynamics in fixed time compared with fxesos in zhang et al 2019a 2018 the proposed fxeso can avoid tuning the parameter t u with trial and error by referring to ni et al 2017 ii a novel fixed time velocity free sliding mode control scheme based on the fxeso is proposed the proposed scheme can guarantee an msv track a desired trajectory accurately and the tracking errors can converge to the origin in fixed time in comparison with zhang et al 2019a the proposed controller is without singularity meanwhile the convergence time is independent of the variable and the tracking errors can converge to the origin the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 some notations and useful preliminaries are presented in section 3 the mathematical models of an msv are introduced and the control problem is set up in section 4 coordinate transformation is utilized and an fxeso is proposed in section 5 consider af unmodelled dynamics and disturbances we design a fixed time velocity free sliding mode trajectory tracking control scheme based on the fxeso with a rigorous proof of closed loop fixed time stability in section 6 the effectiveness and superiority of the

theorem 1 if an fxeso is designed as 15 for system 14 and the observer gains are selected such that the following matrices are hurwitz then η w and χ can be estimated within a fixed time by η ˆ w ˆ

fixed time velocity free sliding mode trajectory tracking control the block diagram of the algorithm based system is shown in fig 2 5 1 design of a fixed time singularity free sliding mode manifold in this subsection based on 15 the fixed time singularity free sliding mode manifold motivated by zuo 2015 is expressed as follows 16 s η e s i g γ 2 k η e w ˆ e where w ˆ e w ˆ w d k η e diag k 1 η e 1

we can conclude 19 η e i 1 λ 1 η e i γ 1 1 γ 2 λ 2 γ 2 s i g γ 2 w ˆ e i in order to simplify 19 we make the following changes 20 s i g 1 γ 2 η e i 1 λ 1 η e i γ 1 1 γ 2 λ 2 w ˆ e i sgn w ˆ e i 1 λ 1

necessarily required to obtain the actual velocity tracking errors which is difficult to obtain during the navigation hence w e is constructed by the fxeso and replaced by w ˆ e 5 2 fixed time fault

diag k i γ 2 η e i diag w e i γ 2 1 k γ s k γ 2 η e diag ρ w e i γ 2 1 θ diag w e i 1 γ 2 s i g ξ s s i g ζ s s and then 30 can be rewritten as follows 31 v 0 s t γ 2 k θ γ s diag ρ w e i γ 2 1 s i g ξ s s i g ζ s s subsequently 32 v 0 γ 2 k θ γ s i 1 3 ρ w e i γ 2 1 s i ξ 1 γ 2 k θ γ s i 1 3 ρ w e i γ 2 1 s i ζ 1 γ 2 k θ γ s i 1 3 ρ w e i γ 2 1 s i 2 due to 0 γ s 1 the following can be expressed as 33 v 0 γ 2 k θ i 1 3 ρ w e i γ 2 1 s i ξ 1 γ 2 k θ i 1 3 ρ w e i γ 2 1 s i ζ 1 according to lemma 2 we have 34 v 0 γ 2 k θ min ρ w e i γ 2 1 1 3 ξ 1 2 1 2 v 0 ξ 1 2 γ 2 k θ min ρ w e i γ 2 1 2 v 0 ς 1 2 where ξ 1 2 1 and 0 ς 1 2 1 notice that ρ w e i γ 2 1 0 if w e i 0 for the convenience of the proof the system states η e i ℜ and w e i ℜ are divided into two different areas i e ω 1 η e i w e i w e i γ 2 1 ι and ω 2 η e i w e i w e i γ 2 1 ι if the system states are in ω 1 that is w e i γ 2 1 ι holds then the following inequality is given as follows 35 v 0 a v 0 ξ 1 2 b v 0 ς 1 2 where a γ 2 k θ 1 3 ξ 1 2 1 2 ξ 1 2 and b γ 2 k θ 2 ς 1 2 in the light of lemma 1 we can conclude that the sliding mode manifold can converge to zero or enter ω 2 within a fixed time and the convergence time is bounded by 36 t 3 2 a ξ 1 2 b 1 ς if the system states are in ω 2 that is 0 ρ w e i γ 2 1 1 holds when w e i 0 then it can be manifested similarly from 34 that the sliding mode surface s 0 is still an attractor next according to zuo 2015 it is to prove that η e i axis is not attractive except for the origin it is shown that in close proximity to η e i axis the control input 24 can express as 37 τ n m r 1 k γ s k γ 2 η e s i g ξ s s i g ζ s s χ ˆ w d accordingly the following can be expressed when w e 0 38 w e k γ s k γ 2 η e s i g ξ s s i g ζ s s according to 38 if s 0 then w e 0 if s 0 then w e 0 therefore the system states will transgress ω 2 into ω 1 monotonically according to zuo 2015 there is a constant ε o 0 for a given o 0 to specify the time margin for the system trajectory to pass through ω 2 where o ι 1 γ 2 1 hence the total convergence time is bounded by t t 1 t 2 t 3 ε o this completes the proof of theorem 3 remark 3 a fixed time control scheme is proposed without singularity however in zhang et al 2019a it is worth noticing that k i e 1 i κ 1 e 1 i 1 1 γ 2 κ 2 e 1 i 2 1 γ 2 λ 2 2 κ 1 1 1 γ 2 e 1 i 1 γ 2 κ 2 2 1 γ 2 e 1 i 1 1 γ 2 z 2 i when e 1 i ε 0 as e 1 i 0 e 1 i 1 γ 2 1 γ 2 2 is infinitely large hence it may give rise to singularity meanwhile the convergence time is independent of the variable and the tracking errors can converge to the origin 6 simulation and comparison studies 6 1 simulations and comparisons of af s influence on control system in order to explore the af s influence on control system the following three scenarios will be compared in the simulations meanwhile simulation studies are carried out on cybership ii 1 the designed control law τ n in 24 is combined by χ ˆ with the estimations for unmodelled dynamics disturbances and af we define the proposed scheme as fxsm 1 2 the comparative control law τ c o m in 39 is combined by γ ˆ without the estimation for af to understand the effect on system performance it is worth noting that af exists in the vessel system we define the comparative scheme as fxsm 2 39 τ c o m m r 1 k γ s k γ 2 η e diag ρ w e i γ 2 1 θ diag w e i 1 γ 2 s i g ξ s s i g ζ s s γ ˆ z w d

fxsm 3 are superior to fxsm 2 the corresponding control inputs are shown in fig 9 it implies that the force and torque acting on the msv are smooth and reasonable for three schemes the motion of the msv in the horizontal plane is plotted in fig 10 the quantitative analyses and comparisons are listed in table 1 in table 1 x e x x d y e y y d as well as ψ e ψ ψ d denote the errors between the

that τ r o b is originated from τ n s f x s m without considering the estimations χ ˆ to show the robustness from table 2 it is obvious that the control performance of τ f x s m is superior to τ n s f

21988,in this study a numerical analysis of the performance of two oscillating water column owc wave energy converters at different front and back wall slopes was carried out the first device had vertical front and back walls and the second one had its wall slopes of 40 in relation to the horizontal plane the fluent numerical model which is based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations was used the volume of fluid vof method was employed to take into account free surface flows the case study comprised a 10 m deep flume with an onshore owc at its end equipped with a wells turbine a 2d hydrodynamic mathematical model was employed and a 3d air pressure effect inside the owc air chamber was considered analyses of the hydrodynamics behavior fluid structure interaction outside run up down reflected waves and inside the chamber free surface elevation sloshing and energy distribution pneumatic extracted energy reflected wave energy and energy losses were conducted results showed that the device with inclined walls had the best efficiency in comparison with the other one however the latter showed lower variation in efficiency in the wave period range than the former keywords wave energy oscillating water column device numerical simulation finite volume method volume of fluid 1 introduction ocean energy from waves tides currents thermal variabilities and salinity gradients are alternative sources to substitute fossil fuels nevertheless these energy sources have insignificant installed power in the global energetic matrix as opposed to wind and solar ones that have developed technologies to generate electricity commercially difficulties are due to the hostile environment and the diversity of the ocean energy source which cause high cost of construction and maintenance and consequently poses a great challenge to design engineers overcoming this challenge can cause high impact on the importance of ocean energy in the global energetic matrix besides the available wave energy in the world is around 32 000 tw year similar to the world electric energy demand cruz 2008 its contribution would be meaningful even if only a little of this source is extracted although the potential of wave energy is significant there are no devices in commercial scale yet the oscillating water column owc wave energy converter is the most studied device it consists of a partially submerged concrete or steel structure chamber opened below the water free surface falcão 2010 the incident wave induces an oscillation of free surface inside the chamber that compresses and decompresses the confined air and makes both a turbine and a generator work to generate electricity ghosh and prelas 2011 this device can float nearshore and offshore or be inserted in a breakwater or installed on the coast onshore the owc integrated in a breakwater has important advantages it shares construction costs and it is easily accessed for construction operation and maintenance the wells turbine created in mid 1970 s is the most used type in prototypes its flow is axial and its rotational direction does not depend on the flow direction some examples of onshore prototypes in real scale are pico s plant 400 kw at cachorro port azores portugal limpet 500 kw on isley island united kingdom toftes 500 kw in norway sakata 60 kw in japan vizhinjam in india and mutriku 300 kw in spain nowadays several researchers have been looking for energy wave converter devices with optimal efficiency to reach economically feasible designs however this search requires understanding of the energy balance of this complex system that involves wave structure interaction with strong non linearity therefore since energy losses are identified and quantified different systems and design optimizations can be proposed to increase device efficiency tseng et al 2000 investigated experimentally the energy balance of an onshore owc device and reported three types of energy that could be directly identified energy losses mainly viscous ones reflected energy and pneumatic energy subdivided into effective energy and turbine losses folley and whittaker 2002 reported mechanisms such as run up and run down on the front wall sloshing and water oscillating inside the chamber of the energy balance in a limpet type owc fleming et al 2012 studied the energy transfer process of a forward facing bent duct oscillating water column two dimensional velocity fields obtained by means of particle imaging velocimetry piv were used for analyzing the kinematic energy and vorticity inside and around the device elhanafi et al 2016a studied the energy balance in an onshore owc numerically partitioning the absorbed energy in energy losses and the water column oscillation potential energy inside the chamber besides the authors employed coefficients to represent each energy quantity in relation to the total the numerical analysis of this energy distribution of onshore owc devices that involves complex phenomena such as viscosity effects wave breaking and both nonlinear wave structure interaction and hydro aerodynamic coupling requires the use of accurate models models based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are a good option liu et al 2008 2009a 2009b marjani et al 2008 conde et al 2011 didier et al 2011 teixeira et al 2013 lópez et al 2014 luo et al 2014 iturrioz et al 2015 kamath et al 2015 lópez et al 2016 bouali and larbi 2017 elhanafi et al 2017 mahnamfar and altunkaynak 2017 ning et al 2017 tsai et al 2018 some of these researchers have investigated different geometries of onshore owc devices by means of rans models to understand their behavior and to find conditions to achieve optimum performance however none analyzed the influence of these geometry variations on the energy distribution with the use of rans models this study aims at analyzing the performance and the energy distribution of two owc devices with different slopes of chamber walls taking into account air damping inside the chamber due to a wells turbine the first owc case a had vertical front and back walls the second one case b had its front and back wall slopes equal to 40 in relation to the horizontal plane the fluent numerical model fluent 2016 which is based on rans equations discretized by means of the finite volume technique was used the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 was employed to take into consideration free surface flows both case studies consisted of a 10 m deep flume with the onshore owc at its end a wells turbine was coupled to the chamber and it was modeled by using user defined functions udfs incident waves with heights from 1 0 to 2 5 m and periods from 6 to 12 s were tested the influence of the turbine characteristic relation kt of a wells turbine from open condition kt null to kt 250 pa s m 3 was also investigated 2 methodology 2 1 case studies both case studies consisted in a 10 m deep flume and with two different owc s at its end fig 1 subject to incident regular waves the flume length was 2l where l is the wavelength calculated by the dispersion equation of a linear wave dean and dalrymple 1991 both owc chambers were 10 m wide and 10 m long with a front wall 0 5 m thick submerged in 2 5 m the chamber was 6 m high from the still water level and a wells turbine was used for extracting the pneumatic energy case a fig 1a had vertical front and back walls its geometry was similar to the pico s plant case b fig 1b had its front and back wall slopes of 40 it was the same slope of the front wall above the water level of limpet s owc water and air volumes inside the chamber in case b were the same as those in case a analyses were carried out by using incident waves with periods from 6 to 12 s and heights from 1 0 to 2 5 m the influence of the turbine characteristic relation was also investigated values ranged from null open case to kt 250 pa s m 3 that was inversely proportional to the actual turbine diameter and proportional to the operational rotational speed torres et al 2016 therefore there are several combinations of turbine diameters and rotational speeds for each value of kt 2 2 fluent numerical model simulations were carried out by means of fluent fluent 2016 numerical model taking into account incompressible fluid flows that can be described by the continuity and navier stokes equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t i u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i g i 1 ρ τ i j x j where i j 1 2 for 2d flow u i are velocity components t is the time p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density g i are gravitational acceleration components and τ ij is the viscous stress tensor in this study rans equations based on the decomposition of the instantaneous velocity and pressure fields of the navier stokes equations eqs 1 and 2 into mean and fluctuating components and the subsequent time averaging of the set of equations were used this process introduces reynolds stress terms associated with turbulence a turbulence model was applied to relate the reynolds stresses to mean flow variables and close the equations although it is well known that compressibility effects of the air can reduce device efficiency up to around 10 as reported by teixeira et al 2013 medina lópez et al 2017 and elhanafi et al 2017 the air was incompressible in this study since simulations considering compressible air demands high computational cost however this simplification does not influence the comparative investigation of these study cases free surface flow motion was defined by the vof method which consists through the transport equation of a scalar the volume fraction α eq 3 to identify the position of the free surface from the volume fraction which takes value 0 in the air and 1 in the water the position of the free surface is defined by value 0 5 3 α t u j α x j 0 the fluent model uses the finite volume method to discretize equations in this study the algorithm simplec semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent was used for the pressure velocity coupling a second order implicit scheme for time integration with time step below t 600 was used didier et al 2011 conde et al 2011 teixeira et al 2013 dias et al 2015 mendonça et al 2017 both phases were incompressible and the hric high resolution interface capturing method peric and ferziger 1997 was used for defining the free surface the turbulence model k ε was also employed relaxation parameters were 1 for pressure momentum and volume fraction and 0 8 for turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence dissipation rate the presto pressure staggering option method was used for spatial discretization of pressure classically used for wave propagation modeling in fluent while the interpolation scheme of third order muscl monotone upstream centered schemes for conservation laws was adopted to momentum and turbulence 2 3 mathematical models the computational domain and boundary conditions of case a are shown in fig 2 similar conditions were employed in case b the incident wave generation was imposed by a udf user defined functions applied to the wave maker boundary velocity component profiles which are related to time and depth according to the linear wave theory dean and dalrymple 1991 were imposed and the corresponding free surface position was defined by the volume fraction value 0 for air and 1 for water besides small values of turbulence kinetic energy k 10 6 m2 s2 and dissipation rate ε 10 6 m2 s3 were imposed on this boundary following lin and liu 1998 wu 2004 and elhanafi et al 2016b an active absorption technique was imposed at the wave generation didier et al 2016 teixeira et al 2017 to eliminate re reflection of waves on the tank by using the methodology proposed by schäffer and klopman 2000 that is based on the linear shallow water theory this methodology has shown that it works relatively well even when used for waves outside the shallow water range didier et al 2016 teixeira et al 2017 the active absorption allows the use of a relative small length of numerical flume low computational cost since long flume domains are typically used for increasing the number of waves that must propagate before they start to re reflect on the tank it should be highlighted that when re reflection occurs it prevents data acquisition from taking place the non slip condition was imposed on walls of the structure and the bottom the atmospheric pressure was applied to the top boundary of the wave flume pressure loss due to the turbine was imposed on the top boundary of the chamber fig 2 by means of udf didier et al 2011 conde et al 2011 teixeira et al 2013 torres et al 2016 based on the relation between the pressure and the volumetric flow rate of the wells turbine given by sheng et al 2013 torres et al 2016 4 δ p k t q where k t is the turbine characteristic relation and δp is the pressure difference between the atmosphere and the owc chamber the pressure was imposed at each instant based on the flow rate of the previous instant considering that a 2d flow hydrodynamic mathematical model was employed in this study the air flow rate computed in the fluent model is per unit width therefore to take into account the real value of the volumetric flow rate q in eq 4 it was multiplied by the width of the owc chamber that was 10 m in this study torres et al 2016 thus the 3d pressure effect inside the owc air chamber due to the turbine can be considered on both top boundaries of the flume and the chamber turbulence kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε of 10 6 m2 s2 and 10 6 m2 s3 respectively were imposed free surface level at rest at 10 m depth null velocity components hydrostatic pressure on the water and atmospheric pressure on the air were initial conditions turbulence kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε were 10 6 m2 s2 and 10 6 m2 s3 respectively the cartesian mesh had 70 elements per wavelength in the horizontal direction and there were refinements near the static wave maker element size of 1 m and around the chamber element size of 0 125 m intermediate zones had gradual variation of element sizes in the vertical direction there were 25 elements per wave height around the free surface zones h above and below the still water level element sizes increased gradually to the top boundary and were maintained on the bottom with increase at the middle of the depth previous studies have shown that wave propagation in fluent is well simulated by 70 elements per wavelength in the horizontal direction and 25 elements in the vertical direction in the region of the free surface consequently the cartesian mesh fig 3 was constructed with these characteristics and a refinement near the static wave maker the chamber walls and the flume bottom teixeira et al 2013 didier et al 2016 mendonça et al 2017 the number of cells ranged from 25664 to 48949 since it depends on the wave characteristic and the type of the case methodologies and numerical parameters shown in this section have been validated and applied to owc wave converters by conde et al 2011 didier et al 2011 teixeira et al 2013 dias et al 2015 and mendonça et al 2017 2 4 energy balance the evaluation of the energy balance was based on the energy conservation law in which the amount of wave energy entering the system source must be equal to the sum of energy leaving the system and the amount of energy absorbed in it sinks fleming et al 2012 storage energy due to front wall run up run down water column heave and sloshing was kept inside the system during the process and exchanges energy with the source and sinks reflected wave power take off viscous and turbulence losses and vortex transport were responsible for sinks fig 4 shows a flowchart of the energy distribution due to the action of incident waves on an onshore owc device the incident wave energy e i is responsible for the energy source energy sinks are composed by the reflected wave energy e r the extracted pneumatic energy e e power take off and energy losses e l due to viscous and turbulence losses and vortex transport therefore considering the energy conservation law the following equation can be expressed 5 e i e r e e e l it is important to emphasize that tseng et al 2000 and elhanafi et al 2016a 2017 stated that the incident wave energy is composed of the reflected wave energy the extracted pneumatic energy energy losses and also added the potential energy related to the water column heave in this study the potential energy was considered stored energy in agreement with fleming et al 2012 folley and whittaker 2002 also observed that energy sinks are composed only of e r e e and e l thus the energy of the water column heave was here considered the energy transferred from the incident wave energy to others but it does not contribute to any energy dissipation the energy source is provided by the incident wave whose energy takes into account the linear theory dean and dalrymple 1991 and is given by 6 e i 1 8 ρ g h 2 l b where ρ is the water specific mass g is the gravity acceleration h is the incident wave height l is the wavelength and b is the width of the chamber in this case 10 m the reflected wave energy e r is proportional to h r 2 where h r is the reflected wave height as follows 7 e r 1 8 ρ g h r 2 l b there are different methods to evaluate the reflected wave by using the fourier transform the method used by this study was firstly proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 improved by mansard and funke 1980 for irregular waves and modified by baquerizo 1995 this method requires time series of surface elevation in three gauges g1 g2 and g3 along the flume located in the middle of the flume fig 5 the distance among them must be adequate to minimize numerical instabilities sousa et al 2011 g2 and g3 are distant from g1 in 0 1l and 0 27l respectively the pneumatic energy extracted by the turbine is calculated by the expression torres et al 2016 8 e e 0 t δ p t q t d t where t is the wave period δp is the pressure difference between the air inside the chamber and atmosphere and q is the volumetric flow rate caused by the free surface displacement inside the chamber at each instant the integral of the air pressure inside the air chamber was monitored the average air pressure inside the chamber was this integral divided by the chamber volume energy losses e l are composed of viscous and turbulence losses that occur mainly in the vortex formation and sometimes due to wave breaking it is obtained by eq 5 since e i e r and e e can be calculated by monitoring variables during the simulation in this study percentages of energy were discussed e r 100 e r e i e e 100 e e e i and e l 100 e l e i e r can be also expressed by e r 100 c r 2 where c r is the relation between the reflected wave height and the incident wave height h r h besides gauges employed to determine the wave reflection height in the middle of the flume there were other gauges located around owc chambers to monitor variables of flows as shown in fig 5 in case b gauges g1 to g3 were located at the same position as case a gauges g4 to g9 also had similar positions to case a however instead of being vertical they were inclined as the wall slope therefore to obtain free surface elevations measurements were project vertically gauges on the front wall outside the chamber g4 allowed observing time series of the free surface in this position and calculating values of run up and run down five gauges inside the chamber were used for estimating the sloshing g5 to g9 and mean free surface oscillation h c inside the chamber was obtained from the water volume inside the chamber 3 results and discussion in this section behavior of cases considering an incident regular wave with a period t 9 s and a height h 1 5 m and a turbine with kt 50 pa s m3 are discussed velocity magnitude contours and streamlines at nine instants along a wave period are analyzed to describe the main phenomena qualitatively afterwards the analysis of the wave structure interaction is separated in two parts outside and inside the chamber finally the analysis of the energy distribution is carried out 3 1 analysis of owc behavior due to an incident wave of t 9 s and h 1 5 m figs 6 and 7 show velocity magnitude contours and streamlines at nine instants during a wave period in both cases a and b respectively considering an incident regular wave of t 9 s and h 1 5 m and a turbine characteristic relation kt 50 pa s m 3 these plots allow analyzing the flow field and the fluid structure behavior between the two configurations the first instant was related to the zero up crossing of the free surface position inside the chamber in both cases the highest velocity magnitudes were located around the corner of the submerged front wall and at the free surface on the front wall very low values of the velocity magnitude were observed on the corner between the back wall and the bottom mainly in case a other characteristics which were common in both cases were the presence of vortices front wall run up and run down and the sloshing inside the chamber vortices dissipated energy and decrease the effective width of the inlet müller and whittaker 1995 in both cases vortices started to grow during the changing of inflow to outflow and vice versa case a had vortices with the highest diameter run up down of case b were higher than those of case a due to the wall slope of the former the sloshing inside the chamber was induced by the water flow that must change its direction from horizontal to vertical when it enters into the chamber and inverts when it exits the sector of the fluid near the back wall had higher momentum in comparison with the one near the front wall and consequently the free surface elevation near the back wall experiments higher oscillation than the opposite wall it occurred in both cases but it was more intense in case b because of its wall slopes fig 8 shows time series of the air pressure inside the chamber and the pneumatic power available in the turbine in both cases synchronized with figs 6 and 7 the phase between the pressure and the elevation inside the chamber curves in fig 14 was practically 90 as expected case b had the highest pneumatic power and showed inhalation and exhalation with similar maximum amplitude however case a had significant differences in pressure and pneumatic power amplitudes in the exhalation in comparison with the inhalation pressure amplitudes of 3 74 kpa and 3 35 kpa and pneumatic power amplitudes of 279 23 kw and 225 69 kw time averaged pneumatic powers obtained in cases a and b were 121 33 kw and 158 62 kw respectively 3 2 analysis of the wave structure interaction outside the chamber in this section the free surface elevation on the front wall outside the chamber and the reflected wave are analyzed fig 9 shows time series of the free surface elevation η and its rate η t outside the front wall gauge g4 during a wave period synchronized with figs 6 and 7 due to an incident wave of t 9 s and h 1 5 m and turbine characteristic relation kt 50 pa s m 3 case b showed the highest run up 1 37 m due to its front wall slope case a reached its run up faster than that of case b which is an important fact that indicated different fluid structure interaction behavior case b had also the highest run down 1 02 m run down in case a occurred at 0 628t from the run up which was higher than the interval expected in a fully reflected wave on a vertical wall 0 500t however run down of case b occurred around 0 260t from its run up free surface elevation rates on the front wall outside the chamber had a strong non linear behavior in comparison to that expected in stationary waves the free surface elevation rate when it went to up reached maximum values of 8 8 m s case a that was much higher than that expected in a stationary wave 0 5 m s the free surface elevation rate when it goes down in case b is much higher 14 3 m s than that of case a 7 1 m s this difference was the consequence of the fast variation from run up to run down in case b fig 10 shows front wall run up down h run versus the incident wave period with h 1 5 m kt 50 pa s m 3 the incident wave height with t 9 s kt 50 pa s m 3 and the turbine characteristic relation with t 9 s h 1 5 m in both cases values related to the run up were higher than those of the run down the highest h run occurred at t 6 s and the lowest one at t 9 s in case b while in case a h run slightly increased with the increase in the period fig 10a h run increased with the increase in h with more intensity in run up fig 10b maximum run up s were 2 81 m at t 12 s and h 2 5 m and 4 43 m at t 6 s and h 2 5 m in cases a and b respectively to avoid that a high run up causes a wave overtopping a wave breaker on the front wall can be used as the one employed in the owc device at the limpet plant folley and whittaker 2002 both run down and tide level are important to determine the dimension of the lip in this study the maximum run down occurred in h 2 5 m that was h run 1 28 m in case a at t 12 s and 2 65 m in case b at t 6 s the maximum run down in case b was higher than the dimension of the lip 2 5 m however even in this condition the entrance of air inside the chamber under the front wall did not occur because of the water column inside the chamber h run slightly increased with the increase in kt in case a 5 in run down and 15 in run up from the open chamber condition kt null to kt 250 pa s m 3 fig 10c this increase was much higher in case b 73 in run down and 90 in run up this was an expected behavior since the higher the kt the more intense is the air damping effect and consequently the resistance to the water flow inside the chamber fig 11 shows time series of free surface elevations at gauges g1 g2 and g3 in cases a a and b b and incident and reflected wave elevations in cases a c and b d in the case of an incident wave of t 9 s and h 1 5 m and a turbine characteristic relation kt 50 pa s m 3 gauges g1 g2 and g3 were located at the middle of the flume to determine incident and reflected waves free surfaces of these gauges had different behaviors in both cases due to the partial reflection of the incident wave caused by the owc chamber in this case reflected waves were approximately harmonic case a had the highest reflected height 0 61 m as expected because of its vertical front wall the reflected height in case b was 0 50 m fig 12 shows the reflected wave coefficient c r versus the incident wave period with h 1 5 m and kt 50 pa s m 3 incident wave height with t 9 s and kt 50 pa s m 3 and turbine characteristic relation with t 9 s and h 1 5 m in case a c r increased with the increase in t while in case b there was a minimum value around t 7 5 s the behavior observed in case b was similar to that observed by tseng et al 2000 who found a minimum reflection coefficient at a wave period near the natural period of oscillation in a caisson chamber case b had higher c r than that of case a at t 6 s however it inverted at higher incident wave periods fig 12a c r was almost constant with the increase in h at t 9 s fig 12b it means that h r was almost proportional to h which had the same behavior as h run fig 10b in both cases minimum c r occurred around kt 100 pa s m 3 0 42 and 0 39 in cases a and b respectively fig 12c which was in the range of the best efficiency values in this device 80 100 pa s m 3 for incident wave periods from 6 to 10 s according to teixeira et al 2013 maximum values of c r which were 0 74 and 0 77 in cases a and b respectively occurred in the open chamber condition behavior of c r in relation to kt showed minimum values in each range in both cases that was not noticed in h run it indicated the influence of the flow inside the chamber on reflected waves since kt is related to air damping imposed by the turbine fig 13 shows the distribution of c r with t and h for kt 50 pa s m 3 in both cases there was much lower variation of c r with h exception occurred at t 6 s and h 2 5 m in case b in which there may be reduction in c r because of wave breaking resulting from high wave steepness 3 3 analysis of the wave structure interaction inside the chamber this section discusses the behavior of the free surface elevation and the air inside the chamber fig 14 shows time series of free surface elevations of two gauges on the front gauge g5 and back gauge g9 walls inside the chamber synchronized with figs 6 and 7 during a wave period due to an incident wave of t 9 s and h 1 5 m and turbine characteristic relation kt 50 pa s m 3 in both cases the free surface oscillation on the back wall had higher amplitude than that of the front wall inside the chamber which characterizes the sloshing as shown in figs 6 and 7 it was more intense in case b because of the front and back wall slopes the quantification of the sloshing can be expressed by the sloshing parameter s that is the maximum difference between the free surface elevation at the front wall and that at the back one inside the chamber teixeira et al 2013 in case a s 0 29 m which was much lower than that in case b s 1 74 m fig 15 shows the distribution of the oscillating water column height inside the chamber h c in relation to h and t in cases a and b and kt 50 pa s m 3 in both cases h c tended to increase with the increase in h and t as expected fig 16 shows h c versus the incident wave period with h 1 5 m and kt 50 pa s m 3 incident wave height with t 9 s and kt 50 pa s m 3 and turbine characteristic relation with t 9 s and h 1 5 m case b had h c lower than that of case a at incident wave periods which were lower than 8 s fig 16a at t 9 s case b had the highest values of h c along the incident wave height h differences increased with the increase in h fig 16b h c decreased with the increase in kt in both cases from 2 57 m to 3 50 m kt null to 0 94 m and 0 89 m kt 250 pa s m 3 in cases a and b respectively fig 16c this behavior was expected since the higher the kt air damping the higher the air pressure inside the chamber and consequently the lower the free surface elevation fig 17 shows the phase φ between the free surface elevation on the front wall outside the chamber gauge g4 and the mean free surface elevation inside the chamber average value in the chamber length along the incident wave period with h 1 5 m and kt 50 pa s m 3 although measures of free surface elevations are not at the same position this phase shows the level of the synchronism between outside and inside movements at t 9 s phases of both cases were around 50 this condition was the same shown in figs 6 and 7 and the meaning of the phase can be observed at instant t 4 when the free surface inside the chamber was approximately the maximum in this case the flow starts to exit and the outside flow imposed by the incident wave was in the same direction it contributed to increase the exit of energy taken away by the reflected waves a phase close to null indicated a good synchronism of this movement and thus at high values of t in which φ was low the reflected wave coefficient was high fig 12a the minimum value of c r observed at t 7 5 s in case b coincided with the maximum value of φ around 101 that indicated a low synchronism between elevations besides the simultaneous change of the slopes of φ and c r curves at t 9 s showed significant correlation between both variables fig 18 shows the distribution of the sloshing parameter s in relation to h and t in cases a and b and kt 50 pa s m 3 which showed different behavior in both cases the highest values of s were around t 7 5 s at every heights h the lowest values of s were observed at t 12 s and around 10 5 s in cases a and b respectively fig 19 shows the sloshing parameter versus the incident wave period with h 1 5 m and kt 50 pa s m 3 the incident wave height with t 9 s and kt 50 pa s m 3 and the turbine characteristic relation with t 9 s and h 1 5 m in case a s increased up to t 7 5 s and subsequently decreased up to t 12 s fig 19a in case b s increased from t 6 s to around t 7 5 s and then decreased up to t 10 5 s and increased up to t 12 s these variations in s observed along the incident wave period indicated specific behavior of the free surface elevation inside the chamber which was not related to the oscillating water column height fig 16a in both cases s increased along h with approximately linear behavior in case a fig 19b the behavior of s in relation to kt was similar to that of h c fig 19c it decreased with kt increase in both cases from 0 80 m to 2 68 m kt null to 0 25 m and 0 80 m kt 250 pa s m 3 in cases a and b respectively the tendency of s in relation to h and kt was similar to that of h c observed in fig 16b and c maximum and minimum free surface elevations inside the chamber along the incident wave period which were reached on front and back walls at an incident wave height h 2 5 m and kt 50 pa s m 3 are shown in fig 20 in general extreme elevations increased with the increase in the period while the highest values occurred at t 12 s in case b differences between extremes of front and back walls were higher than those found in case a the highest difference was observed at t 6 s the lowest elevations on the front wall that occurred at t 12 s are important dimensions to compare with its submerged dimension in this study the submerged distance of the front wall was 2 5 m and the lowest elevations were 1 51 m and 1 44 m in cases a and b respectively the highest elevations on the back wall have to be taken into consideration during the chamber design to prevent the water from flowing into the turbine values of 2 35 m and 3 58 m were found in cases a and b respectively since these limits were dependent on the turbine characteristic relation the open chamber condition promoted the lowest and the highest values of the free surface elevation on the walls the lowest elevation on the front wall and the highest elevation on the back wall at t 12 s h 2 5 m and in the open air chamber condition were 2 00 m and 2 62 m in case a and 2 03 m and 4 50 m in case b respectively 3 4 energy distribution fig 21 shows the distribution of percentage of extracted energy e e reflected wave energy e r and energy losses e l with kt 50 pa s m 3 in case a at different h and t e e decreased with increase in h there was a peak of e e which was 55 at around t 7 5 s its lowest values were found at the highest h and at the lowest and the highest periods e r had behavior that expresses its proportionality with c r 2 c r plot is shown in fig 13a e l decreased with increase in t and slightly increased with increase in h the lowest value of e l around 10 occurred at t 12 s and h 1 0 m fig 22 shows the distribution of e e e r and e l in case b at different h and t with kt 50 pa s m 3 wave period strongly influenced e e whose maximum value was 65 at t 9 s and h 1 0 m the lowest value of e e was 15 at t 6 s e r had similar behavior of that in case a but it was almost indifferent in relation to the variation h at higher periods e r ranged from 10 at t 6s and h 2 5 m to 40 at t 12 s the behavior of e l was also similar to that in case a but it had less sensitivity in relation to h its variation was high from 10 to 70 percentages of energy sinks e r e e and e l at different incident wave periods with h 1 5 m and kt 50 pa s m 3 are shown in fig 23 in both cases from t 8 12 s e e in case b was higher than that in case a with the maximum at around t 9 s this fact infers an advantage of case b since it had the highest percentage of the extracted energy at the highest periods in which the incident wave has the highest energy potential however low variation in e e with the wave period in case a can be important in sea states whose wave energy is spread from short to long periods the percentage of the reflected energy e r in case a was higher than that in case b from t 7 12 s energy losses e l had low values from t 8 12 s and high ones close to t 6 s in both cases at t 12 s values of e l were similar in both cases in h 1 5 m and t from 8 to 12 s both energy losses and reflected energy found in case a were higher than the ones in case b consequently the extracted energy in case a was lower at periods below 8 s this situation was inverted and the extracted energy in case a was higher than that in case b in this study e l decreased with increase in t but e r had inverse behavior studies of interactions between waves and structures goda 2010 show that the reflected wave height increases with increase in t and it explains behavior of e r however e l is related to energy losses due to viscosity and turbulence effects and it depends on phenomena inside and outside the chamber water dynamics inside the chamber can be represented by h c wherein there was increase with increase in t fig 16a thus behavior of h c with t was inverse to that of e l which indicated that the behavior of e l was not significantly influenced by water dynamics inside the chamber however run up down which can be considered representations of dynamics outside the chamber had high values at low periods fig 10a this fact justifies the high value of e l at low periods this analysis infers that e l was predominantly influenced by energy losses outside the chamber fig 24 shows percentages of energy sinks versus the turbine characteristic relation at an incident wave t 9 s and h 1 5 m in the open chamber condition kt null e e was null and e r represented around 60 of the incident wave energy in both cases the rest was related to energy losses e l the maximum e e occurred around kt 100 pa s m 3 in both cases 60 and 68 in cases a and b respectively that corresponded to the minimum e r 18 and 15 in cases a and b respectively e l decreased with increase in kt due to the low momentum magnitude 4 conclusions analysis of the behavior and energy distribution of two onshore owc devices with different slopes of their chamber walls located at the end of a 10 m deep flume subjected to regular waves was carried out case a had vertical chamber walls and in case b front and back walls had slopes of 40 the fluent rans vof model was used and methodologies to consider a wells turbine and wave generation with active absorption were employed the methodology developed by mansard and funke 1980 was applied to calculate the reflected wave height in both cases an important dependence of the wave structure interaction behavior on the incident wave period was observed differently from the incident wave height and the turbine characteristic relation the wave reflection of case a was more intense than that in case b except at incident wave period of 6 s reflected energy reached more than 45 and 40 of the incident wave energy in cases a and b respectively at t 12 s this magnitude must be diminished to increase the efficiency of the devices mainly in case a efficiency in case b was higher than that in case a at the highest wave periods in which the wave energy source had the highest potential however the lowest variation in the efficiency in case a can be interesting in sea states whose wave energy is spread from short to long periods besides the influence of reflected wave energy on the efficiency of the devices energy losses were representative in the sink in general this energy increased when reflected energy decreased this fact is expected once the lower the reflected energy the higher the fluid dynamics around and inside the chamber and consequently the losses results of the free surface elevation inside and outside the chamber showed that these losses were predominantly influenced by the energy losses outside the chamber additionally the sloshing inside the chamber did not influence energy losses significantly due to the slope of the walls case b had higher run up down and sloshing inside the chamber than those in case a these characteristics are important to take into account in the device design to calculate the adequate dimensions of lip and chamber height to prevent air from entering the chamber and water from approximating the turbine level although reflected wave energy and energy losses are inherent to the process of wave energy extraction the methodology used in this analysis is an important tool to support designers to develop optimal geometries for onshore owc devices another aspect to take into account is the influence of different geometries on chamber construction however this topic is not within the scope of this study credit

21988,in this study a numerical analysis of the performance of two oscillating water column owc wave energy converters at different front and back wall slopes was carried out the first device had vertical front and back walls and the second one had its wall slopes of 40 in relation to the horizontal plane the fluent numerical model which is based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations was used the volume of fluid vof method was employed to take into account free surface flows the case study comprised a 10 m deep flume with an onshore owc at its end equipped with a wells turbine a 2d hydrodynamic mathematical model was employed and a 3d air pressure effect inside the owc air chamber was considered analyses of the hydrodynamics behavior fluid structure interaction outside run up down reflected waves and inside the chamber free surface elevation sloshing and energy distribution pneumatic extracted energy reflected wave energy and energy losses were conducted results showed that the device with inclined walls had the best efficiency in comparison with the other one however the latter showed lower variation in efficiency in the wave period range than the former keywords wave energy oscillating water column device numerical simulation finite volume method volume of fluid 1 introduction ocean energy from waves tides currents thermal variabilities and salinity gradients are alternative sources to substitute fossil fuels nevertheless these energy sources have insignificant installed power in the global energetic matrix as opposed to wind and solar ones that have developed technologies to generate electricity commercially difficulties are due to the hostile environment and the diversity of the ocean energy source which cause high cost of construction and maintenance and consequently poses a great challenge to design engineers overcoming this challenge can cause high impact on the importance of ocean energy in the global energetic matrix besides the available wave energy in the world is around 32 000 tw year similar to the world electric energy demand cruz 2008 its contribution would be meaningful even if only a little of this source is extracted although the potential of wave energy is significant there are no devices in commercial scale yet the oscillating water column owc wave energy converter is the most studied device it consists of a partially submerged concrete or steel structure chamber opened below the water free surface falcão 2010 the incident wave induces an oscillation of free surface inside the chamber that compresses and decompresses the confined air and makes both a turbine and a generator work to generate electricity ghosh and prelas 2011 this device can float nearshore and offshore or be inserted in a breakwater or installed on the coast onshore the owc integrated in a breakwater has important advantages it shares construction costs and it is easily accessed for construction operation and maintenance the wells turbine created in mid 1970 s is the most used type in prototypes its flow is axial and its rotational direction does not depend on the flow direction some examples of onshore prototypes in real scale are pico s plant 400 kw at cachorro port azores portugal limpet 500 kw on isley island united kingdom toftes 500 kw in norway sakata 60 kw in japan vizhinjam in india and mutriku 300 kw in spain nowadays several researchers have been looking for energy wave converter devices with optimal efficiency to reach economically feasible designs however this search requires understanding of the energy balance of this complex system that involves wave structure interaction with strong non linearity therefore since energy losses are identified and quantified different systems and design optimizations can be proposed to increase device efficiency tseng et al 2000 investigated experimentally the energy balance of an onshore owc device and reported three types of energy that could be directly identified energy losses mainly viscous ones reflected energy and pneumatic energy subdivided into effective energy and turbine losses folley and whittaker 2002 reported mechanisms such as run up and run down on the front wall sloshing and water oscillating inside the chamber of the energy balance in a limpet type owc fleming et al 2012 studied the energy transfer process of a forward facing bent duct oscillating water column two dimensional velocity fields obtained by means of particle imaging velocimetry piv were used for analyzing the kinematic energy and vorticity inside and around the device elhanafi et al 2016a studied the energy balance in an onshore owc numerically partitioning the absorbed energy in energy losses and the water column oscillation potential energy inside the chamber besides the authors employed coefficients to represent each energy quantity in relation to the total the numerical analysis of this energy distribution of onshore owc devices that involves complex phenomena such as viscosity effects wave breaking and both nonlinear wave structure interaction and hydro aerodynamic coupling requires the use of accurate models models based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are a good option liu et al 2008 2009a 2009b marjani et al 2008 conde et al 2011 didier et al 2011 teixeira et al 2013 lópez et al 2014 luo et al 2014 iturrioz et al 2015 kamath et al 2015 lópez et al 2016 bouali and larbi 2017 elhanafi et al 2017 mahnamfar and altunkaynak 2017 ning et al 2017 tsai et al 2018 some of these researchers have investigated different geometries of onshore owc devices by means of rans models to understand their behavior and to find conditions to achieve optimum performance however none analyzed the influence of these geometry variations on the energy distribution with the use of rans models this study aims at analyzing the performance and the energy distribution of two owc devices with different slopes of chamber walls taking into account air damping inside the chamber due to a wells turbine the first owc case a had vertical front and back walls the second one case b had its front and back wall slopes equal to 40 in relation to the horizontal plane the fluent numerical model fluent 2016 which is based on rans equations discretized by means of the finite volume technique was used the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 was employed to take into consideration free surface flows both case studies consisted of a 10 m deep flume with the onshore owc at its end a wells turbine was coupled to the chamber and it was modeled by using user defined functions udfs incident waves with heights from 1 0 to 2 5 m and periods from 6 to 12 s were tested the influence of the turbine characteristic relation kt of a wells turbine from open condition kt null to kt 250 pa s m 3 was also investigated 2 methodology 2 1 case studies both case studies consisted in a 10 m deep flume and with two different owc s at its end fig 1 subject to incident regular waves the flume length was 2l where l is the wavelength calculated by the dispersion equation of a linear wave dean and dalrymple 1991 both owc chambers were 10 m wide and 10 m long with a front wall 0 5 m thick submerged in 2 5 m the chamber was 6 m high from the still water level and a wells turbine was used for extracting the pneumatic energy case a fig 1a had vertical front and back walls its geometry was similar to the pico s plant case b fig 1b had its front and back wall slopes of 40 it was the same slope of the front wall above the water level of limpet s owc water and air volumes inside the chamber in case b were the same as those in case a analyses were carried out by using incident waves with periods from 6 to 12 s and heights from 1 0 to 2 5 m the influence of the turbine characteristic relation was also investigated values ranged from null open case to kt 250 pa s m 3 that was inversely proportional to the actual turbine diameter and proportional to the operational rotational speed torres et al 2016 therefore there are several combinations of turbine diameters and rotational speeds for each value of kt 2 2 fluent numerical model simulations were carried out by means of fluent fluent 2016 numerical model taking into account incompressible fluid flows that can be described by the continuity and navier stokes equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t i u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i g i 1 ρ τ i j x j where i j 1 2 for 2d flow u i are velocity components t is the time p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density g i are gravitational acceleration components and τ ij is the viscous stress tensor in this study rans equations based on the decomposition of the instantaneous velocity and pressure fields of the navier stokes equations eqs 1 and 2 into mean and fluctuating components and the subsequent time averaging of the set of equations were used this process introduces reynolds stress terms associated with turbulence a turbulence model was applied to relate the reynolds stresses to mean flow variables and close the equations although it is well known that compressibility effects of the air can reduce device efficiency up to around 10 as reported by teixeira et al 2013 medina lópez et al 2017 and elhanafi et al 2017 the air was incompressible in this study since simulations considering compressible air demands high computational cost however this simplification does not influence the comparative investigation of these study cases free surface flow motion was defined by the vof method which consists through the transport equation of a scalar the volume fraction α eq 3 to identify the position of the free surface from the volume fraction which takes value 0 in the air and 1 in the water the position of the free surface is defined by value 0 5 3 α t u j α x j 0 the fluent model uses the finite volume method to discretize equations in this study the algorithm simplec semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent was used for the pressure velocity coupling a second order implicit scheme for time integration with time step below t 600 was used didier et al 2011 conde et al 2011 teixeira et al 2013 dias et al 2015 mendonça et al 2017 both phases were incompressible and the hric high resolution interface capturing method peric and ferziger 1997 was used for defining the free surface the turbulence model k ε was also employed relaxation parameters were 1 for pressure momentum and volume fraction and 0 8 for turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence dissipation rate the presto pressure staggering option method was used for spatial discretization of pressure classically used for wave propagation modeling in fluent while the interpolation scheme of third order muscl monotone upstream centered schemes for conservation laws was adopted to momentum and turbulence 2 3 mathematical models the computational domain and boundary conditions of case a are shown in fig 2 similar conditions were employed in case b the incident wave generation was imposed by a udf user defined functions applied to the wave maker boundary velocity component profiles which are related to time and depth according to the linear wave theory dean and dalrymple 1991 were imposed and the corresponding free surface position was defined by the volume fraction value 0 for air and 1 for water besides small values of turbulence kinetic energy k 10 6 m2 s2 and dissipation rate ε 10 6 m2 s3 were imposed on this boundary following lin and liu 1998 wu 2004 and elhanafi et al 2016b an active absorption technique was imposed at the wave generation didier et al 2016 teixeira et al 2017 to eliminate re reflection of waves on the tank by using the methodology proposed by schäffer and klopman 2000 that is based on the linear shallow water theory this methodology has shown that it works relatively well even when used for waves outside the shallow water range didier et al 2016 teixeira et al 2017 the active absorption allows the use of a relative small length of numerical flume low computational cost since long flume domains are typically used for increasing the number of waves that must propagate before they start to re reflect on the tank it should be highlighted that when re reflection occurs it prevents data acquisition from taking place the non slip condition was imposed on walls of the structure and the bottom the atmospheric pressure was applied to the top boundary of the wave flume pressure loss due to the turbine was imposed on the top boundary of the chamber fig 2 by means of udf didier et al 2011 conde et al 2011 teixeira et al 2013 torres et al 2016 based on the relation between the pressure and the volumetric flow rate of the wells turbine given by sheng et al 2013 torres et al 2016 4 δ p k t q where k t is the turbine characteristic relation and δp is the pressure difference between the atmosphere and the owc chamber the pressure was imposed at each instant based on the flow rate of the previous instant considering that a 2d flow hydrodynamic mathematical model was employed in this study the air flow rate computed in the fluent model is per unit width therefore to take into account the real value of the volumetric flow rate q in eq 4 it was multiplied by the width of the owc chamber that was 10 m in this study torres et al 2016 thus the 3d pressure effect inside the owc air chamber due to the turbine can be considered on both top boundaries of the flume and the chamber turbulence kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε of 10 6 m2 s2 and 10 6 m2 s3 respectively were imposed free surface level at rest at 10 m depth null velocity components hydrostatic pressure on the water and atmospheric pressure on the air were initial conditions turbulence kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε were 10 6 m2 s2 and 10 6 m2 s3 respectively the cartesian mesh had 70 elements per wavelength in the horizontal direction and there were refinements near the static wave maker element size of 1 m and around the chamber element size of 0 125 m intermediate zones had gradual variation of element sizes in the vertical direction there were 25 elements per wave height around the free surface zones h above and below the still water level element sizes increased gradually to the top boundary and were maintained on the bottom with increase at the middle of the depth previous studies have shown that wave propagation in fluent is well simulated by 70 elements per wavelength in the horizontal direction and 25 elements in the vertical direction in the region of the free surface consequently the cartesian mesh fig 3 was constructed with these characteristics and a refinement near the static wave maker the chamber walls and the flume bottom teixeira et al 2013 didier et al 2016 mendonça et al 2017 the number of cells ranged from 25664 to 48949 since it depends on the wave characteristic and the type of the case methodologies and numerical parameters shown in this section have been validated and applied to owc wave converters by conde et al 2011 didier et al 2011 teixeira et al 2013 dias et al 2015 and mendonça et al 2017 2 4 energy balance the evaluation of the energy balance was based on the energy conservation law in which the amount of wave energy entering the system source must be equal to the sum of energy leaving the system and the amount of energy absorbed in it sinks fleming et al 2012 storage energy due to front wall run up run down water column heave and sloshing was kept inside the system during the process and exchanges energy with the source and sinks reflected wave power take off viscous and turbulence losses and vortex transport were responsible for sinks fig 4 shows a flowchart of the energy distribution due to the action of incident waves on an onshore owc device the incident wave energy e i is responsible for the energy source energy sinks are composed by the reflected wave energy e r the extracted pneumatic energy e e power take off and energy losses e l due to viscous and turbulence losses and vortex transport therefore considering the energy conservation law the following equation can be expressed 5 e i e r e e e l it is important to emphasize that tseng et al 2000 and elhanafi et al 2016a 2017 stated that the incident wave energy is composed of the reflected wave energy the extracted pneumatic energy energy losses and also added the potential energy related to the water column heave in this study the potential energy was considered stored energy in agreement with fleming et al 2012 folley and whittaker 2002 also observed that energy sinks are composed only of e r e e and e l thus the energy of the water column heave was here considered the energy transferred from the incident wave energy to others but it does not contribute to any energy dissipation the energy source is provided by the incident wave whose energy takes into account the linear theory dean and dalrymple 1991 and is given by 6 e i 1 8 ρ g h 2 l b where ρ is the water specific mass g is the gravity acceleration h is the incident wave height l is the wavelength and b is the width of the chamber in this case 10 m the reflected wave energy e r is proportional to h r 2 where h r is the reflected wave height as follows 7 e r 1 8 ρ g h r 2 l b there are different methods to evaluate the reflected wave by using the fourier transform the method used by this study was firstly proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 improved by mansard and funke 1980 for irregular waves and modified by baquerizo 1995 this method requires time series of surface elevation in three gauges g1 g2 and g3 along the flume located in the middle of the flume fig 5 the distance among them must be adequate to minimize numerical instabilities sousa et al 2011 g2 and g3 are distant from g1 in 0 1l and 0 27l respectively the pneumatic energy extracted by the turbine is calculated by the expression torres et al 2016 8 e e 0 t δ p t q t d t where t is the wave period δp is the pressure difference between the air inside the chamber and atmosphere and q is the volumetric flow rate caused by the free surface displacement inside the chamber at each instant the integral of the air pressure inside the air chamber was monitored the average air pressure inside the chamber was this integral divided by the chamber volume energy losses e l are composed of viscous and turbulence losses that occur mainly in the vortex formation and sometimes due to wave breaking it is obtained by eq 5 since e i e r and e e can be calculated by monitoring variables during the simulation in this study percentages of energy were discussed e r 100 e r e i e e 100 e e e i and e l 100 e l e i e r can be also expressed by e r 100 c r 2 where c r is the relation between the reflected wave height and the incident wave height h r h besides gauges employed to determine the wave reflection height in the middle of the flume there were other gauges located around owc chambers to monitor variables of flows as shown in fig 5 in case b gauges g1 to g3 were located at the same position as case a gauges g4 to g9 also had similar positions to case a however instead of being vertical they were inclined as the wall slope therefore to obtain free surface elevations measurements were project vertically gauges on the front wall outside the chamber g4 allowed observing time series of the free surface in this position and calculating values of run up and run down five gauges inside the chamber were used for estimating the sloshing g5 to g9 and mean free surface oscillation h c inside the chamber was obtained from the water volume inside the chamber 3 results and discussion in this section behavior of cases considering an incident regular wave with a period t 9 s and a height h 1 5 m and a turbine with kt 50 pa s m3 are discussed velocity magnitude contours and streamlines at nine instants along a wave period are analyzed to describe the main phenomena qualitatively afterwards the analysis of the wave structure interaction is separated in two parts outside and inside the chamber finally the analysis of the energy distribution is carried out 3 1 analysis of owc behavior due to an incident wave of t 9 s and h 1 5 m figs 6 and 7 show velocity magnitude contours and streamlines at nine instants during a wave period in both cases a and b respectively considering an incident regular wave of t 9 s and h 1 5 m and a turbine characteristic relation kt 50 pa s m 3 these plots allow analyzing the flow field and the fluid structure behavior between the two configurations the first instant was related to the zero up crossing of the free surface position inside the chamber in both cases the highest velocity magnitudes were located around the corner of the submerged front wall and at the free surface on the front wall very low values of the velocity magnitude were observed on the corner between the back wall and the bottom mainly in case a other characteristics which were common in both cases were the presence of vortices front wall run up and run down and the sloshing inside the chamber vortices dissipated energy and decrease the effective width of the inlet müller and whittaker 1995 in both cases vortices started to grow during the changing of inflow to outflow and vice versa case a had vortices with the highest diameter run up down of case b were higher than those of case a due to the wall slope of the former the sloshing inside the chamber was induced by the water flow that must change its direction from horizontal to vertical when it enters into the chamber and inverts when it exits the sector of the fluid near the back wall had higher momentum in comparison with the one near the front wall and consequently the free surface elevation near the back wall experiments higher oscillation than the opposite wall it occurred in both cases but it was more intense in case b because of its wall slopes fig 8 shows time series of the air pressure inside the chamber and the pneumatic power available in the turbine in both cases synchronized with figs 6 and 7 the phase between the pressure and the elevation inside the chamber curves in fig 14 was practically 90 as expected case b had the highest pneumatic power and showed inhalation and exhalation with similar maximum amplitude however case a had significant differences in pressure and pneumatic power amplitudes in the exhalation in comparison with the inhalation pressure amplitudes of 3 74 kpa and 3 35 kpa and pneumatic power amplitudes of 279 23 kw and 225 69 kw time averaged pneumatic powers obtained in cases a and b were 121 33 kw and 158 62 kw respectively 3 2 analysis of the wave structure interaction outside the chamber in this section the free surface elevation on the front wall outside the chamber and the reflected wave are analyzed fig 9 shows time series of the free surface elevation η and its rate η t outside the front wall gauge g4 during a wave period synchronized with figs 6 and 7 due to an incident wave of t 9 s and h 1 5 m and turbine characteristic relation kt 50 pa s m 3 case b showed the highest run up 1 37 m due to its front wall slope case a reached its run up faster than that of case b which is an important fact that indicated different fluid structure interaction behavior case b had also the highest run down 1 02 m run down in case a occurred at 0 628t from the run up which was higher than the interval expected in a fully reflected wave on a vertical wall 0 500t however run down of case b occurred around 0 260t from its run up free surface elevation rates on the front wall outside the chamber had a strong non linear behavior in comparison to that expected in stationary waves the free surface elevation rate when it went to up reached maximum values of 8 8 m s case a that was much higher than that expected in a stationary wave 0 5 m s the free surface elevation rate when it goes down in case b is much higher 14 3 m s than that of case a 7 1 m s this difference was the consequence of the fast variation from run up to run down in case b fig 10 shows front wall run up down h run versus the incident wave period with h 1 5 m kt 50 pa s m 3 the incident wave height with t 9 s kt 50 pa s m 3 and the turbine characteristic relation with t 9 s h 1 5 m in both cases values related to the run up were higher than those of the run down the highest h run occurred at t 6 s and the lowest one at t 9 s in case b while in case a h run slightly increased with the increase in the period fig 10a h run increased with the increase in h with more intensity in run up fig 10b maximum run up s were 2 81 m at t 12 s and h 2 5 m and 4 43 m at t 6 s and h 2 5 m in cases a and b respectively to avoid that a high run up causes a wave overtopping a wave breaker on the front wall can be used as the one employed in the owc device at the limpet plant folley and whittaker 2002 both run down and tide level are important to determine the dimension of the lip in this study the maximum run down occurred in h 2 5 m that was h run 1 28 m in case a at t 12 s and 2 65 m in case b at t 6 s the maximum run down in case b was higher than the dimension of the lip 2 5 m however even in this condition the entrance of air inside the chamber under the front wall did not occur because of the water column inside the chamber h run slightly increased with the increase in kt in case a 5 in run down and 15 in run up from the open chamber condition kt null to kt 250 pa s m 3 fig 10c this increase was much higher in case b 73 in run down and 90 in run up this was an expected behavior since the higher the kt the more intense is the air damping effect and consequently the resistance to the water flow inside the chamber fig 11 shows time series of free surface elevations at gauges g1 g2 and g3 in cases a a and b b and incident and reflected wave elevations in cases a c and b d in the case of an incident wave of t 9 s and h 1 5 m and a turbine characteristic relation kt 50 pa s m 3 gauges g1 g2 and g3 were located at the middle of the flume to determine incident and reflected waves free surfaces of these gauges had different behaviors in both cases due to the partial reflection of the incident wave caused by the owc chamber in this case reflected waves were approximately harmonic case a had the highest reflected height 0 61 m as expected because of its vertical front wall the reflected height in case b was 0 50 m fig 12 shows the reflected wave coefficient c r versus the incident wave period with h 1 5 m and kt 50 pa s m 3 incident wave height with t 9 s and kt 50 pa s m 3 and turbine characteristic relation with t 9 s and h 1 5 m in case a c r increased with the increase in t while in case b there was a minimum value around t 7 5 s the behavior observed in case b was similar to that observed by tseng et al 2000 who found a minimum reflection coefficient at a wave period near the natural period of oscillation in a caisson chamber case b had higher c r than that of case a at t 6 s however it inverted at higher incident wave periods fig 12a c r was almost constant with the increase in h at t 9 s fig 12b it means that h r was almost proportional to h which had the same behavior as h run fig 10b in both cases minimum c r occurred around kt 100 pa s m 3 0 42 and 0 39 in cases a and b respectively fig 12c which was in the range of the best efficiency values in this device 80 100 pa s m 3 for incident wave periods from 6 to 10 s according to teixeira et al 2013 maximum values of c r which were 0 74 and 0 77 in cases a and b respectively occurred in the open chamber condition behavior of c r in relation to kt showed minimum values in each range in both cases that was not noticed in h run it indicated the influence of the flow inside the chamber on reflected waves since kt is related to air damping imposed by the turbine fig 13 shows the distribution of c r with t and h for kt 50 pa s m 3 in both cases there was much lower variation of c r with h exception occurred at t 6 s and h 2 5 m in case b in which there may be reduction in c r because of wave breaking resulting from high wave steepness 3 3 analysis of the wave structure interaction inside the chamber this section discusses the behavior of the free surface elevation and the air inside the chamber fig 14 shows time series of free surface elevations of two gauges on the front gauge g5 and back gauge g9 walls inside the chamber synchronized with figs 6 and 7 during a wave period due to an incident wave of t 9 s and h 1 5 m and turbine characteristic relation kt 50 pa s m 3 in both cases the free surface oscillation on the back wall had higher amplitude than that of the front wall inside the chamber which characterizes the sloshing as shown in figs 6 and 7 it was more intense in case b because of the front and back wall slopes the quantification of the sloshing can be expressed by the sloshing parameter s that is the maximum difference between the free surface elevation at the front wall and that at the back one inside the chamber teixeira et al 2013 in case a s 0 29 m which was much lower than that in case b s 1 74 m fig 15 shows the distribution of the oscillating water column height inside the chamber h c in relation to h and t in cases a and b and kt 50 pa s m 3 in both cases h c tended to increase with the increase in h and t as expected fig 16 shows h c versus the incident wave period with h 1 5 m and kt 50 pa s m 3 incident wave height with t 9 s and kt 50 pa s m 3 and turbine characteristic relation with t 9 s and h 1 5 m case b had h c lower than that of case a at incident wave periods which were lower than 8 s fig 16a at t 9 s case b had the highest values of h c along the incident wave height h differences increased with the increase in h fig 16b h c decreased with the increase in kt in both cases from 2 57 m to 3 50 m kt null to 0 94 m and 0 89 m kt 250 pa s m 3 in cases a and b respectively fig 16c this behavior was expected since the higher the kt air damping the higher the air pressure inside the chamber and consequently the lower the free surface elevation fig 17 shows the phase φ between the free surface elevation on the front wall outside the chamber gauge g4 and the mean free surface elevation inside the chamber average value in the chamber length along the incident wave period with h 1 5 m and kt 50 pa s m 3 although measures of free surface elevations are not at the same position this phase shows the level of the synchronism between outside and inside movements at t 9 s phases of both cases were around 50 this condition was the same shown in figs 6 and 7 and the meaning of the phase can be observed at instant t 4 when the free surface inside the chamber was approximately the maximum in this case the flow starts to exit and the outside flow imposed by the incident wave was in the same direction it contributed to increase the exit of energy taken away by the reflected waves a phase close to null indicated a good synchronism of this movement and thus at high values of t in which φ was low the reflected wave coefficient was high fig 12a the minimum value of c r observed at t 7 5 s in case b coincided with the maximum value of φ around 101 that indicated a low synchronism between elevations besides the simultaneous change of the slopes of φ and c r curves at t 9 s showed significant correlation between both variables fig 18 shows the distribution of the sloshing parameter s in relation to h and t in cases a and b and kt 50 pa s m 3 which showed different behavior in both cases the highest values of s were around t 7 5 s at every heights h the lowest values of s were observed at t 12 s and around 10 5 s in cases a and b respectively fig 19 shows the sloshing parameter versus the incident wave period with h 1 5 m and kt 50 pa s m 3 the incident wave height with t 9 s and kt 50 pa s m 3 and the turbine characteristic relation with t 9 s and h 1 5 m in case a s increased up to t 7 5 s and subsequently decreased up to t 12 s fig 19a in case b s increased from t 6 s to around t 7 5 s and then decreased up to t 10 5 s and increased up to t 12 s these variations in s observed along the incident wave period indicated specific behavior of the free surface elevation inside the chamber which was not related to the oscillating water column height fig 16a in both cases s increased along h with approximately linear behavior in case a fig 19b the behavior of s in relation to kt was similar to that of h c fig 19c it decreased with kt increase in both cases from 0 80 m to 2 68 m kt null to 0 25 m and 0 80 m kt 250 pa s m 3 in cases a and b respectively the tendency of s in relation to h and kt was similar to that of h c observed in fig 16b and c maximum and minimum free surface elevations inside the chamber along the incident wave period which were reached on front and back walls at an incident wave height h 2 5 m and kt 50 pa s m 3 are shown in fig 20 in general extreme elevations increased with the increase in the period while the highest values occurred at t 12 s in case b differences between extremes of front and back walls were higher than those found in case a the highest difference was observed at t 6 s the lowest elevations on the front wall that occurred at t 12 s are important dimensions to compare with its submerged dimension in this study the submerged distance of the front wall was 2 5 m and the lowest elevations were 1 51 m and 1 44 m in cases a and b respectively the highest elevations on the back wall have to be taken into consideration during the chamber design to prevent the water from flowing into the turbine values of 2 35 m and 3 58 m were found in cases a and b respectively since these limits were dependent on the turbine characteristic relation the open chamber condition promoted the lowest and the highest values of the free surface elevation on the walls the lowest elevation on the front wall and the highest elevation on the back wall at t 12 s h 2 5 m and in the open air chamber condition were 2 00 m and 2 62 m in case a and 2 03 m and 4 50 m in case b respectively 3 4 energy distribution fig 21 shows the distribution of percentage of extracted energy e e reflected wave energy e r and energy losses e l with kt 50 pa s m 3 in case a at different h and t e e decreased with increase in h there was a peak of e e which was 55 at around t 7 5 s its lowest values were found at the highest h and at the lowest and the highest periods e r had behavior that expresses its proportionality with c r 2 c r plot is shown in fig 13a e l decreased with increase in t and slightly increased with increase in h the lowest value of e l around 10 occurred at t 12 s and h 1 0 m fig 22 shows the distribution of e e e r and e l in case b at different h and t with kt 50 pa s m 3 wave period strongly influenced e e whose maximum value was 65 at t 9 s and h 1 0 m the lowest value of e e was 15 at t 6 s e r had similar behavior of that in case a but it was almost indifferent in relation to the variation h at higher periods e r ranged from 10 at t 6s and h 2 5 m to 40 at t 12 s the behavior of e l was also similar to that in case a but it had less sensitivity in relation to h its variation was high from 10 to 70 percentages of energy sinks e r e e and e l at different incident wave periods with h 1 5 m and kt 50 pa s m 3 are shown in fig 23 in both cases from t 8 12 s e e in case b was higher than that in case a with the maximum at around t 9 s this fact infers an advantage of case b since it had the highest percentage of the extracted energy at the highest periods in which the incident wave has the highest energy potential however low variation in e e with the wave period in case a can be important in sea states whose wave energy is spread from short to long periods the percentage of the reflected energy e r in case a was higher than that in case b from t 7 12 s energy losses e l had low values from t 8 12 s and high ones close to t 6 s in both cases at t 12 s values of e l were similar in both cases in h 1 5 m and t from 8 to 12 s both energy losses and reflected energy found in case a were higher than the ones in case b consequently the extracted energy in case a was lower at periods below 8 s this situation was inverted and the extracted energy in case a was higher than that in case b in this study e l decreased with increase in t but e r had inverse behavior studies of interactions between waves and structures goda 2010 show that the reflected wave height increases with increase in t and it explains behavior of e r however e l is related to energy losses due to viscosity and turbulence effects and it depends on phenomena inside and outside the chamber water dynamics inside the chamber can be represented by h c wherein there was increase with increase in t fig 16a thus behavior of h c with t was inverse to that of e l which indicated that the behavior of e l was not significantly influenced by water dynamics inside the chamber however run up down which can be considered representations of dynamics outside the chamber had high values at low periods fig 10a this fact justifies the high value of e l at low periods this analysis infers that e l was predominantly influenced by energy losses outside the chamber fig 24 shows percentages of energy sinks versus the turbine characteristic relation at an incident wave t 9 s and h 1 5 m in the open chamber condition kt null e e was null and e r represented around 60 of the incident wave energy in both cases the rest was related to energy losses e l the maximum e e occurred around kt 100 pa s m 3 in both cases 60 and 68 in cases a and b respectively that corresponded to the minimum e r 18 and 15 in cases a and b respectively e l decreased with increase in kt due to the low momentum magnitude 4 conclusions analysis of the behavior and energy distribution of two onshore owc devices with different slopes of their chamber walls located at the end of a 10 m deep flume subjected to regular waves was carried out case a had vertical chamber walls and in case b front and back walls had slopes of 40 the fluent rans vof model was used and methodologies to consider a wells turbine and wave generation with active absorption were employed the methodology developed by mansard and funke 1980 was applied to calculate the reflected wave height in both cases an important dependence of the wave structure interaction behavior on the incident wave period was observed differently from the incident wave height and the turbine characteristic relation the wave reflection of case a was more intense than that in case b except at incident wave period of 6 s reflected energy reached more than 45 and 40 of the incident wave energy in cases a and b respectively at t 12 s this magnitude must be diminished to increase the efficiency of the devices mainly in case a efficiency in case b was higher than that in case a at the highest wave periods in which the wave energy source had the highest potential however the lowest variation in the efficiency in case a can be interesting in sea states whose wave energy is spread from short to long periods besides the influence of reflected wave energy on the efficiency of the devices energy losses were representative in the sink in general this energy increased when reflected energy decreased this fact is expected once the lower the reflected energy the higher the fluid dynamics around and inside the chamber and consequently the losses results of the free surface elevation inside and outside the chamber showed that these losses were predominantly influenced by the energy losses outside the chamber additionally the sloshing inside the chamber did not influence energy losses significantly due to the slope of the walls case b had higher run up down and sloshing inside the chamber than those in case a these characteristics are important to take into account in the device design to calculate the adequate dimensions of lip and chamber height to prevent air from entering the chamber and water from approximating the turbine level although reflected wave energy and energy losses are inherent to the process of wave energy extraction the methodology used in this analysis is an important tool to support designers to develop optimal geometries for onshore owc devices another aspect to take into account is the influence of different geometries on chamber construction however this topic is not within the scope of this study credit

21989,this paper presents the effect on the manoeuvring characteristics of an axisymmetric underwater vehicle due to its body slenderness ratio and aft fins the vehicle is a slender body of revolution with elliptical nose tapered tail and cylindrical middle body five vehicle lengths with slenderness ratio from 10 8 to 14 4 with two sets of aft cruciform fins with different aspect ratios are employed for this study the effect of manoeuvrability is evaluated by simulation of standard manoeuvres using 6 degrees of freedom 6dof equations of motion the variation of normal force and pitch moment at oblique flows pitch rates due to slenderness ratio and aft fin are evaluated by experimental and numerical methods it is seen that the straight line stability in horizontal plane improves with slenderness ratio and aft fins size keywords axisymmetric body slenderness ratio fins angle of incidence pitch rate hydrodynamic coefficients standard manoeuvres 1 introduction underwater vehicles are generally streamlined bodies of revolution with elliptical nose tapered tail and cylindrical middle body the nose and tail profiles are designed for optimum drag propeller inflow aft fin location etc the power sources payloads etc are generally placed in the cylindrical middle body the extent of the cylindrical middle body is decided based on the space required to accommodate the power sources payloads etc the different options of power sources and payloads available necessitate the evaluation of hydrodynamic performance with different vehicle lengths vehicle upgrades like retrofitting diesel electric submarines with air independent propulsion aip systems to improve speed and endurance usually result in increase of vehicle length autonomous underwater vehicle auv designers adopt a modular design to accommodate different payloads to meet various customer requirements resulting in different vehicle lengths the vehicle diameter is not usually increased to avoid complete change in vehicle configuration and to keep same vehicle docking handling launching systems williams et al 2006 conducted static drift angle tests on bare hull configuration of a slender body of revolution underwater vehicle with slenderness ratios γ of 8 5 9 5 10 5 11 5 and 12 5 keeping the nose and tail length constant and have concluded that the axial lateral forces and yaw moment varies approximately linear with γ azarsina et al 2007a conducted pure yaw experiments on the above hullforms and states that for same yaw rate vehicle with larger γ produced larger non dimensional sway force and yaw moment azarsina et al 2007b developed regression equations in the form of response surface models for the hydrodynamic loads from the pure yaw captive manoeuvring tests conducted on the above five models azarsina et al 2010 conducted pure sway experiments on the above hullforms and an empirical relationship of hydrodynamic derivatives y v and n v are suggested as a function of γ mackay 1999 evaluated the hydrodynamic effect of inclusion of aip system on two submarine hullforms by manoeuvring simulation based on linear stability derivatives estimated by semi empirical methods it is reported that in the horizontal plane the margin of stability is reduced for aip system placed aft of the sail and increased for aip system placed forward of the sail the radius and duration of steady turn increased in proportion to the additional hull length while the yaw overshoots in zigzag manoeuvres are unaffected in the vertical plane aip system placed aft of sail gave small reduction in margin of stability and pitch overshoots in zigzag manoeuvres are unaffected praveen et al 2017 studied the hydrodynamic effects due to slenderness ratio and aft fin size for an axisymmetric body at incidence by experimental and numerical means an empirical formulation for linear hydrodynamic coefficients z w and m w for slender underwater vehicles is presented based on the experimental results renilson 2015 it is stated that the hydrodynamic forces and moments on slender bodies of revolution at incidence are dominated by the effect of flow separation due to complex three dimensional flows around the body hence flow visualization experiments and circumferential pressure measurements were done on the body at incidence to validate the numerical prediction of cross flow separation location based on circumferential distribution of pressure and skin friction the present study is done for five vehicle lengths corresponding to slenderness ratios γ l d l is length d is diameter of the vehicle of 10 8 11 4 12 5 13 3 and 14 4 the length of cylindrical body is changed keeping the nose tail lengths constant the studies are done for bare hull bh i e naked body and for appended hull ah i e body with aft cruciform fins two sets of aft cruciform fin configurations with different aspect ratios are attempted under the present study the span of both fin configurations is confined to maximum diameter of the body the details of the models are given in table 1 and fig 1 the details of fins are given in table 2 and fig 2 the five models are denoted by a b c d and e corresponding to slenderness ratio of 10 8 11 4 12 5 13 3 and 14 4 as given in table 1 the bare hull models are denoted by a0 b0 c0 d0 and e0 while the appended hull models with fin1 are denoted by a1 b1 c1 d1 and e1 and with fin2 are denoted by a2 b2 c2 d2 and e2 the effect of γ and aft fins on the manoeuvring performance of the underwater vehicle is evaluated by simulation of standard manoeuvres using a mathematical model and a set of hydrodynamic coefficients the mathematical model proposed by feldman 1979 is considered here the most important hydrodynamic coefficients affecting the manoeuvring of marine vehicles are due to linear and angular velocities in horizontal vertical planes these coefficients along with drag are sensitive to variation in γ in the present study these coefficients are estimated by experimental and numerical means the coefficients due to linear velocities are estimated by conduct of static tests while coefficients due to angular velocities are estimated by conduct of dynamic tests the other hydrodynamic coefficients appearing in the equations of motion are determined by strip theory or empirical methods standard manoeuvres like turning circle and zigzag manoeuvre in horizontal plane and meander and overshoot manoeuvre in vertical plane are simulated for all the five models the numerical measures from each of the manoeuvres provide an indication of the effect of γ and aft fins on the manoeuvring performance of slender underwater vehicles 2 mathematical model selection of mathematical model suiting the vehicle under consideration is the primary step in the manoeuvring study of underwater vehicles the solution of mathematical model representing the equations of motion of the vehicle provides the vehicle trajectory under given initial conditions and control commands standard equations of motion for submarine proposed by gertler and hagen 1967 and later modified by feldman 1979 are widely used by the submarine hydrodynamics community however this model is suitable for submarine which is asymmetric about x y plane due to the presence of deck and sail mccarter et al 2014 presents the design elements and effects of speed rudder deflection and mass location on the diving performance of axisymmetric auv configuration since the present vehicle is axisymmetric the hydrodynamic coefficients accounting for the asymmetry are dropped from feldman s model to obtain a simplified model suitable for axisymmetric bodies as given below 1 m x u u x m vr wq x g q 2 r 2 z g pr q x vr vr x wq wq x qq q 2 x rr r 2 x u u x uu u 2 x vv

mechanism vpmm to measure forces and moments due to angle of attack and pitch rate the description and operational principles of vpmm system is given by gertler 1967 goodman 1985 while theoretical background of pmm systems is given by bishop and parkinson 1970 crane et al 1989 in the vpmm system the hull model is supported by two struts arranged in tandem and attached through a gimbal and gage assembly at each strut the vpmm system enables setting of static pitch angles for conduct of static tests and enables imparting sinusoidal heaving and pitching motion for conduct of dynamic tests the general arrangement of vpmm system is given in fig 4 while the orientation of the model during static and dynamic pitch tests is given in figs 5 and 6 the models are manufactured in modular fashion consisting of nose tail middle and three intermediate sections the length variation is accomplished by inserting the intermediate sections between the other three sections model axial normal forces x

pitch moment m about centre of buoyancy lcb is estimated from normal force measurements during the tests the model is submerged to a depth of 2 1 m 4d to minimize the free surface effect the tests are conducted at a forward speed of 3 m s the reynold s number re based on length varied from 2 2 107 to 2 9 107 for the five models and re based on diameter is 1 9 106 the angle of attack test is used to

are conducted at incidence angles of 18 with an interval 2 during dynamic pitch tests the forward and aft struts of vpmm are set to oscillation amplitude a 0 025 m by means of a pulley motor drive system tests are conducted for three frequencies of oscillation f 0 21 hz 0 28 hz and 0 35 hz for obtaining pure pitch motion the forward and aft strut motions are set at a phase difference φs given by tan φs 2 ωx u where ω is the circular frequency of oscillation ω 2πf x is ½ strut spacing and u is forward speed the force gage signals are passed through a low pass filter with cut off frequency 0 05 hz during static tests and 1500 hz filter is kept open during the dynamic tests the sampling frequency of data acquisition is 10 hz for static tests and 100 hz for dynamic tests the forces during the static tests are obtained by averaging the gage signals over the measurement period of about 10s the forces during dynamic tests are obtained by fitting a first order fourier curve to the gage signals over the measurement period corresponding to six cycles of oscillation this enables the separation of force signals into components in phase and out of phase with the strut displacements in the case of dynamic tests it can be shown that the in phase components are in phase with the body accelerations whereas the quadrature components are in phase with the body velocities crane et al 1989 goodman 1985 the hydrodynamic coefficients due to angle of attack and pitch rate are obtained by fitting suitable curves to the relevant experimental data and are given in table 4 for the bare hull

10 for dynamic motion simulations of the model the domain is split into an inner and outer zone the outer zone remains fixed in space while the inner domain containing the model moves to create motions induced by vpmm here the mesh in the inner domain remains fixed relative to the motion of the model this method enables use of structured meshes for dynamic simulations malik and guang 2013 the first cell height of inner domain is placed 0 5 mm from the surface such that the wall y is kept in the range 20 the first cell height of outer domain is placed 500 mm from the outer surface of inner domain such that during the translatory and rotary motion of the inner domain the meshes do not collapse and no negative volumes are created typical mesh used for the dynamic simulations is shown in fig 11 the inlet outlet and far boundaries are kept at a distance of one four and one length from the hull respectively for the inner domain the forward aft and far boundaries are placed three six and twelve diameters away from the hull respectively the boundary conditions applied are velocity inlet at inlet and far boundaries outflow at outlet and stationary wall on the hull velocity components are specified at inlet and far boundaries to get the required incidence with inflow turbulence of 2 the simulations are carried out using k ω turbulence model the pitch oscillation motion is implemented by compiling a user defined function udf written in c programming language the dynamic mesh udf is implemented using the define cg motion macro for pure pitch motion the inner domain containing the model translates vertically as well as rotates about the model lcb the specified normal velocity is w aωcos ωt and pitch rate is q θ0ωcos ωt where a is the motion amplitude a 0 025 m θ0 is the pitch motion amplitude θ0 0 58 0 74 and 0 87 corresponding to the frequencies of oscillation of 0 21 hz 0 28 hz and 0 35 hz the rans simulations are done using double precision segregated pressure based solver quick scheme is adopted for discretization of momentum and turbulence quantities and simple algorithm is used for pressure velocity coupling for static simulations convergence criteria are kept at 10 5 however the force and moment data stabilized by 3000 iterations and further iterations up to 6000 had only 0 5 effect hence simulations are done for 3000 iterations for the dynamic simulations a time step of 0 03s is used with 25 iterations per time step the dynamic simulations are done for two cycles of oscillation instabilities in force and moment predictions are noticed during the initial stages of the transient simulations however the values stabilized after ½ oscillations 4 simulation of standard manoeuvres the manoeuvring characteristics of submerged bodies are studied by performing simulation of standard manoeuvres using equations of motion of the vehicle for conduct of trajectory simulation the 6dof equations of motion are written in terms the six accelerations u v w p q r and are solved by numerical integration to obtain the velocities u v w p q r and displacements φ θ ψ x y z for given initial conditions and control commands the numerical integration of the equations of motion are carried out using a code developed in matlab matlab in built function ode 45 which uses a 5th order runge kutta scheme dormand price method is used for the numerical integration the parameters obtained from the standard manoeuvres provide information on the inherent dynamic stability course keeping ability course changing ability yaw checking ability turning ability etc the standard manoeuvres simulated for the five vehicles include turning circle and zigzag manoeuvres in horizontal plane and meander and overshoot manoeuvres in vertical plane all the standard manoeuvres are initiated on the vehicle moving at a steady forward speed i e u u0 0 v w p q r 0 with δp δy δr at their neutral settings the control surface rates δ y and δ p is taken as 5 s the propeller rps n for obtaining a speed of 3 m s for straight ahead motion is estimated for the vehicles a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 and e 1 as 6 273 6 331 6 401 6 446 and 6 541 and for vehicles a 2 b 2 c 2 d 2 and e 2 as 6 281 6 342 6 417 6 466 and 6 573 based on the resistance and propulsion characteristics the propeller rps is kept constant during the duration of each manoeuvre for simulation the following values are taken w b ρg ρ 1025 kg m3 g 9 81 m s2 xb zb xg 0 zg 0 025 m ix m 0 4d 2 iy iz m 0 25 l 2 dp 0 77d the following assumptions are made a the vehicle is a rigid body b unbounded fluid without the effects of free surface sea bottom c compressibility effects during depth change are negligible 5 discussion on results the significant geometric parameters influencing the normal force and pitch moment acting on axisymmetric slender bodies at incidence are slenderness ratio and prismatic coefficient cp mackay 2006 for the present vehicle configurations the variation of cp is marginal as given in table 1 and the entire variation of force and moment is attributed to slenderness ratio the normal force and pitch moment at incidence are higher for longer bodies as shown in fig 12 and fig 13 the normal force and pitch moment at α 16 are increased by 43 and 32 respectively for the longest model e0 compared to the shortest model a0 the variation of normal force and pitch moment with slenderness ratio at α 18 is presented in fig 14 it is seen that for a particular incidence force and moment vary linearly with slenderness ratio as reported by williams et al 2006 the normal force and pitch moment coefficients due to pitch rate obtained from the experimental study z uq and m uq for the bare hull and appended hull configurations of the five models are presented in fig 15 it is seen that both force and moment coefficients vary linearly with slenderness ratio as observed by azarsina et al 2007a the normal force is decreased by 17 and pitch moment increased by 281 at q 0 0333 rad s f 0 35 hz for model e0 compared to model a0 the aft fins provide stability to the vehicle by increasing the normal force and reducing the destabilizing pitch moment at incidence by positioning the fins at the aft portion of the vehicle the centre of pressure due to incidence is moved close to the vehicle cg which is usually near to mid length for underwater bodies it is seen that the appended hull configurations at incidence experience higher normal force and lower destabilizing pitch moment as shown in fig 16 the normal force is increased by 29 while pitch moment is decreased by 48 at α 16 for model e1 compared to model e0 the aft fins provide stability by increasing the normal force and increasing the stabilizing pitch moment at pitch rate by positioning the fins at the aft portion of the vehicle the centre of pressure due to pitch rate is moved aft of the vehicle cg it is seen that the appended hull configurations undergoing pitch rate experience higher normal force and higher stabilizing pitch moment as shown in fig 17 the bare hull configurations have a positive normal force for a positive pitch rate giving a cp location forward of the lcb indicating instability while the appended hull configurations have a negative normal force for a positive pitch rate giving a cp location aft of the lcb indicating stability the normal force is increased by 388 while pitch moment is increased by 209 at q 0 0333 rad s for model e1 compared to model e0 the numerical predictions of normal force and pitch moment due to angle of attack match reasonably well with the experiments difference 8 22 for normal force and 1 12 for pitch moment for bh difference 4 14 for normal force and 1 9 for pitch moment for ah 1 the numerical predictions of pitch moment due to pitch rate match reasonably well with the experiments difference 4 10 for 0 21 hz 7 33 for 0 28 hz and 2 11 for 0 35 hz however the normal force variations during pitch oscillations from experimental and numerical studies are out of phase giving rise to differences in normal force while resolving numerical simulations enable determination of static pressure and skin friction distribution along the hull in longitudinal and circumferential directions experiments are conducted on model a0 to measure the static pressure along the circumference 0 180 at 15 interval where 0 and 180 corresponds to windward and leeward sides respectively at x l 0 84 for α 18 and u 3 m s the pressure is measured by means of 13 static pressure tubes which are arranged flush with the hull the pressure tubes are connected to one end of differential pressure transducers dpt placed in the towing tank by means of flexible tubes the other end of the dpt is left open to the atmosphere the comparative results of the pressure measurements from experimental and numerical study along the circumferential direction are presented in fig 18 it can be seen from the plot that the computed pressures are comparable with measured pressures flow separation occurs due to adverse pressure gradients and the separated region can be identified by the plateau in the pressure plot φs 100 160 in fig 18 where φs is the circumferential angle the pressure distribution along the circumferential direction is dependent on the flow separation on the leeward side of the hull the flow separation occurs at the location of minimum skin friction at the leeward side of the hull and attachment occurs at the location of maximum skin friction jeans et al 2009 paint smear tests are conducted on model a0 to estimate the circumferential location of separation attachment and re separation at α 18 and u 3 m s the flow visualization is made possible by means of application of a mixture of linseed oil carbon black and fine sand on the model surface the mixture is applied at different longitudinal stations from φs 0 180 on port side of the model which produced streak lines on the model as per the local flow conditions the separation attachment and re separation lines along the length of the model are drawn by hand and the respective circumferential angles are measured at different longitudinal stations as shown in fig 19 the separation line on the leeward side is indicated by the confluence of the skin friction lines and attachment is indicated by divergence of skin friction lines hess et al 2010 the circumferential location of separation and re separation determined from numerical study is compared with the experiments results in fig 20 it can be seen from the plot that the computed locations of separation and re separation are comparable with measured locations it is seen that the separation happens at a lower circumferential angle as one moves towards tail φs 154 at x l 0 14 and φs 86 at x l 0 94 in fig 20 results of the turning circle zigzag meander and overshoot manoeuvres are presented in figs 21 24 the variation of the key manoeuvring parameters with γ for turning circle zigzag meander and overshoot manoeuvres are presented in figs 25 28 it should be noted that zigzag manoeuvres could not be completed satisfactorily for ah 1 indicating that the fin size of ah 1 is inadequate to provide satisfactory manoeuvring capabilities in the horizontal plane linear stability analysis indicates that ah 1 configurations have a negative stability index and hence the following discussion is mainly based on the results with ah 2 configurations the advance transfer tactical diameter and steady turning diameter during turning circle manoeuvre are higher for longer bodies the turn rate and drift angle during steady turn are lower while the time to change heading is higher for longer bodies these indicate that turning ability decreases with length as longer bodies are slow to turn i e longer bodies are more stable than the shorter bodies the first and second overshoot angles during zigzag manoeuvre are lower for the longer bodies the time to second and third execute is higher and time to check yaw and overshoot path width is lower for longer bodies these indicate that the course keeping and yaw checking abilities improve with length while course changing ability deteriorate with length i e longer bodies are more stable than shorter bodies the overshoot in depth and pitch during meander and overshoot manoeuvre are practically constant and the time measures time to execute time to check pitch and time to check depth are higher for longer bodies these indicate that the depth keeping ability improves with length while pitch changing and pitch checking abilities deteriorate with length i e longer bodies are more stable than shorter bodies it should be noted that all the simulations are done with a metacentric height bg zg of 25 mm the hydrostatic moment in pitch mθ w bg sinθ appearing in equation 5 is dominant at lower speeds used for the simulations and provides the inherent dynamic stability in pitch the advance transfer tactical diameter and steady turning diameter are higher for ah 2 than ah 1 the turn rate drift angle and time to change heading during steady turn are higher for ah 2 than ah 1 these indicate that turning ability decreases with fin size as bodies with larger aft fins are slow to turn the first and second overshoot angles during zigzag manoeuvre are lower for ah 2 than ah 1 the time to execute is higher and time to check yaw and overshoot path width are lower for ah 2 than ah 1 these indicate that the course keeping and yaw checking abilities improve and course changing ability deteriorates with aft fin size the overshoot in depth and pitch during meander and overshoot manoeuvre are lower for ah 2 than ah 1 the time measures time to execute time to check pitch and time to check depth are slightly lower for ah 2 than ah 1 these indicate that the depth keeping and pitch checking abilities improve and depth changing ability deteriorates with aft fin size a qualitative summary of the effect of slenderness ratio and aft fin size on the stability manoeuvrability and controllability of slender underwater vehicles is given in table 5 consider the steady turning phase of turning circle manoeuvre where all accelerations are zero and the vehicle moves in a circular path at steady u v β and r in the horizontal plane the vehicle will experience centrifugal force m u r directed outwards from the centre of the circular path which needs to be balanced by hydrodynamic forces due to v and r yuv uv yvvv v3 u and yur ur directed towards the centre of the circular path the rudder force yδy δy is also directed outwards during the turning manoeuvre the destabilizing moments due to v and δy nuv uv nvvv v3 u and nδy δy needs to be balanced by stabilizing moment due to r nur ur for an initial speed u and rudder input δy the forces and moments needs to dynamically balance to attain steady u v β and r the forward speed u gets reduced slightly due to the drift angle β and turn rate r it is seen from the simulation that longer bodies experience lower v and r and higher u for a given δy than shorter vehicles longer bodies experience lower centrifugal force due to lower value of r even though m and u are higher than shorter bodies for a given δy command it is seen that the rudder force is slightly higher for longer bodies due to higher u even though the rudders are same either fin1 or fin2 for different vehicle lengths the moments due to v r and δy are higher for longer vehicles for a given rudder command the rudder moment is higher for longer vehicles due to the larger distance of rudder from the vehicle cg it should be noted that the longer vehicles have higher inertia due to its higher mass and will turn less for a given δy compared to shorter vehicle this can be seen from the nomoto parameters k and t where k is the system gain and t is the time constant it is seen from the simulation results that k decreases with length and t increases with length as given in figs 29 and 30 the critical geometric parameters studied here are the bare body parameters i e γ cp etc and the aft fin parameters i e aspect ratio area etc if the body slenderness ratio is increased and fin configuration is unchanged the resultant vehicle will have more sluggish dynamic behaviour increase in length also results in increased power requirement consider a case where the initial configuration is a2 and there exist a requirement to increase the length from a to e it is seen from the simulations that the turning performance of e2 is inferior to a2 however the steady state parameters from turning circle simulation for e1 matches well with a2 however the transient behaviour from zigzag meander and overshoot manoeuvres is inferior for e1 than a2 as e1 is less stable than a2 the transient behaviour can be improved by increasing the rudder flap area in the present study both the fin configurations have a 40 flap chord length and hence the flap area of fin1 is less than fin2 the turning performance of a2 e2 and e1 with 40 50 and 60 flap chord length is given in figs 31 and 32 it is clear from the figures that when the vehicle length is increased the fin size needs to be reduced for maintaining the turning performance 6 conclusions it is observed from the present study that the normal force and pitch moment due to angle of attack and pitch rate vary linearly with slenderness ratio it is seen from the simulation studies that straight line stability in the horizontal plane increases with vehicle length in the vertical plane metacentric height ensures directional stability at slow speeds the simulation studies indicate that increasing the vehicle length or increasing the aft fin size makes the vehicle response more sluggish longer vehicle have better course keeping and yaw checking abilities and lesser turning and course changing abilities compared to shorter vehicle larger aft fin size results in better course keeping and yaw checking abilities and lesser tuning ability it is also seen from simulations that if the vehicle length is increased the fin size needs to be reduced to maintain the turning performance it is clear that fin and flap areas are very crucial for stability manoeuvrability and controllability of underwater vehicles declaration of competing interest it is also certified that there is no potential conflict in publishing the above paper 
21989,this paper presents the effect on the manoeuvring characteristics of an axisymmetric underwater vehicle due to its body slenderness ratio and aft fins the vehicle is a slender body of revolution with elliptical nose tapered tail and cylindrical middle body five vehicle lengths with slenderness ratio from 10 8 to 14 4 with two sets of aft cruciform fins with different aspect ratios are employed for this study the effect of manoeuvrability is evaluated by simulation of standard manoeuvres using 6 degrees of freedom 6dof equations of motion the variation of normal force and pitch moment at oblique flows pitch rates due to slenderness ratio and aft fin are evaluated by experimental and numerical methods it is seen that the straight line stability in horizontal plane improves with slenderness ratio and aft fins size keywords axisymmetric body slenderness ratio fins angle of incidence pitch rate hydrodynamic coefficients standard manoeuvres 1 introduction underwater vehicles are generally streamlined bodies of revolution with elliptical nose tapered tail and cylindrical middle body the nose and tail profiles are designed for optimum drag propeller inflow aft fin location etc the power sources payloads etc are generally placed in the cylindrical middle body the extent of the cylindrical middle body is decided based on the space required to accommodate the power sources payloads etc the different options of power sources and payloads available necessitate the evaluation of hydrodynamic performance with different vehicle lengths vehicle upgrades like retrofitting diesel electric submarines with air independent propulsion aip systems to improve speed and endurance usually result in increase of vehicle length autonomous underwater vehicle auv designers adopt a modular design to accommodate different payloads to meet various customer requirements resulting in different vehicle lengths the vehicle diameter is not usually increased to avoid complete change in vehicle configuration and to keep same vehicle docking handling launching systems williams et al 2006 conducted static drift angle tests on bare hull configuration of a slender body of revolution underwater vehicle with slenderness ratios γ of 8 5 9 5 10 5 11 5 and 12 5 keeping the nose and tail length constant and have concluded that the axial lateral forces and yaw moment varies approximately linear with γ azarsina et al 2007a conducted pure yaw experiments on the above hullforms and states that for same yaw rate vehicle with larger γ produced larger non dimensional sway force and yaw moment azarsina et al 2007b developed regression equations in the form of response surface models for the hydrodynamic loads from the pure yaw captive manoeuvring tests conducted on the above five models azarsina et al 2010 conducted pure sway experiments on the above hullforms and an empirical relationship of hydrodynamic derivatives y v and n v are suggested as a function of γ mackay 1999 evaluated the hydrodynamic effect of inclusion of aip system on two submarine hullforms by manoeuvring simulation based on linear stability derivatives estimated by semi empirical methods it is reported that in the horizontal plane the margin of stability is reduced for aip system placed aft of the sail and increased for aip system placed forward of the sail the radius and duration of steady turn increased in proportion to the additional hull length while the yaw overshoots in zigzag manoeuvres are unaffected in the vertical plane aip system placed aft of sail gave small reduction in margin of stability and pitch overshoots in zigzag manoeuvres are unaffected praveen et al 2017 studied the hydrodynamic effects due to slenderness ratio and aft fin size for an axisymmetric body at incidence by experimental and numerical means an empirical formulation for linear hydrodynamic coefficients z w and m w for slender underwater vehicles is presented based on the experimental results renilson 2015 it is stated that the hydrodynamic forces and moments on slender bodies of revolution at incidence are dominated by the effect of flow separation due to complex three dimensional flows around the body hence flow visualization experiments and circumferential pressure measurements were done on the body at incidence to validate the numerical prediction of cross flow separation location based on circumferential distribution of pressure and skin friction the present study is done for five vehicle lengths corresponding to slenderness ratios γ l d l is length d is diameter of the vehicle of 10 8 11 4 12 5 13 3 and 14 4 the length of cylindrical body is changed keeping the nose tail lengths constant the studies are done for bare hull bh i e naked body and for appended hull ah i e body with aft cruciform fins two sets of aft cruciform fin configurations with different aspect ratios are attempted under the present study the span of both fin configurations is confined to maximum diameter of the body the details of the models are given in table 1 and fig 1 the details of fins are given in table 2 and fig 2 the five models are denoted by a b c d and e corresponding to slenderness ratio of 10 8 11 4 12 5 13 3 and 14 4 as given in table 1 the bare hull models are denoted by a0 b0 c0 d0 and e0 while the appended hull models with fin1 are denoted by a1 b1 c1 d1 and e1 and with fin2 are denoted by a2 b2 c2 d2 and e2 the effect of γ and aft fins on the manoeuvring performance of the underwater vehicle is evaluated by simulation of standard manoeuvres using a mathematical model and a set of hydrodynamic coefficients the mathematical model proposed by feldman 1979 is considered here the most important hydrodynamic coefficients affecting the manoeuvring of marine vehicles are due to linear and angular velocities in horizontal vertical planes these coefficients along with drag are sensitive to variation in γ in the present study these coefficients are estimated by experimental and numerical means the coefficients due to linear velocities are estimated by conduct of static tests while coefficients due to angular velocities are estimated by conduct of dynamic tests the other hydrodynamic coefficients appearing in the equations of motion are determined by strip theory or empirical methods standard manoeuvres like turning circle and zigzag manoeuvre in horizontal plane and meander and overshoot manoeuvre in vertical plane are simulated for all the five models the numerical measures from each of the manoeuvres provide an indication of the effect of γ and aft fins on the manoeuvring performance of slender underwater vehicles 2 mathematical model selection of mathematical model suiting the vehicle under consideration is the primary step in the manoeuvring study of underwater vehicles the solution of mathematical model representing the equations of motion of the vehicle provides the vehicle trajectory under given initial conditions and control commands standard equations of motion for submarine proposed by gertler and hagen 1967 and later modified by feldman 1979 are widely used by the submarine hydrodynamics community however this model is suitable for submarine which is asymmetric about x y plane due to the presence of deck and sail mccarter et al 2014 presents the design elements and effects of speed rudder deflection and mass location on the diving performance of axisymmetric auv configuration since the present vehicle is axisymmetric the hydrodynamic coefficients accounting for the asymmetry are dropped from feldman s model to obtain a simplified model suitable for axisymmetric bodies as given below 1 m x u u x m vr wq x g q 2 r 2 z g pr q x vr vr x wq wq x qq q 2 x rr r 2 x u u x uu u 2 x vv

mechanism vpmm to measure forces and moments due to angle of attack and pitch rate the description and operational principles of vpmm system is given by gertler 1967 goodman 1985 while theoretical background of pmm systems is given by bishop and parkinson 1970 crane et al 1989 in the vpmm system the hull model is supported by two struts arranged in tandem and attached through a gimbal and gage assembly at each strut the vpmm system enables setting of static pitch angles for conduct of static tests and enables imparting sinusoidal heaving and pitching motion for conduct of dynamic tests the general arrangement of vpmm system is given in fig 4 while the orientation of the model during static and dynamic pitch tests is given in figs 5 and 6 the models are manufactured in modular fashion consisting of nose tail middle and three intermediate sections the length variation is accomplished by inserting the intermediate sections between the other three sections model axial normal forces x

pitch moment m about centre of buoyancy lcb is estimated from normal force measurements during the tests the model is submerged to a depth of 2 1 m 4d to minimize the free surface effect the tests are conducted at a forward speed of 3 m s the reynold s number re based on length varied from 2 2 107 to 2 9 107 for the five models and re based on diameter is 1 9 106 the angle of attack test is used to

are conducted at incidence angles of 18 with an interval 2 during dynamic pitch tests the forward and aft struts of vpmm are set to oscillation amplitude a 0 025 m by means of a pulley motor drive system tests are conducted for three frequencies of oscillation f 0 21 hz 0 28 hz and 0 35 hz for obtaining pure pitch motion the forward and aft strut motions are set at a phase difference φs given by tan φs 2 ωx u where ω is the circular frequency of oscillation ω 2πf x is ½ strut spacing and u is forward speed the force gage signals are passed through a low pass filter with cut off frequency 0 05 hz during static tests and 1500 hz filter is kept open during the dynamic tests the sampling frequency of data acquisition is 10 hz for static tests and 100 hz for dynamic tests the forces during the static tests are obtained by averaging the gage signals over the measurement period of about 10s the forces during dynamic tests are obtained by fitting a first order fourier curve to the gage signals over the measurement period corresponding to six cycles of oscillation this enables the separation of force signals into components in phase and out of phase with the strut displacements in the case of dynamic tests it can be shown that the in phase components are in phase with the body accelerations whereas the quadrature components are in phase with the body velocities crane et al 1989 goodman 1985 the hydrodynamic coefficients due to angle of attack and pitch rate are obtained by fitting suitable curves to the relevant experimental data and are given in table 4 for the bare hull

10 for dynamic motion simulations of the model the domain is split into an inner and outer zone the outer zone remains fixed in space while the inner domain containing the model moves to create motions induced by vpmm here the mesh in the inner domain remains fixed relative to the motion of the model this method enables use of structured meshes for dynamic simulations malik and guang 2013 the first cell height of inner domain is placed 0 5 mm from the surface such that the wall y is kept in the range 20 the first cell height of outer domain is placed 500 mm from the outer surface of inner domain such that during the translatory and rotary motion of the inner domain the meshes do not collapse and no negative volumes are created typical mesh used for the dynamic simulations is shown in fig 11 the inlet outlet and far boundaries are kept at a distance of one four and one length from the hull respectively for the inner domain the forward aft and far boundaries are placed three six and twelve diameters away from the hull respectively the boundary conditions applied are velocity inlet at inlet and far boundaries outflow at outlet and stationary wall on the hull velocity components are specified at inlet and far boundaries to get the required incidence with inflow turbulence of 2 the simulations are carried out using k ω turbulence model the pitch oscillation motion is implemented by compiling a user defined function udf written in c programming language the dynamic mesh udf is implemented using the define cg motion macro for pure pitch motion the inner domain containing the model translates vertically as well as rotates about the model lcb the specified normal velocity is w aωcos ωt and pitch rate is q θ0ωcos ωt where a is the motion amplitude a 0 025 m θ0 is the pitch motion amplitude θ0 0 58 0 74 and 0 87 corresponding to the frequencies of oscillation of 0 21 hz 0 28 hz and 0 35 hz the rans simulations are done using double precision segregated pressure based solver quick scheme is adopted for discretization of momentum and turbulence quantities and simple algorithm is used for pressure velocity coupling for static simulations convergence criteria are kept at 10 5 however the force and moment data stabilized by 3000 iterations and further iterations up to 6000 had only 0 5 effect hence simulations are done for 3000 iterations for the dynamic simulations a time step of 0 03s is used with 25 iterations per time step the dynamic simulations are done for two cycles of oscillation instabilities in force and moment predictions are noticed during the initial stages of the transient simulations however the values stabilized after ½ oscillations 4 simulation of standard manoeuvres the manoeuvring characteristics of submerged bodies are studied by performing simulation of standard manoeuvres using equations of motion of the vehicle for conduct of trajectory simulation the 6dof equations of motion are written in terms the six accelerations u v w p q r and are solved by numerical integration to obtain the velocities u v w p q r and displacements φ θ ψ x y z for given initial conditions and control commands the numerical integration of the equations of motion are carried out using a code developed in matlab matlab in built function ode 45 which uses a 5th order runge kutta scheme dormand price method is used for the numerical integration the parameters obtained from the standard manoeuvres provide information on the inherent dynamic stability course keeping ability course changing ability yaw checking ability turning ability etc the standard manoeuvres simulated for the five vehicles include turning circle and zigzag manoeuvres in horizontal plane and meander and overshoot manoeuvres in vertical plane all the standard manoeuvres are initiated on the vehicle moving at a steady forward speed i e u u0 0 v w p q r 0 with δp δy δr at their neutral settings the control surface rates δ y and δ p is taken as 5 s the propeller rps n for obtaining a speed of 3 m s for straight ahead motion is estimated for the vehicles a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 and e 1 as 6 273 6 331 6 401 6 446 and 6 541 and for vehicles a 2 b 2 c 2 d 2 and e 2 as 6 281 6 342 6 417 6 466 and 6 573 based on the resistance and propulsion characteristics the propeller rps is kept constant during the duration of each manoeuvre for simulation the following values are taken w b ρg ρ 1025 kg m3 g 9 81 m s2 xb zb xg 0 zg 0 025 m ix m 0 4d 2 iy iz m 0 25 l 2 dp 0 77d the following assumptions are made a the vehicle is a rigid body b unbounded fluid without the effects of free surface sea bottom c compressibility effects during depth change are negligible 5 discussion on results the significant geometric parameters influencing the normal force and pitch moment acting on axisymmetric slender bodies at incidence are slenderness ratio and prismatic coefficient cp mackay 2006 for the present vehicle configurations the variation of cp is marginal as given in table 1 and the entire variation of force and moment is attributed to slenderness ratio the normal force and pitch moment at incidence are higher for longer bodies as shown in fig 12 and fig 13 the normal force and pitch moment at α 16 are increased by 43 and 32 respectively for the longest model e0 compared to the shortest model a0 the variation of normal force and pitch moment with slenderness ratio at α 18 is presented in fig 14 it is seen that for a particular incidence force and moment vary linearly with slenderness ratio as reported by williams et al 2006 the normal force and pitch moment coefficients due to pitch rate obtained from the experimental study z uq and m uq for the bare hull and appended hull configurations of the five models are presented in fig 15 it is seen that both force and moment coefficients vary linearly with slenderness ratio as observed by azarsina et al 2007a the normal force is decreased by 17 and pitch moment increased by 281 at q 0 0333 rad s f 0 35 hz for model e0 compared to model a0 the aft fins provide stability to the vehicle by increasing the normal force and reducing the destabilizing pitch moment at incidence by positioning the fins at the aft portion of the vehicle the centre of pressure due to incidence is moved close to the vehicle cg which is usually near to mid length for underwater bodies it is seen that the appended hull configurations at incidence experience higher normal force and lower destabilizing pitch moment as shown in fig 16 the normal force is increased by 29 while pitch moment is decreased by 48 at α 16 for model e1 compared to model e0 the aft fins provide stability by increasing the normal force and increasing the stabilizing pitch moment at pitch rate by positioning the fins at the aft portion of the vehicle the centre of pressure due to pitch rate is moved aft of the vehicle cg it is seen that the appended hull configurations undergoing pitch rate experience higher normal force and higher stabilizing pitch moment as shown in fig 17 the bare hull configurations have a positive normal force for a positive pitch rate giving a cp location forward of the lcb indicating instability while the appended hull configurations have a negative normal force for a positive pitch rate giving a cp location aft of the lcb indicating stability the normal force is increased by 388 while pitch moment is increased by 209 at q 0 0333 rad s for model e1 compared to model e0 the numerical predictions of normal force and pitch moment due to angle of attack match reasonably well with the experiments difference 8 22 for normal force and 1 12 for pitch moment for bh difference 4 14 for normal force and 1 9 for pitch moment for ah 1 the numerical predictions of pitch moment due to pitch rate match reasonably well with the experiments difference 4 10 for 0 21 hz 7 33 for 0 28 hz and 2 11 for 0 35 hz however the normal force variations during pitch oscillations from experimental and numerical studies are out of phase giving rise to differences in normal force while resolving numerical simulations enable determination of static pressure and skin friction distribution along the hull in longitudinal and circumferential directions experiments are conducted on model a0 to measure the static pressure along the circumference 0 180 at 15 interval where 0 and 180 corresponds to windward and leeward sides respectively at x l 0 84 for α 18 and u 3 m s the pressure is measured by means of 13 static pressure tubes which are arranged flush with the hull the pressure tubes are connected to one end of differential pressure transducers dpt placed in the towing tank by means of flexible tubes the other end of the dpt is left open to the atmosphere the comparative results of the pressure measurements from experimental and numerical study along the circumferential direction are presented in fig 18 it can be seen from the plot that the computed pressures are comparable with measured pressures flow separation occurs due to adverse pressure gradients and the separated region can be identified by the plateau in the pressure plot φs 100 160 in fig 18 where φs is the circumferential angle the pressure distribution along the circumferential direction is dependent on the flow separation on the leeward side of the hull the flow separation occurs at the location of minimum skin friction at the leeward side of the hull and attachment occurs at the location of maximum skin friction jeans et al 2009 paint smear tests are conducted on model a0 to estimate the circumferential location of separation attachment and re separation at α 18 and u 3 m s the flow visualization is made possible by means of application of a mixture of linseed oil carbon black and fine sand on the model surface the mixture is applied at different longitudinal stations from φs 0 180 on port side of the model which produced streak lines on the model as per the local flow conditions the separation attachment and re separation lines along the length of the model are drawn by hand and the respective circumferential angles are measured at different longitudinal stations as shown in fig 19 the separation line on the leeward side is indicated by the confluence of the skin friction lines and attachment is indicated by divergence of skin friction lines hess et al 2010 the circumferential location of separation and re separation determined from numerical study is compared with the experiments results in fig 20 it can be seen from the plot that the computed locations of separation and re separation are comparable with measured locations it is seen that the separation happens at a lower circumferential angle as one moves towards tail φs 154 at x l 0 14 and φs 86 at x l 0 94 in fig 20 results of the turning circle zigzag meander and overshoot manoeuvres are presented in figs 21 24 the variation of the key manoeuvring parameters with γ for turning circle zigzag meander and overshoot manoeuvres are presented in figs 25 28 it should be noted that zigzag manoeuvres could not be completed satisfactorily for ah 1 indicating that the fin size of ah 1 is inadequate to provide satisfactory manoeuvring capabilities in the horizontal plane linear stability analysis indicates that ah 1 configurations have a negative stability index and hence the following discussion is mainly based on the results with ah 2 configurations the advance transfer tactical diameter and steady turning diameter during turning circle manoeuvre are higher for longer bodies the turn rate and drift angle during steady turn are lower while the time to change heading is higher for longer bodies these indicate that turning ability decreases with length as longer bodies are slow to turn i e longer bodies are more stable than the shorter bodies the first and second overshoot angles during zigzag manoeuvre are lower for the longer bodies the time to second and third execute is higher and time to check yaw and overshoot path width is lower for longer bodies these indicate that the course keeping and yaw checking abilities improve with length while course changing ability deteriorate with length i e longer bodies are more stable than shorter bodies the overshoot in depth and pitch during meander and overshoot manoeuvre are practically constant and the time measures time to execute time to check pitch and time to check depth are higher for longer bodies these indicate that the depth keeping ability improves with length while pitch changing and pitch checking abilities deteriorate with length i e longer bodies are more stable than shorter bodies it should be noted that all the simulations are done with a metacentric height bg zg of 25 mm the hydrostatic moment in pitch mθ w bg sinθ appearing in equation 5 is dominant at lower speeds used for the simulations and provides the inherent dynamic stability in pitch the advance transfer tactical diameter and steady turning diameter are higher for ah 2 than ah 1 the turn rate drift angle and time to change heading during steady turn are higher for ah 2 than ah 1 these indicate that turning ability decreases with fin size as bodies with larger aft fins are slow to turn the first and second overshoot angles during zigzag manoeuvre are lower for ah 2 than ah 1 the time to execute is higher and time to check yaw and overshoot path width are lower for ah 2 than ah 1 these indicate that the course keeping and yaw checking abilities improve and course changing ability deteriorates with aft fin size the overshoot in depth and pitch during meander and overshoot manoeuvre are lower for ah 2 than ah 1 the time measures time to execute time to check pitch and time to check depth are slightly lower for ah 2 than ah 1 these indicate that the depth keeping and pitch checking abilities improve and depth changing ability deteriorates with aft fin size a qualitative summary of the effect of slenderness ratio and aft fin size on the stability manoeuvrability and controllability of slender underwater vehicles is given in table 5 consider the steady turning phase of turning circle manoeuvre where all accelerations are zero and the vehicle moves in a circular path at steady u v β and r in the horizontal plane the vehicle will experience centrifugal force m u r directed outwards from the centre of the circular path which needs to be balanced by hydrodynamic forces due to v and r yuv uv yvvv v3 u and yur ur directed towards the centre of the circular path the rudder force yδy δy is also directed outwards during the turning manoeuvre the destabilizing moments due to v and δy nuv uv nvvv v3 u and nδy δy needs to be balanced by stabilizing moment due to r nur ur for an initial speed u and rudder input δy the forces and moments needs to dynamically balance to attain steady u v β and r the forward speed u gets reduced slightly due to the drift angle β and turn rate r it is seen from the simulation that longer bodies experience lower v and r and higher u for a given δy than shorter vehicles longer bodies experience lower centrifugal force due to lower value of r even though m and u are higher than shorter bodies for a given δy command it is seen that the rudder force is slightly higher for longer bodies due to higher u even though the rudders are same either fin1 or fin2 for different vehicle lengths the moments due to v r and δy are higher for longer vehicles for a given rudder command the rudder moment is higher for longer vehicles due to the larger distance of rudder from the vehicle cg it should be noted that the longer vehicles have higher inertia due to its higher mass and will turn less for a given δy compared to shorter vehicle this can be seen from the nomoto parameters k and t where k is the system gain and t is the time constant it is seen from the simulation results that k decreases with length and t increases with length as given in figs 29 and 30 the critical geometric parameters studied here are the bare body parameters i e γ cp etc and the aft fin parameters i e aspect ratio area etc if the body slenderness ratio is increased and fin configuration is unchanged the resultant vehicle will have more sluggish dynamic behaviour increase in length also results in increased power requirement consider a case where the initial configuration is a2 and there exist a requirement to increase the length from a to e it is seen from the simulations that the turning performance of e2 is inferior to a2 however the steady state parameters from turning circle simulation for e1 matches well with a2 however the transient behaviour from zigzag meander and overshoot manoeuvres is inferior for e1 than a2 as e1 is less stable than a2 the transient behaviour can be improved by increasing the rudder flap area in the present study both the fin configurations have a 40 flap chord length and hence the flap area of fin1 is less than fin2 the turning performance of a2 e2 and e1 with 40 50 and 60 flap chord length is given in figs 31 and 32 it is clear from the figures that when the vehicle length is increased the fin size needs to be reduced for maintaining the turning performance 6 conclusions it is observed from the present study that the normal force and pitch moment due to angle of attack and pitch rate vary linearly with slenderness ratio it is seen from the simulation studies that straight line stability in the horizontal plane increases with vehicle length in the vertical plane metacentric height ensures directional stability at slow speeds the simulation studies indicate that increasing the vehicle length or increasing the aft fin size makes the vehicle response more sluggish longer vehicle have better course keeping and yaw checking abilities and lesser turning and course changing abilities compared to shorter vehicle larger aft fin size results in better course keeping and yaw checking abilities and lesser tuning ability it is also seen from simulations that if the vehicle length is increased the fin size needs to be reduced to maintain the turning performance it is clear that fin and flap areas are very crucial for stability manoeuvrability and controllability of underwater vehicles declaration of competing interest it is also certified that there is no potential conflict in publishing the
