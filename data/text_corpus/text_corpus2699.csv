13495,the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate a common contaminant in surface and ground water to the harmless nitrogen gas is a promising technology that can be potentially energy efficient and environmentally friendly the bottleneck hindering its large scale implementation is mainly attributed to the unsatisfactory selectivity toward the final product n2 to solve this challenge a two step strategy was applied here in which the no3 was first reduced to nh4 at the cathode followed with a rapid non electrochemical oxidation to n2 by the clo generated from anodic breakpoint chlorination note that the formation of clo may be easily controlled and enhanced by the dosage of cl ions the overall nitrate removal efficiency for the above process was determined by its no3 to nh4 activity the high performance copper nickel alloys embedded mesoporous carbon electrocatalysts were therefore rationally designed which exhibited a complete conversion of no3 in the absence of cl and furthermore a 100 n2 selectivity with the addition of cl using density functional theory calculations it was verified that the incorporation of ni atoms into cu interface significantly enhanced the adsorption of nhoh and nh2oh intermediates lowering the barrier of noh hydrogenation to nh3 nh4 besides the nitrogen containing ordered mesoporous carbon support not only facilitated the synthesis of uniformly

and eventually n2 gas the other route is the atomic hydrogen mediated reduction of no3 which tends to form nh4 nh3 as the end product rather than n2 29 36 it is generally accepted that the conversion of no3 ads to no2 ads is the rate determining step 37 while the adsorption energy of no2 ads no ads n2o ads and other intermediates decides the selectivity 2 based on this rationale bimetallic pd cu

gradient approximation gga using the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe formulation 56 the projected augmented wave paw potentials 57 58 were chosen to describe the ionic cores and take valence electrons into account using a plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 450 ev partial occupancies of the kohn sham orbitals were allowed using the gaussian smearing method and a width of 0 05 ev the

grimme s dft d3 methodology 59 was used to describe the dispersion interactions among all the atoms in adsorption models the vacuum spacing in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the catalyst

the stability of cu80ni20 alloy systems was screened via doping ni into cu at various layers and distributions the free energy was calculated using the equation g e zpe ts where g e zpe and ts were the free energy total energy from dft calculations zero point energy and entropic contributions t was set to be 300 k respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 compositional and structural characteristics of cuni omcn as shown in fig 1 the cuni omcn catalysts were prepared via an evaporation induced self assembly approach 52 using low molecular weight resol as the carbon source pluronic f127 as the structure directing agent dcda as the metal coordination agent and cu no3 2 and nicl2 as the metal precursors during the slow evaporation of ethanol solution cu and ni ions were well distributed into carbon matrix which facilitated the nucleation and growth of cuni alloys the subsequent carbonization in n2 atmosphere removed the surfactant templates leaving cuni nanoparticles immobilized in the mesoporous carbon framework the saxs pattern of the resulting cuni omcn fig 2 a exhibited two scattering peaks at the q values of 0 65 and 1 1 nm 1 which could be assigned to the 100 and 200 reflection respectively suggesting the successful formation of a 2d hexagonal mesoporous p6mm structure the porosity of cuni omcn was further analyzed by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig 2b a typical type iv curve with the distinct h2 hysteresis loop was observed indicating that the catalysts possessed an ink bottle like pore structure a mono distributed mesopore size of ca 4 1 nm insert in fig 2b was derived from the adsorption branch of isotherms by the barrett joyner halenda method besides the calculated brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area of 447 5 m2 g 1 t plot micropore surface area of 248 9 m2 g 1 and total pore volume of 0 374 m3 g 1 all supported the high surface area micro meso porous characteristics of cuni omcn the successful formation of cuni alloys were evidenced by the wide angle xrd pattern of cuni omcn as shown in fig 2c the diffraction peaks with the 2θ values of 43 5 and 50 8 were assigned to the 111 or 200 plane of the cu0 81ni0 19 alloy pdf 47 1406 while the others at 27 31 6 45 5 56 and 75 corresponded to the graphitic carbon pdf 46 0943 according to the debye scherrer formula the crystallite size of the cuni alloys was estimated to be ca 20 nm in addition the xrd patterns of mono metallic cu omcn or ni omcn fig s3 also showed two peaks for the 111 and 200 planes of cu or ni respectively indicating a similar crystal structure of those composites note that the peak positions of cuni were between those of cu and ni the corresponding d spacing of the former should also be between the latter two which again supported the formation of cuni alloys the local structure and morphology of cuni omcn was examined in greater detail by hrtem imaging and eds mapping it was seen in fig 3 a c that cuni nanoparticles those darker spots were well dispersed on a highly ordered cylindrical mesoporous carbon support with the majority 70 possessing a particle size of ca 20 nm in good accordance with the grain size estimated above moreover a higher resolution image fig 3d revealed the existence of two different lattice spacing 0 180 and 0 206 nm in cuni nanoparticles which perfectly matched the 200 and 111 plane identified in the xrd pattern indicating a face centered cubic fcc crystal structure of cuni alloys 60 what s more the eds elemental mapping of cuni omcn displayed a homogeneous distribution of c and n atoms throughout the whole sample fig 3e f and the complete overlap of cu and ni atoms fig 3g h further illustrating the immobilization of cuni nanoalloys on nitrogen doped carbon supports the xps survey spectrum of cuni omcn reaffirmed the presence of c n cu and ni in it fig s6 high resolution spectra were then adopted to elucidate the exact chemical state of each element with regard to the c 1s fig s7a and n1s fig s7b four peaks were identified at 284 4 284 9 286 0 and 288 9 ev in the former corresponding to the cc cc co and o c o groups respectively while the other three found in the latter at 398 4 399 5 and 400 7 ev were attributed to the pyridinic pyrrolic and graphitic nitrogen 61 62 the high content of pyridinic n 47 7 at in cuni omcn was supposed to promote the formation of cuni nanoalloys 63 thus enhancing the overall catalytic nitrate reduction activity besides zero valent cu and ni which should be assigned to the cuni alloys were found to account for approximately half of the total amount of those two elements fig s7c d the remaining half were cu2 and ni2 respectively which could be attributed to the amorphous metal nitrides taking into account of both the xrd patterns and the synthesis methods 3 2 electrocatalytic activity and mechanism for the reduction of no3 the electrocatalytic activity of cuni omcn for the reduction of no3 was critically evaluated both in the absence and presence of cl as seen in fig 4 a for an initial no3 n concentration of 30 mg l 1 a typical nitrogen content for urban domestic sewage over 50 of them was reduced within an hour by cuni omcn while the complete removal was achievable in 7 h when no cl was added and the applied voltage was 1 8 v it was further shown in fig 4b that a 100 n2 selectivity could be reached under the same condition except the addition of cl ions the reduced efficiency of nitrate removal in this case was probably due to the adsorption of cl on cuni thus blocking a certain number of catalytic sites this issue was readily solved using a divided cell configuration 37 at the cost of a higher ohmic resistance derived from the additional ion exchange membrane the specific roles of the bimetallic cuni active site and the mesoporous omcn support were then examined to elaborate the origin of the excellent nitrate reduction performance of cuni omcn as shown in fig s12 the percent of no3 removed after 7 h of operation was 31 5 75 2 and 74 for omcn cu omcn and ni omcn in the absence of cl the nh4 selectivity also increased from over 85 to nearly 100 after the incorporation of cu or ni sites into omcn framework nevertheless the overall reduction efficiency for the monometallic catalysts were still much lower than the value achieved by the bimetallic cuni omcn 100 thus confirming the significance of cuni alloys to enhance the reduction kinetics meanwhile the influence of nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon substrate was demonstrated through the comparison of the no3 reduction by cuni omc cuni omcn and cuni omcn2 with the addition of cl table s1 it was noted that as the concentration of nitrogen precursor increased the rate of no3 removal increased from 74 1 to 80 and 84 while the respective n2 selectivity were 99 100 and 95 the reduced nitrate reduction activity of cuni omc was attributed to the smaller bet specific surface area or pore volume table s2 as well as the formation of much larger agglomerates that might even grow out of the substrate fig s4 on the other hand cuni omcn2 exhibited the lowest selectivity toward n2 although its higher surface area and pore volume table s2 as well as the smaller particle size fig s5 and crystallite size fig s2 all contributed to its highest no3 removal efficiency one possible reason for the loss of n2 selectivity may be the increasing amount of metal nitride as evidenced by the higher content of cu2 and ni2 in xps spectra figs s10 and s11 which was inactive for the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate the operating conditions for no3 removal such as the external applied bias the cl dosage and the concentration of na2so4 supporting electrolyte were systematically investigated and optimized as well in order to ensure the long term stability and durability of cuni omcn as shown in fig s13 the amount of active chlorine produced on anode could not satisfy the demand of ammonia oxidation unless the applied voltage reached 1 8 v at which the 100 n2 selectivity was realized in the meantime it was also noted that further increasing the voltage to 2 0 v led to little improvement on the overall nitrate efficiency which might be due to the competing water electrolysis similarly the dosage of cl could directly affect the breakpoint chlorination process and was crucial to the selectivity and activity of no3 removal as well when the ratio of cl to no3 n in the electrolyte was 4 almost a quarter of the reduction product remained in the form of nh4 fig s14 the n2 selectivity raised to 100 when the cl to no3 n ratio reached 8 and the further increase of cl dosage generated free chlorine residual that would affect the subsequent use of the treated water despite the fact that a higher no3 removal rate might be achieved the influence of the na2so4 supporting electrolyte to the overall nitrate reduction was shown in fig s15 the increase of sulfate concentration improved the conductivity of the electrolyte thus facilitating the reduction of no3 however the extra so4 2 ions could also block some of the active sites in cuni omcn as a result the further increase of so4 2 concentration when it was over 0 1 m led to a decrease in denitrification performance based upon the optimal conditions the cuni omcn catalysts managed to exhibit a consistently high efficiency close to 90 for no3 removal and a 100 n2 selectivity in nine consecutive cycles each last for 7 h as shown in fig 4c notably only a negligible amount of metal leaching was detected over the long term operation figs 4d and s16 such exceptional stability and durability of cuni ocmn should be mainly ascribed to the nanoconfinement of cuni alloys into the mesoporous carbon framework finally dft calculations were applied to estimate the adsorption energy of reaction immediate for the nitrate reduction on either the cu80ni20 or cu surface so as to reveal the origin of the enhanced activity of cuni omcn the stability of the cu80ni20 alloy was first screened via doping ni into cu at various layers and distributions and the surface models used in this work for the subsequent free energy calculations was given in fig s17 according to the previous studies 2 24 33 51 the conversion of no3 to nh3 on cu surface started with a few deoxidation reactions no3 no2 no followed with the stepwise hydrogenation no noh nhoh nh2oh and eventually the removal of hydroxyl group and transformation to nh3 the most stable configuration for the adsorption of each intermediate on the cu80ni20 and cu surface was given in fig 5 a and s18 and the corresponding free energy diagrams for the no3 to nh3 conversion were presented in fig 5b compared to the pure cu surface the adsorption of no3 and no2 rate determining steps on the cu80ni20 alloy was enhanced thus lowering the overpotential required for the nitrate reduction in addition the potential gap for the hydrogenation of noh to nhoh and nh2oh was also reduced on cu80ni20 which corresponded to a higher selectivity toward the formation of nh3 these findings clearly explained the outstanding nitrate to nitrogen activity of cuni omcn with the aid of breakpoint chlorination 4 conclusions to summarize a two step strategy was proposed in this work for the electrocatalytic reduction of no3 to n2 combining a cathodic conversion of no3 to nh4 by cuni omcn with an anodic breakpoint chlorination to produce clo for the subsequent non electrochemical oxidation of nh4 the mesoporous cuni omcn catalysts were prepared through a one pot evaporation induced self assembly followed by the thermal treatment in an inert environment to remove the template the successful formation of well dispersed bimetallic cuni nanoparticles of ca 20 nm on the ordered mesoporous nitrogen containing carbon substrate was carefully examined by a series of characterization techniques including xrd hrtem saxs bet and xps in particular the dosage of nitrogen precursors was found to play a critical role to control the particle size of cuni alloys the porosity of omcn substrate and the distribution of cuni on omcn the resulting cuni omcn catalysts exhibited a complete removal of no3 in the absence of cl and the furthermore the 100 conversion to n2 with its addition compared to the metal free omcn or the monometallic cu omcn and ni omcn the bimetallic cuni omcn demonstrated a significantly enhanced rate of nitrate removal under the same condition indicating the superior reduction kinetics of cuni alloys dft calculations revealed that the adsorption of no3 no2 noh nhoh and nh2oh the key intermediate in the conversion of no3 to nh3 was increased on a cu80ni20 surface compared to the pure cu which explained the origin of the superior activity and selectivity observed above meanwhile it was also found that cuni omcn possessed a much higher no3 reduction activity than cuni omc and a better n2 selectivity than cuni omcn2 which confirmed the synergistic effect between cuni active sites and mesoporous omcn support upon the optimization of operating conditions a close to 90 no3 removal efficiency and 100 n2 selectivity was achieved in nine consecutive cycles each last for 7 h the fantastic no3 to n2 activity of cuni ocmn observed in this work and long term stability in the presence of cl was mainly attributed to the nanoconfinement of cuni alloys into the mesoporous carbon framework it is reasonable to anticipate that such a non noble metal catalyst driven two step conversion of nitrate to nitrogen approach will become a feasible solution to the denitrification of industrial wastewater after the cell configurations and anode materials are further improved to address the partial adsorption of cl ions on cathode as well as the high overpotential required for the chlorination declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

prepared by coating a mixture of sample powders acetylene black and pvdf 10 g l 1 with the ratio of 8 1 1 on a nickel foam 3 4 cm followed by dried at 80 c for 6 h and subsequently 120 c for 12 h in a vacuum oven 2 5 electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate nitrate electro reduction tests were performed on a chi 606d shanghai with a three electrode divided system the available volume of this undivided

added to the solution to evaluate the impact of cl concentration on electrocatalytic denitrification 2 6 physical and chemical characterizations chemical compositions and morphology of the

grimme s dft d3 methodology 59 was used to describe the dispersion interactions among all the atoms in adsorption models the vacuum spacing in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the catalyst

the stability of cu80ni20 alloy systems was screened via doping ni into cu at various layers and distributions the free energy was calculated using the equation g e zpe ts where g e zpe and ts were the free energy total energy from dft calculations zero point energy and entropic contributions t was set to be 300 k respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 compositional and structural characteristics of cuni omcn as shown in fig 1 the cuni omcn catalysts were prepared via an evaporation induced self assembly approach 52 using low molecular weight resol as the carbon source pluronic f127 as the structure directing agent dcda as the metal coordination agent and cu no3 2 and nicl2 as the metal precursors during the slow evaporation of ethanol solution cu and ni ions were well distributed into carbon matrix which facilitated the nucleation and growth of cuni alloys the subsequent carbonization in n2 atmosphere removed the surfactant templates leaving cuni nanoparticles immobilized in the mesoporous carbon framework the saxs pattern of the resulting cuni omcn fig 2 a exhibited two scattering peaks at the q values of 0 65 and 1 1 nm 1 which could be assigned to the 100 and 200 reflection respectively suggesting the successful formation of a 2d hexagonal mesoporous p6mm structure the porosity of cuni omcn was further analyzed by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig 2b a typical type iv curve with the distinct h2 hysteresis loop was observed indicating that the catalysts possessed an ink bottle like pore structure a mono distributed mesopore size of ca 4 1 nm insert in fig 2b was derived from the adsorption branch of isotherms by the barrett joyner halenda method besides the calculated brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area of 447 5 m2 g 1 t plot micropore surface area of 248 9 m2 g 1 and total pore volume of 0 374 m3 g 1 all supported the high surface area micro meso porous characteristics of cuni omcn the successful formation of cuni alloys were evidenced by the wide angle xrd pattern of cuni omcn as shown in fig 2c the diffraction peaks with the 2θ values of 43 5 and 50 8 were assigned to the 111 or 200 plane of the cu0 81ni0 19 alloy pdf 47 1406 while the others at 27 31 6 45 5 56 and 75 corresponded to the graphitic carbon pdf 46 0943 according to the debye scherrer formula the crystallite size of the cuni alloys was estimated to be ca 20 nm in addition the xrd patterns of mono metallic cu omcn or ni omcn fig s3 also showed two peaks for the 111 and 200 planes of cu or ni respectively indicating a similar crystal structure of those composites note that the peak positions of cuni were between those of cu and ni the corresponding d spacing of the former should also be between the latter two which again supported the formation of cuni alloys the local structure and morphology of cuni omcn was examined in greater detail by hrtem imaging and eds mapping it was seen in fig 3 a c that cuni nanoparticles those darker spots were well dispersed on a highly ordered cylindrical mesoporous carbon support with the majority 70 possessing a particle size of ca 20 nm in good accordance with the grain size estimated above moreover a higher resolution image fig 3d revealed the existence of two different lattice spacing 0 180 and 0 206 nm in cuni nanoparticles which perfectly matched the 200 and 111 plane identified in the xrd pattern indicating a face centered cubic fcc crystal structure of cuni alloys 60 what s more the eds elemental mapping of cuni omcn displayed a homogeneous distribution of c and n atoms throughout the whole sample fig 3e f and the complete overlap of cu and ni atoms fig 3g h further illustrating the immobilization of cuni nanoalloys on nitrogen doped carbon supports the xps survey spectrum of cuni omcn reaffirmed the presence of c n cu and ni in it fig s6 high resolution spectra were then adopted to elucidate the exact chemical state of each element with regard to the c 1s fig s7a and n1s fig s7b four peaks were identified at 284 4 284 9 286 0 and 288 9 ev in the former corresponding to the cc cc co and o c o groups respectively while the other three found in the latter at 398 4 399 5 and 400 7 ev were attributed to the pyridinic pyrrolic and graphitic nitrogen 61 62 the high content of pyridinic n 47 7 at in cuni omcn was supposed to promote the formation of cuni nanoalloys 63 thus enhancing the overall catalytic nitrate reduction activity besides zero valent cu and ni which should be assigned to the cuni alloys were found to account for approximately half of the total amount of those two elements fig s7c d the remaining half were cu2 and ni2 respectively which could be attributed to the amorphous metal nitrides taking into account of both the xrd patterns and the synthesis methods 3 2 electrocatalytic activity and mechanism for the reduction of no3 the electrocatalytic activity of cuni omcn for the reduction of no3 was critically evaluated both in the absence and presence of cl as seen in fig 4 a for an initial no3 n concentration of 30 mg l 1 a typical nitrogen content for urban domestic sewage over 50 of them was reduced within an hour by cuni omcn while the complete removal was achievable in 7 h when no cl was added and the applied voltage was 1 8 v it was further shown in fig 4b that a 100 n2 selectivity could be reached under the same condition except the addition of cl ions the reduced efficiency of nitrate removal in this case was probably due to the adsorption of cl on cuni thus blocking a certain number of catalytic sites this issue was readily solved using a divided cell configuration 37 at the cost of a higher ohmic resistance derived from the additional ion exchange membrane the specific roles of the bimetallic cuni active site and the mesoporous omcn support were then examined to elaborate the origin of the excellent nitrate reduction performance of cuni omcn as shown in fig s12 the percent of no3 removed after 7 h of operation was 31 5 75 2 and 74 for omcn cu omcn and ni omcn in the absence of cl the nh4 selectivity also increased from over 85 to nearly 100 after the incorporation of cu or ni sites into omcn framework nevertheless the overall reduction efficiency for the monometallic catalysts were still much lower than the value achieved by the bimetallic cuni omcn 100 thus confirming the significance of cuni alloys to enhance the reduction kinetics meanwhile the influence of nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon substrate was demonstrated through the comparison of the no3 reduction by cuni omc cuni omcn and cuni omcn2 with the addition of cl table s1 it was noted that as the concentration of nitrogen precursor increased the rate of no3 removal increased from 74 1 to 80 and 84 while the respective n2 selectivity were 99 100 and 95 the reduced nitrate reduction activity of cuni omc was attributed to the smaller bet specific surface area or pore volume table s2 as well as the formation of much larger agglomerates that might even grow out of the substrate fig s4 on the other hand cuni omcn2 exhibited the lowest selectivity toward n2 although its higher surface area and pore volume table s2 as well as the smaller particle size fig s5 and crystallite size fig s2 all contributed to its highest no3 removal efficiency one possible reason for the loss of n2 selectivity may be the increasing amount of metal nitride as evidenced by the higher content of cu2 and ni2 in xps spectra figs s10 and s11 which was inactive for the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate the operating conditions for no3 removal such as the external applied bias the cl dosage and the concentration of na2so4 supporting electrolyte were systematically investigated and optimized as well in order to ensure the long term stability and durability of cuni omcn as shown in fig s13 the amount of active chlorine produced on anode could not satisfy the demand of ammonia oxidation unless the applied voltage reached 1 8 v at which the 100 n2 selectivity was realized in the meantime it was also noted that further increasing the voltage to 2 0 v led to little improvement on the overall nitrate efficiency which might be due to the competing water electrolysis similarly the dosage of cl could directly affect the breakpoint chlorination process and was crucial to the selectivity and activity of no3 removal as well when the ratio of cl to no3 n in the electrolyte was 4 almost a quarter of the reduction product remained in the form of nh4 fig s14 the n2 selectivity raised to 100 when the cl to no3 n ratio reached 8 and the further increase of cl dosage generated free chlorine residual that would affect the subsequent use of the treated water despite the fact that a higher no3 removal rate might be achieved the influence of the na2so4 supporting electrolyte to the overall nitrate reduction was shown in fig s15 the increase of sulfate concentration improved the conductivity of the electrolyte thus facilitating the reduction of no3 however the extra so4 2 ions could also block some of the active sites in cuni omcn as a result the further increase of so4 2 concentration when it was over 0 1 m led to a decrease in denitrification performance based upon the optimal conditions the cuni omcn catalysts managed to exhibit a consistently high efficiency close to 90 for no3 removal and a 100 n2 selectivity in nine consecutive cycles each last for 7 h as shown in fig 4c notably only a negligible amount of metal leaching was detected over the long term operation figs 4d and s16 such exceptional stability and durability of cuni ocmn should be mainly ascribed to the nanoconfinement of cuni alloys into the mesoporous carbon framework finally dft calculations were applied to estimate the adsorption energy of reaction immediate for the nitrate reduction on either the cu80ni20 or cu surface so as to reveal the origin of the enhanced activity of cuni omcn the stability of the cu80ni20 alloy was first screened via doping ni into cu at various layers and distributions and the surface models used in this work for the subsequent free energy calculations was given in fig s17 according to the previous studies 2 24 33 51 the conversion of no3 to nh3 on cu surface started with a few deoxidation reactions no3 no2 no followed with the stepwise hydrogenation no noh nhoh nh2oh and eventually the removal of hydroxyl group and transformation to nh3 the most stable configuration for the adsorption of each intermediate on the cu80ni20 and cu surface was given in fig 5 a and s18 and the corresponding free energy diagrams for the no3 to nh3 conversion were presented in fig 5b compared to the pure cu surface the adsorption of no3 and no2 rate determining steps on the cu80ni20 alloy was enhanced thus lowering the overpotential required for the nitrate reduction in addition the potential gap for the hydrogenation of noh to nhoh and nh2oh was also reduced on cu80ni20 which corresponded to a higher selectivity toward the formation of nh3 these findings clearly explained the outstanding nitrate to nitrogen activity of cuni omcn with the aid of breakpoint chlorination 4 conclusions to summarize a two step strategy was proposed in this work for the electrocatalytic reduction of no3 to n2 combining a cathodic conversion of no3 to nh4 by cuni omcn with an anodic breakpoint chlorination to produce clo for the subsequent non electrochemical oxidation of nh4 the mesoporous cuni omcn catalysts were prepared through a one pot evaporation induced self assembly followed by the thermal treatment in an inert environment to remove the template the successful formation of well dispersed bimetallic cuni nanoparticles of ca 20 nm on the ordered mesoporous nitrogen containing carbon substrate was carefully examined by a series of characterization techniques including xrd hrtem saxs bet and xps in particular the dosage of nitrogen precursors was found to play a critical role to control the particle size of cuni alloys the porosity of omcn substrate and the distribution of cuni on omcn the resulting cuni omcn catalysts exhibited a complete removal of no3 in the absence of cl and the furthermore the 100 conversion to n2 with its addition compared to the metal free omcn or the monometallic cu omcn and ni omcn the bimetallic cuni omcn demonstrated a significantly enhanced rate of nitrate removal under the same condition indicating the superior reduction kinetics of cuni alloys dft calculations revealed that the adsorption of no3 no2 noh nhoh and nh2oh the key intermediate in the conversion of no3 to nh3 was increased on a cu80ni20 surface compared to the pure cu which explained the origin of the superior activity and selectivity observed above meanwhile it was also found that cuni omcn possessed a much higher no3 reduction activity than cuni omc and a better n2 selectivity than cuni omcn2 which confirmed the synergistic effect between cuni active sites and mesoporous omcn support upon the optimization of operating conditions a close to 90 no3 removal efficiency and 100 n2 selectivity was achieved in nine consecutive cycles each last for 7 h the fantastic no3 to n2 activity of cuni ocmn observed in this work and long term stability in the presence of cl was mainly attributed to the nanoconfinement of cuni alloys into the mesoporous carbon framework it is reasonable to anticipate that such a non noble metal catalyst driven two step conversion of nitrate to nitrogen approach will become a feasible solution to the denitrification of industrial wastewater after the cell configurations and anode materials are further improved to address the partial adsorption of cl ions on cathode as well as the high

13496,artificial mixing is considered as one of the most effective methods for controlling cyanobacterial blooms however the success rate of this method is still very low and whether it could be successfully applied to shallow waters remains unclear in the current study a self designed moving aeration device was employed in an extremely eutrophic shallow pond with water depth of 1 5 m a similar pond without aeration was set as the control the experiment was performed over two years 2019 2020 there were no significant differences in the mean values of all water quality parameters except for ammonia concentration between the two ponds nevertheless the occurrence of blooms was eliminated in the treated pond in the second year while cyanobacterial blooms still occurred frequently in the control pond in the second year of the experiment cyanobacteria was the dominant phytoplankton phylum in the control pond comprising up to 68 of the total community however in the treated pond the maximum proportion of cyanobacteria was just 30 while the proportions of bacillariophyta and chlorophyta reached approximately 80 microcystis was the dominant genus in the control pond while scenedesmus and pediastrum became dominant in the treated pond in the second year microcystis colony size decreased substantially in the treated pond in the second year the results suggest that moving aeration is an environmentally friendly method of controlling cyanobacterial blooms in shallow ponds and lakes the aeration could disaggregate microcystis colonies and shift the phytoplankton community from cyanobacteria to chlorophyta and bacillariophyta keywords moving aeration cyanobacterial blooms microcystis colony size 1 introduction in recent decades cyanobacterial blooms especially those of the genus microcystis have become a major environmental problem affecting water supplies and ecological security worldwide 1 3 researchers have devised a number of ways to control cyanobacterial blooms but very few methods can be put into practice 4 7 in addition to classic biological manipulation artificial mixing is considered to be one of the most effective methods for controlling cyanobacterial blooms however the success rate of the artificial mixing method is still very low especially when the system was too shallow or the horizontal distribution of mixing devices was inadequate to cover the entire lake 8 thus it is necessary to carry out pilot and field experiments to improve our ability to control cyanobacterial blooms using the artificial mixing method the artificial mixing method was initially used to improve the water quality in lakes and reservoirs 8 9 phosphorus release from sediments is considered to be reduced by aeration because the amount of oxidized iron fe3 increases with increasing dissolved oxygen concentration 10 11 this increase in oxidized fe3 leads to the formation of more stable iron bound phosphorus sherman et al 12 reported that artificial mixing reduced internal phosphorus release by 80 in chaffey reservoir in northern new south wales australia steinberg and zimmermann 13 also indicated that the phosphorus concentration in lake fischkaltersee bavaria southern germany decreased from 0 264 mg l 1 to 0 048 mg l 1 when treated with aeration however the water depths in both studies were greater than 5 m in addition most previous studies on the use of artificial mixing to control cyanobacterial blooms have not reported on the water quality 14 15 whether artificial mixing would be able to reduce phosphorus concentrations in shallower lakes such as lake taihu in china was not clear which is important because most shallow lakes and ponds have higher nutrient levels and more serious blooms than deeper water bodies 16 17 it has been proposed that artificial mixing mainly controls cyanobacterial blooms by reducing the sedimentation losses of the negatively buoyant chlorophyta and bacillariophyta and by entraining the buoyant cyanobacteria in the deeper parts of the water body in this way the mixing alters the light dose received by the different phytoplankton and thus affects the competition between cyanobacteria and other algae this mechanism has been shown to work well in several deep lakes and reservoirs 8 however the sedimentation losses of chlorophyta and bacillariophyta in shallow lakes and ponds would be much lower than in deep water bodies therefore it should be explored whether artificial mixing could be successfully applied to shallow waters in several practical works that focused on the use of artificial mixing for controlling cyanobacterial blooms the blooms were not caused by the most common cyanobacterial bloom forming genus microcystis but by oscillatoria cylindrospermopsis and anabaena 8 microcystis individuals always form large colonies and thus it is difficult to force microcystis off the water surface by mixing 18 19 several pilot experiments have failed to control microcystis blooms by mixing 8 nevertheless a recent study has indicated that microcystis colonies could be disaggregated by turbulence if the turbulence intensity is high enough 20 thus there is still potential for microcystis blooms to be controlled successfully by increasing the mixing intensity selecting an appropriate aeration position is also vital for determining the success or failure of using artificial mixing to control cyanobacterial blooms because every lake and reservoir is different it is hard to find a universal rule for choosing the aeration position as a solution to this problem the employment of a moving aerator could be considered this would allow the entire water surface to become an aeration point in succession high costs may be a great challenge to this proposal however this challenge could be overcome if the power for the movement is generated by the aeration process itself in this way it is thus feasible to design a moving aeration device to control cyanobacteria blooms the aim of this study was to reveal the effects of an artificial moving aeration system on the water quality and cyanobacterial blooms occurrence in an extremely eutrophic shallow pond the variation in phytoplankton community structure and microcystis colony size was investigated to understand the effect of artificial mixing on the dynamic of cyanobacterial blooms 2 methods and materials 2 1 experimental site the experimental site was located in a fish farm 30 602 n 103 673 e in chengdu sichuan province china two fish ponds 20 m 14 m with a water depth of 1 5 m were selected the ponds were made of concrete and had a cuboid construction one pond was used for the aeration treatment and the other was used as a control the fish in the pond were fished before the experiment the sediment thickness of both ponds was approximately 10 cm 2 2 moving aeration device and operation conditions a self designed moving aeration device was used in the experiment fig 1 the moving aeration device worked from 8 00 to 18 00 every day with an aeration intensity of 1000 l min 1 and a power of 0 6 kw h the moving velocity was 6 m min 1 and the moving direction changed randomly from 0 to 90 degrees to the right every minute the path of the device was random generally the moving path of the device could cover the whole water surface in 1 h and a random route was shown in fig 1b 2 3 water sampling the experiment was conducted over the course of the years 2019 and 2020 sampling was carried out every month from may to october and every two months during the rest of each year however it was not possible to conduct the sampling from january to april 2020 due to covid 19 restrictions in each pond three sampling points were selected which were distributed as a triangle 12 m 12 m 12 m at each point 1000 ml of water was collected from the surface layer 0 15 cm middle layer 65 80 cm and bottom layer 125 140 cm using a polymethyl methacrylate sampler 21 the water samples from the same site were mixed and then divided into two groups one group was used for water quality analysis and the other group was used for phytoplankton analysis 2 4 water sample analysis the water samples destined for water quality analysis were divided into two groups one group of samples was used directly to determine the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations using colorimetric methods after digestion with naoh k2s2o8 40 the other group of samples was filtrated through a membrane with a pore size of 0 45 μm the filtrate was used for the determination of ammonia nh3 n nitrate no3 n and orthophosphate p2o5 3 concentrations using nessler s reagent 22 sulfamic acid 41 and molybdenum antimony anti spectrophotometry 23 respectively the water samples destined for phytoplankton analysis were treated with lugol s reagent 15 ml l 1 and were stood in the laboratory for 48 h the supernatant was then siphoned off and the final volume was adjusted to 30 ml the samples were then observed at 200 or 400 magnification using a light microscope cx31 olympus tokyo japan for phytoplankton identification at the genus level and cell counting respectively microphotos were taken of the microcystis colonies using a digital camera d600 canon tokyo japan coupled to light optical microscope the photos were then analyzed using uthscsa imagetool v3 00 software department of dental diagnostic science university of texas health science center san antonio tx usa the sizes of the microcystis colonies were calculated according to the method described by zhu et al 17 2 5 data analysis the alpha diversity of phytoplankton communities was estimated using eqs 1 3 richness index h 1 h s 1 ln n simpson s diversity index d 2 d 1 i 1 s ni n 2 pielou s evenness index j 3 j 1 i 1 s p i ln p i lns where s is the number of phytoplankton genera found at each sampling point n is the total number of phytoplankton individuals found at each point and ni is the number of phytoplankton individuals in the i genus statistical analyses were conducted using spss v19 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa one way analysis of variance anova tests were used to identify significant differences in environmental factors and in the biomass morphology and community structure of phytoplankton between the control and the treated ponds p 0 05 3 results 3 1 water quality during the experimental period the nh3 n concentration ranged from 0 04 mg l 1 to 1 58 mg l 1 in the control pond but from 0 03 mg l 1 to 0 80 mg l 1 in the treated pond the mean concentrations of tn and tp in the two ponds were approximately 4 71 mg l 1 and 1 08 mg l 1 respectively there were no significant differences in the mean values of all the water quality parameters tested except for nh3 n concentration between the two ponds with and without aeration fig 2 3 2 phytoplankton biomass and bloom occurrence cyanobacterial blooms occurred frequently in the control pond throughout the experimental period while there were no obvious blooms in the treated pond in the second year fig 3a b nevertheless the water in the treated pond was still clearly green the phytoplankton biomass varied monthly and the value in the treated pond was slightly higher than in the control pond at most sampling times fig 3c inversely the cyanobacterial biomass was almost always lower in the treated pond than in the control fig 3d in particular in the second year of the experiment the cyanobacterial biomass in the treated pond was less than 5 mg l 1 at most time points while the value in the control pond was always higher than 10 mg l 1 3 3 biomass and colony size of microcystis there was no distinct difference in the microcystis biomass between the two ponds in the first year the maximum microcystis biomass was found in the control pond in july 2020 at 25 mg l 1 the corresponding value in the treated pond was just 13 mg l 1 fig 4a thus the microcystis biomass in the treated pond was almost as low as half of that in the control pond in the second year similarly the microcystis colony size displayed a distinct decrease 21 3 15 8 μm in the treated pond in the second year fig 4b 3 4 phytoplankton community composition at the phylum level bacillariophyta and chlorophyta were dominant in both ponds in the first year and their proportion reached 80 in the total phytoplankton community fig 5 however cyanobacteria was the dominant phylum in the control pond in the second year with a maximum proportion of 68 the maximum proportion of cyanobacteria in the treated pond was just 30 in the second year while the maximum proportion of bacillariophyta and chlorophyta was approximately 80 in the first year the most abundant genera in both ponds were microcystis 8 0 scenedesmus 11 5 pediastrum 16 0 nitzschia 4 8 and fragilaria 14 6 fig 6 however in the second year microcystis 56 2 was dominant in the control pond while scenedesmus 13 9 and pediastrum 20 7 were dominant in the treated pond specifically the proportion of microcystis in the treated pond 18 1 was two thirds lower than that in the control pond similarly the maximum proportion of pseudoanabaena in the treated pond 6 2 was two thirds lower than that in the control pond 19 6 in contrast the mean proportion of scenedesmus in the treated pond reached 13 9 which was much higher than the proportion in the control pond 2 6 in addition the maximum proportion of nitzschia reached 36 9 in the treated pond while the proportion in the control pond was just 4 5 3 5 phytoplankton community diversity in the first year the values of each phytoplankton diversity index were similar in the ponds with and without aeration however in the second year the simpson s diversity index pielou s evenness index and the richness index were all markedly higher in the treated pond than in the control pond fig 7 4 discussion in this study we used a moving aeration device to treat a shallow pond over a two year period the results showed that there was no significant difference in the phosphorus concentration between the treated pond and the control pond this increasing trend is contrary to the results of many previous experiments 8 in the current study the mean tp concentration in both ponds was approximately 1 mg l 1 while in previous studies the tp concentration was generally below 0 05 mg l 1 12 13 due to this high background tp value even a slight increase in the phosphorus concentration was difficult to detect a possible explanation for the above mentioned discrepancies is that the water depths in previous studies were much greater approximately 5 30 m than in the present study only 1 5 m and thus there would be an anaerobic zone in the deep water layers when treated with aeration these anaerobic zones would become aerobic and iron would be oxidized to a higher valence ion this would lead to the formation of relatively stable iron phosphate thereby fixing phosphorus in the sediments in shallow waters sediments are not in an anaerobic environment and thus this phosphorus fixing process would not occur upon aeration in addition the release from the sediments suspended by the mixing would impede phosphorus deposition 24 it is also notable that in the present study moving aeration reduced nitrogen concentration especially nh3 n in the treated pond this effect could be mainly due to the enhancement of nitrification by aeration 25 due to the small density of fish the effect of fish on phytoplankton biomass in the current study was negligible compared with the control moving aeration slightly increased the total phytoplankton biomass in the treated pond in this study although this biomass increase was an unintentional effect of the aeration this result was similar to results previously obtained in deep lakes 8 generally the ph in some calm lakes and reservoirs increases at noon on sunny summer days because the dissolved carbon dioxide in the water is absorbed by fast growing phytoplankton including cyanobacteria 26 carbon dioxide is an important limiting factor for the growth of phytoplankton therefore it is possible that in the present study the additional supply of carbon dioxide by aeration ameliorated carbon dioxide limitation and thus promoted phytoplankton growth cyanobacteria tend to accumulate in the surface water layer exploiting their own buoyancy and larger size compared with other phytoplankton such as chlorophyta and bacillariophyta 3 in the treated pond the phytoplankton community was fully mixed and uniformly distributed throughout the water column in contrast in the control pond cyanobacteria mainly accumulated in the surface layer of the water this vertical redistribution of phytoplankton caused by the aeration could facilitate the phytoplankton to acquire light and nutrients thus slightly increasing the total phytoplankton biomass this redistribution would also explain why aeration led to the clear promotion of green algal and diatom growth but inhibited cyanobacterial growth this mechanism has been well described by huisman et al 27 the results of the present study indicated that moving aeration did not eliminate cyanobacterial blooms until the second year of the experiment several previous studies showed that the effect of aeration on controlling the occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms was not evident this negative result was thus likely caused by the short experimental periods less than a year used in those studies 8 15 28 in this study the dominant genus of cyanobacteria in the treated pond was identified to be microcystis the large colony size and gas vesicles of microcystis are always considered to be the main reasons for their rapid rising velocity which allows the colonies to float upward and accumulate at the water surface forming blooms 3 here the results showed that moving aeration substantially reduced the mean diameter of microcystis colonies in the treated pond indicating the disaggregation of microcystis colonies based on a computational fluid dynamics model feng et al 42 estimated that the energy dissipation rate in a tank with an aeration intensity of 3 m3 min 1 was 5 07 10 2 m3 s 2 in the current study the aeration intensity was approximately 2 m3 min 1 therefore the turbulence intensity generated in the treated pond would be much smaller than that in the aerated tank because the boundary in the tank was limited the turbulence intensity in the treated pond was in the same order of magnitude as the value in the tank treated by feng et al 42 this intensity was also similar to the 600 800 rpm treatment in the study conducted by li et al 20 which could disaggregate microcystis colonies within 30 min zhu et al 29 reported that disaggregation of microcystis occurred when the energy dissipation rate was 2 33 10 5 m3 s 2 which corresponded to an average wind speed of 5 00 m s 1 in a reservoir with 30 m depth thus turbulence caused by moving aeration in the current study can break up microcystis colonies in the second year of the present study the proportion of microcystis in the treated pond was lower than that in the control pond a similar trend was observed in the proportion of pseudoanabaena this result indicated that moving aeration reduced the proportion of other cyanobacterial genera in addition to microcystis however the proportion of scenedesmus was considerably increased by aeration in the second year he et al 2020 showed that microcystis was sensitive to turbulence while scenedesmus had a greater tolerance in a photobioreactor subjected to aeration based on a field investigation and a laboratorial experiment zhou et al 30 indicated that the diatom fragilaria became dominant when wind induced turbulence was applied with an energy dissipation rate of 2 95 10 5 m2 s 3 while microcystis was dominant without turbulence however thomas and gibson 31 showed that the relative sensitivities of phytoplankton to turbulence were ranked in the order of chlorophyta cyanobacteria bacillariophyta in addition xiao et al 32 reported that the specific growth rate of microcystis flos aquae increased when the energy dissipation rate of turbulence increased from 0 to 8 01 10 2 m2 s 3 overall these previous results imply that the species dependent sensitivity of phytoplankton to turbulence is not the only reason why chlorophyta and bacillariophyta are dominant when treated with turbulence the vertical redistribution of phytoplankton caused by the mixing is likely to be more important phytoplankton biodiversity indices have frequently been used to evaluate the degree of pollution in water bodies 33 36 in the present study there were no considerable differences in water quality between the control and treated ponds however all the phytoplankton biodiversity indices namely the simpson s diversity index pielou s evenness index and richness index were much higher in the treated pond than in the control pond in addition synedra has sometimes been used as an indicator of organic pollution 37 in the present study the proportion of synedra in the treated pond was much higher than in the control pond these results suggest that using phytoplankton and phytoplankton biodiversity indices as biological indicators does not work well when assessing water bodies with largely different hydrodynamic states in this study the moving aeration device consumed 6 kw h of electrical energy when working for 10 h per day according to the local electricity price the electricity cost of running the aeration device was approximately 400 us dollars per year the year round implementation could be adjusted so that the device is only implemented in the summer and fall to reduce the cost additionally it is feasible to reduce the working time by 2 h per day making such operation reductions could reduce the cost by 62 5 although aeration is a common water quality improvement technology cyanobacteria blooms still occur in many shallow lakes and ponds with fixed aeration systems 38 39 in the present study the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms was controlled by the moving aeration system changing fixed aeration devices to moving aeration devices would significantly decrease the number of aeration devices to get the same treatment effect in addition in the present study air was the only input substance used during the whole aeration process and no other chemicals were added although no direct data were obtained for microcystins during the aeration experiment it is inevitable that microcystin concentrations would decrease because of the considerable reduction in microcystis biomass therefore moving aeration can be used as an environmentally friendly method to control cyanobacterial blooms in shallow lakes and ponds and is thus worthy of widespread promotion 5 conclusion the results showed that despite no major changes in water quality cyanobacterial blooms almost disappeared from the shallow pond in the second year of moving aeration treatment in the second year of the experiment cyanobacteria was the dominant phylum in the control pond while chlorophyta and bacillariophyta were dominant in the aerated pond meanwhile microcystis was the dominant genus in the control pond while scenedesmus and pediastrum became dominant in the aerated pond microcystis colonies were also disaggregated by moving aeration the results suggested that moving aeration effectively controlled cyanobacterial blooms by disaggregating microcystis colonies and by shifting the phytoplankton community from cyanobacteria to chlorophyta and bacillariophyta declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

13496,artificial mixing is considered as one of the most effective methods for controlling cyanobacterial blooms however the success rate of this method is still very low and whether it could be successfully applied to shallow waters remains unclear in the current study a self designed moving aeration device was employed in an extremely eutrophic shallow pond with water depth of 1 5 m a similar pond without aeration was set as the control the experiment was performed over two years 2019 2020 there were no significant differences in the mean values of all water quality parameters except for ammonia concentration between the two ponds nevertheless the occurrence of blooms was eliminated in the treated pond in the second year while cyanobacterial blooms still occurred frequently in the control pond in the second year of the experiment cyanobacteria was the dominant phytoplankton phylum in the control pond comprising up to 68 of the total community however in the treated pond the maximum proportion of cyanobacteria was just 30 while the proportions of bacillariophyta and chlorophyta reached approximately 80 microcystis was the dominant genus in the control pond while scenedesmus and pediastrum became dominant in the treated pond in the second year microcystis colony size decreased substantially in the treated pond in the second year the results suggest that moving aeration is an environmentally friendly method of controlling cyanobacterial blooms in shallow ponds and lakes the aeration could disaggregate microcystis colonies and shift the phytoplankton community from cyanobacteria to chlorophyta and bacillariophyta keywords moving aeration cyanobacterial blooms microcystis colony size 1 introduction in recent decades cyanobacterial blooms especially those of the genus microcystis have become a major environmental problem affecting water supplies and ecological security worldwide 1 3 researchers have devised a number of ways to control cyanobacterial blooms but very few methods can be put into practice 4 7 in addition to classic biological manipulation artificial mixing is considered to be one of the most effective methods for controlling cyanobacterial blooms however the success rate of the artificial mixing method is still very low especially when the system was too shallow or the horizontal distribution of mixing devices was inadequate to cover the entire lake 8 thus it is necessary to carry out pilot and field experiments to improve our ability to control cyanobacterial blooms using the artificial mixing method the artificial mixing method was initially used to improve the water quality in lakes and reservoirs 8 9 phosphorus release from sediments is considered to be reduced by aeration because the amount of oxidized iron fe3 increases with increasing dissolved oxygen concentration 10 11 this increase in oxidized fe3 leads to the formation of more stable iron bound phosphorus sherman et al 12 reported that artificial mixing reduced internal phosphorus release by 80 in chaffey reservoir in northern new south wales australia steinberg and zimmermann 13 also indicated that the phosphorus concentration in lake fischkaltersee bavaria southern germany decreased from 0 264 mg l 1 to 0 048 mg l 1 when treated with aeration however the water depths in both studies were greater than 5 m in addition most previous studies on the use of artificial mixing to control cyanobacterial blooms have not reported on the water quality 14 15 whether artificial mixing would be able to reduce phosphorus concentrations in shallower lakes such as lake taihu in china was not clear which is important because most shallow lakes and ponds have higher nutrient levels and more serious blooms than deeper water bodies 16 17 it has been proposed that artificial mixing mainly controls cyanobacterial blooms by reducing the sedimentation losses of the negatively buoyant chlorophyta and bacillariophyta and by entraining the buoyant cyanobacteria in the deeper parts of the water body in this way the mixing alters the light dose received by the different phytoplankton and thus affects the competition between cyanobacteria and other algae this mechanism has been shown to work well in several deep lakes and reservoirs 8 however the sedimentation losses of chlorophyta and bacillariophyta in shallow lakes and ponds would be much lower than in deep water bodies therefore it should be explored whether artificial mixing could be successfully applied to shallow waters in several practical works that focused on the use of artificial mixing for controlling cyanobacterial blooms the blooms were not caused by the most common cyanobacterial bloom forming genus microcystis but by oscillatoria cylindrospermopsis and anabaena 8 microcystis individuals always form large colonies and thus it is difficult to force microcystis off the water surface by mixing 18 19 several pilot experiments have failed to control microcystis blooms by mixing 8 nevertheless a recent study has indicated that microcystis colonies could be disaggregated by turbulence if the turbulence intensity is high enough 20 thus there is still potential for microcystis blooms to be controlled successfully by increasing the mixing intensity selecting an appropriate aeration position is also vital for determining the success or failure of using artificial mixing to control cyanobacterial blooms because every lake and reservoir is different it is hard to find a universal rule for choosing the aeration position as a solution to this problem the employment of a moving aerator could be considered this would allow the entire water surface to become an aeration point in succession high costs may be a great challenge to this proposal however this challenge could be overcome if the power for the movement is generated by the aeration process itself in this way it is thus feasible to design a moving aeration device to control cyanobacteria blooms the aim of this study was to reveal the effects of an artificial moving aeration system on the water quality and cyanobacterial blooms occurrence in an extremely eutrophic shallow pond the variation in phytoplankton community structure and microcystis colony size was investigated to understand the effect of artificial mixing on the dynamic of cyanobacterial blooms 2 methods and materials 2 1 experimental site the experimental site was located in a fish farm 30 602 n 103 673 e in chengdu sichuan province china two fish ponds 20 m 14 m with a water depth of 1 5 m were selected the ponds were made of concrete and had a cuboid construction one pond was used for the aeration treatment and the other was used as a control the fish in the pond were fished before the experiment the sediment thickness of both ponds was approximately 10 cm 2 2 moving aeration device and operation conditions a self designed moving aeration device was used in the experiment fig 1 the moving aeration device worked from 8 00 to 18 00 every day with an aeration intensity of 1000 l min 1 and a power of 0 6 kw h the moving velocity was 6 m min 1 and the moving direction changed randomly from 0 to 90 degrees to the right every minute the path of the device was random generally the moving path of the device could cover the whole water surface in 1 h and a random route was shown in fig 1b 2 3 water sampling the experiment was conducted over the course of the years 2019 and 2020 sampling was carried out every month from may to october and every two months during the rest of each year however it was not possible to conduct the sampling from january to april 2020 due to covid 19 restrictions in each pond three sampling points were selected which were distributed as a triangle 12 m 12 m 12 m at each point 1000 ml of water was collected from the surface layer 0 15 cm middle layer 65 80 cm and bottom layer 125 140 cm using a polymethyl methacrylate sampler 21 the water samples from the same site were mixed and then divided into two groups one group was used for water quality analysis and the other group was used for phytoplankton analysis 2 4 water sample analysis the water samples destined for water quality analysis were divided into two groups one group of samples was used directly to determine the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations using colorimetric methods after digestion with naoh k2s2o8 40 the other group of samples was filtrated through a membrane with a pore size of 0 45 μm the filtrate was used for the determination of ammonia nh3 n nitrate no3 n and orthophosphate p2o5 3 concentrations using nessler s reagent 22 sulfamic acid 41 and molybdenum antimony anti spectrophotometry 23 respectively the water samples destined for phytoplankton analysis were treated with lugol s reagent 15 ml l 1 and were stood in the laboratory for 48 h the supernatant was then siphoned off and the final volume was adjusted to 30 ml the samples were then observed at 200 or 400 magnification using a light microscope cx31 olympus tokyo japan for phytoplankton identification at the genus level and cell counting respectively microphotos were taken of the microcystis colonies using a digital camera d600 canon tokyo japan coupled to light optical microscope the photos were then analyzed using uthscsa imagetool v3 00 software department of dental diagnostic science university of texas health science center san antonio tx usa the sizes of the microcystis colonies were calculated according to the method described by zhu et al 17 2 5 data analysis the alpha diversity of phytoplankton communities was estimated using eqs 1 3 richness index h 1 h s 1 ln n simpson s diversity index d 2 d 1 i 1 s ni n 2 pielou s evenness index j 3 j 1 i 1 s p i ln p i lns where s is the number of phytoplankton genera found at each sampling point n is the total number of phytoplankton individuals found at each point and ni is the number of phytoplankton individuals in the i genus statistical analyses were conducted using spss v19 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa one way analysis of variance anova tests were used to identify significant differences in environmental factors and in the biomass morphology and community structure of phytoplankton between the control and the treated ponds p 0 05 3 results 3 1 water quality during the experimental period the nh3 n concentration ranged from 0 04 mg l 1 to 1 58 mg l 1 in the control pond but from 0 03 mg l 1 to 0 80 mg l 1 in the treated pond the mean concentrations of tn and tp in the two ponds were approximately 4 71 mg l 1 and 1 08 mg l 1 respectively there were no significant differences in the mean values of all the water quality parameters tested except for nh3 n concentration between the two ponds with and without aeration fig 2 3 2 phytoplankton biomass and bloom occurrence cyanobacterial blooms occurred frequently in the control pond throughout the experimental period while there were no obvious blooms in the treated pond in the second year fig 3a b nevertheless the water in the treated pond was still clearly green the phytoplankton biomass varied monthly and the value in the treated pond was slightly higher than in the control pond at most sampling times fig 3c inversely the cyanobacterial biomass was almost always lower in the treated pond than in the control fig 3d in particular in the second year of the experiment the cyanobacterial biomass in the treated pond was less than 5 mg l 1 at most time points while the value in the control pond was always higher than 10 mg l 1 3 3 biomass and colony size of microcystis there was no distinct difference in the microcystis biomass between the two ponds in the first year the maximum microcystis biomass was found in the control pond in july 2020 at 25 mg l 1 the corresponding value in the treated pond was just 13 mg l 1 fig 4a thus the microcystis biomass in the treated pond was almost as low as half of that in the control pond in the second year similarly the microcystis colony size displayed a distinct decrease 21 3 15 8 μm in the treated pond in the second year fig 4b 3 4 phytoplankton community composition at the phylum level bacillariophyta and chlorophyta were dominant in both ponds in the first year and their proportion reached 80 in the total phytoplankton community fig 5 however cyanobacteria was the dominant phylum in the control pond in the second year with a maximum proportion of 68 the maximum proportion of cyanobacteria in the treated pond was just 30 in the second year while the maximum proportion of bacillariophyta and chlorophyta was approximately 80 in the first year the most abundant genera in both ponds were microcystis 8 0 scenedesmus 11 5 pediastrum 16 0 nitzschia 4 8 and fragilaria 14 6 fig 6 however in the second year microcystis 56 2 was dominant in the control pond while scenedesmus 13 9 and pediastrum 20 7 were dominant in the treated pond specifically the proportion of microcystis in the treated pond 18 1 was two thirds lower than that in the control pond similarly the maximum proportion of pseudoanabaena in the treated pond 6 2 was two thirds lower than that in the control pond 19 6 in contrast the mean proportion of scenedesmus in the treated pond reached 13 9 which was much higher than the proportion in the control pond 2 6 in addition the maximum proportion of nitzschia reached 36 9 in the treated pond while the proportion in the control pond was just 4 5 3 5 phytoplankton community diversity in the first year the values of each phytoplankton diversity index were similar in the ponds with and without aeration however in the second year the simpson s diversity index pielou s evenness index and the richness index were all markedly higher in the treated pond than in the control pond fig 7 4 discussion in this study we used a moving aeration device to treat a shallow pond over a two year period the results showed that there was no significant difference in the phosphorus concentration between the treated pond and the control pond this increasing trend is contrary to the results of many previous experiments 8 in the current study the mean tp concentration in both ponds was approximately 1 mg l 1 while in previous studies the tp concentration was generally below 0 05 mg l 1 12 13 due to this high background tp value even a slight increase in the phosphorus concentration was difficult to detect a possible explanation for the above mentioned discrepancies is that the water depths in previous studies were much greater approximately 5 30 m than in the present study only 1 5 m and thus there would be an anaerobic zone in the deep water layers when treated with aeration these anaerobic zones would become aerobic and iron would be oxidized to a higher valence ion this would lead to the formation of relatively stable iron phosphate thereby fixing phosphorus in the sediments in shallow waters sediments are not in an anaerobic environment and thus this phosphorus fixing process would not occur upon aeration in addition the release from the sediments suspended by the mixing would impede phosphorus deposition 24 it is also notable that in the present study moving aeration reduced nitrogen concentration especially nh3 n in the treated pond this effect could be mainly due to the enhancement of nitrification by aeration 25 due to the small density of fish the effect of fish on phytoplankton biomass in the current study was negligible compared with the control moving aeration slightly increased the total phytoplankton biomass in the treated pond in this study although this biomass increase was an unintentional effect of the aeration this result was similar to results previously obtained in deep lakes 8 generally the ph in some calm lakes and reservoirs increases at noon on sunny summer days because the dissolved carbon dioxide in the water is absorbed by fast growing phytoplankton including cyanobacteria 26 carbon dioxide is an important limiting factor for the growth of phytoplankton therefore it is possible that in the present study the additional supply of carbon dioxide by aeration ameliorated carbon dioxide limitation and thus promoted phytoplankton growth cyanobacteria tend to accumulate in the surface water layer exploiting their own buoyancy and larger size compared with other phytoplankton such as chlorophyta and bacillariophyta 3 in the treated pond the phytoplankton community was fully mixed and uniformly distributed throughout the water column in contrast in the control pond cyanobacteria mainly accumulated in the surface layer of the water this vertical redistribution of phytoplankton caused by the aeration could facilitate the phytoplankton to acquire light and nutrients thus slightly increasing the total phytoplankton biomass this redistribution would also explain why aeration led to the clear promotion of green algal and diatom growth but inhibited cyanobacterial growth this mechanism has been well described by huisman et al 27 the results of the present study indicated that moving aeration did not eliminate cyanobacterial blooms until the second year of the experiment several previous studies showed that the effect of aeration on controlling the occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms was not evident this negative result was thus likely caused by the short experimental periods less than a year used in those studies 8 15 28 in this study the dominant genus of cyanobacteria in the treated pond was identified to be microcystis the large colony size and gas vesicles of microcystis are always considered to be the main reasons for their rapid rising velocity which allows the colonies to float upward and accumulate at the water surface forming blooms 3 here the results showed that moving aeration substantially reduced the mean diameter of microcystis colonies in the treated pond indicating the disaggregation of microcystis colonies based on a computational fluid dynamics model feng et al 42 estimated that the energy dissipation rate in a tank with an aeration intensity of 3 m3 min 1 was 5 07 10 2 m3 s 2 in the current study the aeration intensity was approximately 2 m3 min 1 therefore the turbulence intensity generated in the treated pond would be much smaller than that in the aerated tank because the boundary in the tank was limited the turbulence intensity in the treated pond was in the same order of magnitude as the value in the tank treated by feng et al 42 this intensity was also similar to the 600 800 rpm treatment in the study conducted by li et al 20 which could disaggregate microcystis colonies within 30 min zhu et al 29 reported that disaggregation of microcystis occurred when the energy dissipation rate was 2 33 10 5 m3 s 2 which corresponded to an average wind speed of 5 00 m s 1 in a reservoir with 30 m depth thus turbulence caused by moving aeration in the current study can break up microcystis colonies in the second year of the present study the proportion of microcystis in the treated pond was lower than that in the control pond a similar trend was observed in the proportion of pseudoanabaena this result indicated that moving aeration reduced the proportion of other cyanobacterial genera in addition to microcystis however the proportion of scenedesmus was considerably increased by aeration in the second year he et al 2020 showed that microcystis was sensitive to turbulence while scenedesmus had a greater tolerance in a photobioreactor subjected to aeration based on a field investigation and a laboratorial experiment zhou et al 30 indicated that the diatom fragilaria became dominant when wind induced turbulence was applied with an energy dissipation rate of 2 95 10 5 m2 s 3 while microcystis was dominant without turbulence however thomas and gibson 31 showed that the relative sensitivities of phytoplankton to turbulence were ranked in the order of chlorophyta cyanobacteria bacillariophyta in addition xiao et al 32 reported that the specific growth rate of microcystis flos aquae increased when the energy dissipation rate of turbulence increased from 0 to 8 01 10 2 m2 s 3 overall these previous results imply that the species dependent sensitivity of phytoplankton to turbulence is not the only reason why chlorophyta and bacillariophyta are dominant when treated with turbulence the vertical redistribution of phytoplankton caused by the mixing is likely to be more important phytoplankton biodiversity indices have frequently been used to evaluate the degree of pollution in water bodies 33 36 in the present study there were no considerable differences in water quality between the control and treated ponds however all the phytoplankton biodiversity indices namely the simpson s diversity index pielou s evenness index and richness index were much higher in the treated pond than in the control pond in addition synedra has sometimes been used as an indicator of organic pollution 37 in the present study the proportion of synedra in the treated pond was much higher than in the control pond these results suggest that using phytoplankton and phytoplankton biodiversity indices as biological indicators does not work well when assessing water bodies with largely different hydrodynamic states in this study the moving aeration device consumed 6 kw h of electrical energy when working for 10 h per day according to the local electricity price the electricity cost of running the aeration device was approximately 400 us dollars per year the year round implementation could be adjusted so that the device is only implemented in the summer and fall to reduce the cost additionally it is feasible to reduce the working time by 2 h per day making such operation reductions could reduce the cost by 62 5 although aeration is a common water quality improvement technology cyanobacteria blooms still occur in many shallow lakes and ponds with fixed aeration systems 38 39 in the present study the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms was controlled by the moving aeration system changing fixed aeration devices to moving aeration devices would significantly decrease the number of aeration devices to get the same treatment effect in addition in the present study air was the only input substance used during the whole aeration process and no other chemicals were added although no direct data were obtained for microcystins during the aeration experiment it is inevitable that microcystin concentrations would decrease because of the considerable reduction in microcystis biomass therefore moving aeration can be used as an environmentally friendly method to control cyanobacterial blooms in shallow lakes and ponds and is thus worthy of widespread promotion 5 conclusion the results showed that despite no major changes in water quality cyanobacterial blooms almost disappeared from the shallow pond in the second year of moving aeration treatment in the second year of the experiment cyanobacteria was the dominant phylum in the control pond while chlorophyta and bacillariophyta were dominant in the aerated pond meanwhile microcystis was the dominant genus in the control pond while scenedesmus and pediastrum became dominant in the aerated pond microcystis colonies were also disaggregated by moving aeration the results suggested that moving aeration effectively controlled cyanobacterial blooms by disaggregating microcystis colonies and by shifting the phytoplankton community from cyanobacteria to chlorophyta and bacillariophyta declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

13497,the explosion in urban population are increasing burdens on water and energy systems which ultimately release harmful pollutants such as wastewater and toxic gases into the natural ecosystems in order to eliminate these pollutants the production of vehicular quality biodiesel along with the phycoremediation of wastewater using two different chlorella species chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana was investigated both the chlorella sp due to their stress tolerance behavior showed higher growth rate lipid content and biomass productivity when cultivated in wastewater than in control chlorella sorokiniana exhibited 19 14 higher lipids than chlorella minutissima when cultivated in wastewater the fatty acid methyl esters fames biodiesel profiling has shown the decrease in poly unsaturated fatty acids pufas with enhancement in saturated fatty acids sfas and oleic acid content the physical properties of biodiesel derived from chlorella sorokiniana exceeded the existing

carbon toc from wastewater the removal efficiency of toc was found to be 95 and 98 by chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana respectively overall chlorella sorokiniana grown in wastewater was found to be a better candidate for the biodiesel production together with phycoremediation of wastewater keywords phycoremediation wastewater lipid accumulation biodiesel chlorella 1 introduction industrial domestic and agricultural uses of water release many organic and inorganic substances in the environment leading to water pollution the presence of these nutrients in the water causes eutrophication and other harmful effects 1 these effects can be minimized by treating the wastewater before releasing into the environment generally primary and secondary treatments of wastewater help to remove the settleable materials and organic carbon 2 however wastewater also contains other nutrients e g nitrogen in the form of ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 etc phosphorous orthophosphates and inorganic carbon 3 which also need removal moreover the chemical based treatment technologies sometimes increase the amount of hazardous byproduct of treatment process and lead to secondary pollution for example removal of phosphorous from wastewater increases the amount of aluminum sludge which creates associated ecological problems if disposed off not safely moreover these technologies have shortcoming such as extensive maintenance high energy input and high operational costs 4 considering the status of wastewater generation in india 61 754 million liters per day of sewage is generated in urban areas only out of which nearly 65 of waste is untreated due to provision of limited treatment facilities 5 on the other hand north america produces about 85 km3 of wastewater each year out of which around 61 km3 is treated 6 in a long term prospective continued discharge of untreated wastewater and lack of efficient recycling technologies would affect the entire ecosystem hence there is an urge to develop advanced technologies which helps the environment while treating the wastewater considering these issues microalgae may be proposed as an option for the biological purification of municipal wastewater microalgae are especially attractive due to their photosynthetic abilities and capabilities to accumulate nutrients heavy metals pesticides organic and inorganic toxic substances from various waste streams 7 8 9 10 microalgae can utilize inorganic and organic form of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus for high productivity of their biomass 11 12 13 microalgae based treatment of wastewater seems as promising non toxic and the most effective alternative approach to replace conventional treatment techniques 9 besides wastewater treatment using microalgae may have other advantages over conventional wastewater treatment such as cost effectiveness low energy input minimum sludge formation and biomass production for value addition 9 14 the selection of appropriate algal species for a specific application plays an important role in achieving the desired goals 15 till date more than 1000 algal taxa have been described as wastewater tolerant strains a taxonomic study on algae revealed that the chlorophyta such as chlorella sp was dominant species in contrast to cyanophyta to treat waste streams with simultaneous production of valuable biomass 16 the highly tolerant genera consist of 8 green algae 5 blue greens algae and 6 diatoms the most tolerant genera were found to be chlorella oscillatoria chlamydomonas scenedesmus etc 17 18 the microalgae scenedesmus obliquus chlorococcum sp chlorella vulgaris parachlorella sp and scenedesmus quadricauda have been described as removing ammonium nitrates and phosphorus by 98 99 85 97 and 90 99 respectively from wastewater 19 besides removing the nutrients from the wastewater microalgae produce biomass having application in various sectors including biofuels 8 20 21 for example chlorella species have been reported to grow well with wastewater nutrients and produce high levels of lipids constituent for biodiesel production in their biomass 22 23 the literature related to algae derived biodiesel production with treatment of industrial wastewater is abundant 11 24 25 however the studies on application of algae based biodiesel grown in municipal wastewater discussion associated with its physical properties and its suitability as a transportation fuel are limited hence this investigation is conducted to examine the phycoremediation of municipal wastewater using two different microalgal species with the production of vehicular quality biodiesel the study has employed chlorella sp chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana due to their high nutrient removal efficiency photosynthetic activity growth rate and environmental stress tolerance behavior 26 27 28 29 30 the productivity in terms of biomass lipid carbohydrates and proteins in both the cells grown in wastewater were estimated and compared the assessment of functional groups found in the lipids samples derived from algal cells was determined by using fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy the profile of fatty acid methyl esters fames was analyzed through cg ms the physical properties of biodiesel were estimated to investigate the compliance of biodiesel produced from algal cells with existing fuel standards moreover the nutrient removal efficiency for both the cells were calculated and compared to identify the best suited species for wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana chlorella sp mcc27 and chlorella sp mcc33 were made available by iari new delhi india bold s basal media bbm media was used to cultivate both of the strains 31 chlorella species were inoculated in bbm as mentioned in katiyar et al 20 the cultivation conditions for algal strains were maintained as mentioned in barbera et al 32 all the chemicals

all data were expressed as the mean standard deviation sd 2 1 1 wastewater characteristics estimation wastewater was collected from chandreshwar nagar muni ki reti sewage pumping station rishikesh uttarakhand india wastewater was kept for settling in flask for two hours to remove large materials the presences of nitrogen element in form of ammonia nh4 nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn were examined by using nesslerization method 33 ultraviolet photospectrometric method 34 spectrophotometric method 35 and block digestion and flow digestion method 36 respectively the total phosphorus tp and ortho phosphorous op were estimated by using manual digestion flow digestion method 37 and stannous chloride method 38 respectively chemical oxygen demand cod was examined by colorimetric technique using cod digesters 39 and the total organic carbon toc present in the wastewater was determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc v other factors i e turbidity ph conductivity

algae grown in wastewater before cultivating algae into wastewater the wastewater was kept for settling in the flask for two hours to remove large materials wastewater was pretreated by passing whatman filter paper for removal of suspended particles two different flasks of 1 l capacity were then used for holding the 500 ml of wastewater each the inoculums 5 of both the strains was taken and inoculated in different wastewater flask the cultivation conditions required for growth of algal strains were maintained as mentioned in arora et al 40 optical densities od at 650 nm of cultures were

lipid and biomass productivity for both the chlorella sp grown in wastewater were examined and calculated 20 then the total lipid content from cells was investigated by using bligh and dyer method 41 followed by solvent s recovery 20 later the different functional groups of lipid samples derived from both the species of chlorella cultivated in wastewater were identified by using ftir analysis 42 43 for the protein content in biomass total nitrogen concentration was multiplied with a factor of 6 25 44 the elemental chns analyzer from thermo scientific was used to determine the concentration of tn to measure the total carbohydrates in both the algal strains the phenol sulphuric acid method was employed 45 2 1 3 estimation of removal efficiency of nutrients removal efficiency of nutrients was calculated after harvesting 12 days algal cells from wastewater the wastewater was then tested for total nitrogen tn tp tkn cod nh4 n and toc the total percentage of removal efficiency was measured by using subsequent expression removal efficiency p o p 1 p 0 100 where p0 is initial nutrient concentration of mg l 1 in waste water and p1 is the final nutrient concentration mg l 1 in waste water after growth of algae 2 1 4 fames characterization from the lipids trans esterification of the lipids from both the algal strains was performed with the addition of methanolic koh and samples were incubated at 60 c for 2 h finally with the help of a gc ms fames derived from both the strains were analyzed 20 43 2 1 5 evaluation of physical properties of biodiesel the physical properties determine the actual potential of a fuel to be used in vehicles the study used empirical formulae to determine the values of important physical properties for the biodiesel obtained from both the algal strains investigated in the study the physical properties that were estimated include saponification value sv cetane number cn cold filter plugging point cfpp long chain saturation factor iodine value iv degree of unsaturation du high heating value hhv and oxidative stability os afterwards the estimated physical properties were compared with existing fuel standards for determining the potential of biodiesel to be used as a fuel for vehicles 40 46 2 1 6 statistical analysis all the experiments were done in triplicates and test data are represented as average values mean standard deviation sd attained from triplicates determinations statistically significant differences among datasets were determined p 0 05 using a one way analysis of variance i e anova tukey s test the analysis was carried out by using minitab 17 minitab inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation of algae growth biomass productivity and lipid productivity the effect of wastewater on both the species of chlorella was explained by evaluating growth rates lipids and biomass productivity and total lipid accumulation in the cells the growth estimation was conducted for both the strains of algae in this study chlorella sorokiniana grew exponentially in wastewater while chlorella minutissima reported increase in cell growth in the initial 3 days followed by steady phase diauxic growth from 3rd to 5th day finally on the 10th day of growth cycle both the strains grown in wastewater were showing significant enhancement in biomass growth chlorella minutissima recorded higher growth rate μ 0 196 day 1 on 12th day when cultured in wastewater than in bbm 0 151 day 1 similarly the higher specific growth rate of chlorella sorokiniana was evident 0 269 day 1 on 12th day when grown in wastewater than in bbm 0 171 day 1 in between two species of chlorella grown in wastewater chlorella sorokiniana depicted higher specific growth rate than chlorella minutissima table 1 this result agrees with the work carried out by jebali et al 47 and sweiss 48 they described that strains of microalgae that adapt to wastewater have improved growth rate and exhibit a significant reduction in wastewater organic load scenedesmus sp also showed the specific growth rate in the range of 0 14 0 62 day 1 when cultivated in urban wastewater with different n p ratios 49 50 high specific growth rate in the cells leads to higher biomass productivity in the cells in wastewater the biomass productivity was calculated as 191 66 0 55 mg l 1 day 1 and 208 33 0 24 mg l 1 day 1 for chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana respectively table 2 the biomass productivity was greater in chlorella sorokiniana than in chlorella minutissima this enhanced growth rate and productivity of biomass for both the chlorella sp cultivated in the wastewater as compared to bbm may be the result of presence of high amount of toc 154 mg l 1 in the wastewater table 3 the presence of toc in wastewater results in mixotrophic growth pattern in algal species this type of growth pattern causes higher lipid accumulation and biomass productivity in algal cells 49 51 subsequently in this investigation the wastewater was found to be a better cultivation medium for cultivating both the chlorella sp as compared to bbm the lipid accumulation was estimated in early stationary phase after 12th day of growth period the lipid accumulated in chlorella minutissima 18 03 0 20 was higher when cells were cultivated in wastewater than in bbm 13 88 0 62 similarly the lipid content of chlorella sorokiniana 22 30 0 42 was enhanced when cultivated in wastewater than in bbm 19 74 0 45 the lipid productivity in chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana was measured 36 66 0 46 mg l 1 day 1 and 48 33 0 40 mg l 1 day 1 respectively table 2 the higher lipid accumulation in algal cells cultivated in wastewater can be attributed to the inadequate amount of nitrogen and phosphorous content found in the wastewater 52 53 hena et al 54 demonstrated that the lipid content of chlorella saccharophila and scenedesmus sp were 21 82 and 13 64 respectively when cultivated in wastewater from dairy farms shen et al 55 evaluated the municipal wastewater treatment using s obliquus reaching a productivity of 0 57 g l 1d 1 and the composition of the dry biomass exhibited 17 of lipids 19 of proteins and 64 of carbohydrates in between two species chlorella sorokiniana performed better in terms of lipid accumulation lipid and biomass productivity than chlorella minutissima this may be due to higher nutrient utilization in chlorella sorokiniana than chlorella minutissima table 3 causing an enhancement in growth rate biomass and total lipid content high nutrient utilization in mixotrophic growth causes increase in rubisco enzyme activity increase in large subunit accd and acc1 gene that causes nutrient limitation in the environment the deficiency of nutrients in the environment causes the algae cells to start lipid metabolism 56 earlier ji et al 57 has reported similar finding in terms of lipid content 19 26 in micratinium reisseri grown in municipal wastewater various studies on chlorella sp grown in waste steams have also exhibited the enhancement in total biomass and lipid productivity 18 58 59 3 2 characterization of wastewater and analysis of removal efficiency the components associated with the growth of algae include ph temperature and light intensity the ph of wastewater reduced after growth of both the strains chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana the reduction in ph table 3 may be due to the consumption of co2 by microalgae while temperature showed a bit increase in value in case of both the strains turbidity and conductivity of the wastewater culturing system decreased significantly during the growth of both the chlorella species table 3 the removal efficiencies for nh4 n no3 and tkn were estimated to be 98 6 0 40 38 65 0 22 and 27 75 0 25 respectively for chlorella minutissima whereas for chlorella sorokiniana these efficiencies were 97 65 0 31 34 4 014 and 40 80 0 20 respectively the tn removal rates for chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana were reported as 28 46 0 07 and 40 0 28 respectively p 0 05 during the growth both strains consumed nitrogen from wastewater in the form of ammonia assimilating it into amino groups for nitrogenous metabolism 66 for chlorella minutissima the tp and op removal rate was estimated as 12 75 0 21 and 44 25 0 12 whereas for chlorella sorokiniana it was calculated 21 0 01 and 58 55 0 05 respectively the n p ratio which is required for growth of algae should be maintained in between 6 8 and 10 the n p ratio was calculated 2 55 0 11 for wastewater on the first day before inoculation of algae after cultivation of chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana n p ratio was calculated 2 08 0 03 and 1 92 0 01 respectively the value of n p ratio below the critical value was indicating severe nitrogen limitation for algal growth which causes cells to accumulate more lipids or carbohydrates content under stress conditions 52 moreover the toc in wastewater was removed with removal efficiency of 95 0 21 and 97 7 0 30 by chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana respectively p 0 05 removal rates for cod were achieved at 61 69 0 21 and 72 17 0 31 for chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana respectively higher removal rate of toc by both the strains of chlorella indicate utilization of organic carbon from wastewater causing algae to grow mixotrophically mixotrophic growth leads to enhanced growth of algae than photoautotrophic growth 51 because in mixotrophic growth the energy is taken from organic and inorganic carbon for production of biomass while in case of autotrophic growth algae uses only inorganic carbon as source for production of biomass results of this study for the removal efficiencies of nutrients in the wastewater by using chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana were compared with nutrient removal efficiencies of other species of algae grown in different feed stocks table 2 marazzi et al 67 evaluated that dairy wastewater from whey processing characterized by high contents of cod and organic nitrogen allows the growth of scenedesmus acuminatus with percentages of nutrients removal being more than 65 collectively both the algal species removed tn tp toc and cod from wastewater in the range of efficiencies varying from 20 for tp to 98 for toc for the removal efficiencies of tn tp and toc chlorella sorokiniana also performed better than chlorella minutissima hence it can be stated that selection of an appropriate species is one of the crucial parameters for making the process efficient 3 3 carbohydrates and protein analysis both the strains chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana showed increase in their carbohydrate content when cultivated in wastewater as compared to bbm fig 1 the biomass of chlorella sorokiniana exhibited 9 40 increase in carbohydrates than in chlorella minutissima chlorella sorokiniana and chlorella minutissima in wastewater have also reported 16 22 and 20 73 more lipid content than in bbm respectively fig 1 moreover the total content of protein in chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana showed 28 93 and 48 78 decrease respectively when cultivated in wastewater than in bbm fig 1 hence the biochemical analyses of the strains grown in wastewater have shown decrease in total content of protein with augmentation in total carbohydrates and lipid accretion comparable outcomes have been explained in a study by kong et al 68 in which they described that the mixotrophic culture conditions for chlorella vulgaris caused enhancement in overall lipid content in the process carbon is partitioned in two competing pathways of carbohydrates and lipid metabolism while protein content shows significant decrease lipid content of both the strains was showing increase which would result into enhanced production of biodiesel also the increased carbohydrates content in case of both the strains may be used for other by products e g biobutanol or bioethanol 69 70 71 also the protein fraction of the cells can be utilized in feed industry or in agriculture as fertilizer 72 73 3 4 evaluation of lipids using ftir the examination of lipids or macromolecules using ftir spectroscopy is generally used for recognizing the arrangements and presence of various functional groups for example the triglycerides tags are the indicator molecules present in the lipid samples for biodiesel production 43 hence to examine the appropriateness of lipid samples for biodiesel production it should be rich in the bands showing tags as functional groups the ftir spectrum of lipids indicated the most prominent peak at 2925 cm 1 showing the symmetrical and asymmetrical extending vibration of methylene group for both the strains other peaks at 1261 cm 1 and at 1260 cm 1 were exhibiting the existence of co elongation and hence compatibility with tags standard for both the species chlorella sorokiniana and chlorella minutissima table 4 supplementary figs 1 2 3 the peaks at 1709 cm 1 for chlorella sorokiniana and 1745 cm 1 for chlorella minutissima were demonstrating the occurrence of ester carbonyl c o group of the triglycerides table 4 the ftir based bands or graphs of lipid samples from both the strains were compared with triolein tags standard and spectrum of tags obtained from olive oil and palm oil 42 3 5 gc ms profiling of fames analysis of fames profile is essential step for accessing the suitability of algal based oil for production of biodiesel the fames conversion efficiency w w of lipids was recorded 89 23 0 21 and 82 47 0 11 for chlorella sorokiniana and chlorella minutissima respectively the fames profile of both the species grown in wastewater showed the occurrence of c16 c20 chains of fatty acids table 5 the total saturated fatty acids sfa in chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana grown in wastewater were found to be 19 71 0 34 and 32 79 0 11 respectively table 5 p 0 05 chlorella sorokiniana and chlorella minutissima have revealed 29 55 and 23 3 higher sfas in fames respectively when cells were cultivated in wastewater than in bbm fig 2 chlorella sorokiniana grown in wastewater reported 39 89 higher amount of sfas in fames as compared to chlorella minutissima fig 2 high amount of sfas indicates higher cetane number which ensures the smooth run of the engine and makes a fuel appropriate for transportation vehicles 20 43 46 for both species grown in wastewater the amounts of unsaturated fatty acids ufas were higher in biodiesel resulting from chlorella minutissima than that in case of chlorella sorokiniana as a result the biodiesel obtained from chlorella minutissima can be useful in cold as well as warm climatic conditions 43 this has also been demonstrated in previous investigations where 77 and 23 of ufas and sfas 74 respectively have been achieved from chlorella vulgaris cultivated in dairy wastewater effluents 63 and 37 of ufas and sfas respectively 54 with a microalgae cyanobacteria consortium cultivated in dairy farm based wastewater 51 and 42 of ufas and sfas respectively 75 from scenedesmus ecornis using fertilizer plant wastewater the poly unsaturated fatty acids pufas content in biodiesel obtained from chlorella sorokiniana and chlorella minutissima was decreased by 41 12 and 21 2 respectively when cells were cultivated in the wastewater than in bbm fig 2 for cells grown in the wastewater the pufas content has shown 32 32 decrease for fames obtained from chlorella sorokiniana than that of chlorella minutissima table 5 the lower amount of pufas in biodiesel causes minimum polymerization vulnerability resulting in improved shelf life chlorella sorokiniana exhibited 39 61 high oleic acid content in fames when cultivated in wastewater than in bbm fig 2 the oleic acid content of biodiesel showed 44 68 increase when obtained from chlorella sorokiniana than chlorella minutissima table 5 presence of high oleic acid content in biodiesel makes it suitable for vehicle use 43 results of this study was compared well with those from the study by hasan 64 who also explained the occurrence of c14 c18 chains of fatty acids present in fames obtained from c debaryana at24 cultured in swine wastewater the fames analysis indicates the potential of chlorella sorokiniana for producing better quality biodiesel when compared to chlorella minutissima thus the above results show the potential of wastewater as an economical cultivation media than bbm for improving biodiesel quality from both species of chlorella furthermore chlorella sorokiniana was found to be more suitable candidate than chlorella minutissima for better quality biodiesel production 3 6 estimation of physical properties of biodiesel the analysis of physical properties for biodiesel is important before its use in transportation the physical parameters such as cn iv and cfpp define the suitability of biodiesel for vehicle use 76 the physical properties considerations of biodiesel obtained using chlorella sorokiniana complied with the fuel standards and also compared well with those of commercially used biodiesel derived from plants like jatropha and palm table 6 the physical properties of biodiesel formed from chlorella sorokiniana were more suited than that obtained from chlorella minutissima table 6 the data revealed the lower cfpp 6 22 c higher cn 47 and average os 3 43 h for biodiesel extracted from chlorella sorokiniana grown in wastewater the better performance of the engine and production of less harmful emissions can be ensured by these physical properties the physical properties of biodiesel gotten in this study were also comparable with algal based fuel derived from chlorella vulgaris 77 henceforth the biodiesel obtained from chlorella sorokiniana grown in wastewater is suitable for use in vehicles 4 conclusions present study investigates the capability of chlorella sp chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana for phycoremediation of municipal wastewater along with the biodiesel production both the species of chlorella have grown well in wastewater and showed higher growth rate lipid and biomass productivity and lipid accretion than in bbm control between the two species chlorella sorokiniana showed higher biomass productivity and lipid content than chlorella minutissima when grown in wastewater the data for physical parameters revealed better properties i e lower cfpp 6 22 c higher cn 47 and average os 3 43 h for biodiesel extracted from chlorella sorokiniana grown in

and cod from wastewater e g the toc removal efficiency from the wastewater was measured as 95 0 21 and 97 7 0 30 by chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana respectively among both the strains the removal efficiency of pollutants from wastewater was also found to be higher in case of chlorella sorokiniana than in chlorella minutissima hence chlorella sorokiniana can be considered as a suitable candidate for phycoremediation of wastewater coupled with the production of vehicular quality biodiesel in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

13497,the explosion in urban population are increasing burdens on water and energy systems which ultimately release harmful pollutants such as wastewater and toxic gases into the natural ecosystems in order to eliminate these pollutants the production of vehicular quality biodiesel along with the phycoremediation of wastewater using two different chlorella species chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana was investigated both the chlorella sp due to their stress tolerance behavior showed higher growth rate lipid content and biomass productivity when cultivated in wastewater than

found to be a better candidate for the biodiesel production together with phycoremediation of wastewater keywords phycoremediation wastewater lipid accumulation biodiesel chlorella 1 introduction industrial domestic and agricultural uses of water release many organic and inorganic substances in the environment leading to water pollution the presence of these nutrients in the water causes eutrophication and other harmful effects 1 these effects can be minimized by treating the wastewater before releasing into the environment generally primary and secondary treatments of wastewater help to remove the settleable materials and organic carbon 2 however wastewater also contains other nutrients e g nitrogen in the form of ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 etc phosphorous orthophosphates and inorganic carbon 3 which also need removal moreover the chemical based treatment technologies sometimes increase the amount of hazardous byproduct of treatment process and lead to secondary pollution for example removal of phosphorous from wastewater increases the amount of aluminum sludge which creates associated ecological problems if disposed off not safely moreover these technologies have shortcoming such as extensive maintenance high energy input and high operational costs 4 considering the status of wastewater generation in india 61 754 million liters per day of sewage is generated in urban areas only out of which nearly 65 of waste is untreated due to provision of limited treatment facilities 5 on the other hand north america produces about 85 km3 of wastewater each year out of which around 61 km3 is treated 6 in a long term prospective continued discharge of untreated wastewater and lack of efficient recycling technologies would affect the entire ecosystem hence there is an urge to develop advanced technologies which helps the environment while treating the wastewater considering these issues microalgae may be proposed as an option for the biological purification of municipal wastewater microalgae are especially attractive due to their photosynthetic abilities and capabilities to accumulate nutrients heavy metals pesticides organic and inorganic toxic substances from various waste streams 7 8 9 10 microalgae can utilize inorganic and organic form of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus for high productivity of their biomass 11 12 13 microalgae based treatment of wastewater seems as promising non toxic and the most effective alternative approach to replace conventional treatment techniques 9 besides wastewater treatment using microalgae may have other advantages over conventional wastewater treatment such as cost effectiveness low energy input minimum sludge formation and biomass production for value addition 9 14 the selection of appropriate algal species for a specific application plays an important role in achieving the desired goals 15 till date more than 1000 algal taxa have been described as wastewater tolerant strains a taxonomic study on algae revealed that the chlorophyta such as chlorella sp was dominant species in contrast to cyanophyta to treat waste streams with simultaneous production of valuable biomass 16 the highly tolerant genera consist of 8 green algae 5 blue greens algae and 6 diatoms the most tolerant genera were found to be chlorella oscillatoria chlamydomonas scenedesmus etc 17 18 the microalgae scenedesmus obliquus chlorococcum sp chlorella vulgaris parachlorella sp and scenedesmus quadricauda have been described as removing ammonium nitrates and phosphorus by 98 99 85 97 and 90 99 respectively from wastewater 19 besides removing the nutrients from the wastewater microalgae produce biomass having application in various sectors including biofuels 8 20 21 for example chlorella species have been reported to grow well with wastewater nutrients and produce high levels of lipids constituent for biodiesel production in their biomass 22 23 the literature related to algae derived biodiesel production with treatment of industrial wastewater is abundant 11 24 25 however the studies on application of algae based biodiesel grown in municipal wastewater discussion associated with its physical properties and its suitability as a transportation fuel are limited hence this investigation is conducted to examine the phycoremediation of municipal wastewater using two different microalgal species with the production of vehicular quality biodiesel the study has employed chlorella sp chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana due to their high nutrient removal efficiency photosynthetic activity growth rate and environmental stress tolerance behavior 26 27 28 29 30 the productivity in terms of biomass lipid carbohydrates and proteins in both the cells grown in wastewater were estimated and compared the assessment of functional groups found in the lipids samples derived from algal cells was determined by using fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy the profile of fatty acid methyl esters fames was analyzed through cg ms the physical properties of biodiesel were estimated to investigate the compliance of biodiesel produced from algal cells with existing fuel standards moreover the nutrient removal efficiency for both the cells were calculated and compared to identify the best suited species for wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods

total phosphorus tp and ortho phosphorous op were estimated by using manual digestion flow digestion method 37 and stannous chloride method 38 respectively chemical oxygen demand cod was examined by colorimetric technique using cod digesters 39 and the total organic carbon toc present in the wastewater was determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc v other factors i e turbidity ph conductivity and temperature were measured by using turbidimeter ph meter conductivity meter and thermometer respectively 2 1 2 cultivation and assessment of total lipids protein and carbohydrates content from algae grown in wastewater before cultivating algae into wastewater the wastewater was kept for settling in the flask for two hours to remove large materials wastewater was pretreated by passing whatman filter paper for removal of suspended particles two different flasks of 1 l capacity were then used for holding the 500 ml of wastewater each the inoculums 5 of both the strains was taken and inoculated in different wastewater flask the cultivation conditions required for growth of algal strains were maintained as mentioned in arora et al 40 optical densities od at 650 nm of cultures were determined on every second day using spectrophotometer hach dr 500 both the species of chlorella were investigated for 12 days of cultivation period for both the species the specific growth rates μ lipid and biomass productivity for both the chlorella sp grown in wastewater were examined and calculated 20 then the total lipid content from cells was investigated by using bligh and dyer method 41 followed by solvent s recovery 20 later the different functional groups of lipid samples derived from both the species of chlorella cultivated in wastewater were identified by using ftir analysis 42 43 for the protein content in biomass total nitrogen concentration was multiplied with a factor of 6 25 44 the elemental chns analyzer from thermo scientific was used to determine the concentration of tn to measure the total carbohydrates in both the algal strains the phenol sulphuric acid method was employed 45 2 1 3 estimation of removal efficiency of nutrients removal efficiency of nutrients was

species of chlorella was explained by evaluating growth rates lipids and biomass productivity and total lipid accumulation in the cells the growth estimation was conducted for both the strains of algae in this study chlorella sorokiniana grew exponentially in wastewater while chlorella minutissima reported increase in cell growth in the initial 3 days followed by steady phase diauxic growth from 3rd to 5th day finally on the 10th day of growth cycle both the strains grown in wastewater were showing significant enhancement in biomass growth chlorella minutissima recorded higher growth rate μ 0 196 day 1 on 12th day when cultured in wastewater than in bbm 0 151 day 1 similarly the higher specific growth rate of chlorella sorokiniana was evident 0 269 day 1 on 12th day when grown in wastewater than in bbm 0 171 day 1 in between two species of chlorella grown in wastewater chlorella sorokiniana depicted higher specific growth rate than chlorella minutissima table 1 this result agrees with the work carried out by jebali et al 47 and sweiss 48 they described that strains of microalgae that adapt to wastewater have improved growth rate and exhibit a significant reduction in wastewater organic load scenedesmus sp also showed the specific growth rate in the range of 0 14 0 62 day 1 when cultivated in urban wastewater with different n p ratios 49 50 high specific growth rate in the cells leads to higher biomass productivity in the cells in wastewater the biomass productivity was calculated as 191 66 0 55 mg l 1 day 1 and 208 33 0 24 mg l 1 day 1 for chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana respectively table 2 the biomass productivity was greater in chlorella sorokiniana than in chlorella minutissima this enhanced growth rate and productivity of biomass for both the chlorella sp cultivated in the wastewater as compared to bbm may be the result of presence of high amount of toc 154 mg l 1 in the wastewater table 3 the presence of toc in wastewater results in mixotrophic growth pattern in algal species this type of growth pattern causes higher lipid accumulation and biomass productivity in algal cells 49 51 subsequently in this investigation the wastewater was found to be a better cultivation medium for cultivating both the chlorella sp as compared to bbm the lipid accumulation was estimated in early stationary phase after 12th day of growth period the lipid accumulated in chlorella minutissima 18 03 0 20 was higher when cells were cultivated in wastewater than in bbm 13 88 0 62 similarly the lipid content of chlorella sorokiniana 22 30 0 42 was enhanced when cultivated in wastewater than in bbm 19 74 0 45 the lipid productivity in chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana was measured 36 66 0 46 mg l 1 day 1 and 48 33 0 40 mg l 1 day 1 respectively table 2 the higher lipid accumulation in algal cells cultivated in wastewater can be attributed to the inadequate amount of nitrogen and phosphorous content found in the wastewater 52 53 hena et al 54 demonstrated that the lipid content of chlorella saccharophila and scenedesmus sp were 21 82 and 13 64 respectively when cultivated in wastewater from dairy farms shen et al 55 evaluated the municipal wastewater treatment using s obliquus reaching a productivity of 0 57 g l 1d 1 and the composition of the dry biomass exhibited 17 of lipids 19 of proteins and 64 of carbohydrates in between two species chlorella sorokiniana performed better in terms of lipid accumulation lipid and biomass productivity than chlorella minutissima this may be due to higher nutrient utilization in chlorella sorokiniana than chlorella minutissima table 3 causing an enhancement in growth rate biomass and total lipid content high nutrient utilization in mixotrophic growth causes increase in rubisco enzyme activity increase in large subunit accd and acc1 gene that causes nutrient limitation in the environment the deficiency of nutrients in the environment causes the algae cells to start lipid metabolism 56 earlier ji et al 57 has reported similar finding in terms of lipid content 19 26 in micratinium reisseri grown in municipal wastewater various studies on chlorella sp grown in waste steams have also exhibited the enhancement in total biomass and lipid productivity 18 58 59 3 2 characterization of wastewater and analysis of removal efficiency the components associated with the growth of algae include ph temperature and light intensity the ph of wastewater reduced after growth of both the strains chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana the reduction in ph table 3 may be due to the consumption of co2 by microalgae while temperature showed a bit increase in value in case of both the strains turbidity and conductivity of the wastewater culturing system decreased significantly during the growth of both the chlorella species table 3 the removal efficiencies for nh4 n no3 and tkn were estimated to be 98 6 0 40 38 65 0 22 and 27 75 0 25 respectively for chlorella minutissima whereas for chlorella sorokiniana these efficiencies were 97 65 0 31 34 4 014 and 40 80 0 20 respectively the tn removal rates for chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana were reported as 28 46 0 07 and 40 0 28 respectively p 0 05 during the growth both strains consumed nitrogen from wastewater in the form of ammonia assimilating it into amino groups for nitrogenous metabolism 66 for chlorella minutissima the tp and op removal rate was estimated as 12 75 0 21 and 44 25 0 12 whereas for chlorella sorokiniana it was calculated 21 0 01 and 58 55 0 05 respectively the n p ratio which is required for growth of algae should be maintained in between 6 8 and 10 the n p ratio was calculated 2 55 0 11 for wastewater on the first day before inoculation of algae after cultivation of chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana n p ratio was calculated 2 08 0 03 and 1 92 0 01 respectively the value of n p ratio below the critical value was indicating severe nitrogen limitation for algal growth which causes cells to accumulate more lipids or carbohydrates content under stress conditions 52 moreover the toc in wastewater was removed with removal efficiency of 95 0 21 and 97 7 0 30 by chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana respectively p 0 05 removal rates for cod were achieved at 61 69 0 21 and 72 17 0 31 for chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana respectively higher removal rate of toc by both the strains of chlorella indicate utilization of organic carbon from wastewater causing algae to grow mixotrophically mixotrophic growth leads to enhanced growth of algae than photoautotrophic growth 51 because in mixotrophic growth the energy is taken from organic and inorganic carbon for production of biomass while in case of autotrophic growth algae uses only inorganic carbon as source for production of biomass results of this study for the removal efficiencies of nutrients in the wastewater by using chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana were compared with nutrient removal efficiencies of other species of algae grown in different feed stocks table 2 marazzi et al 67 evaluated that dairy wastewater from whey processing characterized by high contents of cod and organic nitrogen allows the growth of scenedesmus acuminatus with percentages of nutrients removal being more than 65 collectively both the algal species removed tn tp toc and cod from wastewater in the range of efficiencies varying from 20 for tp to 98 for toc for the removal efficiencies of tn tp and toc chlorella sorokiniana also performed better than chlorella minutissima hence it can be stated that selection of an appropriate species is one of the crucial parameters for making the process efficient 3 3 carbohydrates and protein analysis both the strains chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana showed increase in their carbohydrate content when cultivated in wastewater as compared to bbm fig 1 the biomass of chlorella sorokiniana exhibited 9 40 increase in carbohydrates than in chlorella minutissima chlorella sorokiniana and chlorella minutissima in wastewater have also reported 16 22 and 20 73 more lipid content than in bbm respectively fig 1 moreover the total content of protein in chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana showed 28 93 and 48 78 decrease respectively when cultivated in wastewater than in bbm fig 1 hence the biochemical analyses of the strains grown in wastewater have shown decrease in total content of protein with augmentation in total carbohydrates and lipid accretion comparable outcomes have been explained in a study by kong et al 68 in which they described that the mixotrophic culture conditions for chlorella vulgaris caused enhancement in overall lipid content in the process carbon is partitioned in two competing pathways of carbohydrates and lipid metabolism while protein content shows significant decrease lipid content of both the strains was showing increase which would result into enhanced production of biodiesel also the increased carbohydrates content in case of both the strains may be used for other by products e g biobutanol or bioethanol 69 70 71 also the protein fraction of the cells can be utilized in feed industry or in agriculture as fertilizer 72 73 3 4 evaluation of lipids using ftir the examination of lipids or macromolecules using ftir spectroscopy is generally used for recognizing the arrangements and presence of various functional groups for example the triglycerides tags are the indicator molecules present in the lipid samples for biodiesel production 43 hence to examine the appropriateness of lipid samples for biodiesel production it should be rich in the bands showing tags as functional groups the ftir spectrum of lipids indicated the most prominent peak at 2925 cm 1 showing the symmetrical and asymmetrical extending vibration of methylene group for both the strains other peaks at 1261 cm 1 and at 1260 cm 1 were exhibiting the existence of co elongation and hence compatibility with tags standard for both the species chlorella sorokiniana and chlorella minutissima table 4 supplementary figs 1 2 3 the peaks at 1709 cm 1 for chlorella sorokiniana and 1745 cm 1 for chlorella minutissima were demonstrating the occurrence of ester carbonyl c o group of the triglycerides table 4 the ftir based bands or graphs of lipid samples from both the strains were compared with triolein tags standard and spectrum of tags obtained from olive oil and palm oil 42 3 5 gc ms profiling of fames analysis of fames profile is essential step for accessing the suitability of algal based oil for production of biodiesel the fames conversion efficiency w w of lipids was recorded 89 23 0 21 and 82 47 0 11 for chlorella sorokiniana and chlorella minutissima respectively the fames profile of both the species grown in wastewater showed the occurrence of c16 c20 chains of fatty acids table 5 the total saturated fatty acids sfa in chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana grown in wastewater were found to be 19 71 0 34 and 32 79 0 11 respectively table 5 p 0 05 chlorella sorokiniana and chlorella minutissima have revealed 29 55 and 23 3 higher sfas in fames respectively when cells were cultivated in wastewater than in bbm fig 2 chlorella sorokiniana grown in wastewater reported 39 89 higher amount of sfas in fames as compared to chlorella minutissima fig 2 high amount of sfas indicates higher cetane number which ensures the smooth run of the engine and makes a fuel appropriate for transportation vehicles 20 43 46 for both species grown in wastewater the amounts of unsaturated fatty acids ufas were higher in biodiesel resulting from chlorella minutissima than that in case of chlorella sorokiniana as a result the biodiesel obtained from chlorella minutissima can be useful in cold as well as warm climatic conditions 43 this has also been demonstrated in previous investigations where 77 and 23 of ufas and sfas 74 respectively have been achieved from chlorella vulgaris cultivated in dairy wastewater effluents 63 and 37 of ufas and sfas respectively 54 with a microalgae cyanobacteria consortium cultivated in dairy farm based wastewater 51 and 42 of ufas and sfas respectively 75 from scenedesmus ecornis using fertilizer plant wastewater the poly unsaturated fatty acids pufas content in biodiesel obtained from chlorella sorokiniana and chlorella minutissima was decreased by 41 12 and 21 2 respectively when cells were cultivated in the wastewater than in bbm fig 2 for cells grown in the wastewater the pufas content has shown 32 32 decrease for fames obtained from chlorella sorokiniana than that of chlorella minutissima table 5 the lower amount of pufas in biodiesel causes minimum polymerization vulnerability resulting in improved shelf life chlorella sorokiniana exhibited 39 61 high oleic acid content in fames when cultivated in wastewater than in bbm fig 2 the oleic acid content of biodiesel showed 44 68 increase when obtained from chlorella sorokiniana than chlorella minutissima table 5 presence of high oleic acid content in biodiesel makes it suitable for vehicle use 43 results of this study was compared well with those from the study by hasan 64 who also explained the occurrence of c14 c18 chains of fatty acids present in fames obtained from c debaryana at24 cultured in swine wastewater the fames analysis indicates the potential of chlorella sorokiniana for producing better quality biodiesel when compared to chlorella minutissima thus the above results show the potential of wastewater as an economical cultivation media than bbm for improving biodiesel quality from both species of chlorella furthermore chlorella sorokiniana was found to be more suitable candidate than chlorella minutissima for better quality biodiesel production 3 6 estimation of physical properties of biodiesel the analysis of physical properties for biodiesel is important before its use in transportation the physical parameters such as cn iv and cfpp define the suitability of biodiesel for vehicle use 76 the physical properties considerations of biodiesel obtained using chlorella sorokiniana complied with the fuel standards and also compared well with those of commercially used biodiesel derived from plants like jatropha and palm table 6 the physical properties of biodiesel formed from chlorella sorokiniana were more suited than that obtained from chlorella minutissima table 6 the data revealed the lower cfpp 6 22 c higher cn 47 and average os 3 43 h for biodiesel extracted from chlorella sorokiniana grown in wastewater the better performance of the engine and production of less harmful emissions can be ensured by these physical properties the physical properties of biodiesel gotten in this study were also comparable with algal based fuel derived from chlorella vulgaris 77 henceforth the biodiesel obtained from chlorella sorokiniana grown in wastewater is suitable for use in vehicles 4 conclusions present study investigates the capability of chlorella sp chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana for phycoremediation of municipal wastewater along with the biodiesel production both the species of chlorella have grown well in wastewater and showed higher growth rate lipid and biomass productivity and lipid accretion than in bbm control between the two species chlorella sorokiniana showed higher biomass productivity and lipid content than chlorella minutissima when grown in wastewater the data for physical parameters revealed better properties i e lower cfpp 6 22 c higher cn 47 and average os 3 43 h for biodiesel extracted from chlorella sorokiniana grown in wastewater these physical properties were also within permissible range of the vehicular fuel standards astm and eu simultaneously both the chlorella species have also significantly removed tp tn toc and cod from wastewater e g the toc removal efficiency from the wastewater was measured as 95 0 21 and 97 7 0 30 by chlorella minutissima and chlorella sorokiniana respectively among both the strains the removal efficiency of pollutants from wastewater was also found to be higher in case of chlorella sorokiniana than in chlorella minutissima hence chlorella sorokiniana can be considered as a suitable candidate for phycoremediation of wastewater coupled with the production of vehicular quality biodiesel in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

13498,a single level biological aerated filter baf was used to treat domestic wastewater the response surface method rsm model was applied to optimize the operating parameters such as hydraulic retention time hrt reflux ratio r and aeration stop ratio the characteristics of the wastewater were analyzed the results showed the average removal efficiencies for cod tn and nh4 n were 87 77 75 41 and 87 28 for a cod n ratio of 3 44 under the rsm optimized conditions of hrt 7 h r 105 and aeration stop ratio of 1 1 the environment was favorable for enhanced denitrification in the 30 70 cm section the proportion of proteobacteria showed a valley pattern along the range direction while planctomycetes and nitrospirae were gradually increasing the microorganisms involved in denitrification were more abundant at the phylum level notably proteobacteria 22 87 47 56 planctomycetes 6 62 10 68 nitrospirae 0 79 3 02 and denitrifying bacteria were also evident at the genus level i e flavobacterium 0 21 1 43 the baf system with internal reflux coupled intermittent aeration enhances nitrification and denitrification thereby facilitating nitrogen removal keywords aerated biological filter response surface method nitrogen removal performance microbial community structure domestic wastewater 1 introduction biological aerated filtering is a biofilm treatment process that integrates oxidative biodegradation and physical retention of filter media it is characterized by strong resistance to impact loading a lower susceptibility to sludge expansion and easy management 1 3 in such systems cod and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n have a high removal efficiency 4 5 however after the conversion of nh4 n to nitrate nitrogen no3 n in the reactor along the water flow direction the resulting oxygen rich and organic matter deprived environment restricts denitrification resulting in a low total nitrogen removal efficiency 2 to support nitrogen removal the two stage aeration biofilter with nitrification and denitrification is generally used 6 however in recent years studies have shown that the addition of internal reflux in a single level aeration biofilter can achieve a nitrogen removal effect similar to that of a two stage aeration biofilter i e by optimizing the operation mode of the single level baf enhanced nitrogen removal can be achieved on the basis of saving engineering investment and operating costs 7 this is of great significance for the application of baf in decentralized domestic wastewater treatment with large fluctuations in water volume and quality compared to the traditional activated sludge processes such as anaerobic anoxic oxic oxidation ditch etc it is difficult to zone the environmental conditions of microbial carriers in the reactor space if continuous aeration is adjusted to intermittent aeration the partitioning of environmental conditions along time can be achieved in the baf to improve nitrogen removal 7 however this may affect the efficiency of the system for cod and nh4 n treatment 8 in addition factors such as hydraulic residence time or reflux ratio can also adversely affect nitrogen removal efficiency 9 10 and different operating conditions can have a cross effect on the final treatment effect 11 in this sense the identification of the key controlling parameters of single level baf for enhanced denitrification and optimal control of the reactor operation are practical problems to be solved when baf is applied in the treatment of domestic wastewater the response surface method rsm is applied to optimize experimental conditions it uses multiple quadratic regression equations to fit the functional relationship between factors and the response quantity and then evaluates the factors and their interactions through experimental design mathematical modeling and model testing to obtain the predicted optimized response quantity and the optimized experimental conditions 12 the membrane bioreactor mbr using the rsm method to optimize the influent carbon to nitrogen ratio cod n alternating aerobic strict cycles and aeration volume has been developed to obtain the best operating parameters and the validity and applicability of the model have been verified 13 mirghorayshi et al 14 investigated the removal of carbon and nitrogen from compost filtrate by mixed gas lift using three independent variables as operating parameters to evaluate reactor performance determine the optimal operating conditions for high cod and total nitrogen tn removal rates and verify the validity of the rsm model these studies show that rsm has the advantages of high accuracy reliable prediction results and multiple analysis dimensions making it suitable for optimizing process conditions that are influenced by multiple factors in the water treatment process in this study we used a single level baf plant to treat domestic wastewater based on the experimental results from the single factor operating conditions the response surface method was used to optimize the baf operating parameters and verify the optimized results with the removal efficiency of cod tn and nh4 n as the constraint via analysis of dissolved oxygen do variation and microbial population characteristics the microbial response characteristics of the single stage baf operation parameters optimized to enhance nitrogen removal efficiency were identified with the aim to provide technical guidance for the practical application of baf in the decentralized treatment of domestic wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental devices the experimental device is shown in fig 1 the baf reactor was cylindrical and made of polyvinyl chloride with an inner diameter of 15 cm an outer diameter of 25 cm and an overall height of 240 cm the bottom was a uniform water distribution zone 20 cm high the top was a lining layer 30 cm high and 1 4 cm pebbles were spread on a uniform water distribution plate with an perforated aeration tube aperture 4 mm the physical parameters of the ceramic filler were as follows particle size 0 3 0 5 cm bulk density 0 7 1 0 g cm3 porosity greater than 30 seven sampling ports of 8 mm in diameter were set at 20 cm intervals along the filling layer height to collect water samples and biological filler samples for analysis the top was hydrostatic the height of the zones was 50 cm the zones were connected by flanges the baf hydrostatic zone contained a nitrifying liquid return pipeline connected to the bottom water distribution zone the effluent circulated internally through the return pipe an aeration device was installed outside the reactor to control the aeration volume and the cycle of the air compressor 800 w 30 l ots china with a gas flow meter lzb 3w kede china and a time control switch kg316t chnt china 2 2 experimental water quality the experimental water was taken from the conditioning pool water of a university sewage treatment station to prevent the large impurities from blocking the filter the original water in the tank was allowed to sediment for 1 h and the upper water layer was used for the experiment the specific water quality characteristics are shown in table 1 2 3 test methods 2 3 1 reactor startup we adopted the rapid sludge discharge method to initiate the baf hanging film 15 the inoculation sludge was obtained from the activated sludge with good activity from a university wastewater treatment plant in xi an shaanxi province the activated sludge mixture was pumped into the filter tank with a peristaltic pump yz1515x chuangrui tech co china from bottom to top and the amount of sludge added was based on flooding the top surface of the ceramic filler layer the remaining part was filled with raw water after 7 h of aeration at 30 l h and 1 h of static sedimentation the supernatant was discharged and domestic sewage was added to the original height after 5 d of continuous aeration the water with a small flow rate was divided into four stages to gradually increase the inlet water flow to the design flow each stage of continuous operation lasted for 7 d 2 3 2 single factor optimization experiments in this study the operating conditions were determined before the single factor test the main operating parameters were hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 h a gas to water ratio of 6 1 aeration stop aeration cycle of 1 h temperature control of the entire reactor at 22 2 c the backwashing process was as follows gas washing for 2 5 min mixed gas to water washing for 4 6 min water washing for 8 10 min washing intensity of 8 16 l m3 s backwashing cycle of 4 d three factors a hrt b r and c aeration stop time ratio affecting baf nitrogen removal were selected for single factor experiments to determine the optimal single factor conditions for long term operation table 2 shows the experimental design 2 3 3 response surface optimization experiments based on single factor experiments the range of rsm experimental design parameters can be initially determined and the three factor three level experimental design can be carried out using the box behnken bbd model based on rsm the experimental factor and level designs are shown in table 3 2 4 analysis methods 2 4 1 water quality water samples entering and exiting the system were filtered daily using a 0 45 μm filter membrane sigma aldrich canada and tested according to the standard method the cod was determined by the rapid digestion of potassium dichromate 5b 1f lianhua tech co china we used an ultraviolet spectrophotometer dr6000 haca usa for the determination of nh4 n no3 n and tn respectively the do and temperature were determined using a portable dissolved oxygen meter hqd30 hach usa 2 4 2 sem observation the bio pellets were rinsed three times with water to remove surface impurities before after mounting to fix the surface microorganisms after mounting the samples were immersed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde ph 7 4 for 2 h and processed according to conventional electron microscopy 16 subsequently the samples were blow dried and sprayed with gold followed by observation through an sem jsm 5600lv tokyo japan 2 4 3 high throughput sequencing microbial diversity and community structure along the route of the baf system were investigated via 16s rrna high throughput sequencing for this samples were taken from the biofilter of the baf reactor after continuous operation under optimal conditions bacterial dna was extracted as described elsewhere 17 the primers 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc were used for pcr amplification of 16s rrna sequences in the v3 v4 high variable region 18 the bacterial dna samples were sequenced using the miseq pe300 shanghai sangon biological co ltd china platform the original data were been uploaded to the sequence read archive database the login was srp298082 3 results and discussion 3 1 baf film startup as shown in fig 2 the influent cod and nh4 n concentrations in the startup phase fluctuated from 179 18 to 275 94 mg l and 35 45 to 53 40 mg l respectively and the average removal rate increased with the shortening of the hrt the average removal rates for cod and nh4 n were 39 03 and 11 28 respectively in the sullen exposure phase the average effluent concentrations of cod and nh4 n were 139 25 and 38 58 mg l respectively when the hrt was gradually reduced to 4 h the average removal rates for cod and nh4 n increased to 75 13 and 79 01 respectively with average effluent concentrations of cod and nh4 n of 54 13 and 9 47 mg l after the above start up phase the system was highly effective in removing cod and nh4 n from the water after 32 d of continuous operation of the baf reactor the average cod and nh4 n removal rates were above 75 a thick brown viscous matter could be observed on the filler surface as shown in fig 1 b and c the surface of the pre mounted film as rough with a large number of cocci and bacilli growing on the carrier surface the biofilm was mature and the start of the system mounting was completed 19 3 2 single factor impacts on baf denitrification to identify the influences of operating parameters on the nitrogen removal effect during the stable operation of the baf system the operating parameters hrt r and aeration stop ratio were adjusted sequentially to optimize nitrogen removal based on maintaining the average cod removal rate above 85 00 the changes in tn nh4 n and no3 n in the influent and effluent at each stage are shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 a the nh4 n removal rate gradually increased with the increase of the hrt from an average of 67 99 to 88 92 when the hrt increased the wastewater remained in the system for a longer time which was conducive to nitrification by nitrifying bacteria 20 from the perspective of changing the survival conditions of bacteria nitrifying bacteria are typically autotrophic and the removal of nh4 n in the baf system mainly relies on the biological oxidation of nitrification inhibitors increasing the hrt can lead to the rapid growth of autotrophic bacteria and promote the growth of nitrifying bacteria this is agreement with tao et al 21 who found that when the hrt was reduced from 5 2 to 3 5 and 2 6 h the organic load of u pabf is increased and inhibited the proliferation rate of auto oxidizing nitrifying bacteria leading to a decrease in the nh4 n removal rate as shown in fig 3 b the average tn removal rates were 34 33 42 93 44 27 44 10 and 38 99 respectively the overall removal rate of tn was low and the effect was not obvious with the fluctuation of the hrt as seen in fig 3 c the average inlet concentration of no3 n was 0 41 mg l and the average outlet concentration of no3 n was 17 66 mg l over 150 d of continuous operation of the baf with an increase in hrt from 2 to 10 h the average outlet concentrations of no3 n were 13 05 17 25 15 63 15 63 15 63 and 17 66 mg l respectively denitrification in the system was low which explains the low tn removal 22 an hrt of 6 h resulted in optimal reactor operation regarding nitrogen removal and energy consumption based on this hrt internal reflux was further added to optimize the nitrogen removal performance of the baf as shown in fig 3 d the average removal rate for nh4 n under different r conditions was stable at values above 80 and the average effluent concentration of nh4 n was 6 81 mg l the nitrifying bacteria in the system had a strong metabolic rate facilitating nh4 n removal therefore under the condition that nitrification is up to standard the effect of nitrogen removal in the system mainly depends on denitrification 19 as shown in fig 3 e with the gradual increase in the reflux ratio from r 50 to r 100 the average tn removal rate of the baf increased to 60 44 and 65 98 and the average tn concentration of the effluent was 35 35 and 26 07 mg l the tn removal effect had a more obvious optimization effect reflux can promote the denitrification of the system and effectively remove tn from the effluent further no3 n is converted to n2 which in turn enhances the removal of tn this is in agreement with a previous study showing that increased reflux in baf reactors enhances the transfer of microorganisms and pollutants 23 with the further increase of the reflux ratio to 200 the average tn removal rates of the baf were 62 81 and 45 62 and the average effluent tn concentrations were 24 62 and 25 58 mg l indicating a decreased tn removal when the reflux ratio was below 100 the tn concentration in the effluent increased significantly because of the high do content in the reflux nitrifying solution resulting in a significant decrease in the do concentration gradient inside and outside the biofilm consequently this impeded the retransformation of no3 n from denitrification thus making it difficult for baf to achieve a good nitrogen removal effect also as shown in fig 3 f the average effluent no3 n concentrations were 16 33 12 42 12 85 12 27 and 24 49 mg l when the reflux ratio increased from 50 to 200 this indicates that the reflux of certain nitrifying liquid increased the denitrification activity which in turn promotes nitrogen removal however in our study the main cause for this phenomenon may be the delivery of no3 n to the bottom of the baf through internal circulation along with sufficient cod in the feed water through the action of biofilm snd denitrification can be enhanced and the tn removal rate can be improved 24 therefore nitrogen removal of the system is significantly improved with a maximum efficiency at r 100 to further optimize the nitrogen removal performance of the baf continuous aeration was adjusted to intermittent aeration under the above optimal conditions as shown in fig 3 g for aeration stop ratios of 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 the average nh4 n removal rates were 83 32 76 83 and 86 31 and the average concentrations of effluent nh4 n were 7 88 11 08 and 6 55 mg l although the average nh4 n removal rate increases 25 the removal of nh4 n under intermittent aeration was not as good as that under continuous aeration this is because intermittent aeration reduces the oxygen supply and affects the nitrification of the system which is consistent with the findings of rahimi et al 26 where do was the main factor limiting nitrification here nitrification under intermittent aeration can also be optimized by increasing the oxygen supply during the aeration stage as shown in fig 3 h the average tn removal rates were 73 01 60 25 and 62 44 for the three different aeration ratios compared with the tn removal effect under continuous aeration the effect of aeration stop ratio on baf tn removal was more significant the above phenomena may be due to the transport of no3 n to the bottom of the system through the internal reflux but also to the high level of organic matter in the influent providing growth substrate for denitrifying bacteria the aeration stop ratio of 1 1 had the best effect on tn removal it can be seen that the suitable aeration stopping time ratio is conducive to the smooth nitrification and denitrification of the system which in turn optimizes the denitrification effect of the system for all three ratios based on fig 3 i the average no3 n effluent concentrations were 9 13 8 94 and 14 96 mg l as indicated by the aeration stop ratio of 1 1 the average no3 n effluent concentration was relatively low which supports the assumption that intermittent aeration can strengthen the denitrification effect of baf to a certain extent based on nitrogen removal of the optimal aeration stop ratio was 1 1 overall the optimal single factor conditions were as follows a hydraulic retention time of 6 h a reflux ratio of 100 and an aeration stop ratio of 1 1 resulting in average tn and nh4 n removal rates of 73 01 and 83 32 respectively and an average no3 n effluent concentration of 9 13 mg l 3 3 response surface optimization 3 3 1 modeling and analysis of variance based on the preliminary single factor test the rsm model was used to further optimize the operating parameters of the system appendix shows a total of 17 groups of different bbd test designs and response values n p and q are the target response cod removal rate nh4 n removal rate and tn removal rate respectively based on appendix the quadratic polynomial regression model of the response values and variables can be expressed as follows 1 n 87 85 2 86 a 2 60 b 4 14 c 1 70 ab 0 83 ac 0 94 bc 0 07 a 2 1 76 b 2 4 82 c 2 2 p 89 22 1 41 a 0 39 b 4 88 c 3 90 ab 1 37 ac 1 04 bc 0 85 a 2 1 09 b 2 2 31 c 2 3 q 76 29 0 33 a 1 24 b 1 00 c 0 87 ab 0 96 ac 0 04 bc 0 16 a 2 5 98 b 2 0 50 c 2 the analysis of variance of the predicted response surface model for cod nh4 n and tn removal efficiency is shown in table 4 the n p and q regression models were significant p 0 01 and the out of fit term was not significant p 0 05 indicating that the model is highly significant and that the simulation is accurate 27 the simulated signal to noise ratio was greater than 5 this ratio indicates that the model provides an adequate signal to respond to the design making it highly realistic the model coefficient of determination r2 was 0 9623 0 9610 and 0 9056 indicating that the model can explain 96 23 96 10 and 90 56 of the variation in the response values 28 allowing its use to functionalize the relationship by comparing the f values we found strong and weak relationships between the factors as seen in table 4 the order of the influence of each factor on the cod removal rate was aeration stop ratio hydraulic residence time reflux ratio the influence of each factor on the nh4 n removal rate followed the order aeration stop ratio hydraulic residence time reflux ratio the order of the influence of each factor on the removal rate of tn was aeration stop ratio reflux ratio hydraulic residence time 3 3 2 response surface analysis and parameter optimization to better reflect the influence of the pairwise interaction of hrt r and exposure to stop ratio on cod nh4 n and tn removal a three dimensional response surface was made using the design expert software fig 4 from the curvature of the surface and the closure of the contour lines the extreme values of cod removal nh4 n removal and tn removal were all within the range of the selected test factors the optimal conditions were hrt 7 h r 104 and 1 06 1 the predicted cod removal rate was 87 99 nh4 n removal rate was 88 14 and the tn removal rate was 75 50 3 3 3 verification of optimized operating parameters to investigate the accuracy and practicality of the simulation optimization conditions based on the best test conditions derived from the response surface analysis and to facilitate parameter control hrt 7 h r 105 and the aeration stop ratio of 1 1 were selected fig 5 the average removal rates for cod nh4 n and tn were 87 77 87 28 and 75 41 respectively compared with the predicted value there was only a 2 relative error in the actual removal rate indicating a good fit between the predicted and actual values and demonstrating the reliability of the best test conditions and the practical feasibility of the predicted results in addition the results of similar previous studies were compared the combination of strengthen circulation anaerobic sca and biological aerated filter baf reactor was employed to treat municipal wastewater the average removal rates of cod nh4 n and tn were 92 81 94 7 and 67 8 at the optimal operating conditions 29 it can be seen that the system has good denitrification performance after optimization in this study 3 4 baf along route do study under optimal operating conditions to analyze the nitrogen removal process of the single stage baf under optimal conditions the characteristics of the dissolved oxygen environment along the route of the baf reactor were investigated and the do concentration distribution along the route of the system was measured 30 min after starting and stopping the aeration the distribution of do along with the baf packing layer under two different conditions is shown in fig 6 in the 30 70 cm section do decreased significantly in both stages we assume that the abundant organic matter at the bottom coupled with a large number of active aerobic bacteria in the system can rapidly increase the do of the baf system the do in the 90 130 cm range then increased and remained above 4 mg l on the one hand the activity and biomass of aerobic microorganisms in this section decreased reducing the consumption of oxygen on the other hand the system is a push flow reactor and the water with high do at the bottom rises to this section during the stopping stage of aeration which also leads to a higher do in the effluent based on the do comparison between a and b there was a large difference in do in the 30 70 cm section and even anoxic conditions do 0 5 mg l were observed after 30 min of aeration according to pelaz et al 30 do and cod n are limiting factors in the denitrification process and the cod n requirement for complete denitrification is 5 3 11 in this study the cod n was lower than the optimal denitrification conditions described above indicating that cod n is an important factor limiting the further improvement of nitrogen removal in the whole system 31 3 5 high throughput sequencing analysis to understand the relationship between microbial community and system performance and removal efficiency in more detail phylogenetic classification of bacterial sequences at the taxonomic levels of phylum and genus was performed for three samples along the route as shown in fig 7 based on fig 7 a at the phylum level there were five dominant groups of bacteria with abundance greater than 1 00 in each sample with the highest abundance for proteobacteria 22 87 47 56 and bacteroidetes 11 97 32 05 a finding that is consistent with previous studies of microorganisms in domestic wastewater nitrogen removal systems the diversity results were consistent with previous findings 21 other abundant phyla were firmicutes 7 91 14 43 planctomycetes 6 62 10 68 and acidobacteria 1 884 44 the main microorganisms involved in nitrogen removal are proteobacteria planctomycetes and nitrospirae which accounted for 1 88 4 44 18 59 45 75 and 0 79 3 02 of the total bacteria in terms of nitrogen removing bacteria proteobacteria are considered to be the most important bacteria in baf reactors they are widely distributed in soil wastewater and sludge 32 33 based on previous studies proteobacteria play an important role in biological nitrogen removal and the degradation of many pollutants 34 35 the proportions of the bacteria from a1 to a3 were 47 56 22 87 and 42 87 respectively and the changes were consistent with the valley type of do which was lowest at the sampling point a2 the proportion of planctomycetes along the distribution was 6 62 9 96 and 10 68 which was gradually increasing and differed greatly from the distribution of proteobacteria proteobacteria and planctomycetes are the main taxa of this system and contain common denitrifying bacteria 36 nitrospirae a major nitrifier accounts for the presence of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nobs 37 the sampling points along the route of each nitrospirae accounted for a low percentage of the total bacteria ranging from 0 79 to 3 02 with high levels only at the end of the filler layer at a3 this phenomenon is also consistent with the findings of ma et al 38 who concluded that nitrospirae is the dominant phylogenetic group under aeration conditions besides to further analyze the mechanism of systematic nitrogen removal a deeper understanding of community function in microbial ecosystems can be obtained at the genus level heat maps were used to analyze the relative abundance values of 46 genera corresponding to the screened differential abundance in three samples along the route as seen in fig 7 b the genera acidovorax 0 18 1 60 flavobacterium 0 17 1 43 and rhodobacter 0 06 1 59 were detected as bacteria capable of anoxic metabolism suggesting that anoxic environments also exist in the aeration zone in addition it has been demonstrated that species of the genus flavobacterium can denitrify and reduce nitrate under anoxic conditions 39 in addition nitrifying bacteria are autotrophic bacteria and their growth and reproduction are also influenced by heterotrophic aerobic microorganisms the low concentration of organic matter in the upper part and the slow reproduction of heterotrophic aerobic bacteria may be an important factor for the high abundance of nitrifying bacteria since conventional bafs are limited by internal environmental conditions that make it difficult to enrich anoxic metabolic and denitrifying bacteria the results of a previous study 40 can support the above speculation showing that nitrosomonadaceae the dominant group of bacteria in the biostyr aeration biofilter system can perform nitrosation and presumably other nitrosative bacteria may be present no dominant bacteria capable of denitrification were detected the bacterial community of this system was richer with more pronounced nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria as indicated by the abundance of functional populations the operation of the system with intermittent aeration coupled with internal reflux leads to a richer diversity of microbial communities which can partly explain why the system can effectively enhance single level baf nitrogen removal through conventional nitrification and denitrification 3 6 nitrogen removal mechanism in biological aerated filter systems in the biofilm treatment process the microbial community diversity and structure directly affect nitrogen removal 41 in this paper the microenvironment of the inner and outer layers of the packed biofilm as well as the biological community structure and nitrogen removal mechanism was investigated as is shown in fig 8 during the aeration stage due to sufficient oxygen concentration the diffusion of oxygen and ammonia promoted ammonia oxidation enhancing the nitrification effect during the stop aeration stage the system is deficient in oxygen and an anoxic environment will occur in the biofilm using the nitrate and cod remaining from the aeration stage in macro temporal terms alternating aerobic anoxic environments are formed for tn removal besides oxygen transfer creates a dissolved oxygen gradient in the biofilm and biological flocs with the outer layer of the biofilm being dominated by aerobic nitrifying bacteria for nitrification and the inner layer of the biofilm by denitrifying bacteria for denitrification depending on the microenvironment of the outer and inner layers of the biofilm and the structure of the biological community the baf can also contribute to denitrification this also explains why the single level baf in this study had a good nitrogen removal performance after response surface optimization 4 conclusions the average removal rates for cod nh4 n and tn were 87 77 87 28 and 75 41 respectively under the operating conditions of cod n of 3 44 hrt 7 h r 105 and aeration stop ratio 1 1 based on a single factor and using the rsm model to optimize the operating conditions in the 30 70 cm section the system had the advantage of enhanced denitrification at the gate level the abundance of denitrifying microorganisms was higher mainly regarding proteobacteria 22 87 47 56 planctomycetes 6 62 10 68 nitrospirae 0 79 3 02 flavobacterium was also present at the genus level 0 21 1 43 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

13498,a single level biological aerated filter baf was used to treat domestic wastewater the response surface method rsm model was applied to optimize the operating parameters such as hydraulic retention time hrt reflux ratio r and aeration stop ratio the characteristics of the wastewater were analyzed the results showed the average removal efficiencies for cod tn and nh4 n were 87 77 75 41 and 87 28 for a cod n ratio of 3 44 under the rsm optimized conditions of hrt 7 h r 105 and aeration stop ratio of 1 1 the environment was favorable for enhanced denitrification in the 30 70 cm section the proportion of proteobacteria showed a valley pattern along the range direction while planctomycetes and nitrospirae were gradually increasing the microorganisms involved in denitrification were more abundant at the phylum level notably proteobacteria 22 87 47 56 planctomycetes 6 62 10 68 nitrospirae 0 79 3 02 and denitrifying bacteria were also evident at the genus level i e flavobacterium 0 21 1 43 the baf system with internal reflux coupled intermittent aeration enhances nitrification and denitrification thereby facilitating nitrogen removal keywords aerated biological filter response surface method nitrogen removal performance microbial community structure domestic wastewater 1 introduction biological aerated filtering is a biofilm treatment process that integrates oxidative biodegradation and physical retention of filter media it is characterized by strong resistance to impact loading a lower susceptibility to sludge expansion and easy management 1 3 in such systems cod and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n have a high removal efficiency 4 5 however after the conversion of nh4 n to nitrate nitrogen no3 n in the reactor along the water flow direction the resulting oxygen rich and organic matter deprived environment restricts denitrification resulting in a low total nitrogen removal efficiency 2 to support nitrogen removal the two stage aeration biofilter with nitrification and denitrification is generally used 6 however in recent years studies have shown that the addition of internal reflux in a single level aeration biofilter can achieve a nitrogen removal effect similar to that of a two stage aeration biofilter i e by optimizing the operation mode of the single level baf enhanced nitrogen removal can be achieved on the basis of saving engineering investment and operating costs 7 this is of great significance for the application of baf in decentralized domestic wastewater treatment with large fluctuations in water volume and quality compared to the traditional activated sludge processes such as anaerobic anoxic oxic oxidation ditch etc it is difficult to zone the environmental conditions of microbial carriers in the reactor space if continuous aeration is adjusted to intermittent aeration the partitioning of environmental conditions along time can be achieved in the baf to improve nitrogen removal 7 however this may affect the efficiency of the system for cod and nh4 n treatment 8 in addition factors such as hydraulic residence time or reflux ratio can also adversely affect nitrogen removal efficiency 9 10 and different operating conditions can have a cross effect on the final treatment effect 11 in this sense the identification of the key controlling parameters of single level baf for enhanced denitrification and optimal control of the reactor operation are practical problems to be solved when baf is applied in the treatment of domestic wastewater the response surface method rsm is applied to optimize experimental conditions it uses multiple quadratic regression equations to fit the functional relationship between factors and the response quantity and then evaluates the factors and their interactions through experimental design mathematical modeling and model testing to obtain the predicted optimized response quantity and the optimized experimental conditions 12 the membrane bioreactor mbr using the rsm method to optimize the influent carbon to nitrogen ratio cod n alternating aerobic strict cycles and aeration volume has been developed to obtain the best operating parameters and the validity and applicability of the model have been verified 13 mirghorayshi et al 14 investigated the removal of carbon and nitrogen from compost filtrate by mixed gas lift using three independent variables as operating parameters to evaluate reactor performance determine the optimal operating conditions for high cod and total nitrogen tn removal rates and verify the validity of the rsm model these studies show that rsm has the advantages of high accuracy reliable prediction results and multiple analysis dimensions making it suitable for optimizing process conditions that are influenced by multiple factors in the water treatment process in this study we used a single level baf plant to treat domestic wastewater based on the experimental results from the single factor operating conditions the response surface method was used to optimize the baf operating parameters and verify the optimized results with the removal efficiency of cod tn and nh4 n as the constraint via analysis of dissolved oxygen do variation and microbial population characteristics the microbial response characteristics of the single stage baf operation parameters optimized to enhance nitrogen removal efficiency were identified with the aim to provide technical guidance for the practical application of baf in the decentralized treatment of domestic wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental devices the experimental device is shown in fig 1 the baf reactor was cylindrical and made of polyvinyl chloride with an inner diameter of 15 cm an outer diameter of 25 cm and an overall height of 240 cm the bottom was a uniform water distribution zone 20 cm high the top was a lining layer 30 cm high and 1 4 cm pebbles were spread on a uniform water distribution plate with an perforated aeration tube aperture 4 mm the physical parameters of the ceramic filler were as follows particle size 0 3 0 5 cm bulk density 0 7 1 0 g cm3 porosity greater than 30 seven sampling ports

china and a time control switch kg316t chnt china 2 2 experimental water quality the experimental water was taken from the conditioning pool water of a university sewage treatment station to prevent the large impurities from blocking the filter the original water in the tank was allowed to sediment for 1 h and the upper water layer was used for the experiment the specific water quality characteristics are shown in table 1 2 3 test methods 2 3 1 reactor startup we adopted the rapid sludge discharge method to initiate the baf hanging film 15 the inoculation sludge was obtained from the activated sludge with good activity from a university wastewater treatment plant in xi an shaanxi province the activated sludge mixture was pumped into the filter tank with a peristaltic pump yz1515x chuangrui tech co china from bottom to top and the amount of sludge added was based on flooding the top surface of the ceramic filler layer the remaining part was filled with raw water after 7 h of aeration at 30 l h and 1 h of static sedimentation the supernatant was discharged and domestic sewage was added to the original height after 5 d of continuous aeration the water with a small flow rate was divided into four stages to gradually increase the inlet water flow to the design flow each stage of continuous operation lasted for 7 d 2 3 2 single factor optimization experiments in this study the operating conditions were determined before the single factor test the main operating parameters were hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 h a gas to water ratio of 6 1 aeration stop aeration cycle of 1 h temperature control of the entire reactor at 22 2 c the backwashing process was as follows gas washing for 2 5 min mixed gas to water washing for 4 6 min water washing for 8 10 min washing intensity of 8 16 l m3 s backwashing cycle of 4 d three factors a hrt b r and c aeration stop time ratio affecting baf nitrogen removal were selected for single factor experiments to determine the optimal single factor conditions for long term operation table 2 shows the experimental design 2 3 3 response surface optimization experiments based on single factor experiments the range of rsm experimental design parameters can be initially determined and the three factor three level experimental design can be carried out using the box behnken bbd model based on rsm the experimental factor and level designs are shown in table 3 2 4 analysis methods 2 4 1 water quality water samples entering and exiting the system were filtered daily using a 0 45 μm filter membrane sigma aldrich canada and tested according to the standard method the cod was determined by the rapid digestion of potassium dichromate 5b 1f lianhua tech co china we used an ultraviolet spectrophotometer dr6000 haca usa for the determination of nh4 n no3 n and tn respectively the do and temperature were determined using a portable dissolved oxygen meter hqd30 hach usa 2 4 2 sem observation the bio pellets were rinsed three times with water to remove surface impurities before after mounting to fix the surface microorganisms after mounting the samples were immersed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde ph 7 4 for 2 h and processed according to conventional electron microscopy 16 subsequently the samples were blow dried and sprayed with gold followed by observation through an sem jsm 5600lv tokyo japan 2 4 3 high throughput sequencing microbial diversity and community structure along the route of the baf system were investigated via 16s rrna high throughput sequencing for this samples were taken from the biofilter of the baf reactor after continuous operation under optimal conditions bacterial dna was extracted as described elsewhere 17 the primers 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc were used for pcr amplification of 16s rrna sequences in the v3 v4 high variable region 18 the bacterial dna samples were sequenced using the miseq pe300 shanghai sangon biological co ltd china platform the original data were been uploaded to the sequence read archive database the login was srp298082 3 results and discussion 3 1 baf film startup as shown in fig 2 the influent cod and nh4 n concentrations in the startup phase fluctuated from 179 18 to 275 94 mg l and 35 45 to 53 40 mg l respectively and the average removal rate increased with the shortening of the hrt the average removal rates for cod and nh4 n were 39 03 and 11 28 respectively in the sullen exposure phase the average effluent concentrations of cod and nh4 n were 139 25 and 38 58 mg l respectively when the hrt was gradually reduced to 4 h the average removal rates for cod and nh4 n increased to 75 13 and 79 01 respectively with average effluent concentrations of cod and nh4 n of 54 13 and 9 47 mg l after the above start up phase the system was highly effective in removing cod and nh4 n from the water after 32 d of continuous operation of the baf reactor the average cod and nh4 n removal rates were above 75 a thick brown viscous matter could be observed on the filler surface as shown in fig 1 b and c the surface of the pre mounted film as rough with a large number of cocci and bacilli growing on the carrier surface the biofilm was mature and the start of the system mounting was completed 19 3 2 single factor impacts on baf denitrification to identify the influences of operating parameters on the nitrogen removal effect during the stable operation of the baf system the operating parameters hrt r and aeration stop ratio were adjusted sequentially to optimize nitrogen removal based on maintaining the average cod removal rate above 85 00 the changes in tn nh4 n and no3 n in the influent and effluent at each stage are shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 a the nh4 n removal rate gradually increased with the increase of the hrt from an average of 67 99 to 88 92 when the hrt increased the wastewater remained in the system for a longer time which was conducive to nitrification by nitrifying bacteria 20 from the perspective of changing the survival conditions of bacteria nitrifying bacteria are typically autotrophic and the removal of nh4 n in the baf system mainly relies on the biological oxidation of nitrification inhibitors increasing the hrt can lead to the rapid growth of autotrophic bacteria and promote the growth of nitrifying bacteria this is agreement with tao et al 21 who found that when the hrt was reduced from 5 2 to 3 5 and 2 6 h the organic load of u pabf is increased and inhibited the proliferation rate of auto oxidizing nitrifying bacteria leading to a decrease in the nh4 n removal rate as shown in fig 3 b the average tn removal rates were 34 33 42 93 44 27 44 10 and 38 99 respectively the overall removal rate of tn was low and the effect was not obvious with the fluctuation of the hrt as seen in fig 3 c the average inlet concentration of no3 n was 0 41 mg l and the average outlet concentration of no3 n was 17 66 mg l over 150 d of continuous operation of the baf with an increase in hrt from 2 to 10 h the average outlet concentrations of no3 n were 13 05 17 25 15 63 15 63 15 63 and 17 66 mg l respectively denitrification in the system was low which explains the low tn removal 22 an hrt of 6 h resulted in optimal reactor operation regarding nitrogen removal and energy consumption based on this hrt internal reflux was further added to optimize the nitrogen removal performance of the baf as shown in fig 3 d the average removal rate for nh4 n under different r conditions was stable at values above 80 and the average effluent concentration of nh4 n was 6 81 mg l the nitrifying bacteria in the system had a strong metabolic rate facilitating nh4 n removal therefore under the condition that nitrification is up to standard the effect of nitrogen removal in the system mainly depends on denitrification 19 as shown in fig 3 e with the gradual increase in the reflux ratio from r 50 to r 100 the average tn removal rate of the baf increased to 60 44 and 65 98 and the average tn concentration of the effluent was 35 35 and 26 07 mg l the tn removal effect had a more obvious optimization effect reflux can promote the denitrification of the system and effectively remove tn from the effluent further no3 n is converted to n2 which in turn enhances the removal of tn this is in agreement with a previous study showing that increased reflux in baf reactors enhances the transfer of microorganisms and pollutants 23 with the further increase of the reflux ratio to 200 the average tn removal rates of the baf were 62 81 and 45 62 and the average effluent tn concentrations were 24 62 and 25 58 mg l indicating a decreased tn removal when the reflux ratio was below 100 the tn concentration in the effluent increased significantly because of the high do content in the reflux nitrifying solution resulting in a significant decrease in the do concentration gradient inside and outside the biofilm consequently this impeded the retransformation of no3 n from denitrification thus making it difficult for baf to achieve a good nitrogen removal effect also as shown in fig 3 f the average effluent no3 n concentrations were 16 33 12 42 12 85 12 27 and 24 49 mg l when the reflux ratio increased from 50 to 200 this indicates that the reflux of certain nitrifying liquid increased the denitrification activity which in turn promotes nitrogen removal however in our study the main cause for this phenomenon may be the delivery of no3 n to the bottom of the baf through internal circulation along with sufficient cod in the feed water through the action of biofilm snd denitrification can be enhanced and the tn removal rate can be improved 24 therefore nitrogen removal of the system is significantly improved with a maximum efficiency at r 100 to further optimize the nitrogen removal performance of the baf continuous aeration was adjusted to intermittent aeration under the above optimal conditions as shown in fig 3 g for aeration stop ratios of 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 the average nh4 n removal rates were 83 32 76 83 and 86 31 and the average concentrations of effluent nh4 n were 7 88 11 08 and 6 55 mg l although the average nh4 n removal rate increases 25 the removal of nh4 n under intermittent aeration was not as good as that under continuous aeration this is because intermittent aeration reduces the oxygen supply and affects the nitrification of the system which is consistent with the findings of rahimi et al 26 where do was the main factor limiting nitrification here nitrification under intermittent aeration can also be optimized by increasing the oxygen supply during the aeration stage as shown in fig 3 h the average tn removal rates were 73 01 60 25 and 62 44 for the three different aeration ratios compared with the tn removal effect under continuous aeration the effect of aeration stop ratio on baf tn removal was more significant the above phenomena may be due to the transport of no3 n to the bottom of the system through the internal reflux but also to the high level of organic matter in the influent providing growth substrate for denitrifying bacteria the aeration stop ratio of 1 1 had the best effect on tn removal it can be seen that the suitable aeration stopping time ratio is conducive to the smooth nitrification and denitrification of the system which in turn optimizes the denitrification effect of the system for all three ratios based on fig 3 i the average no3 n effluent concentrations were 9 13 8 94 and 14 96 mg l as indicated by the aeration stop ratio of 1 1 the average no3 n effluent concentration was relatively low which supports the assumption that intermittent aeration can strengthen the denitrification effect of baf to a certain extent based on nitrogen removal of the optimal aeration stop ratio was 1 1 overall the optimal single factor conditions were as follows a hydraulic retention time of 6 h a reflux ratio of 100 and an aeration stop ratio of 1 1 resulting in average tn and nh4 n removal rates of 73 01 and 83 32 respectively and an average no3 n effluent concentration of 9 13 mg l 3 3 response surface optimization 3 3 1 modeling and analysis of variance based on the preliminary single factor test the rsm model was used to further optimize the operating parameters of the system appendix shows a total of 17 groups of different bbd test designs and response values n p and q are the target response cod removal rate nh4 n removal rate and tn removal rate respectively based on appendix the quadratic polynomial regression model of the response values and variables can be expressed as follows 1 n 87 85 2 86 a 2 60 b 4 14 c 1 70 ab 0 83 ac 0 94 bc 0 07 a 2 1 76 b 2 4 82 c 2 2 p 89 22 1 41 a 0 39 b 4 88 c 3 90 ab 1 37 ac 1 04 bc 0 85 a 2 1 09 b 2 2 31 c 2 3 q 76 29 0 33 a 1 24 b 1 00 c 0 87 ab 0 96 ac 0 04 bc 0 16 a 2 5 98 b 2 0 50 c 2 the analysis of variance of the predicted response surface model for cod nh4 n and tn removal efficiency is shown in table 4 the n p and q regression models were significant p 0 01 and the out of fit term was not significant p 0 05 indicating that the model is highly significant and that the simulation is accurate 27 the simulated signal to noise ratio was greater than 5 this ratio indicates that the model provides an adequate signal to respond to the design making it highly realistic the model coefficient of determination r2 was 0 9623 0 9610 and 0 9056 indicating that the model can explain 96 23 96 10 and 90 56 of the variation in the response values 28 allowing its use to functionalize the relationship by comparing the f values we found strong and weak relationships between the factors as seen in table 4 the order of the influence of each factor on the cod removal rate was aeration stop ratio hydraulic residence time reflux ratio the influence of each factor on the nh4 n removal rate followed the order aeration stop ratio hydraulic residence time reflux ratio the order of the influence of each factor on the removal rate of tn was aeration stop ratio reflux ratio hydraulic residence time 3 3 2 response surface analysis and parameter optimization to better reflect the influence of the pairwise interaction of hrt r and exposure to stop ratio on cod nh4 n and tn removal a three dimensional response surface was made using the design expert software fig 4 from the curvature of the surface and the closure of the contour lines the extreme values of cod removal nh4 n removal and tn removal were all within the range of the selected test factors the optimal conditions were hrt 7 h r 104 and 1 06 1 the predicted cod removal rate was 87 99 nh4 n removal rate was 88 14 and the tn removal rate was 75 50 3 3 3 verification of optimized operating parameters to investigate the accuracy and practicality of the simulation optimization conditions based on the best test conditions derived from the response surface analysis and to facilitate parameter control hrt 7 h r 105 and the aeration stop ratio of 1 1 were selected fig 5 the average removal rates for cod nh4 n and tn were 87 77 87 28 and 75 41 respectively compared with the predicted value there was only a 2 relative error in the actual removal rate indicating a good fit between the predicted and actual values and demonstrating the reliability of the best test conditions and the practical feasibility of the predicted results in addition the results of similar previous studies were compared the combination of strengthen circulation anaerobic sca and biological aerated filter baf reactor was employed to treat municipal wastewater the average removal rates of cod nh4 n and tn were 92 81 94 7 and 67 8 at the optimal operating conditions 29 it can be seen that the system has good denitrification performance after optimization in this study 3 4 baf along route do study under optimal operating conditions to analyze the nitrogen removal process of the single stage baf under optimal conditions the characteristics of the dissolved oxygen environment along the route of the baf reactor were investigated and the do concentration distribution along the route of the system was measured 30 min after starting and stopping the aeration the distribution of do along with the baf packing layer under two different conditions is shown in fig 6 in the 30 70 cm section do decreased significantly in both stages we assume that the abundant organic matter at the bottom coupled with a large number of active aerobic bacteria in the system can rapidly increase the do of the baf system the do in the 90 130 cm range then increased and remained above 4 mg l on the one hand the activity and biomass of aerobic microorganisms in this section decreased reducing the consumption of oxygen on the other hand the system is a push flow reactor and the water with high do at the bottom rises to this section during the stopping stage of aeration which also leads to a higher do in the effluent based on the do comparison between a and b there was a large difference in do in the 30 70 cm section and even anoxic conditions do 0 5 mg l were observed after 30 min of aeration according to pelaz et al 30 do and cod n are limiting factors in the denitrification process and the cod n requirement for complete denitrification is 5 3 11 in this study the cod n was lower than the optimal denitrification conditions described above indicating that cod n is an important factor limiting the further improvement of nitrogen removal in the whole system 31 3 5 high throughput sequencing analysis to understand the relationship between microbial community and system performance and removal efficiency in more detail phylogenetic classification of bacterial sequences at the taxonomic levels of phylum and genus was performed for three samples along the route as shown in fig 7 based on fig 7 a at the phylum level there were five dominant groups of bacteria with abundance greater than 1 00 in each sample with the highest abundance for proteobacteria 22 87 47 56 and bacteroidetes 11 97 32 05 a finding that is consistent with previous studies of microorganisms in domestic wastewater nitrogen removal systems the diversity results were consistent with previous findings 21 other abundant phyla were firmicutes 7 91 14 43 planctomycetes 6 62 10 68 and acidobacteria 1 884 44 the main microorganisms involved in nitrogen removal are proteobacteria planctomycetes and nitrospirae which accounted for 1 88 4 44 18 59 45 75 and 0 79 3 02 of the total bacteria in terms of nitrogen removing bacteria proteobacteria are considered to be the most important bacteria in baf reactors they are widely distributed in soil wastewater and sludge 32 33 based on previous studies proteobacteria play an important role in biological nitrogen removal and the degradation of many pollutants 34 35 the proportions of the bacteria from a1 to a3 were 47 56 22 87 and 42 87 respectively and the changes were consistent with the valley type of do which was lowest at the sampling point a2 the proportion of planctomycetes along the distribution was 6 62 9 96 and 10 68 which was gradually increasing and differed greatly from the distribution of proteobacteria proteobacteria and planctomycetes are the main taxa of this system and contain common denitrifying bacteria 36 nitrospirae a major nitrifier accounts for the presence of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nobs 37 the sampling points along the route of each nitrospirae accounted for a low percentage of the total bacteria ranging from 0 79 to 3 02 with high levels only at the end of the filler layer at a3 this phenomenon is also consistent with the findings of ma et al 38 who concluded that nitrospirae is the dominant phylogenetic group under aeration conditions besides to further analyze the mechanism of systematic nitrogen removal a deeper understanding of community function in microbial ecosystems can be obtained at the genus level heat maps were used to analyze the relative abundance values of 46 genera corresponding to the screened differential abundance in three samples along the route as seen in fig 7 b the genera acidovorax 0 18 1 60 flavobacterium 0 17 1 43 and rhodobacter 0 06 1 59 were detected as bacteria capable of anoxic metabolism suggesting that anoxic environments also exist in the aeration zone in addition it has been demonstrated that species of the genus flavobacterium can denitrify and reduce nitrate under anoxic conditions 39 in addition nitrifying bacteria are autotrophic bacteria and their growth and reproduction are also influenced by heterotrophic aerobic microorganisms the low concentration of organic matter in the upper part and the slow reproduction of heterotrophic aerobic bacteria may be an important factor for the high abundance of nitrifying bacteria since conventional bafs are limited by internal environmental conditions that make it difficult to enrich anoxic metabolic and denitrifying bacteria the results of a previous study 40 can support the above speculation showing that nitrosomonadaceae the dominant group of bacteria in the biostyr aeration biofilter system can perform nitrosation and presumably other nitrosative bacteria may be present no dominant bacteria capable of denitrification were detected the bacterial community of this system was richer with more pronounced nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria as indicated by the abundance of functional populations the operation of the system with intermittent aeration coupled with internal reflux leads to a richer diversity of microbial communities which can partly explain why the system can effectively enhance single level baf nitrogen removal through conventional nitrification and denitrification 3 6 nitrogen removal mechanism in biological aerated filter systems in the biofilm treatment process the microbial community diversity and structure directly affect nitrogen removal 41 in this paper the microenvironment of the inner and outer layers of the packed biofilm as well as the biological community structure and nitrogen removal mechanism was investigated as is shown in fig 8 during the aeration stage due to sufficient oxygen concentration the diffusion of oxygen and ammonia promoted ammonia oxidation enhancing the nitrification effect during the stop aeration stage the system is deficient in oxygen and an anoxic environment will occur in the biofilm using the nitrate and cod remaining from the aeration stage in macro temporal terms alternating aerobic anoxic environments are formed for tn removal besides oxygen transfer creates a dissolved oxygen gradient in the biofilm and biological flocs with the outer layer of the biofilm being dominated by aerobic nitrifying bacteria for nitrification and the inner layer of the biofilm by denitrifying bacteria for denitrification depending on the microenvironment of the outer and inner layers of the biofilm and the structure of the biological community the baf can also contribute to denitrification this also explains why the single level baf in this study had a good nitrogen removal performance after response surface optimization 4 conclusions the average removal rates for cod nh4 n and tn were 87 77 87 28 and 75 41 respectively under the operating conditions of cod n of 3 44 hrt 7 h r 105 and aeration stop ratio 1 1 based on a single factor and using the rsm model to optimize the operating conditions in the 30 70 cm section the system had the advantage of enhanced denitrification at the gate level the abundance of denitrifying microorganisms was higher mainly regarding proteobacteria 22 87 47 56 planctomycetes 6 62 10 68 nitrospirae 0 79 3 02 flavobacterium was

13499,the novel sars cov 2 is expanding internationally while the current focus is on limiting its transmission from direct contact with infected patients and surfaces during the pandemic the secondary transmission potential via sewage should not be underestimated especially in low income and developing countries with weak wastewater treatment technologies recent studies have indicated sars cov 2 positivity also be detected in the feces of patients therefore the risk of transmission and infection can be increased into sewage by the fecal oral way mainly in some parts of the globe with a high amount of open defecation this review collected scattered data and recent studies about the direct and indirect effects of coronavirus in the water cycle the direct impacts of covid 19 on wastewater are related to the presence of the coronavirus and suitable viral removal methods in different phases of treatment in wastewater treatment plants the indirect effects of covid 19 on wastewater are related to the overuse of cleaning and disinfecting products to protect against viral infection and the overuse of certain drugs to protect against virus or novel mental problems and panic to covid 19 and consequently their presence in wastewater this unexpected situation leads to changes in the quality of wastewater and brings adverse and harmful effects for the human aquatic organisms and the environment therefore applying effective wastewater treatment technologies with low toxic by products in wastewater treatment plants will be helpful to prevent the increasing occurrence of these extra contaminants in the environment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords covid 19 coronavirus wastewater treatment cleaning products disinfectants pharmaceuticals 1 introduction the crisis of covid 19 which is caused by the new coronavirus sars cov 2 is presently posing a considerable threat to the economic growth and the health of the world especially developing countries sars cov 2 is a single stranded virus with a positive sense of rna and spherical shape which belongs to the coronaviridae family 1 6 sars cov 2 is more transmitted between the people rather than sars cov and mers cov especially in dense population places such as public transportations industrial processing factories prisons nursing homes and etc 7 9 despite the worldwide lockdown attempts the rates of positive covid 19 cases are still high the world health organization who has reported the principal ways of coronavirus exposure are inhalation of respiratory droplets produced when a patient sneezes coughs and exhales or direct contact with infected surfaces 10 recent scientific researches announced the possible waterborne transmission of the sars cov 2 moreover the presence of coronavirus rna was confirmed by several reports in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 11 12 the risk of transmission by the fecal oral way into sewage can also be a crucial concern and should be highlighted in the areas that have not adequate water treatment and sanitation facilities 12 13 even when the respiratory tract shows negative stool may stay positive for sars cov 2 and it raises a set of concerns about the possible presence of the virus in the effluent and choosing the appropriate methods for wastewater treatment to inactivate the virus 14 moreover during the covid 19 pandemic the municipal wastewater can usually observe other excessive contaminants like disinfectants pharmaceuticals and disposable personal protective equipment which are generally excreted by humankind activities 15 the covid 19 pandemic has also raised the consumption of certain drugs comprising antimicrobials and antidepressants between people due to improper attempts to protect themselves against the covid 19 with antibiotics while it is a viral sickness and the worldwide occurrence of anxiety and depression as a result they can be found in the environment particularly in the urban water cycle which is harmful to aquatic organisms and the environment 16 19 the purpose of this review is to collect the present knowledge about the case of disturbances caused by covid 19 in wastewater both directly and indirectly that can encourage researchers in various fields to conduct further research about this emerging problem the direct existence of the covid 19 in sewage and wastewater by human droplets stool or hospital wastes the capability of transmission in this way and effective methods to inactive the virus in the wastewater indirect effects of covid 19 on wastewater include increased use of disinfectants hand sanitizers and surfactants including detergents and soaps and the over or misuse of certain medications such as antimicrobials antidepressants etc ultimately collecting the efficient removal methods for these emerging wastewater contaminants is the other aim of this research 2 impact of covid 19 on wastewater 2 1 sars cov 2 most viruses found out in stools such as sars coronavirus can come from the superior respiratory tracts by deglutition respiratory secretions the virus can be destructed by stomach acidity but it may be protected when mixed with meals or potential resistor to acidic ph therefore it can pass through the intestine moreover it can derive from the replication of the virus in intestinal cells 20 21 in 2002 and 2003 during the two outbreaks of sars cov up to 73 of infected people during the disease development had gastrointestinal symptoms and the existence rna of sars cov was illustrated in the fecal specimens even after ten weeks from the onset of symptoms 22 23 researches during the mers cov pandemic showed that one fourth of infected people announced symptoms like abdominal pain or diarrhea before severe respiratory symptoms and in 14 6 of stool specimens mers cov rna was detected 24 25 zhou et al reported that intestinal mucous cells were extremely sensitive to mers cov and could help viral replication 26 recent studies demonstrated sars cov 2 positivity also be detected in the feces of patients in the absence of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms for example live sars cov 2 was observed inside the stool of two infected persons without diarrhea symptoms 14 lescure et al have also confirmed sars cov 2 in urine specimens of patients 27 tang a et al found sars cov 2 from stool specimen of an asymptomatic ten year child which was evident for considering stool to be an extra routine diagnostic specimen separate from the respiratory tract samples 28 the coronavirus viral concentration in feces of infected people who tested positive were exhibited in the range of almost 104 108 copies l however in sewage feces dilution is caused to reduce the viral load between almost 102 106 5 copies l 29 although the possible infection of coronavirus is not proved the existence of the virus is confirmed in the stool of a human until 33 days when the infected person s test is negative for sars cov 2 12 the risk of infection increase in some parts of the globe and with a high amount of open defecation according to unicef 892 million people around the world still use open defecation 30 for example statistical data on november 2019 demonstrated that in india about 28 7 of rural people still do not have access to any type of toilet 31 hence a considerable amount of viruses would be expected in sewage from the number of diagnosed infected individuals which has been exhibited in studies from many countries affected by this crisis currently real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rrt pcr nested rt pcr and quantitative rt pcr rt qpcr are the methods which are applied for the tracing of cvid 19 rna 29 table 1 additionally medical wastewater of toxic and hazardous materials must be treated before sending out to the wastewater system sewage services in healthcare facilities must be managed precisely and in a different way after the covid 19 crisis especially in the areas with low financial and technical resources like palestine and india or some regions of africa 30 32 33 moreover huge demand in consumption of personal protective equipment ppe such as masks gloves and shields and improper disposal of this infected solid waste into the environment can increase not only the physical pollutants in water bodies but also can increase the risk of coronavirus transmission 2 2 cleaning and disinfecting products coronavirus can remain viable on surfaces such as stainless steel cardboard and plastic for hours or even days 42 43 therefore one of the best effective and practical ways to prevent and cope with the spread of coronavirus is to disinfect the surface and hands and washing them successively in recent research it turns out that during the pandemic from january to february 2020 in wuhan city of china almost 2000 tons of disinfectant were released into sewage systems 44 45 these huge contaminated water without any treatment can directly be discharged into water bodies or can reduce the water quality and create significant problems for wastewater treatment this situation not only brings a high danger risk for drinking water resources but also threatens the marine environment 46 47 it turns out that excessive and successive use of disinfectants can increase drinking water consumption by 20 which could lead to more than 15 18 wastewater generation 46 furthermore the huge consumption of disinfectants detergents and soaps could find ways to access and contaminate water bodies which is one of the major environmental concerns related to the covid 19 pandemic 46 47 antimicrobial resistance has become one of the other crucial concerns around the world due to the overuse of antimicrobials antivirals antibiotics and antiparasitics and extreme consumption of alcohol surfactants and hydrogen peroxides as the cleansing agents which are caused microorganisms resistance 48 2 2 1 surfactants according to who proper handwashing with soap and rubbing both sides of hands take at least 20 30 s 49 the detriment to coronavirus spike proteins can lead to the inactivation virus 50 detergents and soaps are consist of surfactants which are explained as the damaging factor for spike proteins or peplomers of the virus for example the ebola virus which indicates spike protein mediated host attachment can be inactivated by surfactant nanoemulsion therefore researchers have widely approved surfactants 51 surfactants are considered emerging pollutants that are not easily degradable and are stable in the environment for a long time they are toxic for microorganisms and mammals in different environmental matrices 52 53 in addition during the pandemic there are many other tasks including disinfecting the indoor or outdoor environment washing clothes showers and cleaning which consume a large amount of water 46 a single hand washes for each person might consume two liters of water if the tap is closed this amount of water used can be increased to 4 l if the tap is remained open under these circumstances each person consumes more quantity of water than before for example in bundelkhand city of india water demand was increased 60 70 in a similar way massive operations of fumigation and disinfection have been done in all around words in order to disinfect avenues streets hospitals markets this situation contributed to huge wastewater generation which mainly contains pollutants such as detergents 46 the other main problem of common soap in hard water is sedimentation which has led to the improvement of organic chemicals in spite of the fact that the structural characteristics of these developed compounds are like soap their chemical properties are different and they can foam whenever they are being used in hard or acid water detergents formulation consists of several types of surfactants surfactants relied on their electrolytic dissociation and are mainly separated into four groups according to the charge on their head group including non ionic amphoteric anionic and cationic 54 56 properties of surfactants can be defined by the head group of them 57 various used types of surfactants are shown in table 2 and several impacts of detergents on wastewaters are explained in table 3 2 2 2 hand sanitizer hand sanitizer can be separated into two main groups alcohol free or alcohol based alcohol based hand sanitizers are recommended by who during the covid 19 pandemic due to their several advantages including rapid action and protection against viruses and bacteria this situation leads to the huge consumption of alcohol based hand sanitizers for example in japan in april 2020 the production of alcohol disinfectants in the kao company increased by 2000 to fight the shortage 67 45 it turns out the overuse of hand sanitizer might become harmful to the environment and human health 68 overusing hand sanitizer contributes to antimicrobial resistance putting more burdens on healthcare professionals who already have been struggling with this problem 44 the most effective formulation of hand sanitizer contains 62 95 alcohol because it could inactivate viruses and denature the proteins of microbes in general alcohol based hand sanitizers are mainly made up of isopropyl alcohols and ethanol 67 45 ethanol has a huge directly negative impact on aquatic organisms many kinds of research have been done to investigate the effects of ethanol on various species in addition the large amounts of isopropanol in water might lead to environmental impairment due to its high potency to decrease oxygen in the water which ultimately brings adverse effects on the aquatic living system 69 2 3 pharmaceutical compounds during the covid 19 pandemic the consumption of certain drugs such as antibiotics antidepressants and sedatives drug of abuse anabolic steroids vitamin supplements antidiarrheals antitussives antipyretics and analgesics has increased among people this increase in demand and use of the drugs has enhanced concern globally which is affecting developing and even developed countries 16 70 72 the consumption of antimicrobials in the prevention and therapy of covid 19 is arising a lot of people incorrectly try to protect themselves against the covid 19 by self medicate with antibiotics despite it is a viral sickness these attempts are mainly prevalent in developing societies 73 74 the primary wave of covid 19 widespread may have significantly affected antimicrobial utilization in hospitals silva et al evaluated the antimicrobial consumption of specific hospital during the covid 19 pandemic in brazil they found a 2500 higher rate of azithromycin consumption in the covid 19 emergency department and a 2000 higher rate of azithromycin consumption in the clinical ward moreover the usage of amoxicillin clavulanate had a notably higher rate in all covid 19 clusters 71 the who and other specialists suggested that antimicrobial treatment should not be started for suspected or affirmed mild covid 19 unless in critically covid 19 patients with a high clinical suspicion of bacterial infection 75 the increased antimicrobials usage can have critical outcomes with the existence of antimicrobial elements in the environment which can stimulate resistance of the antimicrobials and even in minimal amounts can present unpleasant impacts in non target creatures it has been indicated that above 80 of amoxicillin is discharged by urine from the person s body after 2 h and consequently the existence of amoxicillin in water sources and wastewaters can lead to harmful ecological problems 76 a new typhoid fever epidemic in pakistan has been related to the resistance of antibiotics due to inappropriate consumption of drugs weak sanitation and polluted water supplies 77 moreover the novel covid 19 pandemic has influenced people s mental health due to bereavement fear lockdown and loss of income in society leading to an increase in depressive episodes in the countries such as uk china spain and the usa 16 78 79 antidepressants which are considered in the classification of psychiatric drugs are in the first step of therapy to treat depression anxiety and episodes which are resulting from the imposed quarantine psychiatric drugs are in the category of organic compounds which are comprising sertraline carbamazepine fluoxetine citalopram etc 80 results indicated that european countries are the most antidepressants consumers in the world based on the organization for economic co operation and development oecd data 81 these drugs are relatively metabolized and excreted hence they enter into wastewater and traditional treatments are not able to remove them varied literature confirms the existence of antidepressants in water sources worldwide and wastewater treatment plants which can potentially be toxically bioaccumulated in the tissues of water organisms such as some aquatic plants mollusks and fishes 82 the fate of these emerging pollutants whenever released into the environment depends on the physical and chemical nature of the pharmaceutical components this issue is significant because several of these ingredients have been found in drinking water sources and wastewater effluents 70 83 84 nason et al detected different chemicals and evaluated their trends from daily collected samples from march 19 to april 15 2020 and weekly composite samples from march 19 to june 30 2020 in primary wastewater sludge from wwtps in new haven ct usa however they did not know what chemicals were existed before analyzing samples about antidepressant drugs sertraline and citalopram had a clear increase in daily and weekly samples respectively moreover they found an increase in the concentration of some opioids and drugs of abuse such as methadone hydromorphone and cocaine in the weekly samples and increasing acetaminophen as a drug to relieve the symptoms of covid 19 comprising headache and fever in their weekly sample analysis the increased concentrations of hydroxychloroquine as a drug that received considerable attention due to its potential to treat covid 19 were also obvious in daily sludge samples in the third week of investigation 72 the specifications and environmental impacts of some drugs are collected in table 4 therefore the covid 19 pandemic has huge negative direct and indirect impacts on water and wastewater quality all of the already mentioned new contaminants can find a way to reach surface water and negatively affect the environment fig 1 3 wastewater treatment during covid 19 the treated wastewater from treatment plants is usually discharged into receiving bodies of water or reused for purposes such as recreation and irrigation this section deals with the introduction and evaluation of the effectiveness of different physical biological and chemical methods and unit operations that are currently used to remove organic contaminants and deactivate viruses hence they can generally be used at the varied stages of the wastewater treatment during the covid 19 pandemic 3 1 coronavirus removal preventing the spread of the virus in the environment all around the world is crucial before utilizing reclaimed water there are three main phases to treat the infected water from coronavirus to safe water for recycling or reusing the first treatment phase includes physical actions such as screening grit chamber and initial sedimentation in order to eliminate infected solids that are suspended in the wastewater the second and third treatment phases consist of biological treatment actions to eliminate the biodegradable organic matter and physicochemical treatment actions to further decrease turbidity remaining organics heavy metals and pathogens such as coronavirus respectively 91 92 although specific additional research about these methods on sars cov 2 regular monitoring of their efficiency in real water treatment with considering all factors affecting virus survival and environmental considerations is needed to choose the best disinfection technology 3 1 1 first treatment phase the first treatment phase consists of physical processes that include the elimination of volatile and fixed solids suspended in sewage via physical barriers virus adsorption onto the large suspended solids in sewage which is accompanied by gravitational sedimentation is considered as the main and first mechanism in the treatment phase for the virus removal 93 however according to the available scientific reports the gravitational sedimentation in the primary treatment phase is insufficient for the viral removal entirely from the sewage the removal of coronavirus rna through wastewater treatment operations has been seen for additional treatments comprising secondary and tertiary treatment and tertiary treated wastewater is reused for irrigation and public domain directly 94 3 1 2 secondary treatment phase biological techniques such as membrane bioreactor activated sludge extended aeration biological processes etc are mainly used as part of the secondary treatment phase in the wastewater treatment plants 94 past studies have exhibited a higher elimination of the intestinal viruses by secondary treatment processes rather than the first treatment processes other studies have also reported the coronavirus resistance and survival in primary treatment was slightly higher than in secondary treatment due to the existence of higher organics in the primary treatment stage which were protecting viruses from damaging 95 96 in the activated sludge technique uptake of viral particles on the organic biomass and elimination by sedimentation through the secondary clarifier assigned as the important and main mechanism for the virus elimination in the wastewater treatment 97 the membrane bioreactor is used in the secondary treatment phase of wastewater to remove viral particles considerably and it consists of membrane filtration and a suspended growth bioreactor membrane technology is cost effective and environmentally friendly with small or no chemical usage a considerable decrease in the equipment size and easy accessibility 98 99 based on recent studies the high energy requirement is the major limitation of this technology which is among 0 45 and 0 65 kwh m 3 for the highest optimum performance 100 101 membrane bioreactor operations are designed with more retention times of solids towards activated sludge processes which leads to varied treatment performances and other related conditions the disadvantages of membrane compared to activated sludge are related to more operational difficulties and complexity 102 simmons et al applied the membrane bioreactor process in the secondary treatment phase and could attain the log removal values of 6 8 6 3 4 8 for enterovirus adenovirus and norovirus respectively 103 sars cov 2 is greatly similar to other coronaviruses and they are seriously affected by decontaminants or various environmental parameters such as ph temperature presence of sunlight and solids according to current studies coronaviruses are more fragile in the environment than intestinal viruses like norovirus adenoviruses rotavirus and hepatitis virus which exist in wastewater treatment plants 104 105 the longer period time for retention in the wastewater treatment plants could assist the inactivation of coronavirus in swedge dramatically and this effect is definitely expected to be further obvious at upper temperatures 106 3 1 3 tertiary treatment phase the third phase of treatment includes operations such as coagulation filtration ultraviolet uv chlorination ozonation performic acid nanomaterials etc 92 nanomaterials such as titanium dioxide zero valent iron and carbon nanotubes cnts have been applied for the inactivation and elimination of viruses in sewage 107 108 the structure of the virus consists of a genome and a protein capsid without or with an envelope the initial purpose of the viral disinfection such as uv chlorination ozonization etc is to change one of these parts by applying environmental stress 105 the viral envelope is more vulnerable to disruption hence non enveloping virus illustrates the upper resistance to inactivation and less susceptibility to unfavorable situations 109 3 1 3 1 chlorination free available chlorine was released through disinfection procedures and its main sources are chlorine elements chloramines sodium hypochlorite chlorine dioxide calcium hypochlorite and chloroisocyanurates the presence of chlorine as hypochlorite ion clo and hypochlorous acid hocl stay the most successful methods to combat viral particles hypochlorite is one of the powerful oxidizing agents which is oxidizing organic contaminants effectively while undissociated hypochlorous acid is the microbiocidal agent primarily 110 111 wang et al reported that the sars cov was inactivated completely in sewage for 30 min at the free residual concentration of clo2 equal to almost 2 19 mg l or chlorine concentration greater than 0 4 mg l 95 chin et al confirmed these results by some tests conducted in vitro on sars cov 2 utilizing 1 99 diluted household bleach in order to inactive the virus after 5 min 42 one of the major concerns and challenges in successful chlorination can be the existence of ammonia which required chlorine for additional co pollutants and ph the cl binds with the ammonia make a chlorine combination chloramines which is not effective and efficient enough against viral particles like free chlorine therefore it is definitely pivotal to assure that cl is not adsorbed by different demanding substrates such as organic matter ferrous ion ammonia hydrogen sulfide and nitrites organic matters normally neutralize chlorine based materials which cause short term risks on the environment for plants and soil 112 113 randazzo et al reported preliminary research on the existence of coronavirus rna in wastewater after the second and third treatments after normal activated sludge about 11 of samples remained positive to coronavirus rna however after the third treatment 100 of samples changed to negative by using disinfection with naclo and in several cases which can be combined with ultraviolet uv 40 zhang et al used a high dose of sodium hypochlorite to disinfect hospital sewage from sars cov 2 however this method had a high level of residual by products which possessed notable environmental risks 114 3 1 3 2 performic acid performic acid is a less stable common disinfectant and oxidizing agent with the formula ch2o3 which is a combination of hydrogen peroxide 35 and formic acid 10 to 20 115 it has many benefits over chlorine and can be more efficient to inactive viruses bacteria and fungus during wastewater treatment 116 performic acid also can apply at conditions with low temperature under 25 c hence it can be used in cold areas or during winter 117 performic acid decomposes quickly which leads to enhance the amount of reactive oxygen and consequently making more powerful disinfection and produce non toxic h2o2 and formic acid as by products 118 3 1 3 3 ultraviolet uv uv radiation effectively controls the growth of microbial in any medium like air water and any kind of surface currently different environmental public settings around the world such as health care facilities hospitals airports and shopping centers are considering the uv disinfection devices implementation for disinfection of the surfaces that are frequently touched and streams of circulating air however the applied uv c energy dosage must be balanced in order to obtain acceptable biocidal efficiency levels and prevent excessive energy that can damage the surfaces and reduce the predicted lifetime 119 in recent years the ultraviolet disinfection technique is more interested in water treatment because it is a clean disinfectant and effective against most waterborne pathogens comprising several microbial pollutants that are relatively resistant 120 moreover this method can easily operate and install and it is non corrosive the viral particles under the uv light lose their potential to infect and replicate by damaging the genome and protein comprising the break down of the phosphodiester bonds and the links with extra molecules 121 darnell et al showed the partial inactivation of sars cov by uv c light irradiation 254 nm dose 4016 μw cm 2 which could reach to 400 fold reduction in infectious viral load at 1 min with enhancing efficiency up to 6 min the viral particles became totally inactivated after almost 15 min below the limit of the detection while no impacts of uv a 365 nm with dose 2133 μw cm 2 exposure were observed on the virus over a 15 min period of the exposure 122 disinfection efficiency of uv may be reduced dramatically by algae with biofouling of the lamp colored and turbid substances protecting microorganisms 123 hence the secondary treatment followed by uv helps residual protection and assures microbial shielding redundancy 3 1 3 4 ozonization ozone is a clean and potent oxidizing factor which is an effective microbicide against protozoan bacteria and viruses by attacking viruses and destroying the viral protein the ozone technique has exhibited excellent performance against non enveloped and enveloped viruses in water aerosols and surfaces comprising analogous viruses in morphology to sars cov 2 124 125 ronaldo et al assessed the virucidal performance of ozonated water which is a strong oxidizing factor against sars cov 2 the source of ozonated water at a low concentration 0 2 0 8 ppm was the particular faucet which demonstrated the reduction of two log10 in virus infectiveness after exposure to ozonated water for about 1 min in comparison to control groups 126 the combination of treatment techniques comprising uv treatment ozonation and chlorination could inactive about almost 99 99 of fecal coliform in water and no coronavirus was found after disinfection the studies revealed that applying the ozonation technique enhanced transmittance of uv by almost 20 30 inside the water and as a result uv dose can be decreased 127 3 2 removal of other emerging contaminants in general conventional treatment systems that are existing today might not be able to completely remove these huge amounts of organic micropollutants during the covid 19 pandemic in urban wastewaters although additional research is needed various pharmaceuticals components were detected in the inlet and outlet waters in different wastewater treatment plants in the past which means several kinds of these substances could not be removed effectively by existing systems hence more specific and effective treatments are needed in order to reduce the environmental impacts of sewage proper water treatments include chemical precipitation to remove phosphorus ionic exchange for removing ions biological systems to eliminate nitrogen aops for removing toxic organic compounds distillation for volatile organic compounds removal and adsorption for removal of inorganic and organic pollutants some of these water treatment methods have not to be applied on a large scale and are under research because there is a lack of information about their reactor design issues proper data about their mechanisms and the impacts of operational variables 46 128 129 in the following different water treatment methods with proper efficiency for cleaning and pharmaceutical compounds are discussed and the advantage and disadvantages of each method are mentioned in table 5 moreover some of the related studies with these methods are summarized in table 6 3 2 1 adsorption in order to separate the interface of two phases adsorption can be used with two classifications chemisorption and physisorption depending on the adsorbate and adsorbent interactions one of the significant advantages of the adsorption method is the regeneration or recycling of adsobents which makes it economical for use in water treatment the reusing of the adsorbent mainly relied on the regeneration efficiency of the adsorbent the pharmaceuticals and surfactants adsorption depends on the properties of the solution adsorbent and adsorbate for example surface charge pore volume pore size and surface area of the adsorbent and continuously the polarity size molecular weight hydrophobicity functionality geometry and solubility for adsorbate in an aqueous solution 130 133 many different adsorbents have been synthesized for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds and surfactants from water the nanomaterials can perform very well for surfactant adsorption ncibi et al used carbon nanotubes cnts with adsorption capacities of 156 and 312 mg g for removal of ctab and sdbs surfactants the performance for the removal efficiency of surfactants can be increased by ultrasonication 134 also carbon nanotubes are effective adsorbents for removing pharmaceutical compounds 135 however carbon nanotubes in the largescale application are limited because of several problems such as difficult separation contribute to leakage into water bodies and eventually has adverse effects on human health and ecosystems 134 activated carbon can be considered as one of the most effective materials for the adsorption of surfactants and pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater 136 138 schouten et al reported that activated carbon which has a proper microporous structure in the average pore diameter of almost 1 5 nm can remove anionic surfactants such as las and aos the pore sizes and ionic strength are important factors for this process the macro 50 nm and meso 2 5 nm pores are suitable for the adsorption of aos and las it turns out that activated carbon and double layered hydroxide ldh can be considered as the proper candidate for the adsorption of the anionic surfactant due to several properties such as being cost effective and having high adsorption capacity the ionic interactions caused higher adsorption in comparison with non ionic interactions 139 the effect of pore and particle size on the anionic surfactant adsorption by four activated carbons which have various pore sizes indicated that the activated carbon with a smaller pore size between 0 56 and 0 77 nm could adsorb more anionic surfactant in comparison with other activated carbons the particle size has a remarkable effect on the small particle due to the complex compound formation between cations of surfactant molecules and activated carbon although using activated carbon has several drawbacks such as inefficient regeneration poor adsorption selectivity and expensive synthesis however taking advantage of economical raw materials which have efficient regeneration ability for the synthesis of activated carbons can improve this adsorbent for the removal of surfactants 140 139 moreover according to the literature activated carbons have a high performance in the adsorption of pharmaceuticals one of the advantages of activated carbon for removing pharmaceuticals is that pharmacologically or toxic active products do not generate 129 chitosan is a biocompatible biodegradable and non toxic mucoadhesive biopolymer it is an economical renewable and generally available biomaterial and after cellulose is the most abundant natural polysaccharide 141 parhizgar et al investigated that this adsorbent could successfully remove 97 of the sdbs anionic surfactant and its adsorption capacity was almost 6 38 mg g 142 generally from literature results the unmodified chitosan has low adsorption capacity in comparison to modified chitosan for anionic surfactants chitosan can be modified with various methods such as doping with metals or cross linking contribution to the higher surface area to having more active sites 143 3 2 2 advanced oxidation processes aops aops can degrade almost all kinds of organic pollutants into harmless products this method is considered an environmentally friendly process because pollutants could not transfer from one phase to another one and massive hazardous sludge does not be produced in this method 144 145 aops can reduce organic pollutant concentration from hundreds ppm to less than near 5 ppb 146 this method relies on the generation of oh reactive hydroxyl radicals after series of oxidation reactions ultimate mineralization products which are co2 and h2o are produced aop can mix with ozone o3 fenton s reagent h2o2 fe2 photocatalysis and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and combine with ultraviolet uv irradiation like tio2 uv ozone h2o2 uv ozone uv and h2o2 uv methods that include uv radiation can be considered as photochemical processes uv source improves the reduction of fe2 and fe3 which can be reacted with h2o2 in order to produce more hydroxyl radicals 147 148 150 some studies have been done with using aops as an effective treatment for pharmaceutical pollutants 130 151 and surfactants 152 153 mechanisms of degradation might vary from one method to another one the fenton based aops popularity has been much dependent on the selection of iron based catalysts for water treatment although due to the limitation in the solubility of iron species the efforts of research have focused on the development of iron free fenton systems for the h2o2 activation however one disadvantage of using fenton s technique is sludge formation which contains iron hydroxide as a secondary product thus sludge disposal should be considered in the initial cost and design process moreover the fenton process requires continuous ph adjustment because this process needs a lower ph 154 156 the aops are recommended to be applied in new or existing wastewater treatment plants for highly concentrated wastewater aops are suitable to be considered as pre treatment to decompose recalcitrant organic contaminants into biodegradable intermediates or products that can later be eliminated in biological post treatments 154 3 2 2 1 ultrasonic ultrasonic irradiation sonochemistry is a promising technique for the degradation of various types of hazardous organic compounds and pollutants from wastewater with undesirable impacts in the water environment ultrasonic irradiation can commence pyrolytic and oxidative degradation procedures this method does not need any chemical additives and can successfully apply to sludge colored or turbid solutions ultrasonic irradiation exposure induces acoustic cavitation in water sonochemistry is in the category of aops a phenomenon that is related to the production growth and intense collapse of gaseous bubbles into water known as cavitation in the pressure 1000 atm and high temperature 5000 k conditions irradiation of water with ultrasound decomposes water molecules into highly reactive radicals including ḥ and oh these reactive radicals can react with each other or diffuse to consider as an oxidant 157 159 kıdak and doğan removed and degraded antibiotic amoxicillin by ultrasonic irradiation alone and with ozonation the ultrasonic irradiation treatment was applied at three different frequencies 575 861 and 1141 khz due to the synergistic impact the combination of ultrasound and ozone gave rise to a rate constant of almost 2 5 min 1 which was 625 times more than alone ultrasound this hybrid degradation pathway which is considered an advanced oxidative process confirms the lower toxicity due to the low producing toxic intermediates 160 serna galvis et al demonstrated the total elimination and mineralization of the antidepressant drug fluoxetine by sonochemical process combined with biological treatment the alone biological treatment cannot remove the contaminant even after five days and under desirable conditions but the sonochemical process 600 khz was able to eliminate the pharmaceutical after 240 and 360 min of sonicating in the biological procedure microorganisms could remove 20 and 70 of the primary total organic carbon respectively 88 3 2 3 biological treatments biological treatment is a common method especially for detergents and pharmaceutical pollutants that exist in wastewater the effluent of this method can be returned to the river and the sludge can be used as a fertilizer for the soil the mentioned contamination can be considered as a nutrient source or energy for microorganisms in the biodegradation process the mechanism of biodegradation can be changed by several factors such as anaerobic and aerobic conditions or the chemical structure of the contamination 161 163 aerobic degradation can be accomplished in various ways such as using activated sludge tanks oxidation bonds and trickling filters each method has a considerable impact on removal efficiency although activated sludge tanks have almost 99 removal efficiency for las however the trickling filters have a wider range of 89 1 99 1 removal efficiencies 161 164 moreover las has removal efficiency in the range of 40 85 under anaerobic conditions depending on which method was used 165 166 in addition the high chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of pharmaceutical wastewater caused it suitable for anaerobic processes based on some studies cod reduction on antibiotic residues was by 70 to 75 and some research reports that combining a filter and the anaerobic sludge blanket leads to high removal efficiency 167 168 however there are many limitations that cause it unsuitable to consider as a sole treatment method for the removal of surfactants from wastewater one disadvantage is that this method is suitable for a low concentration of surfactant this is because in a concentration above almost 1 000 000 μg l the surfactant can depolarize the bacterial cell and can destroy function and structure 164 169 by taking advantage of chemical pre treatment for wastewater before enters to the treatment plant mentioned problems could be mitigated the huge advantage of pre treatment of wastewater is to convert these compounds to products that could be more biodegraded there are numerous methods for per treatment and aops can be considered as one of the commonly used methods 164 169 3 2 4 coagulation and flocculation coagulation flocculation is considered a chemical water treatment method that can usually be applied prior to filtration and sedimentation this simple and low cost method is used to improve the ability of a treatment action in order to remove pollutants such as surfactants coagulation can form a mass which is large enough to be trapped or settle in the filter flocculation is considered as gentle agitation or stirring to reinforce the particles formed to be clustered into large masses to settle from solution inorganic coagulants polymer type such as fe2 so4 3 feso4 7h2o and al2 so4 3 18h2o are generally used in this process 170 171 residual contents of inorganic coagulants like al2 so4 3 18h2o might cause alzheimer s disease 172 thus it is better to use fewer inorganic coagulants and these materials should be replaced with ecofriendly materials 173 it has been turned out that this method is effective and useful for the removal of the surfactant from wastewaters in many kinds of research removing the surfactant was roughly 95 in wastewater and cod reduction was approximately 88 147 4 conclusion and future perspective presently there is a considerable research gap in the survival of sars cov 2 in the water and the potential of coronavirus transmission by untreated and treated wastewater the excretion of the virus via feces is quite obvious from recent researches hence this research investigates the occurrence detection and recommended removal treatment ways of coronavirus in wastewater with different techniques commonly used at the different stages of the treatment including primary secondary and tertiary phases in the wastewater treatment plants the research of nasseri et al is a practical example of using the proposed methods to inactivate the sars cov 2 in wwtp they evaluated the presence of sars cov 2 in the outlet samples from ultraviolet uv disinfection module outlet 5 to 6 and samples from chlorine disinfection module outlet 1 to 4 of wwtps in southern tehran iran and the results showed that only chlorine disinfection samples remain positive hence the uv disinfection was more successful than chlorine disinfection and operators of wwtps should enhance the free residual chlorine concentration to 0 5 mg l 1 for effective disinfection 192 the development of environmentally friendly and low cost processes for viral removal are other opportunities for scholars to manage and reduce the growing health and environmental risks from any similar future crisis another crucial environmental concern related to the covid 19 epidemic is the extra use of disinfectants detergents and soaps and the overuse of specific drugs to protect against virus or novel mental problems related to quarantine their excretion into wastewater not only can pollute drinking water resources but also includes a potential threat to the aquatic environment hence future studies should be directed to update and re design wwtp to remove these extra amounts of organic compounds efficiently and create environmentally friendly cleaning products such as hand sanitizers and soaps with low toxic by product formation for humans and environmental safety further communication among regulatory agencies with chemical biological and medical researchers is needed to explore additional acceptance and validation of these water treatment approaches which are applied to make claims of successful water treatment

13499,the novel sars cov 2 is expanding internationally while the current focus is on limiting its transmission from direct contact with infected patients and surfaces during the pandemic the secondary transmission potential via sewage should not be underestimated especially in low income and developing countries with weak wastewater treatment technologies recent studies have indicated sars cov 2 positivity also be detected in the feces of patients therefore the risk of transmission and infection can be increased into sewage by the fecal oral way mainly in some parts of the globe with a high amount of open defecation this review collected scattered data and recent studies about the direct and indirect effects of coronavirus in the water cycle the direct impacts of covid 19 on wastewater are related to the presence of the coronavirus and suitable viral removal methods in different phases of treatment in wastewater treatment plants the indirect effects of covid 19 on wastewater are related to the overuse of cleaning and disinfecting products to protect against viral infection and the overuse of certain drugs to protect against virus or novel mental problems and panic to covid 19 and consequently their presence in wastewater this unexpected situation leads to changes in the quality of wastewater and brings adverse and harmful effects for the human aquatic organisms and the environment therefore applying effective wastewater treatment technologies with low toxic by products in wastewater treatment plants will be helpful to prevent the increasing occurrence of these extra contaminants in the environment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords covid 19 coronavirus wastewater treatment cleaning products disinfectants pharmaceuticals 1 introduction the crisis of covid 19 which is caused by the new coronavirus sars cov 2 is presently posing a considerable threat to the economic growth and the health of the world especially developing countries sars cov 2 is a single stranded virus with a positive sense of rna and spherical shape which belongs to the coronaviridae family 1 6 sars cov 2 is more transmitted between the people rather than sars cov and mers cov especially in dense population places such as public transportations industrial processing factories prisons nursing homes and etc 7 9 despite the worldwide lockdown attempts the rates of positive covid 19 cases are still high the world health organization who has reported the principal ways of coronavirus exposure are inhalation of respiratory droplets produced when a patient sneezes coughs and exhales or direct contact with infected surfaces 10 recent scientific researches announced the possible waterborne transmission of the sars cov 2 moreover the presence of coronavirus rna was confirmed by several reports in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 11 12 the risk of transmission by the fecal oral way into sewage can also be a crucial concern and should be highlighted in the areas that have not adequate water treatment and sanitation facilities 12 13 even when the respiratory tract shows negative stool may stay positive for sars cov 2 and it raises a set of concerns about the possible presence of the virus in the effluent and choosing the appropriate methods for wastewater treatment to inactivate the virus 14 moreover during the covid 19 pandemic the municipal wastewater can usually observe other excessive contaminants like disinfectants pharmaceuticals and disposable personal protective equipment which are generally excreted by humankind activities 15 the covid 19 pandemic has also raised the consumption of certain drugs comprising antimicrobials and antidepressants between people due to improper attempts to protect themselves against the covid 19 with antibiotics while it is a viral sickness and the worldwide occurrence of anxiety and depression as a result they can be found in the environment particularly in the urban water cycle which is harmful to aquatic organisms and the environment 16 19 the purpose of this review is to collect the present knowledge about the case of disturbances caused by covid 19 in wastewater both directly and indirectly that can encourage researchers in various fields to conduct further research about this emerging problem the direct existence of the covid 19 in sewage and wastewater by human droplets stool or hospital wastes the capability of transmission in this way and effective methods to inactive the virus in the wastewater indirect effects of covid 19 on wastewater include increased use of disinfectants hand sanitizers and surfactants including detergents and soaps and the over or misuse of certain medications such as antimicrobials antidepressants etc ultimately collecting the efficient removal methods for these emerging wastewater contaminants is the other aim of this research 2 impact of covid 19 on wastewater 2 1 sars cov 2 most viruses found out in stools such as sars coronavirus can come from the superior respiratory tracts by deglutition respiratory secretions the virus can be destructed by stomach acidity but it may be protected when mixed with meals or potential resistor to acidic ph therefore it can pass through the intestine moreover it can derive from the replication of the virus in intestinal cells 20 21 in 2002 and 2003 during the two outbreaks of sars cov up to 73 of infected people during the disease development had gastrointestinal symptoms and the existence rna of sars cov was illustrated in the fecal specimens even after ten weeks from the onset of symptoms 22 23 researches during the mers cov pandemic showed that one fourth of infected people announced symptoms like abdominal pain or diarrhea before severe respiratory symptoms and in 14 6 of stool specimens mers cov rna was detected 24 25 zhou et al reported that intestinal mucous cells were extremely sensitive to mers cov and could help viral replication 26 recent studies demonstrated sars cov 2 positivity also be detected in the feces of patients in the absence of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms for example live sars cov 2 was observed inside the stool of two infected persons without diarrhea symptoms 14 lescure et al have also confirmed sars cov 2 in urine specimens of patients 27 tang a et al found sars cov 2 from stool specimen of an asymptomatic ten year child which was evident for considering stool to be an extra routine diagnostic specimen separate from the respiratory tract samples 28 the coronavirus viral concentration in feces of infected people who tested positive were exhibited in the range of almost 104 108 copies l however in sewage feces dilution is caused to reduce the viral load between almost 102 106 5 copies l 29 although the possible infection of coronavirus is not proved the existence of the virus is confirmed in the stool of a human until 33 days when the infected person s test is negative for sars cov 2 12 the risk of infection increase in some parts of the globe and with a high amount of open defecation according to unicef 892 million people around the world still use open defecation 30 for example statistical data on november 2019 demonstrated that in india about 28 7 of rural people still do not have access to any type of toilet 31 hence a considerable amount of viruses would be expected in sewage from the number of diagnosed infected individuals which has been exhibited in studies from many countries affected by this crisis currently real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rrt pcr nested rt pcr and quantitative rt pcr rt qpcr are the methods which are applied for the tracing of cvid 19 rna 29 table 1 additionally medical wastewater of toxic and hazardous materials must be treated before sending out to the wastewater system sewage services in healthcare facilities must be managed precisely and in a different way after the covid 19 crisis especially in the areas with low financial and technical resources like palestine and india or some regions of africa 30 32 33 moreover huge demand in consumption of personal protective equipment ppe such as masks gloves and shields and improper disposal of this infected solid waste into the environment can increase not only the physical pollutants in water bodies but also can increase the risk of coronavirus transmission 2 2 cleaning and disinfecting products coronavirus can remain viable on surfaces such as stainless steel cardboard and plastic for hours or even days 42 43 therefore one of the best effective and practical ways to prevent and cope with the spread of coronavirus is to disinfect the surface and hands and washing them successively in recent research it turns out that during the pandemic from january to february 2020 in wuhan city of china almost 2000 tons of disinfectant were released into sewage systems 44 45 these huge contaminated water without any treatment can directly be discharged into water bodies or can reduce the water quality and create significant problems for wastewater treatment this situation not only brings a high danger risk for drinking water resources but also threatens the marine environment 46 47 it turns out that excessive and successive use of disinfectants can increase drinking water consumption by 20 which could lead to more than 15 18 wastewater generation 46 furthermore the huge consumption of disinfectants detergents and soaps could find ways to access and contaminate water bodies which is one of the major environmental concerns related to the covid 19 pandemic 46 47 antimicrobial resistance has become one of the other crucial concerns around the world due to the overuse of antimicrobials antivirals antibiotics and antiparasitics and extreme consumption of alcohol surfactants and hydrogen peroxides as the cleansing agents which are caused microorganisms resistance 48 2 2 1 surfactants according to who proper handwashing with soap and rubbing both sides of hands take at least 20 30 s 49 the detriment to coronavirus spike proteins can lead to the inactivation virus 50 detergents and soaps are consist of surfactants which are explained as the damaging factor for spike proteins or peplomers of the virus for example the ebola virus which indicates spike protein mediated host attachment can be inactivated by surfactant nanoemulsion therefore researchers have widely approved surfactants 51 surfactants are considered emerging pollutants that are not easily degradable and are stable in the environment for a long time they are toxic for microorganisms and mammals in different environmental matrices 52 53 in addition during the pandemic there are many other tasks including disinfecting the indoor or outdoor environment washing clothes showers and cleaning which consume a large amount of water 46 a single hand washes for each person might consume two liters of water if the tap is closed this amount of water used can be increased to 4 l if the tap is remained open under these circumstances each person consumes more quantity of water than before for example in bundelkhand city of india water demand was increased 60 70 in a similar way massive operations of fumigation and disinfection have been done in all around words in order to disinfect avenues streets hospitals markets this situation contributed to huge wastewater generation which mainly contains pollutants such as detergents 46 the other main problem of common soap in hard water is sedimentation which has led to the improvement of organic chemicals in spite of the fact that the structural characteristics of these developed compounds are like soap their chemical properties are different and they can foam whenever they are being used in hard or acid water detergents formulation consists of several types of surfactants surfactants relied on their electrolytic dissociation and are mainly separated into four groups according to the charge on their head group including non ionic amphoteric anionic and cationic 54 56 properties of surfactants can be defined by the head group of them 57 various used types of surfactants are shown in table 2 and several impacts of detergents on wastewaters are explained in table 3 2 2 2 hand sanitizer hand sanitizer can be separated into two main groups alcohol free or alcohol based alcohol based hand sanitizers are recommended by who during the covid 19 pandemic due to their several advantages including rapid action and protection against viruses and bacteria this situation leads to the huge consumption of alcohol based hand sanitizers for example in japan in april 2020 the production of alcohol disinfectants in the kao company increased by 2000 to fight the shortage 67 45 it turns out the overuse of hand sanitizer might become harmful to the environment and human health 68 overusing hand sanitizer contributes to antimicrobial resistance putting more burdens on healthcare professionals who already have been struggling with this problem 44 the most effective formulation of hand sanitizer contains 62 95 alcohol because it could inactivate viruses and denature the proteins of microbes in general alcohol based hand sanitizers are mainly made up of isopropyl alcohols and ethanol 67 45 ethanol has a huge directly negative impact on aquatic organisms many kinds of research have been done to investigate the effects of ethanol on various species in addition the large amounts of isopropanol in water might lead to environmental impairment due to its high potency to decrease oxygen in the water which ultimately brings adverse effects on the aquatic living system 69 2 3 pharmaceutical compounds during the covid 19 pandemic the consumption of certain drugs such as antibiotics antidepressants and sedatives drug of abuse anabolic steroids vitamin supplements antidiarrheals antitussives antipyretics and analgesics has increased among people this increase in demand and use of the drugs has enhanced concern globally which is affecting developing and even developed countries 16 70 72 the consumption of antimicrobials in the prevention and therapy of covid 19 is arising a lot of people incorrectly try to protect themselves against the covid 19 by self medicate with antibiotics despite it is a viral sickness these attempts are mainly prevalent in developing societies 73 74 the primary wave of covid 19 widespread may have significantly affected antimicrobial utilization in hospitals silva et al evaluated the antimicrobial consumption of specific hospital during the covid 19 pandemic in brazil they found a 2500 higher rate of azithromycin consumption in the covid 19 emergency department and a 2000 higher rate of azithromycin consumption in the clinical ward moreover the usage of amoxicillin clavulanate had a notably higher rate in all covid 19 clusters 71 the who and other specialists suggested that antimicrobial treatment should not be started for suspected or affirmed mild covid 19 unless in critically covid 19 patients with a high clinical suspicion of bacterial infection 75 the increased antimicrobials usage can have critical outcomes with the existence of antimicrobial elements in the environment which can stimulate resistance of the antimicrobials and even in minimal amounts can present unpleasant impacts in non target creatures it has been indicated that above 80 of amoxicillin is discharged by urine from the person s body after 2 h and consequently the existence of amoxicillin in water sources and wastewaters can lead to harmful ecological problems 76 a new typhoid fever epidemic in pakistan has been related to the resistance of antibiotics due to inappropriate consumption of drugs weak sanitation and polluted water supplies 77 moreover the novel covid 19 pandemic has influenced people s mental health due to bereavement fear lockdown and loss of income in society leading to an increase in depressive episodes in the countries such as uk china spain and the usa 16 78 79 antidepressants which are considered in the classification of psychiatric drugs are in the first step of therapy to treat depression anxiety and episodes which are resulting from the imposed quarantine psychiatric drugs are in the category of organic compounds which are comprising sertraline carbamazepine fluoxetine citalopram etc 80 results indicated that european countries are the most antidepressants consumers in the world based on the organization for economic co operation and development oecd data 81 these drugs are relatively metabolized and excreted hence they enter into wastewater and traditional treatments are not able to remove them varied literature confirms the existence of antidepressants in water sources worldwide and wastewater treatment plants which can potentially be toxically bioaccumulated in the tissues of water organisms such as some aquatic plants mollusks and fishes 82 the fate of these emerging pollutants whenever released into the environment depends on the physical and chemical nature of the pharmaceutical components this issue is significant because several of these ingredients have been found in drinking water sources and wastewater effluents 70 83 84 nason et al detected different chemicals and evaluated their trends from daily collected samples from march 19 to april 15 2020 and weekly composite samples from march 19 to june 30 2020 in primary wastewater sludge from wwtps in new haven ct usa however they did not know what chemicals were existed before analyzing samples about antidepressant drugs sertraline and citalopram had a clear increase in daily and weekly samples respectively moreover they found an increase in the concentration of some opioids and drugs of abuse such as methadone hydromorphone and cocaine in the weekly samples and increasing acetaminophen as a drug to relieve the symptoms of covid 19 comprising headache and fever in their weekly sample analysis the increased concentrations of hydroxychloroquine as a drug that received considerable attention due to its potential to treat covid 19 were also obvious in daily sludge samples in the third week of investigation 72 the specifications and environmental impacts of some drugs are collected in table 4 therefore the covid 19 pandemic has huge negative direct and indirect impacts on water and wastewater quality all of the already mentioned new contaminants can find a way to reach surface water and negatively affect the environment fig 1 3 wastewater treatment during covid 19 the treated wastewater from treatment plants is usually discharged into receiving bodies of water or reused for purposes such as recreation and irrigation this section deals with the introduction and evaluation of the effectiveness of different physical biological and chemical methods and unit operations that are currently used to remove organic contaminants and deactivate viruses hence they can generally be used at the varied stages of the wastewater treatment during the covid 19 pandemic 3 1 coronavirus removal preventing the spread of the virus in the environment all around the world is crucial before utilizing reclaimed water there are three main phases to treat the infected water from coronavirus to safe water for recycling or reusing the first treatment phase includes physical actions such as screening grit chamber and initial sedimentation in order to eliminate infected solids that are suspended in the wastewater the second and third treatment phases consist of biological treatment actions to eliminate the biodegradable organic matter and physicochemical treatment actions to further decrease turbidity remaining organics heavy metals and pathogens such as coronavirus respectively 91 92 although specific additional research about these methods on sars cov 2 regular monitoring of their efficiency in real water treatment with considering all factors affecting virus survival and environmental considerations is needed to choose the best disinfection technology 3 1 1 first treatment phase the first treatment phase consists of physical processes that include the elimination of volatile and fixed solids suspended in sewage via physical barriers virus adsorption onto the large suspended solids in sewage which is accompanied by gravitational sedimentation is considered as the main and first mechanism in the treatment phase for the virus removal 93 however according to the available scientific reports the gravitational sedimentation in the primary treatment phase is insufficient for the viral removal entirely from the sewage the removal of coronavirus rna through wastewater treatment operations has been seen for additional treatments comprising secondary and tertiary treatment and tertiary treated wastewater is reused for irrigation and public domain directly 94 3 1 2 secondary treatment phase biological techniques such as membrane bioreactor activated sludge extended aeration biological processes etc are mainly used as part of the secondary treatment phase in the wastewater treatment plants 94 past studies have exhibited a higher elimination of the intestinal viruses by secondary treatment processes rather than the first treatment processes other studies have also reported the coronavirus resistance and survival in primary treatment was slightly higher than in secondary treatment due to the existence of higher organics in the primary treatment stage which were protecting viruses from damaging 95 96 in the activated sludge technique uptake of viral particles on the organic biomass and elimination by sedimentation through the secondary clarifier assigned as the important and main mechanism for the virus elimination in the wastewater treatment 97 the membrane bioreactor is used in the secondary treatment phase of wastewater to remove viral particles considerably and it consists of membrane filtration and a suspended growth bioreactor membrane technology is cost effective and environmentally friendly with small or no chemical usage a considerable decrease in the equipment size and easy accessibility 98 99 based on recent studies the high energy requirement is the major limitation of this technology which is among 0 45 and 0 65 kwh m 3 for the highest optimum performance 100 101 membrane bioreactor operations are designed with more retention times of solids towards activated sludge processes which leads to varied treatment performances and other related conditions the disadvantages of membrane compared to activated sludge are related to more operational difficulties and complexity 102 simmons et al applied the membrane bioreactor process in the secondary treatment phase and could attain the log removal values of 6 8 6 3 4 8 for enterovirus adenovirus and norovirus respectively 103 sars cov 2 is greatly similar to other coronaviruses and they are seriously affected by decontaminants or various environmental parameters such as ph temperature presence of sunlight and solids according to current studies coronaviruses are more fragile in the environment than intestinal viruses like norovirus adenoviruses rotavirus and hepatitis virus which exist in wastewater treatment plants 104 105 the longer period time for retention in the wastewater treatment plants could assist the inactivation of coronavirus in swedge dramatically and this effect is definitely expected to be further obvious at upper temperatures 106 3 1 3 tertiary treatment phase the third phase of treatment includes operations such as coagulation filtration ultraviolet uv chlorination ozonation performic acid nanomaterials etc 92 nanomaterials such as titanium dioxide zero valent iron and carbon nanotubes cnts have been applied for the inactivation and elimination of viruses in sewage 107 108 the structure of the virus consists of a genome and a protein capsid without or with an envelope the initial purpose of the viral disinfection such as uv chlorination ozonization etc is to change one of these parts by applying environmental stress 105 the viral envelope is more vulnerable to disruption hence non enveloping virus illustrates the upper resistance to inactivation and less susceptibility to unfavorable situations 109 3 1 3 1 chlorination free available chlorine was released through disinfection procedures and its main sources are chlorine elements chloramines sodium hypochlorite chlorine dioxide calcium hypochlorite and chloroisocyanurates the presence of chlorine as hypochlorite ion clo and hypochlorous acid hocl stay the most successful methods to combat viral particles hypochlorite is one of the powerful oxidizing agents which is oxidizing organic contaminants effectively while undissociated hypochlorous acid is the microbiocidal agent primarily 110 111 wang et al reported that the sars cov was inactivated completely in sewage for 30 min at the free residual concentration of clo2 equal to almost 2 19 mg l or chlorine concentration greater than 0 4 mg l 95 chin et al confirmed these results by some tests conducted in vitro on sars cov 2 utilizing 1 99 diluted household bleach in order to inactive the virus after 5 min 42 one of the major concerns and challenges in successful chlorination can be the existence of ammonia which required chlorine for additional co pollutants and ph the cl binds with the ammonia make a chlorine combination chloramines which is not effective and efficient enough against viral particles like free chlorine therefore it is definitely pivotal to assure that cl is not adsorbed by different demanding substrates such as organic matter ferrous ion ammonia hydrogen sulfide and nitrites organic matters normally neutralize chlorine based materials which cause short term risks on the environment for plants and soil 112 113 randazzo et al reported preliminary research on the existence of coronavirus rna in wastewater after the second and third treatments after normal activated sludge about 11 of samples remained positive to coronavirus rna however after the third treatment 100 of samples changed to negative by using disinfection with naclo and in several cases which can be combined with ultraviolet uv 40 zhang et al used a high dose of sodium hypochlorite to disinfect hospital sewage from sars cov 2 however this method had a high level of residual by products which possessed notable environmental risks 114 3 1 3 2 performic acid performic acid is a less stable common disinfectant and oxidizing agent with the formula ch2o3 which is a combination of hydrogen peroxide 35 and formic acid 10 to 20 115 it has many benefits over chlorine and can be more efficient to inactive viruses bacteria and fungus during wastewater treatment 116 performic acid also can apply at conditions with low temperature under 25 c hence it can be used in cold areas or during winter 117 performic acid decomposes quickly which leads to enhance the amount of reactive oxygen and consequently making more powerful disinfection and produce non toxic h2o2 and formic acid as by products 118 3 1 3 3 ultraviolet uv uv radiation effectively controls the growth of microbial in any medium like air water and any kind of surface currently different environmental public settings around the world such as health care facilities hospitals airports and shopping centers are considering the uv disinfection devices implementation for disinfection of the surfaces that are frequently touched and streams of circulating air however the applied uv c energy dosage must be balanced in order to obtain acceptable biocidal efficiency levels and prevent excessive energy that can damage the surfaces and reduce the predicted lifetime 119 in recent years the ultraviolet disinfection technique is more interested in water treatment because it is a clean disinfectant and effective against most waterborne pathogens comprising several microbial pollutants that are relatively resistant 120 moreover this method can easily operate and install and it is non corrosive the viral particles under the uv light lose their potential to infect and replicate by damaging the genome and protein comprising the break down of the phosphodiester bonds and the links with extra molecules 121 darnell et al showed the partial inactivation of sars cov by uv c light irradiation 254 nm dose 4016 μw cm 2 which could reach to 400 fold reduction in infectious viral load at 1 min with enhancing efficiency up to 6 min the viral particles became totally inactivated after almost 15 min below the limit of the detection while no impacts of uv a 365 nm with dose 2133 μw cm 2 exposure were observed on the virus over a 15 min period of the exposure 122 disinfection efficiency of uv may be reduced dramatically by algae with biofouling of the lamp colored and turbid substances protecting microorganisms 123 hence the secondary treatment followed by uv helps residual protection and assures microbial shielding redundancy 3 1 3 4 ozonization ozone is a clean and potent oxidizing factor which is an effective microbicide against protozoan bacteria and viruses by attacking viruses and destroying the viral protein the ozone technique has exhibited excellent performance against non enveloped and enveloped viruses in water aerosols and surfaces comprising analogous viruses in morphology to sars cov 2 124 125 ronaldo et al assessed the virucidal performance of ozonated water which is a strong oxidizing factor against sars cov 2 the source of ozonated water at a low concentration 0 2 0 8 ppm was the particular faucet which demonstrated the reduction of two log10 in virus infectiveness after exposure to ozonated water for about 1 min in comparison to control groups 126 the combination of treatment techniques comprising uv treatment ozonation and chlorination could inactive about almost 99 99 of fecal coliform in water and no coronavirus was found after disinfection the studies revealed that applying the ozonation technique enhanced transmittance of uv by almost 20 30 inside the water and as a result uv dose can be decreased 127 3 2 removal of other emerging contaminants in general conventional treatment systems that are existing today might not be able to completely remove these huge amounts of organic micropollutants during the covid 19 pandemic in urban wastewaters although additional research is needed various pharmaceuticals components were detected in the inlet and outlet waters in different wastewater treatment plants in the past which means several kinds of these substances could not be removed effectively by existing systems hence more specific and effective treatments are needed in order to reduce the environmental impacts of sewage proper water treatments include chemical precipitation to remove phosphorus ionic exchange for removing ions biological systems to eliminate nitrogen aops for removing toxic organic compounds distillation for volatile organic compounds removal and adsorption for removal of inorganic and organic pollutants some of these water treatment methods have not to be applied on a large scale and are under research because there is a lack of information about their reactor design issues proper data about their mechanisms and the impacts of operational variables 46 128 129 in the following different water treatment methods with proper efficiency for cleaning and pharmaceutical compounds are discussed and the advantage and disadvantages of each method are mentioned in table 5 moreover some of the related studies with these methods are summarized in table 6 3 2 1 adsorption in order to separate the interface of two phases adsorption can be used with two classifications chemisorption and physisorption depending on the adsorbate and adsorbent interactions one of the significant advantages of the adsorption method is the regeneration or recycling of adsobents which makes it economical for use in water treatment the reusing of the adsorbent mainly relied on the regeneration efficiency of the adsorbent the pharmaceuticals and surfactants adsorption depends on the properties of the solution adsorbent and adsorbate for example surface charge pore volume pore size and surface area of the adsorbent and continuously the polarity size molecular weight hydrophobicity functionality geometry and solubility for adsorbate in an aqueous solution 130 133 many different adsorbents have been synthesized for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds and surfactants from water the nanomaterials can perform very well for surfactant adsorption ncibi et al used carbon nanotubes cnts with adsorption capacities of 156 and 312 mg g for removal of ctab and sdbs surfactants the performance for the removal efficiency of surfactants can be increased by ultrasonication 134 also carbon nanotubes are effective adsorbents for removing pharmaceutical compounds 135 however carbon nanotubes in the largescale application are limited because of several problems such as difficult separation contribute to leakage into water bodies and eventually has adverse effects on human health and ecosystems 134 activated carbon can be considered as one of the most effective materials for the adsorption of surfactants and pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater 136 138 schouten et al reported that activated carbon which has a proper microporous structure in the average pore diameter of almost 1 5 nm can remove anionic surfactants such as las and aos the pore sizes and ionic strength are important factors for this process the macro 50 nm and meso 2 5 nm pores are suitable for the adsorption of aos and las it turns out that activated carbon and double layered hydroxide ldh can be considered as the proper candidate for the adsorption of the anionic surfactant due to several properties such as being cost effective and having high adsorption capacity the ionic interactions caused higher adsorption in comparison with non ionic interactions 139 the effect of pore and particle size on the anionic surfactant adsorption by four activated carbons which have various pore sizes indicated that the activated carbon with a smaller pore size between 0 56 and 0 77 nm could adsorb more anionic surfactant in comparison with other activated carbons the particle size has a remarkable effect on the small particle due to the complex compound formation between cations of surfactant molecules and activated carbon although using activated carbon has several drawbacks such as inefficient regeneration poor adsorption selectivity and expensive synthesis however taking advantage of economical raw materials which have efficient regeneration ability for the synthesis of activated carbons can improve this adsorbent for the removal of surfactants 140 139 moreover according to the literature activated carbons have a high performance in the adsorption of pharmaceuticals one of the advantages of activated carbon for removing pharmaceuticals is that pharmacologically or toxic active products do not generate 129 chitosan is a biocompatible biodegradable and non toxic mucoadhesive biopolymer it is an economical renewable and generally available biomaterial and after cellulose is the most abundant natural polysaccharide 141 parhizgar et al investigated that this adsorbent could successfully remove 97 of the sdbs anionic surfactant and its adsorption capacity was almost 6 38 mg g 142 generally from literature results the unmodified chitosan has low adsorption capacity in comparison to modified chitosan for anionic surfactants chitosan can be modified with various methods such as doping with metals or cross linking contribution to the higher surface area to having more active sites 143 3 2 2 advanced oxidation processes aops aops can degrade almost all kinds of organic pollutants into harmless products this method is considered an environmentally friendly process because pollutants could not transfer from one phase to another one and massive hazardous sludge does not be produced in this method 144 145 aops can reduce organic pollutant concentration from hundreds ppm to less than near 5 ppb 146 this method relies on the generation of oh reactive hydroxyl radicals after series of oxidation reactions ultimate mineralization products which are co2 and h2o are produced aop can mix with ozone o3 fenton s reagent h2o2 fe2 photocatalysis and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and combine with ultraviolet uv irradiation like tio2 uv ozone h2o2 uv ozone uv and h2o2 uv methods that include uv radiation can be considered as photochemical processes uv source improves the reduction of fe2 and fe3 which can be reacted with h2o2 in order to produce more hydroxyl radicals 147 148 150 some studies have been done with using aops as an effective treatment for pharmaceutical pollutants 130 151 and surfactants 152 153 mechanisms of degradation might vary from one method to another one the fenton based aops popularity has been much dependent on the selection of iron based catalysts for water treatment although due to the limitation in the solubility of iron species the efforts of research have focused on the development of iron free fenton systems for the h2o2 activation however one disadvantage of using fenton s technique is sludge formation which contains iron hydroxide as a secondary product thus sludge disposal should be considered in the initial cost and design process moreover the fenton process requires continuous ph adjustment because this process needs a lower ph 154 156 the aops are recommended to be applied in new or existing wastewater treatment plants for highly concentrated wastewater aops are suitable to be considered as pre treatment to decompose recalcitrant organic contaminants into biodegradable intermediates or products that can later be eliminated in biological post treatments 154 3 2 2 1 ultrasonic ultrasonic irradiation sonochemistry is a promising technique for the degradation of various types of hazardous organic compounds and pollutants from wastewater with undesirable impacts in the water environment ultrasonic irradiation can commence pyrolytic and oxidative degradation procedures this method does not need any chemical additives and can successfully apply to sludge colored or turbid solutions ultrasonic irradiation exposure induces acoustic cavitation in water sonochemistry is in the category of aops a phenomenon that is related to the production growth and intense collapse of gaseous bubbles into water known as cavitation in the pressure 1000 atm and high temperature 5000 k conditions irradiation of water with ultrasound decomposes water molecules into highly reactive radicals including ḥ and oh these reactive radicals can react with each other or diffuse to consider as an oxidant 157 159 kıdak and doğan removed and degraded antibiotic amoxicillin by ultrasonic irradiation alone and with ozonation the ultrasonic irradiation treatment was applied at three different frequencies 575 861 and 1141 khz due to the synergistic impact the combination of ultrasound and ozone gave rise to a rate constant of almost 2 5 min 1 which was 625 times more than alone ultrasound this hybrid degradation pathway which is considered an advanced oxidative process confirms the lower toxicity due to the low producing toxic intermediates 160 serna galvis et al demonstrated the total elimination and mineralization of the antidepressant drug fluoxetine by sonochemical process combined with biological treatment the alone biological treatment cannot remove the contaminant even after five days and under desirable conditions but the sonochemical process 600 khz was able to eliminate the pharmaceutical after 240 and 360 min of sonicating in the biological procedure microorganisms could remove 20 and 70 of the primary total organic carbon respectively 88 3 2 3 biological treatments biological treatment is a common method especially for detergents and pharmaceutical pollutants that exist in wastewater the effluent of this method can be returned to the river and the sludge can be used as a fertilizer for the soil the mentioned contamination can be considered as a nutrient source or energy for microorganisms in the biodegradation process the mechanism of biodegradation can be changed by several factors such as anaerobic and aerobic conditions or the chemical structure of the contamination 161 163 aerobic degradation can be accomplished in various ways such as using activated sludge tanks oxidation bonds and trickling filters each method has a considerable impact on removal efficiency although activated sludge tanks have almost 99 removal efficiency for las however the trickling filters have a wider range of 89 1 99 1 removal efficiencies 161 164 moreover las has removal efficiency in the range of 40 85 under anaerobic conditions depending on which method was used 165 166 in addition the high chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of pharmaceutical wastewater caused it suitable for anaerobic processes based on some studies cod reduction on antibiotic residues was by 70 to 75 and some research reports that combining a filter and the anaerobic sludge blanket leads to high removal efficiency 167 168 however there are many limitations that cause it unsuitable to consider as a sole treatment method for the removal of surfactants from wastewater one disadvantage is that this method is suitable for a low concentration of surfactant this is because in a concentration above almost 1 000 000 μg l the surfactant can depolarize the bacterial cell and can destroy function and structure 164 169 by taking advantage of chemical pre treatment for wastewater before enters to the treatment plant mentioned problems could be mitigated the huge advantage of pre treatment of wastewater is to convert these compounds to products that could be more biodegraded there are numerous methods for per treatment and aops can be considered as one of the commonly used methods 164 169 3 2 4 coagulation and flocculation coagulation flocculation is considered a chemical water treatment method that can usually be applied prior to filtration and sedimentation this simple and low cost method is used to improve the ability of a treatment action in order to remove pollutants such as surfactants coagulation can form a mass which is large enough to be trapped or settle in the filter flocculation is considered as gentle agitation or stirring to reinforce the particles formed to be clustered into large masses to settle from solution inorganic coagulants polymer type such as fe2 so4 3 feso4 7h2o and al2 so4 3 18h2o are generally used in this process 170 171 residual contents of inorganic coagulants like al2 so4 3 18h2o might cause alzheimer s disease 172 thus it is better to use fewer inorganic coagulants and these materials should be replaced with ecofriendly materials 173 it has been turned out that this method is effective and useful for the removal of the surfactant from wastewaters in many kinds of research removing the surfactant was roughly 95 in wastewater and cod reduction was approximately 88 147 4 conclusion and future perspective presently there is a considerable research gap in the survival of sars cov 2 in the water and the potential of coronavirus transmission by untreated and treated wastewater the excretion of the virus via feces is quite obvious from recent researches hence this research investigates the occurrence detection and recommended removal treatment ways of coronavirus in wastewater with different techniques commonly used at the different stages of the treatment including primary secondary and tertiary phases in the wastewater treatment plants the research of nasseri et al is a practical example of using the proposed methods to inactivate the sars cov 2 in wwtp they evaluated the presence of sars cov 2 in the outlet samples from ultraviolet uv disinfection module outlet 5 to 6 and samples from chlorine disinfection module outlet 1 to 4 of wwtps in southern tehran iran and the results showed that only chlorine disinfection samples remain positive hence the uv disinfection was more successful than chlorine disinfection and operators of wwtps should enhance the free residual chlorine concentration to 0 5 mg l 1 for effective disinfection 192 the development of environmentally friendly and low cost processes for viral removal are other opportunities for scholars to manage and reduce the growing health and environmental risks from any similar future crisis another crucial environmental concern related to the covid 19 epidemic is the extra use of disinfectants detergents and soaps and the overuse of specific drugs to protect against virus or novel mental problems related to quarantine their excretion into wastewater not only can pollute drinking water resources but also includes a potential threat to the aquatic environment hence future studies should be directed to update and re design wwtp to remove these extra amounts of organic compounds efficiently and create environmentally friendly cleaning products such as hand sanitizers and soaps with low toxic by product formation for humans and environmental safety further communication among regulatory agencies with chemical biological and medical researchers is needed to explore additional acceptance and validation of these water treatment approaches which are applied to make claims of successful water treatment
