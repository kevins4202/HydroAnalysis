23225,the purpose of the present study was to identify ship near miss areas and determine the relative densities of the areas the findings were used to develop a near miss density map for safe ship navigation and the prevention of collision between passing ships this study used big data of merchant vessel and fishing boat location for 1 year in 2014 the databases were interpolated using a time unit of seconds to extract near misses between ships based on data for exactly the same time furthermore to determine near misses the distance and time to closest point of approach were calculated for different pairs of approaching ships the near miss density of each grid of the map was depicted by means of the rgb color code the concept was validated by using it to depict the distributions of actual collision accident locations that occurred in the southern coastal sea of korea between 1997 and 2016 the highest near miss area was found to be in the approach of busan port where actual collision accidents also occurred most frequently the results showed that 73 3 of the near misses in the study area involved fishing boats in addition out of the 25 collisions that actually occurred in the study area in 2014 19 76 0 were related to fishing boats and this was reflected by the map developed in the present study the findings of the study can be used to develop a special near miss density nautical chart for use as a navigation safety material by deck officers such chart would facilitate the exercise of precaution in passing through dangerous areas keywords near miss density interpolation closest point of approach big data 1 introduction approximately 90 of the world s trade is carried out by sea and the volume of cargo and number of ships entering and leaving ports continue to increase with economic growth united nations 2014 this growth of maritime traffic has been accompanied by increased risk of marine accidents in sea areas with congested traffic ships often execute close passages and the frequencies of collision are high according to heinrich s law a major accident does not occur suddenly but is the consequence of a number of minor events which serve as a precursor signal of the impending accident these minor events are characterized as being causes or precursors of the accident and are commonly referred to as near misses bird and loftus 1976 heinrich et al 1980 a near miss is a situation in which there is the danger of collision between ships approaching each other but with no collision eventually occurring either due to deceleration or evasion by the change of course reason 2016 because the number of actual marine accidents is usually very small it is very difficult to verify a model for evaluating the probability of collision based on previous marine accidents inoue and kawase 2007 debnath et al 2011 further study is required to determine whether actual collisions and the availability of its data could be more useful than the near miss density map however if we were to conduct our study on real accidents an extremely large dataset over 20 years of real collision density map would be required since real accident database is not available in this particular study area and the real collision frequency is extremely low near miss spatial analysis based on the location of a ship can be employed and potentially dangerous locations can be found another important reason for using near miss analysis is that near misses occur frequently and such analysis requires less than one year data it is thus more reasonable to assess the area of interest based on near misses that might have caused marine accidents the international maritime organization imo requires shipping companies to prepare and submit detailed reports on near misses international maritime organization 2008 apart from the fact that near miss reporting is a basic requirement it also contributes to improve the economy and the maritime industry because it promises to stimulate improved crew and ship performance which can reduce associated costs international maritime organization 2008 companies are however reluctant to report near misses due to overloading overwork and other incriminating causes van der schaaf and kanse 2004 previous studies visualized the main sea routes by simply plotting the automatic identification system ais tracks this method is however limited by the inability to plot the relative degrees of dangers in different areas in this sense willems et al 2009 developed a means of visualizing the main routes of ships in the coastal sea of the netherlands based on the kernel density and taking the speed variations into consideration arguedas et al 2014 plotted the main routes of the strait of dover by extracting waypoints taking the changing courses of passing ships into consideration shelmerdine 2015 expressed frequent main traffic flows based on a simple density of the ais trajectories in shetland vettor and soares 2015 plotted ten main routes based on the density of ships passing through the north atlantic sea zhang et al 2016 simplified ais tracks using the douglas peucker algorithm breithaupt et al 2017 plotted the boundaries of the main routes between ports on the atlantic coast of the usa wu et al 2017 mapped a variety of latitude and longitude grids with intervals of 1 10 and 60 to portray the global ship traffic density in the above studies although the ship tracks were accumulated and the determined traffic densities were high the actual collision danger levels were low in areas where the passages are separated by safe water buoys or where there is traffic separation scheme tss this suggests that the cumulative density cannot be used to assess the risks of ship collision meanwhile in a previous study on ship near misses jiacai et al 2012 digitized passing dangers by segmenting the areas in xiamen china they however did not plot their results silveira et al 2013 and kim et al 2014 presented the location distribution of ship near misses in the coastal sea but could not determine the relative density of the different areas because the data used was two dimensional data in addition zhang et al 2015 utilized ais data which did not reflect the flow of fishing boats without ais to overcome the limitations of these previous works this study proposes the use of density in depicting the spatial distribution of the locations of frequent ship near misses in the southern coastal sea of korea in 2014 taking into consideration the traffic flow of fishing boats the near miss density map was developed by means of the rgb color code the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the methodology of the present study while section 3 explains the employed mathematical model subsequently the experimental results are presented in results and discussion in section 4 finally a summary of the work and the conclusion drawn are presented in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area according to the statistical yearbooks of the korea maritime safety tribunal presented in table 1 ship collision accidents were more common in coastal seas 70 9 than in ports 14 1 during the period 2011 to 2015 in addition table 2 reveals that marine accidents in korea were more frequent on the southern sea than on the eastern and western seas korea maritime safety tribunal 2016 the southern sea of korea is one of the most important shipping areas of the world connecting major economies such as china japan russia and south korea increase in foreign trade in the region has led to an increase in port traffic the ship traffic volume in this area is particularly high because the area contains large ports such as the gwangyang port and the busan port which is among the world s top ten container ports song and lee 2006 the present study thus considered the southern coastal sea of korea for the purpose of mapping the near miss density as shown in fig 1 the coastal area is located between latitudes 33 5 and 35 and longitudes 125 5 and 129 5 with an area of approximately 28 576 km2 this study excluded port areas because the interactions between merchant ships and pilot boats tugboats water supply ships and oil supply ships at ports could be mistaken for collisions 2 2 installation of ais since 2002 the imo has mandated the installation of ais on new passenger ships of more than 300 tons and cargo ships of more than 500 tons on international voyages an ais transmits information between ships and between ships and land stations via very high frequency vhf in the 160 mhz band the transmitted information includes the ship s location speed course name type destination and dimension international maritime organization 1998 international association of lighthouse authorities 2000 between 2001 and 2008 42 ais stations were constructed on the coasts of south korea the present study utilized one year data from january 1 to december 31 2014 the data was obtained through the ais national integrated system of the ministry of oceans and fisheries of korea 2 3 fishing boats location transmission device existing studies on near misses of ships that do not follow the international convention for the safety of life at sea non solas ships are insufficient owing to the difficulty of acquiring their location data in a review of studies on non solas ships an 2016 proposed some concepts for e navigation services for non solas ships fukuda 2016 also predicted the tracks of fishing boats through a survey of fishermen owing to the difficulty of acquiring data on non solas ships radar and visual observations are generally used to determine the route of fishing boats but this method cannot be applied on large coastal seas due to its limited observation range lee et al 2016 surveyed a group of maritime traffic experts to analyze the danger factors of ship navigation on the coastal seas of south korea through an analytic hierarchy process ahp they found that the heavy traffic of fishing boats was the most dangerous factor it was observed that the number of surveyed deck officers that considered fishing boats as being the most dangerous factor increased with increasing officer license level lee et al 2016 it is therefore reasonable to highlight the traffic flow of fishing boats in any study on near miss density on coastal seas meanwhile the south korean coast guard developed a system for automatically transmitting the location of a fishing boat to enhance safety through quick initial action in the event of an emergency as shown in fig 2 progressive installation of fishing location transmission devices has been promoted since 2011 in accordance with the fishing vessel act by december 2016 such devices had been installed on approximately 70 000 fishing boats in south korea including small boats of less than 1 ton the devices consist of a wireless system that transmits the location of the ship at intervals of approximately 30 s using a frequency of 897 mhz to consider the traffic flow of non solas fishing boats in the coastal sea in the present study fishing boats location data for 2014 was obtained from the korea coast guard 2 4 procedure to develop the near miss density map to develop the near miss density map the present study utilized ais and fishing location data for one year spanning from january 1 to december 31 2014 korea mof ministry of oceans and fisheries of korea provided the ais data while korea coast guard provided the fishing boats location data for the case study the dataset consisted of a colossal amount of information on ships including the status of the ship name ship id length breadth position speed and course moreover some dynamic values such as position speed and course of the ship were selected and the near misses were calculated the near miss density map was developed as follows in step 1 the entire one year ais and fishing location data were filtered based on location and monthly databases were then developed the ais and fishing location data were distinguished by ship id and sorted according to time the ais data were filtered by ranges of 2 7 with the first digit representing the maritime mobile service identity mmsi which identifies the specific ship the ais information errors regarding the ship type harati mokhtari et al 2007 were corrected using data published by the international telecommunication union international telecommunication union 2014 and the port management information system port mis data of the ministry of oceans and fisheries of south korea park et al 2005 the type of fishing boat is excluded from the ais database to avoid duplication of fishing location data in step 2 the databases were interpolated using a time unit of seconds to extract near misses between ships based on data for exactly the same time in step 3 to determine near misses the distance to the closest point of approach d c p a time to the closest point of approach t c p a and distance δ between ships were calculated for different pairs of approaching ships using a time unit of seconds to extract two ships forming a closest point of approach cpa one ship was maintained as own ship while the other ships were specified as object ships in turn the near misses were initially calculated for only ais ships and subsequently between ais ships and fishing boats near misses between fishing boats were not considered because fishing boats operate in fleets the cpa location of one of the two ships was predicted lastly the near miss data was presented in the form of a smooth histogram for visualization the present study was tri dimensionally schematized to depict the near miss density using rgb color 3 mathematical model 3 1 interpolation the mathematical model developed in this research takes into account the fact that the ais data is transmitted at intervals of approximately 3 10 s depending on the speed of the ship and other factors while fishing location data are transmitted at approximately 30 s intervals because data of different ships are not transmitted at exactly the same time near misses cannot be determined from the raw data therefore it was necessary to carry out data interpolation in this study to interpolate the data collected from discontinuous cycles the date yyyymmdd and time hhmmss of the raw data were converted into time in seconds then the latitude longitude speed and course data were then interpolated with respect to time in seconds based on the ship s id press et al 1992 bartels et al 1998 this data processing facilitated comparison of ship behaviors at any given time the following details should be noted regarding a simple interpolation of the ship course data described by θ which is the angle position relative to the north pole if the alteration to the starboard side of a course θ passes through the true north n 000 a simple interpolation of the course change may appear as an alteration to the port side likewise the interpolation of a similar course alteration to the port side may appear as an alteration to the starboard side for example if θ i is 330 at time t i and θ i 1 is 030 at t i 1 the ship would have actually altered course to the starboard side with θ progressively varying as 330 345 000 030 but this would be interpolated as a course alteration to the port side with θ varying as 330 300 270 030 which would not reflect the passage through the true north n 000 furthermore in the case of the alteration of the course θ to the starboard side through the true north n 000 the interpolated value cannot exceed 360 irrespective of the actual value of the change of course neither can a similar change of course to the port side be interpolated as a negative value to address the above issues the raw θ data was modified using eq 1 this involved the subtraction of 360 2 π from θ i 1 if the phase angle difference between θ i at t i i 1 2 n and θ i 1 at t i 1 was greater than the default jump tolerance 180 π or adding 360 2 π to θ i 1 if the phase angle difference was equal to or less than 180 π 1 θ i 1 θ i 180 θ i 1 θ i 1 360 θ i 1 θ i 180 θ i 1 θ i 1 360 this modified course data was interpolated by applying the cubic spline using a time unit of seconds finally eq 2 was applied in this case if the value of θ i j j 1 2 t i 1 t i 1 interpolated from θ i divided by 360 was less than 0 360 was added to θ i j if the result of the division was greater than 1 360 was subtracted from θ i j through the above process the interpolated course data was modified to be within 000 360 2 θ i j 360 0 θ i j θ i j 360 0 θ i j 360 0 θ i j θ i j θ i j 360 1 θ i j θ i j 360 3 2 near miss condition the values of d c p a and t c p a are respectively indicative of the spatial and temporal approaches between two ships the d c p a and t c p a values are used for the assessment of ship collision level because they can be calculated from the locations speeds and course data of the ships lee and rhee 2001 debnath and chin 2010 however the distance δ between the two ships was also employed in the present study this is because even if the d c p a and t c p a values of the ships are small and there is a collision level a ship with a high speed can evade collision if the δ is sufficient conversely a small δ will increase the collision level the threshold conditions of d c p a t c p a and δ between two ships applied in this study are as follows d c p a 0 1 nm t c p a 3 min and δ 0 3 nm regarding previous studies on d c p a t c p a and δ thresholds berglund and huttunen 2008 defined a d c p a of 0 3 nm as constituting a near miss fukuto and imazu 2013 conducted a study on avoiding situations in which deck officers use inappropriate cpa thresholds with the purpose of reducing the frequency of collision alarms they successfully reduced the alarm frequency by approximately 90 by setting the conditions of the collision to a d c p a of 1 nm and t c p a of 5 min park 2014 set a d c p a of 0 15 nm and t c p a of 3 min as the thresholds in investigating the safe speed in a vessel traffic service vts area langard et al 2015 found that on average ships that took collision evasion actions had a d c p a of 0 64 nm t c p a of 26 min and δ of 1 81 nm because the purpose of the present study is to identify the near miss locations of ships it is reasonable to apply the lowest criteria specifically the simultaneous occurrence of a d c p a of 0 1 nm t c p a of 3 min and δ of 0 3 nm were used to extract the cpa for ship a latitude l a t a longitude l o n a course θ a and speed v a and ship b latitude l a t b longitude l o n b course θ b and speed v b the parameter values in decimal degrees were converted into nautical miles the latitude was converted using eq 3 while the longitude was converted using eq 4 after applying the scale factor which is based on the latitudes of earth considered to be an ellipsoid snyder 1987 the average scale factor for latitudes l a t a and l a t b of ships a and b was applied 3 x a l a t a n m x b l a t b n m where n m 60 0404571514896 4 y a l o n a n m s f c y b l o n b n m

and eqs 5 and 6 which are based on the data of two ships benjamin et al 2006 δ was also accurately calculated using a time unit of seconds using eq 7 which is based on the spherical law of cosines

p a 3 4 visualization the near miss data was visualized using the smooth histogram method the study area was configured with 200 200 grids and the near miss events in each grid were counted to construct a two dimensional histogram y using eq 9 eilers and goeman 2004 9 i 2 λ d 1 d 1 λ 2 d 2 d 2 z y where i is the identity matrix and d 2 d 1 is a matrix of the second first order consisting mainly of zeros but with 1 and 1 occurring in each row the tuning parameter λ was set to 10 to retain the raw data a high value enhances smoothing while values close to 0 produces a plot that is essentially like that of the raw data z denotes the smoothed histogram the near miss density values d v in each grid was represented by a value between 0 and 1 by employing eq 10 10 d v v 1 64 v 64 where v 1 2 64 the near miss density of each grid was depicted using the rgb color code the use of rgb colors for the visualization of big data is effective by facilitating intuitive estimation there is a total of 256 3 colors in the rgb color code based on the 256 expression levels of each of the three primary color components namely r red g green and b blue however the number of colors that are actually sensed is much smaller because only limited amounts of brightness and saturation can be sensed by the human eye for a given pixel size a concept known as color quantification is thus used to express the over 16 million colors by 256 or fewer colors buhmann et al 1998 in the present study we designed a 64 color rgb model comprising four levels of each of the primary colors r g and b using eq 11 which is based on the standard rgb model 256 levels of each of r g and b the designed simple color model is rougher but also more useful for the present purpose than the standard model because it involves a simpler division of the indexes r g and b the rgb coordinates within 0 255 were converted into rgb color coordinates within 0 1 by applying eq 10 above d v were depicted using the corresponding r v g v and b v indexes obtained using eq 11 11 r v g v b v m i n max m i n 4 v 64 1 5 4 v 64 4 5 0 1 m i n max m i n 4 v 64 0 5 4 v 64 3 5 0 1 m i n max m i n 4 v 64 0 5 4 v 64 2 5 0 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 results the results of the near misses that occurred in the southern coastal sea of korea from january 1 to december 31 2014 are presented in this section the near miss detection algorithm was coded in matlab which was run on a pc with an intel xeon e5 2650v3 cpu and 8 16 gb ddr4 2 3 ghz ram to analyze the near miss data by ship we classified the ships into five types namely cargo ships tankers passenger ships towing ships and fishing boats cargo ships include container ships bulk carriers and car carriers tankers comprise lpg carriers lng carriers crude carriers and oil supply ships the analysis of the data presented in table 3 reveals that a total of 57 824 near misses occurred in the study area in the period under consideration a detailed analysis indicates that 73 3 of the near misses involved fishing boats according to the table the near misses between cargo ships and fishing boats accounted for the highest ratio of 34 1 the next highest ratio was observed between tankers and fishing boats 17 2 followed by between towing ships and fishing boats 14 3 and then between passenger ships and fishing boats 7 7 it is pertinent to state that events between fishing boats were excluded from the study because what is technically considered a collision is typical of the fleet operation of fishing boats if the events between fishing boats are considered the near miss incidents would be much higher fig 3 depicts the distribution of the near miss locations in the study area the colors closer to red indicate a higher frequency of near misses compared to the other locations as can be observed near misses occur more frequently in the areas approaching busan port 4 2 discussion the present study was tri dimensionally schematized to depict the near miss density using rgb color to calculate the near misses to reflect the traffic flow of fishing boats which constitute the most dangerous factor in coastal seas we employed fishing location data for the near misses that occurred in the study area in 2014 the findings of this study enabled the identification of relatively dangerous locations as depicted in fig 3 where the relative frequency of near misses increases as the colors tends to red these findings indicate that near misses occur more frequently in the zones approaching busan port fig 4 also illustrates the distribution of 412 collision accident locations in the study area between 1997 and 2016 as can be observed the accidents most frequently occurred in the area approaching busan port which also has a high near miss density korea maritime safety tribunal 2017 busan port suffers from severe congestion which constitutes a high potential near miss risk yeo et al 2007 this is because japan china container cargo from to the hinterlands frequently requires transshipping to the korea china feeder route through the japan korea feeder route at busan port furuichi 2005 after a thorough analysis it was discovered that 73 3 of all near misses in the analyzed area was due to near misses between fishing boats and non fishing boats which was evidently more than those between non fishing boats as was reflected by the present research this result is in accordance with the findings of another study korea maritime safety tribunal 2017 which indicates that out of 25 collisions that occurred in the study area in 2014 19 76 0 were related to fishing boats the results of the present study also substantiate the conclusions of a previous survey of experts that showed that fishing boats constituted the most dangerous factor in coastal seas lee et al 2016 near misses occur more frequently on coastal seas than in ports because the former has many fishing boats the operation sites of fishing boats in coastal waters overlap with the routes of merchant ships besides the results show that there were 19 cases of actual ship collisions involving fishing boats in the study area this represents 0 045 of all the 42 383 near miss cases related to fishing boats moreover among the 15 441 cases of near misses between non fishing boats there were only six cases 0 039 of actual ship collision the fishing boat related accident rate is thus 1 15 times that of non fishing boats the limitations in previous studies include visualizing the main sea area routes by merely plotting the ais tracks in this study this limitation was addressed by plotting the relative density of potentially dangerous locations moreover the flow of fishing boats was also represented in this study it is obvious that near misses cannot be determined with the help of raw data hence the use of data interpolation by means of phase angle difference furthermore the cubic spline was also implemented in this study the limitation in previous works was also addressed through tri dimensional schematization to depict the near miss density and by employing the rgb color in which a 64 color rgb model was designed which enables the implementation of 16 color or 8 color rgb model to achieve this near misses in the southern coastal sea of korea in 2014 were considered as well traffic flow of fishing boats it is convenient to emphasize that the primary objective of this near miss study is to contribute to the avoidance of future losses by identifying areas of concern and aiding the implementation of appropriate corrective actions international maritime organization 2008 the observations should be used to improve safety performance according to branch et al 2004 there is the need for the employment of watchkeepers on merchant ships to look out for fishing boats however even when fishing boats are sighted accidents still often occur due to the failure of timely action by the officer on watch an excuse that is often given for delayed action is that the movements of fishing boats are generally erratic and there was a possibility that boats would be maneuvered in order to avoid a collision moreover fishing boat skippers do not diligently look out and thus fail to take avoidance actions branch et al 2004 indeed an analysis of actual collision accidents revealed that the foremost cause 68 of collisions between fishing boats and non fishing boats was poor look out and that 68 of the fishing boat skippers involved in collision accidents possessed class 5 or 6 deck officer certificates of competency lee et al 2013 hence to reduce the occurrence of collision accidents it is necessary for relevant government agencies to review regulations regarding the navigation of fishing boats take steps to improve operator standard education and training and ensure the procurement of efficient navigation equipment in this study near misses between fishing boats were excluded because what is considered a near miss is typical of the fleet operation of fishing boats if the events between fishing boats are considered the near miss incidents would be much higher in addition the effects of hydro meteorological conditions such as visibility and wave height were not considered in the model the proposed near miss density model can be further refined to consider additional factors such as hydro meteorological conditions and ship size this may however require modification of the modeling technique to reflect the specificity of the concept being operationalized and the intended purpose special nautical maps that indicate the near miss density with respect to encounter type such as crossing and overtaking or encounter time such as daytime and nighttime can also be developed for deck officers for use in course planning and taking precaution when passing through potentially dangerous areas in addition the density map can be modified based on the intended application for example by using 27 colors comprising three levels of each of the primary colors r g and b or 16 colors comprising two levels of each of the primary colors 5 conclusion the purpose of the present study was to map the near miss density in the southern coastal sea of korea for the safe operation of ships and prevention of collisions the near miss density distribution was depicted using rgb colors the results of the analysis of the near miss incidents were used to develop a map that highlighted the areas with high near miss densities the proposed model enables easy recognition of relatively dangerous areas with regard to near miss encounters from ais and fishing boat location databases the limitation of previous studies included the use of ais tracks to visualize the main sea area routes to overcome this limitation the relative density of potentially dangerous locations was plotted in this study the flow of fishing boats was also represented this study used data interpolation by means of phase angle difference to avoid using raw data in addition the concept of near miss detection presented in this paper can be used for operational purposes for example as a tool for identifying possible critical situations and evaluating traffic situations it may contribute to facilitate policy decisions for the focused management of dangerous areas by vts and relevant government agencies the results of the present study also afford basic data for use in maritime traffic control to prevent ship collision the proposed spatial representation of dangerous areas can contribute to the overall enhancement of maritime traffic safety necessary measures should thus be taken to develop and implement appropriate maritime regulations the near miss density map would enable deck officers to intuitively sense relatively dangerous coastal areas affording very valuable navigation safety information however further study is required to determine the relationship between actual collision accidents and near misses this would enable the validation of the use of near misses for the assessment of maritime traffic safety conflicts of interest none acknowledgments funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
23225,the purpose of the present study was to identify ship near miss areas and determine the relative densities of the areas the findings were used to develop a near miss density map for safe ship navigation and the prevention of collision between passing ships this study used big data of merchant vessel and fishing boat location for 1 year in 2014 the databases were interpolated using a time unit of seconds to extract near misses between ships based on data for exactly the same time furthermore to determine near misses the distance and time to closest point of approach were calculated for different pairs of approaching ships the near miss density of each grid of the map was depicted by means of the rgb color code the concept was validated by using it to depict the distributions of actual collision accident locations that occurred in the southern coastal sea of korea between 1997 and 2016 the highest near miss area was found to be in the approach of busan port where actual collision accidents also occurred most frequently the results showed that 73 3 of the near misses in the study area involved fishing boats in addition out of the 25 collisions that actually occurred in the study area in 2014 19 76 0 were related to fishing boats and this was reflected by the map developed in the present study the findings of the study can be used to develop a special near miss density nautical chart for use as a navigation safety material by deck officers such chart would facilitate the exercise of precaution in passing through dangerous areas keywords near miss density interpolation closest point of approach big data 1 introduction approximately 90 of the world s trade is carried out by sea and the volume of cargo and number of ships entering and leaving ports continue to increase with economic growth united nations 2014 this growth of maritime traffic has been accompanied by increased risk of marine accidents in sea areas with congested traffic ships often execute close passages and the frequencies of collision are high according to heinrich s law a major accident does not occur suddenly but is the consequence of a number of minor events which serve as a precursor signal of the impending accident these minor events are characterized as being causes or precursors of the accident and are commonly referred to as near misses bird and loftus 1976 heinrich et al 1980 a near miss is a situation in which there is the danger of collision between ships approaching each other but with no collision eventually occurring either due to deceleration or evasion by the change of course reason 2016 because the number of actual marine accidents is usually very small it is very difficult to verify a model for evaluating the probability of collision based on previous marine accidents inoue and kawase 2007 debnath et al 2011 further study is required to determine whether actual collisions and the availability of its data could be more useful than the near miss density map however if we were to conduct our study on real accidents an extremely large dataset over 20 years of real collision density map would be required since real accident database is not available in this particular study area and the real collision frequency is extremely low near miss spatial analysis based on the location of a ship can be employed and potentially dangerous locations can be found another important reason for using near miss analysis is that near misses occur frequently and such analysis requires less than one year data it is thus more reasonable to assess the area of interest based on near misses that might have caused marine accidents the international maritime organization imo requires shipping companies to prepare and submit detailed reports on near misses international maritime organization 2008 apart from the fact that near miss reporting is a basic requirement it also contributes to improve the economy and the maritime industry because it promises to stimulate improved crew and ship performance which can reduce associated costs international maritime organization 2008 companies are however reluctant to report near misses due to overloading overwork and other incriminating causes van der schaaf and kanse 2004 previous studies visualized the main sea routes by simply plotting the automatic identification system ais tracks this method is however limited by the inability to plot the relative degrees of dangers in different areas in this sense willems et al 2009 developed a means of visualizing the main routes of ships in the coastal sea of the netherlands based on the kernel density and taking the speed variations into consideration arguedas et al 2014 plotted the main routes of the strait of dover by extracting waypoints taking the changing courses of passing ships into consideration shelmerdine 2015 expressed frequent main traffic flows based on a simple density of the ais trajectories in shetland vettor and soares 2015 plotted ten main routes based on the density of ships passing through the north atlantic sea zhang et al 2016 simplified ais tracks using the douglas peucker algorithm breithaupt et al 2017 plotted the boundaries of the main routes between ports on the atlantic coast of the usa wu et al 2017 mapped a variety of latitude and longitude grids with intervals of 1 10 and 60 to portray the global ship traffic density in the above studies although the ship tracks were accumulated and the determined traffic densities were high the actual collision danger levels were low in areas where the passages are separated by safe water buoys or where there is traffic separation scheme tss this suggests that the cumulative density cannot be used to assess the risks of ship collision meanwhile in a previous study on ship near misses jiacai et al 2012 digitized passing dangers by segmenting the areas in xiamen china they however did not plot their results silveira et al 2013 and kim et al 2014 presented the location distribution of ship near misses in the coastal sea but could not determine the relative density of the different areas because the data used was two dimensional data in addition zhang et al 2015 utilized ais data which did not reflect the flow of fishing boats without ais to overcome the limitations of these previous works this study proposes the use of density in depicting the spatial distribution of the locations of frequent ship near misses in the southern coastal sea of korea in 2014 taking into consideration the traffic flow of fishing boats the near miss density map was developed by means of the rgb color code the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the methodology of the present study while section 3 explains the employed mathematical model subsequently the experimental results are presented in results and discussion in section 4 finally a summary of the work and the conclusion drawn are presented in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area according to the statistical yearbooks of the korea maritime safety tribunal presented in table 1 ship collision accidents were more common in coastal seas 70 9 than in ports 14 1 during the period 2011 to 2015 in addition table 2 reveals that marine accidents in korea were more frequent on the southern sea than on the eastern and western seas korea maritime safety tribunal 2016 the southern sea of korea is one of the most important shipping areas of the world connecting major economies such as china japan russia and south korea increase in foreign trade in the region has led to an increase in port traffic the ship traffic volume in this area is particularly high because the area contains large ports such as the gwangyang port and the busan port which is among the world s top ten container ports song and lee 2006 the present study thus considered the southern coastal sea of korea for the purpose of mapping the near miss density as shown in fig 1 the coastal area is located between latitudes 33 5 and 35 and longitudes 125 5 and 129 5 with an area of approximately 28 576 km2 this study excluded port areas because the interactions between merchant ships and pilot boats tugboats water supply ships and oil supply ships at ports could be mistaken for collisions 2 2 installation of ais since 2002 the imo has mandated the installation of ais on new passenger ships of more than 300 tons and cargo ships of more than 500 tons on international voyages an ais transmits information between ships and between ships and land stations via very high frequency vhf in the 160 mhz band the transmitted information includes the ship s location speed course name type destination and dimension international maritime organization 1998 international association of lighthouse authorities 2000 between 2001 and 2008 42 ais stations were constructed on the coasts of south korea the present study utilized one year data from january 1 to december 31 2014 the data was obtained through the ais national integrated system of the ministry of oceans and fisheries of korea 2 3 fishing boats location transmission device existing studies on near misses of ships that do not follow the international convention for the safety of life at sea non solas ships are insufficient owing to the difficulty of acquiring their location data in a review of studies on non solas ships an 2016 proposed some concepts for e navigation services for non solas ships fukuda 2016 also predicted the tracks of fishing boats through a survey of fishermen owing to the difficulty of acquiring data on non solas ships radar and visual observations are generally used to determine the route of fishing boats but this method cannot be applied on large coastal seas due to its limited observation range lee et al 2016 surveyed a group of maritime traffic experts to analyze the danger factors of ship navigation on the coastal seas of south korea through an analytic hierarchy process ahp they found that the heavy traffic of fishing boats was the most dangerous factor it was observed that the number of surveyed deck officers that considered fishing boats as being the most dangerous factor increased with increasing officer license level lee et al 2016 it is therefore reasonable to highlight the traffic flow of fishing boats in any study on near miss density on coastal seas meanwhile the south korean coast guard developed a system for automatically transmitting the location of a fishing boat to enhance safety through quick initial action in the event of an emergency as shown in fig 2 progressive installation of fishing location transmission devices has been promoted since 2011 in accordance with the fishing vessel act by december 2016 such devices had been installed on approximately 70 000 fishing boats in south korea including small boats of less than 1 ton the devices consist of a wireless system that transmits the location of the ship at intervals of approximately 30 s using a frequency of 897 mhz to consider the traffic flow of non solas fishing boats in the coastal sea in the present study fishing boats location data for 2014 was obtained from the korea coast guard 2 4 procedure to develop the near miss density map to develop the near miss density map the present study utilized ais and fishing location data for one year spanning from january 1 to december 31 2014 korea mof ministry of oceans and fisheries of korea provided the ais data while korea coast guard provided the fishing boats location data for the case study the dataset consisted of a colossal amount of information on ships including the status of the ship name ship id length breadth position speed and course moreover some dynamic values such as position speed and course of the ship were selected and the near misses were calculated the near miss density map was developed as follows in step 1 the entire one year ais and fishing location data were filtered based on location and monthly databases were then developed the ais and fishing location data were distinguished by ship id and sorted according to time the ais data were filtered by ranges of 2 7 with the first digit representing the maritime mobile service identity mmsi which identifies the specific ship the ais information errors regarding the ship type harati mokhtari et al 2007 were corrected using data published by the international telecommunication union international telecommunication union 2014 and the port management information system port mis data of the ministry of oceans and fisheries of south korea park et al 2005 the type of fishing boat is excluded from the ais database to avoid duplication of fishing location data in step 2 the databases were interpolated using a time unit of seconds to extract near misses between ships based on data for exactly the same time in step 3 to determine near misses the distance to the closest point of approach d c p a time to the closest point of approach t c p a and distance δ between ships were calculated for different pairs of approaching ships using a time unit of seconds to extract two ships forming a closest point of approach cpa one ship was maintained as own ship while the other ships were specified as object ships in turn the near misses were initially calculated for only ais ships and subsequently between ais ships and fishing boats near misses between fishing boats were not considered because fishing boats operate in fleets the cpa location of one of the two ships was predicted lastly the near miss data was presented in the form of a smooth histogram for visualization the present study was tri dimensionally schematized to depict the near miss density using rgb color 3 mathematical model 3 1 interpolation the mathematical model developed in this research takes into account the fact that the ais data is transmitted at intervals of approximately 3 10 s depending on the speed of the ship and other factors while fishing location data are transmitted at approximately 30 s intervals because data of different ships are not transmitted at exactly the same time near misses cannot be determined from the raw data therefore it was necessary to carry out data interpolation in this study to interpolate the data collected from discontinuous cycles the date yyyymmdd and time hhmmss of the raw data were converted into time in seconds then the latitude longitude speed and course data were then interpolated with respect to time in seconds based on the ship s id press et al 1992 bartels et al 1998 this data processing facilitated comparison of ship behaviors at any given time the following details should be noted regarding a simple interpolation of the ship course data described by θ which is the angle position relative to the north pole if the alteration to the starboard side of a course θ passes through the true north n 000 a simple interpolation of the course change may appear as an alteration to the port side likewise the interpolation of a similar course alteration to the port side may appear as an alteration to the starboard side for example if θ i is 330 at time t i and θ i 1 is 030 at t i 1 the ship would have actually altered course to the starboard side with θ progressively varying as 330 345 000 030 but this would be interpolated as a course alteration to the port side with θ varying as 330 300 270 030 which would not reflect the passage through the true north n 000 furthermore in the case of the alteration of the course θ to the starboard side through the true north n 000 the interpolated value cannot exceed 360 irrespective of the actual value of the change of course neither can a similar change of course to the port side be interpolated as a negative value to address the above issues the raw θ data was modified using eq 1 this involved the subtraction of 360 2 π from θ i 1 if the phase angle difference between θ i at t i i 1 2 n and θ i 1 at t i 1 was greater than the default jump tolerance 180 π or adding 360 2 π to θ i 1 if the phase angle difference was equal to or less than 180 π 1 θ i 1 θ i 180 θ i 1 θ i 1 360 θ i 1 θ i 180 θ i 1 θ i 1 360 this modified course data was interpolated by applying the cubic spline using a time unit of seconds finally eq 2 was applied in this case if the value of θ i j j 1 2 t i 1 t i 1 interpolated from θ i divided by 360 was less than 0 360 was added to θ i j if the result of the division was greater than 1 360 was subtracted from θ i j through the above process the interpolated course data was modified to be within 000 360 2 θ i j 360 0 θ i j θ i j 360 0 θ i j 360 0 θ i j θ i j θ i j 360 1 θ i j θ i j 360 3 2 near miss condition the values of d c p a and t c p a are respectively indicative of the spatial and temporal approaches between two ships the d c p a and t c p a values are used for the assessment of ship collision level because they can be calculated from the locations speeds and course data of the ships lee and rhee 2001 debnath and chin 2010 however the distance δ between the two ships was also employed in the present study this is because even if the d c p a and t c p a values of the ships are small and there is a collision level a ship with a high speed can evade collision if the δ is sufficient conversely a small δ will increase the collision level the threshold conditions of d c p a t c p a and δ between two ships applied in this study are as follows d c p a 0 1 nm t c p a 3 min and δ 0 3 nm regarding previous studies on d c p a t c p a and δ thresholds berglund and huttunen 2008 defined a d c p a of 0 3 nm as constituting a near miss fukuto and imazu 2013 conducted a study on avoiding situations in which deck officers use inappropriate cpa thresholds with the purpose of reducing the frequency of collision alarms they successfully reduced the alarm frequency by approximately 90 by setting the conditions of the collision to a d c p a of 1 nm and t c p a of 5 min park 2014 set a d c p a of 0 15 nm and t c p a of 3 min as the thresholds in investigating the safe speed in a vessel traffic service vts area langard et al 2015 found that on average ships that took collision evasion actions had a d c p a of 0 64 nm t c p a of 26 min and δ of 1 81 nm because the purpose of the present study is to identify the near miss locations of ships it is reasonable to apply the lowest criteria specifically the simultaneous occurrence of a d c p a of 0 1 nm t c p a of 3 min and δ of 0 3 nm were used to extract the cpa for ship a latitude l a t a longitude l o n a course θ a and speed v a and ship b latitude l a t b longitude l o n b course θ b and speed v b the parameter values in decimal degrees were converted into nautical miles the latitude was converted using eq 3 while the longitude was converted using eq 4 after applying the scale factor which is based on the latitudes of earth considered to be an ellipsoid snyder 1987 the average scale factor for latitudes l a t a and l a t b of ships a and b was applied 3 x a l a t a n m x b l a t b n m where n m 60 0404571514896 4 y a l o n a n m s f c y b l o n b n m

p a 3 4 visualization the near miss data was visualized using the smooth histogram method the study area was configured with 200 200 grids and the near miss events in each grid were counted to construct a two dimensional histogram y using eq 9 eilers and goeman 2004 9 i 2 λ d 1 d 1 λ 2 d 2 d 2 z y where i is the identity matrix and d 2 d 1 is a matrix of the second first order consisting mainly of zeros but with 1 and 1 occurring in each row the tuning parameter λ was set to 10 to retain the raw data a high value enhances smoothing while values close to 0 produces a plot that is essentially like that of the raw data z denotes the smoothed histogram the near miss density values d v in each grid was represented by a value between 0 and 1 by employing eq 10 10 d v v 1 64 v 64 where v 1 2 64 the near miss density of each grid was depicted using the rgb color code the use of rgb colors for the visualization of big data is effective by facilitating intuitive estimation there is a total of 256 3 colors in the rgb color code based on the 256 expression levels of each of the three primary color components namely r red g green and b blue however the number of colors that are actually sensed is much smaller because only limited amounts of brightness and saturation can be sensed by the human eye for a given pixel size a concept known as color quantification is thus used to express the over 16 million colors by 256 or fewer colors buhmann et al 1998 in the present study we designed a 64 color rgb model comprising four levels of each of the primary colors r g and b using eq 11 which is based on the standard rgb model 256 levels of each of r g and b the designed simple color model is rougher but also more useful for the present purpose than the standard model because it involves a simpler division of the indexes r g and b the rgb coordinates within 0 255 were converted into rgb color coordinates within 0 1 by applying eq 10 above d v were depicted using the corresponding r v g v and b v indexes obtained using eq 11 11 r v g v b v m i n max m i n 4 v 64 1 5 4 v 64 4 5 0 1 m i n max m i n 4 v 64 0 5 4 v 64 3 5 0 1 m i n max m i n 4 v 64 0 5 4 v 64 2 5 0 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 results the results of the near misses that occurred in the southern coastal sea of korea from january 1 to december 31 2014 are presented in this section the near miss detection algorithm was coded in matlab which was run on a pc with an intel xeon e5 2650v3 cpu and 8 16 gb ddr4 2 3 ghz ram to analyze the near miss data by ship we classified the ships into five types namely cargo ships tankers passenger ships towing ships and fishing boats cargo ships include container ships bulk carriers and car carriers tankers comprise lpg carriers lng carriers crude carriers and oil supply ships the analysis of the data presented in table 3 reveals that a total of 57 824 near misses occurred in the study area in the period under consideration a detailed analysis indicates that 73 3 of the near misses involved fishing boats according to the table the near misses between cargo ships and fishing boats accounted for the highest ratio of 34 1 the next highest ratio was observed between tankers and fishing boats 17 2 followed by between towing ships and fishing boats 14 3 and then between passenger ships and fishing boats 7 7 it is pertinent to state that events between fishing boats were excluded from the study because what is technically considered a collision is typical of the fleet operation of fishing boats if the events between fishing boats are considered the near miss incidents would be much higher fig 3 depicts the distribution of the near miss locations in the study area the colors closer to red indicate a higher frequency of near misses compared to the other locations as can be observed near misses occur more frequently in the areas approaching busan port 4 2 discussion the present study was tri dimensionally schematized to depict the near miss density using rgb color to calculate the near misses to reflect the traffic flow of fishing boats which constitute the most dangerous factor in coastal seas we employed fishing location data for the near misses that occurred in the study area in 2014 the findings of this study enabled the identification of relatively dangerous locations as depicted in fig 3 where the relative frequency of near misses increases as the colors tends to red these findings indicate that near misses occur more frequently in the zones approaching busan port fig 4 also illustrates the distribution of 412 collision accident locations in the study area between 1997 and 2016 as can be observed the accidents most frequently occurred in the area approaching busan port which also has a high near miss density korea maritime safety tribunal 2017 busan port suffers from severe congestion which constitutes a high potential near miss risk yeo et al 2007 this is because japan china container cargo from to the hinterlands frequently requires transshipping to the korea china feeder route through the japan korea feeder route at busan port furuichi 2005 after a thorough analysis it was discovered that 73 3 of all near misses in the analyzed area was due to near misses between fishing boats and non fishing boats which was evidently more than those between non fishing boats as was reflected by the present research this result is in accordance with the findings of another study korea maritime safety tribunal 2017 which indicates that out of 25 collisions that occurred in the study area in 2014 19 76 0 were related to fishing boats the results of the present study also substantiate the conclusions of a previous survey of experts that showed that fishing boats constituted the most dangerous factor in coastal seas lee et al 2016 near misses occur more frequently on coastal seas than in ports because the former has many fishing boats the operation sites of fishing boats in coastal waters overlap with the routes of merchant ships besides the results show that there were 19 cases of actual ship collisions involving fishing boats in the study area this represents 0 045 of all the 42 383 near miss cases related to fishing boats moreover among the 15 441 cases of near misses between non fishing boats there were only six cases 0 039 of actual ship collision the fishing boat related accident rate is thus 1 15 times that of non fishing boats the limitations in previous studies include visualizing the main sea area routes by merely plotting the ais tracks in this study this limitation was addressed by plotting the relative density of potentially dangerous locations moreover the flow of fishing boats was also represented in this study it is obvious that near misses cannot be determined with the help of raw data hence the use of data interpolation by means of phase angle difference furthermore the cubic spline was also implemented in this study the limitation in previous works was also addressed through tri dimensional schematization to depict the near miss density and by employing the rgb color in which a 64 color rgb model was designed which enables the implementation of 16 color or 8 color rgb model to achieve this near misses in the southern coastal sea of korea in 2014 were considered as well traffic flow of fishing boats it is convenient to emphasize that the primary objective of this near miss study is to contribute to the avoidance of future losses by identifying areas of concern and aiding the implementation of appropriate corrective actions international maritime organization 2008 the observations should be used to improve safety performance according to branch et al 2004 there is the need for the employment of watchkeepers on merchant ships to look out for fishing boats however even when fishing boats are sighted accidents still often occur due to the failure of timely action by the officer on watch an excuse that is often given for delayed action is that the movements of fishing boats are generally erratic and there was a possibility that boats would be maneuvered in order to avoid a collision moreover fishing boat skippers do not diligently look out and thus fail to take avoidance actions branch et al 2004 indeed an analysis of actual collision accidents revealed that the foremost cause 68 of collisions between fishing boats and non fishing boats was poor look out and that 68 of the fishing boat skippers involved in collision accidents possessed class 5 or 6 deck officer certificates of competency lee et al 2013 hence to reduce the occurrence of collision accidents it is necessary for relevant government agencies to review regulations regarding the navigation of fishing boats take steps to improve operator standard education and training and ensure the procurement of efficient navigation equipment in this study near misses between fishing boats were excluded because what is considered a near miss is typical of the fleet operation of fishing boats if the events between fishing boats are considered the near miss incidents would be much higher in addition the effects of hydro meteorological conditions such as visibility and wave height were not considered in the model the proposed near miss density model can be further refined to consider additional factors such as hydro meteorological conditions and ship size this may however require modification of the modeling technique to reflect the specificity of the concept being operationalized and the intended purpose special nautical maps that indicate the near miss density with respect to encounter type such as crossing and overtaking or encounter time such as daytime and nighttime can also be developed for deck officers for use in course planning and taking precaution when passing through potentially dangerous areas in addition the density map can be modified based on the intended application for example by using 27 colors comprising three levels of each of the primary colors r g and b or 16 colors comprising two levels of each of the primary colors 5 conclusion the purpose of the present study was to map the near miss density in the southern coastal sea of korea for the safe operation of ships and prevention of collisions the near miss density distribution was depicted using rgb colors the results of the analysis of the near miss incidents were used to develop a map that highlighted the areas with high near miss densities the proposed model enables easy recognition of relatively dangerous areas with regard to near miss encounters from ais and fishing boat location databases the limitation of previous studies included the use of ais tracks to visualize the main sea area routes to overcome this limitation the relative density of potentially dangerous locations was plotted in this study the flow of fishing boats was also represented this study used data interpolation by means of phase angle difference to avoid using raw data in addition the concept of near miss detection presented in this paper can be used for operational purposes for example as a tool for identifying possible critical situations and evaluating traffic situations it may contribute to facilitate policy decisions for the focused management of dangerous areas by vts and relevant government agencies the results of the present study also afford basic data for use in maritime traffic control to prevent ship collision the proposed spatial representation of dangerous areas can contribute to the overall enhancement of maritime traffic safety necessary measures should thus be taken to develop and implement appropriate maritime regulations the near miss density map would enable deck officers to intuitively sense relatively dangerous coastal areas affording very valuable navigation safety information however further study is required to determine the relationship between actual collision accidents and near misses this would enable the validation of the use of near misses for the assessment of maritime traffic safety conflicts of interest none acknowledgments funding this research did not receive any specific grant

23226,ocean wave energy is a clean and inexhaustible energy resource capable of providing more than 2 tw of energy supply worldwide among all the technologies available to convert wave energy the point absorber is one of the most promising solutions today due to its ease of both fabrication and installation the floaters of point absorber wecs wave energy converters are generally exposed to harsh marine environments with great uncertainties in environmental loads which make their reliability assessment quite challenging in this work a reliability assessment framework which combines parametric finite element analysis fea modelling response surface modelling and reliability analysis has been developed specifically for the floater of point absorber wecs an analytical model of point absorber wecs is also developed in this work to calculate wave loads and to validate the developed fea model after the validation through a series of simulations the reliability assessment framework has been applied to the notc national ocean technology centre 10 kw multiple point absorber wec to assess the reliability of the floater considering the fatigue limit state fls optimisation of key design components is also performed based on reliability assessment in order to achieve target reliability the results show that for the considered conditions the wec floater is prone to experience fatigue failure before the end of their nominal service life it is demonstrated that the reliability assessment framework developed in this work is capable of accurately assessing the reliability of wecs and optimising the structure on the basis of reliability keywords wave energy converters wecs point absorber reliability analysis reliability optimisation parametric finite element analysis fea response surface modelling 1 introduction climate change increasing energy demand globally rising industrialisation and population growth rate are just four of the driving factors that constitute clean sustainable and renewable energy one of the world s priorities that can enable further development although wind and solar energy have attracted significant attention so far as interaction with natural resources is straightforward in the last decade more consideration has been given to technologies harvesting energy from waves and tides ocean wave energy is a clean and inexhaustible resource able to provide more than 2 tw of energy supply worldwide gunn and stock williams 2012 wave energy potential has the advantages of being largely predictable and consistent topologically as well as having high energy density making it attractive to coastal countries bozzi et al 2013 lehmann et al 2017 the wave energy sector is today in the pre commercial phase mørk et al 2010 and much work is ongoing in order to raise the trl technology readiness level and then reduce the lcoe levelized cost of energy salvatore 2013 the device responsible for capturing and converting wave energy is the wave energy converter wec this technology generally uses a pto power take off system to convert the motion of the floater into electricity to the grid the floater is one of the key parts of the whole device despite the fact that many different types of wecs have been patented drew et al 2009 only a few of them have been developed and installed at sea bozzi et al 2013 according to the size and direction of elongation wecs can be roughly categorised into three groups drew et al 2009 i e 1 attenuators in which the principal axis is parallel to the wave propagation direction 2 terminators in which the principal axis is perpendicular to the wave propagation direction and 3 point absorber which is insensitive to wave direction due to its small dimensions relative to the incident wavelength among all these different solutions one of the most promising is the point absorber technology first of all its small dimensions allow the device to be wave direction independent and capable of absorbing power from all the wave directions which can be highly varied during the life of the device additionally this technology has the advantages of easy fabrication and installation drew et al 2009 cretel et al 2011 due to their relatively compact size the amount of energy that conventional single point absorber wecs can produce is relatively small when compared to other types of wecs however this limitation can be overcome by using multiple point absorbers which consist of several floaters in a conventional structural analysis the material properties environmental loads model dimensions and parameters are deterministic quantities this kind of analysis is reliable only in cases where randomness is relatively small however modern structures and more specifically those designed for offshore deployment generally require complex designs which are more sensitive to uncertainties considering the environmental operational and manufacturing processes involved for such systems uncertainties in design parameters should be taken into account systematically through stochastic modelling towards a more realistic and optimised design that would consider the structure s life cycle and associated time dependent damage mechanisms reliability analysis provides an effective approach for better understanding the system response to an input parameter change and hence leads to more reliable designs in this scenario this approach to the analysis of the wec is needed in order to model the uncertainties arising from the high complexity of the model its material properties load conditions and pto characteristics the methods used for structural modelling of wecs can be roughly categorised into two groups i e 1 experiments in which structural responses are measured using sensors such as strain gauges and displacement sensors 2 fea finite element analysis which predicts structural responses based on numerical simulations the first method allows the performing of direct experiments in the structure by measuring the strains of the assets considered and then assessing the related stresses the experimental method has the advantage of being accurate as modelling uncertainty is avoided however it is costly and time consuming when variability of response due to uncertainty in design variables is to be considered the second approach analyses the system response through computer simulated fea allowing for a wide variety of cases to be evaluated due to its high flexibility and fidelity fea has been widely used for solving complex engineering problems and is extensively applied to the structural modelling of renewable energy devices such as wind turbine composite blades wang et al 2016a 2016b 2016c offshore support structures gentils et al 2017 martinez luengo et al 2017 and marine structures nicholls lee et al 2011 tasdemir and nohut 2012 therefore fea is chosen in this study for the structural modelling of wecs as far as reliability analysis methods are concerned a series of methods with subsequent variations are available broadly categorised into analytical and stochastic methods common analytical reliability analysis methods are form first order reliability method hohenbichler and rackwitz 1982 and the sorm second order reliability method der kiureghian et al 1987 where the limit state function is approached through taylor s expansions and the problem of evaluating the reliability of a complex system is translated into a problem of mathematical optimisation sorm performs better in cases of highly non linear systems while in other cases the two methods give similar results choi et al 2006a with respect to stochastic methods mcs monte carlo simulation mooney 1997 is also commonly applied mainly due the benefits of direct simulations hence reducing uncertainty in the results due approximations in the solutions approach but with the constraint of calculating high probabilities for relatively non complex engineering systems for the nature of the problem that this work is investigating form is chosen as the most appropriate method to employ once the reliability assessment of the initial structure is performed for a given stochastic set of inputs the basis for optimisation of key variables of the model is established starting from an initial assessment it is possible to focus on the parts of the design that go into failure earlier and perform additional analysis to suggest modifications avoiding failure and achieving the target reliability through a balanced system which avoids unnecessary conservatism to the best of the authors knowledge the reliability assessment of a point absorber wec has not been reported in the literature although reliability has been identified as a key barrier in the further development of ocean energy technologies this paper aims to develop a reliability assessment framework for point absorber wec floaters and then improve the floater s initial design on the basis of reliability a reliability assessment framework for point absorber wec floaters which combines parametric fea modelling response surface modelling and reliability analysis is developed an analytical model of point absorber wecs is also developed in this work to calculate wave loads and to validate the fea model after the validation through a series of case studies the reliability assessment framework has been applied to the notc national ocean technology centre 10 kw multiple point absorber wec to assess its reliability performance this paper is structured as follows section 2 illustrates the notc 10 kw multi point absorber wec section 3 presents the analytical model of point absorber wecs section 4 presents the parametric fea model and section 5 details the implementation of the reliability assessment results and discussion are presented in section 6 followed by conclusions in section 7 2 notc 10 kw multi point absorber wec the wec analysed in this study is the notc 10 kw multi point absorber see fig 1 designed by the notc of tianjin china and manufactured by thoecl tianjin haijin ocean engineering corporation limited the prototype has six point absorbers i e floaters connected to a ship type platform for the tests the floaters are cone shaped and capable of capturing and converting the wave energy through their heave motion the heave motion of each floater can pump a hydraulic cylinder to produce high pressure oil which is then transported to the hydraulic motor through pipelines to generate electric power the overall capacity of the wec is 10 kw fig 2 a presents the 3d three dimensional geometry model of the whole system and fig 2b depicts a close view of the floater 3 analytical model of point absorber wecs an analytical model of the point absorber wecs is developed on the basis of the following assumptions small wave amplitude stable equilibrium of the floater negligible transverse motion of the floater steady state response in waves fig 3 shows the schematic of the analytical model of the point absorber wec the bar ad represents the floater arm having an angle θ with respect to the z axis points a and d are pivot points offsetting from the water surface with a height h and z respectively the pto of the system is represented by the bar bc having a length c and an angle ϕ with respect to the z axis the lengths of ac and ad are denoted by b 1 and b respectively according to the geometrical relations given in fig 3 the length c of the pto and the top location z of the floater can be respectively expressed as 1 c a 2 b 1 2 2 a b 1 cos θ 2 z h b sin θ wave load calculation and kinetic model of the wec are detailed below 3 1 wave load calculation a wave model of point absorber wecs has been developed in this work based on the potential flow theory lin 2014 which is a widely used method for calculating wave loads considering only the heave motion of the floater the total force f 3 acting in z direction can be expressed as 3 f 3 w s p n 3 d s where p is the linear hydrodynamic pressure at any point of the ws wet surface of the floater n 3 is the vertical component of n the unit normal direction of the floater surface the linear hydrodynamic pressure p in eq 3 is given by 4 p re ρ t φ φ i n where ρ is the seawater density φ is the perturbation velocity potential and φ i n is the velocity potential of the incident wave in case of monochromatic incident waves the velocity potential φ i n can be calculated by 5 φ i n a re φ i n 0 e i ω t where a is the wave amplitude ω is the circular frequency and φ i n 0 is the frequency domain wave potential of a monochromatic wave with unit amplitude for infinite depth water level φ i n 0 in eq 5 is given by 6 φ i n 0 g ω e k z i ρ where k is the wave number and ρ is the function of the direction of the incident waves the perturbation velocity potential φ needs to satisfy the following conditions 7 2 φ 0 internal flow field 8 n φ n φ i n u 3 n 3 floater surface boundary condition 9 2 t 2 φ g z φ 0 free surface boundary condition where u 3 is the floater velocity along the vertical direction due to the fact that the perturbation potential of the velocity is linear it can be decomposed to 10 φ re a φ 0 u 3 φ 3 e i ω t where φ 0 is the potential of the diffracted waves φ 3 is the potential of the radiation waves and u 3 is the amplitude of the velocity in order to solve these expressions substituting eqs 5 and 10 into eq 4 yields the pressure p 11 p re ρ t a φ 0 u 3 φ 3 e i ω t a φ i n 0 e i ω t substituting eq 11 into eq 3 gives 12 f 3

i ω t λ 33 u 3 μ 33 u 3 evaluating the coefficients for any reasonable wave frequency allows the estimation of the time dependent force acting on the structure 3 2 kinetic model of point absorber wecs a kinetic model of point absorber wecs has been developed in this work based on the law of conservation of energy the kinetic model aims to assess the energy of all the components of the wec to evaluate how the forces interact between them allowing the calculation of the displacement and velocity of the model the kinetic energy of the wecs can be expressed as 17 e e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 where e 1 is the kinetic energy coming from the rotation of the floater arm ad around a e 2 is the kinetic energy coming from the rotation of the hydraulic cylinder and piston bc around b e 3 is the kinetic

software the geometry material mesh and boundary conditions used in the fea model are presented below 4 1 geometry the basic design parameters of the wec floater are provided by the notc the whole system is composed of six cone shaped floaters having identical dimensions and therefore only one single floater will be studied in this work the cone shaped floater is depicted in fig 4 three different types of structural reinforcements stiffeners are used inside the floater as depicted in fig 5 further details of dimensions are not disclosed in this paper for confidentiality reasons 4 2 material different types of steel are used in the fabrication of the notc wec but for confidentiality reasons they are not disclosed in this paper as its main purpose is to illustrate the applicability of the methodological framework in this study the floater is assumed to be made of s355 steel which is a typical material used in marine structures material properties of s355 steel are listed in table 1 it should be noted that these properties can also be treated stochastically 4 3 mesh a critical step in the setting up of the model to be used for the fea is the mesh generation in order to find the appropriate mesh size a mesh sensitivity analysis is performed the ansys software package offers a reliable and powerful structured mesh generator capable of producing a consistent mesh in all of the structure with low computational requirement an approach suitable for this study five different mesh sizes were investigated i e 40 mm 20 mm 15 mm 10 mm and 5 mm in this case the wec floater is simulated under the fatigue design load case in china s bohai area with a significant wave height of 0 28 m and wave period of 6 2s the time dependent wave loads are calculated from the analytical model see section 3 1 fig 6 depicts the trend of the maximum von mises stress with the refining of the mesh size and detailed mesh analysis data are presented in table 2 as can be seen from fig 6 and table 2 the maximum von mises stress converges at the meshing size of 10 mm with a relative difference 0 32 when compared to the further mesh refinement therefore the meshing size of 10 mm is deemed appropriate and thus chosen in this study the created mesh is depicted in fig 7 4 4 boundary conditions in this study two types of boundary conditions are used i e joints and loads the whole wec would also include the floater arm but being outside the scope of this study it is therefore represented as a beam as shown in fig 8 the relative motion between the adjacent bodies is constrained by revolute joints that constrain three relative displacement dofs degrees of freedom and two out of three relative rotational dofs leaving just one rotational dof available to model the pto of the wec a spring joint characterised by pto stiffness and damping coefficient is also defined the joints introduced above are also depicted in fig 8 fig 9 depicts the load boundary condition used in this study as can be seen from fig 9 the time dependent wave loads of which values are obtained from the analytical model presented in section 3 1 are applied to the floater the direction of the load can be upwards or downwards depending on the time step considered 5 implementation of reliability assessment of wec floaters in this section the reliability assessment of wec floaters is implemented considering the fatigue limit state fls the fea model presented in section 4 is used to perform stochastic fea simulations of wec floaters taking account of stochastic variables such as wave loads and material properties response surface modelling is then used to post process the fea simulation results deriving the performance function expressed in terms of stochastic variables next form is applied to calculate the reliability index assessing the probability of failure of the structure the flowchart of the reliability assessment framework is presented in fig 10 5 1 limit state as a first step to implement the reliability assessment of a system the limit states considered have to be defined the basic design requirement is to give the structure an adequate safety margin that takes into account all the uncertainties in the modelling which affect the integrity of the asset wecs experience significant cyclic loads induced by the wave and their design is generally dominated by their fatigue performance therefore the fls which evaluates how the structure behaves with repeated load cycles under normal sea condition is considered in this study 5 2 determination of stochastic variables and mapping of the response domain the main parameters chosen stochastically are generally the ones regarding the load and material properties resistance of the structure zhang and zhang 2013 zhang and yang 2016 in this study four stochastic variables are considered i e young s module e wave load l spring damping coefficient d and spring stiffness coefficient k as listed in table 3 however the approach can be generalised for a greater number of variables in this study young s modulus and the spring s stiffness and damping coefficients are assumed to follow normal distributions veritas 1992 the mean value is the base design condition while the standard deviation is taken as 15 of the mean in this study the distribution type mean and standard deviation of these stochastic variables are presented in table 4 the wave load is considered differently based on its dependence on wave height and wave period to find the peak of the force acting on the system a truncated rayleigh distribution kolios 2010 is applied to the wave height allowing the system to consider that in the case of storm sea conditions the model can be taken out of the sea to avoid further damage once the maximum and minimum wave heights are defined considering an increment and decrement of 45 from the base load the rayleigh distribution is implemented this distribution is then fitted into a normal equivalent distribution to then follow relevant form procedures the latter transformations allow for the extension of the traditional form to account for various types of statistical distributions which can better fit certain variables in the presence of observed data distribution fitting algorithms such as akaike information criterion bayesian information criterion and kolmogorov smirnov are often employed to determine the shape coefficients of the most appropriate statistical distributions having defined the stochastic variables the fea model presented in section 4 is then used to perform a series of deterministic fea simulations of the wec floater with the help of the design of experiments module and pds probabilistic design system in ansys in order to map the response domain and later on derive an appropriate response surface model this allows the input parameters to be designated as stochastic variables having different types of distributions for stochastic simulation the number of samples is generally chosen between 2 n 1 and 3 n kolios 2010 where n is the number of stochastic variables the larger number of samples generally enables more accurate results but also requires more computational resources in order to achieve accurate results 100 simulations have been performed in ansys which is larger than 3 n obtaining response values of 100 design samples related to the different stochastic parameters selected each parameter is changed by incrementing and decrementing it with 3σ and 3σ in order to cover a reasonable and probable range of values the results are then imported into a matlab code that has been developed in this work for response surface modelling as detailed below 5 3 response surface modelling response surface modelling is generally used for deriving equation s to express a dependent variable in terms of one or more independent variables response surface and surrogate modelling methods are two categories of approximation methods that are often employed to model complex engineering systems the former usually derives analytical expressions of the system is in the shape of polynomial equations while the latter stores the system properties normally in a matrix closed form for further processing the expressions derived from either category of methods can be further combined with reliability analysis methods such as form sorm and mcs as well as employed in multi disciplinary optimisation problems the regression analysis performed in this study is based on the lsm least square method choi et al 2006a in which the best fit is obtained by minimising the absolute distance between the observed values and the fitted values provided by a fitting model its general approach can be expressed as 38 y x a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a 3 x 3 a n x n e where a i are the regression coefficients and e is the error term in the equation eq 38 can also be written in the following matrix form 39 y x a e where y is a matrix containing the dependent variables x is a matrix containing independent variables a is a matrix with the regression coefficients and e is a matrix with the error terms the regression coefficients a can be derived using the lsm 40 a x t x 1 x t y eq 38 shows the mathematical expression of a linear regression analysis in order to achieve a more accurate study the set of data assessed in this study will be treated with a quadratic regression following the same procedure potentially mixed terms can also be included in the expression to account for the correlation of independent variables at the expense of a higher minimum number of simulations required but this is not deemed necessary in this case as the variables are sufficiently uncorrelated as a result in case of a second order polynomial with four independent variables the multivariate polynomial expression can be rewritten as 41 y x a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 1 2 a 3 x 2 a 4 x 2 2 a 5 x 3 a 6 x 3 2 a 7 x 4 a 8 x 4 2 e 5 4 form first order reliability method having obtained the performance function as the expression of safety margin allowable minus actual resistance minus load the form is then used to estimate the reliability index through an iterative process the principle behind this method is based on the fact that the random variables are defined by their first second moments and so on the random variables are transformed in terms of their moments and the reliability index can be assessed by the approximation of the limit state function the probability of failure is computed as 42 p f φ β where β is the reliability index also defined as the minimum distance between the mpp most probable failure point and the origin and φ is the cumulative distribution function of a normal standard variable non normal distributions are accommodated through employing the hasofer lind rackwitz fiessler method choi et al 2006a which employs a normalised tail approximation to also account for non normal distributions the flowchart of the form analysis implemented in the study is based on the form presented in ref choi et al 2006b 6 results and discussion a generic framework for the reliability assessment for wecs has been developed and reported and its constituting blocks are validated by a series of case studies the main components of the reliability assessment framework i e fea model and form are validated separately after the validation the reliability assessment framework has been applied to assess the reliability of wec floaters and improve the floater initial design on the basis of reliability in this study the wec floater is simulated under the fatigue design load in china s bohai area the sea condition data are presented in table 5 6 1 validation case studies are performed to validate the main components of the reliability assessment framework for wec floaters i e fea model and form 6 1 1 validation of fea a case study is performed in order to validate the fea model in this case the wave load is calculated using the method presented in section 3 1 under the sea condition presented in table 5 the calculated wave load is then applied to the buoy in this case the time step in the fea model is chosen as 0 138s corresponding to 1 45 of wave period of 6 2s which is small enough to ensure good convergence the vertical displacement and velocity of the buoy calculated from the fea model presented in section 4 are compared with the results obtained from the analytical model presented in section 3 2 the comparison results are depicted in fig 11 from fig 11 we can see that 1 both vertical displacement and velocity of the floater vary periodically with the wave load 2 there is a phase shift between the vertical displacement and velocity 3 the results from the fea model show reasonable agreement with those from the analytical model in terms of both trend and magnitude with a maximum relative difference of 3 for vertical displacement and of 5 for vertical velocity the results confirm the validity of both fea and the analytical model 6 1 2 validation of the form for the validation of the form a comparison between the combination of the form and rsm and mcs has been performed for the case of a generic frame structure as a direct simulation probabilistic assessment of the floater would be computationally unfeasible the model consists of 40 interconnected members in three levels of the 3d symmetrical geometry with a series of 12 lateral and four vertical loads applied on the structure four stochastic variables are considered as illustrated in fig 12 for the mcs a convergence study was performed which concluded that 107 simulations were adequate to calculate the joint probabilities for all members this is also in line with the rule of thumb which suggests for number of simulations an order of magnitude higher than the inverse of the probabilities to be calculated in this case β values are less than 4 75 which corresponds to a probability of failure of 10 6 from the results presented fig 13 it can be seen that there is a trend of fea rsm to overestimate reliability index values when compared to direct mcs however the difference between predicted values remains consistently below 5 hence the agreement of the two methods can been considered sufficient taking into account that the time required for the fea rsm simulations is a few seconds compared to the mcs they are considered appropriate for problems similar to the one that is considered in this study in a second validation case the results from the matlab form code developed in this work are compared against the results from the mcs the performance function is obtained through post processing stochastic fea simulation results through response surface modelling the comparison results are depicted in fig 14 where the matlab form codes show reasonable agreement with those from mcs the same approach as mentioned previously for the resolution of the analysis was also followed here both in terms of trend and magnitude this further confirms the validity of the matlab form code developed in this work 6 2 case study application of fatigue based reliability assessment following the validation process the fea model is further applied to assess the fatigue reliability of the floater and then improve the floater on the basis of reliability 6 2 1 fatigue reliability the fatigue life limit state performed in this study takes into consideration the widely used method of s n curves according to this method the number of cycles to fatigue failure can be assessed by the equation 43 log n a m log δ s where a is the intercept m is the slope and δ s is the equivalent stress range table 6 presents the parameters of the s n curve used in this study taken from dnv standard dnv rp 2005 reliability index is an important performance parameter and it is a commonly used probabilistic measure of safety for fatigue reliability the reliability index generally varies with time as the total number of cycles of fatigue loads depends on the length of time the reliability assessment framework developed in this work is applied to assess the fatigue reliability of wec floater calculating the time dependent reliability index the calculated reliability index of the floater under fatigue load case is presented in fig 15 as expected the reliability index reduces as time increases it can also be observed that the structure does not achieve the reliability target of the 20 years design life typical value of offshore energy assets and the reliability index drops below the target reliability index 3 71 after about 4 1 years this indicates that the design specification considered for this analysis will experience fatigue failure before the end of its target life the reliability index trend presented in fig 15 which is an output of the present reliability assessment framework provides valuable information for designers regarding how the reliability index reduces with time and if the design achieves the reliability target if the design does not achieve the reliability target improvement of the structure on the basis of the reliability is then needed further this predicted performance can inform the operational management strategy of the asset specifying inspection and predictive maintenance requirements throughout its service life in order to maximise operational availability and reduce downtime additionally performing all the simulations allows us to understand how the structure behaves in terms of maximum von mises stress a local sensitivity analysis can be performed in order to assess what the most critical and important parameters are that can radically change the response and reliability performance of the system fig 16 shows how sensitive to the four design variables the structure is as expected the most critical parameter is the wave force that accounts for 58 of the total sensitivity both stiffness and damping coefficients are around 20 and also expected is the fact that the young s module is only 3 6 2 2 design considerations based on reliability analysis starting from the results shown in section 6 2 1 where reliability values for all components have been calculated a further study is conducted to improve the behaviour of the structure from a fatigue life perspective moreover considering that the critical point of the system is reinforcement a see fig 5 in section 4 1 that goes to failure after about 4 1 years some considerations are made starting from the thickness of this component in order to achieve the reliability target of 20 years some changes have to be made in the design the thickness of reinforcement a which is the first one that is expected to fail is considered as a design variable in this case for refining the design a parametric analysis considering different thickness of reinforcement a is performed studying the fatigue life of the system with the s n curve approach the percentage of increment in the thickness starting from the base load and the design life is represented in fig 17 as can be seen in fig 17 the design life of the model increases with the thickness of reinforcement in this case the target design life of 20 years is reached at a percentage increment of around 140 in the thickness of reinforcement a the practical implication of this result is that the target design life of wec floaters can be achieved through properly engineering the thickness of the floater structure on the basis of reliability in this study fatigue reliability analysis is performed for each incremental thickness of the reinforcement and the results of reliability analysis are then used to inform improvements to the design in order to achieve target reliability levels robustness and efficiency of the method reported herein allow for a further more holistic optimisation approach through appropriate constraints in order to minimise the objective function of mass structure while fulfilling the criterion of target reliability it should be noted that the standard deviation of stochastic variables in this study is assumed to be 15 of the mean which is an assumed value for this case study in absence of more realistic disclosable data the higher value of standard deviation generally infers to higher scatter in stochastic variables which results in reduced reliability levels detailed investigation on available data for accurate modelling of stochastic variables through experimental tests or structural health monitoring system are highly recommended for detailed design of wave energy converters 7 conclusions in this study a reliability assessment framework for point absorber wecs wave energy converters has been developed the framework starts by defining limit states taking account of the fls fatigue limit state a parametric fea finite element analysis model of point absorber wecs is developed considering the stochastic variables e g wave loads and material properties etc the series of fea simulation results are post processed through multivariate regression deriving the performance function expressed in terms of stochastic variables the form first order reliability method is then employed to calculate the reliability index and implemented in a matlab code the proposed framework is applied for the reliability assessment of the notc national ocean technology centre 10 kw multi point wecs the following conclusions can be drawn from the present study both vertical displacement and vertical velocity of the floater calculated from the fea model show reasonable agreement with those from an analytical model also developed in this work which confirms the validity of both fea and analytical models good agreement is achieved when comparing the reliability index calculated from the matlab form code against those from literature and mcs monte carlo simulation which confirms the validity of the matlab form code developed in this work the reliability index of the floater under the fls drops below the target reliability index 3 71 after about 4 1 years which indicates the floater is likely to experience fatigue failure to reach the target life of 20 years some decisions regarding the thickness and design of the structure have to be made in the considered case study increasing the thickness of the reinforcement by around 140 results in the floater achieving the reliability target levels based on the evidence presented in this paper the reliability assessment framework developed and reported in this work is capable of accurately assessing the reliability of point absorber wecs and setting the basis for improving the design of the structure on the basis of reliability the methodology can be further applied in similar problems of ocean energy technologies where complex systems are subject to a variety of uncertain design variables acknowledgements this work was supported by grant ep m020339 1 for

23226,ocean wave energy is a clean and inexhaustible energy resource capable of providing more than 2 tw of energy supply worldwide among all the technologies available to convert wave energy the point absorber is one of the most promising solutions today due to its ease of both fabrication and installation the floaters of point absorber wecs wave energy converters are generally exposed to harsh marine environments with great uncertainties in environmental loads which make their reliability assessment quite challenging in this work a reliability assessment framework which combines parametric finite element analysis fea modelling response surface modelling and reliability analysis has been developed specifically for the floater of point absorber wecs an analytical model of point absorber wecs is also developed in this work to calculate wave loads and to validate the developed fea model after the validation through a series of simulations the reliability assessment framework has been applied to the notc national ocean technology centre 10 kw multiple point absorber wec to assess the reliability of the floater considering the fatigue limit state fls optimisation of key design components is also performed based on reliability assessment in order to achieve target reliability the results show that for the considered conditions the wec floater is prone to experience fatigue failure before the end of their nominal service life it is demonstrated that the reliability assessment framework developed in this work is capable of accurately assessing the reliability of wecs and optimising the structure on the basis of reliability keywords wave energy converters wecs point absorber reliability analysis reliability optimisation parametric finite element analysis fea response surface modelling 1 introduction climate change increasing energy demand globally rising industrialisation and population growth rate are just four of the driving factors that constitute clean sustainable and renewable energy one of the world s priorities that can enable further development although wind and solar energy have attracted significant attention so far as interaction with natural resources is straightforward in the last decade more consideration has been given to technologies harvesting energy from waves and tides ocean wave energy is a clean and inexhaustible resource able to provide more than 2 tw of energy supply worldwide gunn and stock williams 2012 wave energy potential has the advantages of being largely predictable and consistent topologically as well as having high energy density making it attractive to coastal countries bozzi et al 2013 lehmann et al 2017 the wave energy sector is today in the pre commercial phase mørk et al 2010 and much work is ongoing in order to raise the trl technology readiness level and then reduce the lcoe levelized cost of energy salvatore 2013 the device responsible for capturing and converting wave energy is the wave energy converter wec this technology generally uses a pto power take off system to convert the motion of the floater into electricity to the grid the floater is one of the key parts of the whole device despite the fact that many different types of wecs have been patented drew et al 2009 only a few of them have been developed and installed at sea bozzi et al 2013 according to the size and direction of elongation wecs can be roughly categorised into three groups drew et al 2009 i e 1 attenuators in which the principal axis is parallel to the wave propagation direction 2 terminators in which the principal axis is perpendicular to the wave propagation direction and 3 point absorber which is insensitive to wave direction due to its small dimensions relative to the incident wavelength among all these different solutions one of the most promising is the point absorber technology first of all its small dimensions allow the device to be wave direction independent and capable of absorbing power from all the wave directions which can be highly varied during the life of the device additionally this technology has the advantages of easy fabrication and installation drew et al 2009 cretel et al 2011 due to their relatively compact size the amount of energy that conventional single point absorber wecs can produce is relatively small when compared to other types of wecs however this limitation can be overcome by using multiple point absorbers which consist of several floaters in a conventional structural analysis the material properties environmental loads model dimensions and parameters are deterministic quantities this kind of analysis is reliable only in cases where randomness is relatively small however modern structures and more specifically those designed for offshore deployment generally require complex designs which are more sensitive to uncertainties considering the environmental operational and manufacturing processes involved for such systems uncertainties in design parameters should be taken into account systematically through stochastic modelling towards a more realistic and optimised design that would consider the structure s life cycle and associated time dependent damage mechanisms reliability analysis provides an effective approach for better understanding the system response to an input parameter change and hence leads to more reliable designs in this scenario this approach to the analysis of the wec is needed in order to model the uncertainties arising from the high complexity of the model its material properties load conditions and pto characteristics the methods used for structural modelling of wecs can be roughly categorised into two groups i e 1 experiments in which structural responses are measured using sensors such as strain gauges and displacement sensors 2 fea finite element analysis which predicts structural responses based on numerical simulations the first method allows the performing of direct experiments in the structure by measuring the strains of the assets considered and then assessing the related stresses the experimental method has the advantage of being accurate as modelling uncertainty is avoided however it is costly and time consuming when variability of response due to uncertainty in design variables is to be considered the second approach analyses the system response through computer simulated fea allowing for a wide variety of cases to be evaluated due to its high flexibility and fidelity fea has been widely used for solving complex engineering problems and is extensively applied to the structural modelling of renewable energy devices such as wind turbine composite blades wang et al 2016a 2016b 2016c offshore support structures gentils et al 2017 martinez luengo et al 2017 and marine structures nicholls lee et al 2011 tasdemir and nohut 2012 therefore fea is chosen in this study for the structural modelling of wecs as far as reliability analysis methods are concerned a series of methods with subsequent variations are available broadly categorised into analytical and stochastic methods common analytical reliability analysis methods are form first order reliability method hohenbichler and rackwitz 1982 and the sorm second order reliability method der kiureghian et al 1987 where the limit state function is approached through taylor s expansions and the problem of evaluating the reliability of a complex system is translated into a problem of mathematical optimisation sorm performs better in cases of highly non linear systems while in other cases the two methods give similar results choi et al 2006a with respect to stochastic methods mcs monte carlo simulation mooney 1997 is also commonly applied mainly due the benefits of direct simulations hence reducing uncertainty in the results due approximations in the solutions approach but with the constraint of calculating high probabilities for relatively non complex engineering systems for the nature of the problem that this work is investigating form is chosen as the most appropriate method to employ once the reliability assessment of the initial structure is performed for a given stochastic set of inputs the basis for optimisation of key variables of the model is established starting from an initial assessment it is possible to focus on the parts of the design that go into failure earlier and perform additional analysis to suggest modifications avoiding failure and achieving the target reliability through a balanced system which avoids unnecessary conservatism to the best of the authors knowledge the reliability assessment of a point absorber wec has not been reported in the literature although reliability has been identified as a key barrier in the further development of ocean energy technologies this paper aims to develop a reliability assessment framework for point absorber wec floaters and then improve the floater s initial design on the basis of reliability a reliability assessment framework for point absorber wec floaters which combines parametric fea modelling response surface modelling and reliability analysis is developed an analytical model of point absorber wecs is also developed in this work to calculate wave loads and to validate the fea model after the validation through a series of case studies the reliability assessment framework has been applied to the notc national ocean technology centre 10 kw multiple point absorber wec to assess its reliability performance this paper is structured as follows section 2 illustrates the notc 10 kw multi point absorber wec section 3 presents the analytical model of point absorber wecs section 4 presents the parametric fea model and section 5 details the implementation of the reliability assessment results and discussion are presented in section 6 followed by conclusions in section 7 2 notc 10 kw multi point absorber wec the wec analysed in this study is the notc 10 kw multi point absorber see fig 1 designed by the notc of tianjin china and manufactured by thoecl tianjin haijin ocean engineering corporation limited the prototype has six point absorbers i e floaters connected to a ship type platform for the tests the floaters are cone shaped and capable of capturing and converting the wave energy through their heave motion the heave motion of each floater can pump a hydraulic cylinder to produce high pressure oil which is then transported to the hydraulic motor through pipelines to generate electric power the overall capacity of the wec is 10 kw fig 2 a presents the 3d three dimensional geometry model of the whole system and fig 2b depicts a close view of the floater 3 analytical model of point absorber wecs an analytical model of the point absorber wecs is developed on the basis of the following assumptions small wave amplitude stable equilibrium of the floater negligible transverse motion of the floater steady state response in waves fig 3 shows the schematic of the analytical model of the point absorber wec the bar ad represents the floater arm having an angle θ with respect to the z axis points a and d are pivot points offsetting from the water surface with a height h and z respectively the pto of the system is represented by the bar bc having a length c and an angle ϕ with respect to the z axis the lengths of ac and ad are denoted by b 1 and b respectively according to the geometrical relations given in fig 3 the length c of the pto and the top location z of the floater can be respectively expressed as 1 c a

based on the potential flow theory lin 2014 which is a widely used method for calculating wave loads considering only the heave motion of the floater the total force f 3 acting in z direction can be expressed as 3 f 3 w s p n 3 d s where p is the linear hydrodynamic pressure at any point of the ws wet surface of the floater n 3 is the vertical component of n the unit normal direction of the floater surface the linear hydrodynamic pressure p in eq 3 is given by 4 p re ρ t φ φ i n where ρ is the seawater density φ is the perturbation velocity potential and φ i n is the velocity potential of the incident wave in case of monochromatic incident waves the velocity potential φ i n can be calculated by 5 φ i n a re φ i n 0 e i ω t where a is the wave amplitude ω is the circular frequency and φ i n 0 is the frequency domain wave potential of a monochromatic wave with unit amplitude for infinite depth water level φ i n 0 in eq 5 is given by 6 φ i n 0 g ω e k z i ρ where k is the wave number and ρ is the function of the direction of the incident waves the perturbation velocity potential φ needs to satisfy the following conditions 7 2 φ 0 internal flow field 8 n φ n φ i n u 3 n 3 floater surface boundary condition 9 2 t 2 φ g z φ 0 free surface boundary condition where u 3 is the floater velocity along the vertical direction due to the fact that the perturbation potential of the velocity is linear it can be decomposed to 10 φ re a φ 0 u 3 φ 3 e i ω t where φ 0 is the potential of the diffracted waves φ 3 is the potential of the radiation waves and u 3 is the amplitude of the velocity in order to solve these expressions substituting eqs 5 and 10 into eq 4 yields the pressure p 11 p re ρ t a φ 0 u 3 φ 3 e i ω t a φ i n 0 e i ω t substituting eq 11 into eq 3 gives 12 f 3

i ω t λ 33 u 3 μ 33 u 3 evaluating the coefficients for any reasonable wave frequency allows the estimation of the time dependent force acting on the structure 3 2 kinetic model of point absorber wecs a kinetic model of point absorber wecs has been developed in this work based on the law of conservation of energy the kinetic model aims to assess the energy of all the components of the wec to evaluate how the forces interact between them allowing the calculation of the displacement and velocity of the model the kinetic energy of the wecs can be expressed as 17 e e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 where e 1 is the kinetic energy coming from the rotation of the floater arm ad around a e 2 is the kinetic energy coming from the rotation of the hydraulic cylinder and piston bc around b e 3 is the kinetic

software the geometry material mesh and boundary conditions used in the fea model are presented below 4 1 geometry the basic design parameters of the wec floater are provided by the notc the whole system is composed of six cone shaped floaters having identical dimensions and therefore only one single floater will be studied in this work the cone shaped floater is depicted in fig 4 three different types of structural reinforcements stiffeners are used inside the floater as depicted in fig 5 further details of dimensions are not disclosed in this paper for confidentiality reasons 4 2 material different types of steel are used in the fabrication of the notc wec but for confidentiality reasons they are not disclosed in this paper as its main purpose is to illustrate the applicability of the methodological framework in this study the floater is assumed to be made of s355 steel which is a typical material used in marine structures material properties of s355 steel are listed in table 1 it should be noted that these properties can also be treated stochastically 4 3 mesh a critical step in the setting up of the model to be used for the fea is the mesh generation in order to find the appropriate mesh size a mesh sensitivity analysis is performed the ansys software package offers a reliable and powerful structured mesh generator capable of producing a consistent mesh in all of the structure with low computational requirement an approach suitable for this study five different mesh sizes were investigated i e 40 mm 20 mm 15 mm 10 mm and 5 mm in this case the wec floater is simulated under the fatigue design load case in china s bohai area with a significant wave height of 0 28 m and wave period of 6 2s the time dependent wave loads are calculated from the analytical model see section 3 1 fig 6 depicts the trend of the maximum von mises stress with the refining of the mesh size and detailed mesh analysis data are presented in table 2 as can be seen from fig 6 and table 2 the maximum von mises stress converges at the meshing size of 10 mm with a relative difference 0 32 when compared to the further mesh refinement therefore the meshing size of 10 mm is deemed appropriate and thus chosen in this study the created mesh is depicted in fig 7 4 4 boundary conditions in this study two types of boundary conditions are used i e joints and loads the whole wec would also include the floater arm but being outside the scope of this study it is therefore represented as a beam as shown in fig 8 the relative motion between the adjacent bodies is constrained by revolute joints that constrain three relative displacement dofs degrees of freedom and two out of three relative rotational dofs leaving just one rotational dof available to model the pto of the wec a spring joint characterised by pto stiffness and damping coefficient is also defined the joints introduced above are also depicted in fig 8 fig 9 depicts the load boundary condition used in this study as can be seen from fig 9 the time dependent wave loads of which values are obtained from the analytical model presented in section 3 1 are applied to the floater the direction of the load can be upwards or downwards depending on the time step considered 5 implementation of reliability assessment of wec floaters in this section the reliability assessment of wec floaters is implemented considering the fatigue limit state fls the fea model presented in section 4 is used to perform stochastic fea simulations of wec floaters taking account of stochastic variables such as wave loads and material properties response surface modelling is then used to post process the fea simulation results deriving the performance function expressed in terms of stochastic variables next form is applied to calculate the reliability index assessing the probability of failure of the structure the flowchart of the reliability assessment framework is presented in fig 10 5 1 limit state as a first step to implement the reliability assessment of a system the limit states considered have to be defined the basic design requirement is to give the structure an adequate safety margin that takes into account all the uncertainties in the modelling which affect the integrity of the asset wecs experience significant cyclic loads induced by the wave and their design is generally dominated by their fatigue performance therefore the fls which evaluates how the structure behaves with repeated load cycles under normal sea condition is considered in this study 5 2 determination of stochastic variables and mapping of the response domain the main parameters chosen stochastically are generally the ones regarding the load and material properties resistance of the structure zhang and zhang 2013 zhang and yang 2016 in this study four stochastic variables are considered i e young s module e wave load l spring damping coefficient d and spring stiffness coefficient k as listed in table 3 however the approach can be generalised for a greater number of variables in this study young s modulus and the spring s stiffness and damping coefficients are assumed to follow normal distributions veritas 1992 the mean value is the base design condition while the standard deviation is taken as 15 of the mean in this study the distribution type mean and standard deviation of these stochastic variables are presented in table 4 the wave load is considered differently based on its dependence on wave height and wave period to find the peak of the force acting on the system a truncated rayleigh distribution kolios 2010 is applied to the wave height allowing the system to consider that in the case of storm sea conditions the model can be taken out of the sea to avoid further damage once the maximum and minimum wave heights are defined considering an increment and decrement of 45 from the base load the rayleigh distribution is implemented this distribution is then fitted into a normal equivalent distribution to then follow relevant form procedures the latter transformations allow for the extension of the traditional form to account for various types of statistical distributions which can better fit certain variables in the presence of observed data distribution fitting algorithms such as akaike information criterion bayesian information criterion and kolmogorov smirnov are often employed to determine the shape coefficients of the most appropriate statistical distributions having defined the stochastic variables the fea model presented in section 4 is then used to perform a series of deterministic fea simulations of the wec floater with the help of the design of experiments module and pds probabilistic design system in ansys in order to map the response domain and later on derive an appropriate response surface model this allows the input parameters to be designated as stochastic variables having different types of distributions for stochastic simulation the number of samples is generally chosen between 2 n 1 and 3 n kolios 2010 where n is the number of stochastic variables the larger number of samples generally enables more accurate results but also requires more computational resources in order to achieve accurate results 100 simulations have been performed in ansys which is larger than 3 n obtaining response values of 100 design samples related to the different stochastic parameters selected each parameter is changed by incrementing and decrementing it with 3σ and 3σ in order to cover a reasonable and probable range of values the results are then imported into a matlab code that has been developed in this work for response surface modelling as detailed below 5 3 response surface modelling response surface modelling is generally used for deriving equation s to express a dependent variable in terms of one or more independent variables response surface and surrogate modelling methods are two categories of approximation methods that are often employed to model complex engineering systems the former usually derives analytical expressions of the system is in the shape of polynomial equations while the latter stores the system properties normally in a matrix closed form for further processing the expressions derived from either category of methods can be further combined with reliability analysis methods such as form sorm and mcs as well as employed in multi disciplinary optimisation problems the regression analysis performed in this study is based on the lsm least square method choi et al 2006a in which the best fit is obtained by minimising the absolute distance between the observed values and the fitted values provided by a fitting model its general approach can be expressed as 38 y x a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a 3 x 3 a n x n e where a i are the regression coefficients and e is the error term in the equation eq 38 can also be written in the following matrix form 39 y x a e where y is a matrix containing the dependent variables x is a matrix containing independent variables a is a matrix with the regression coefficients and e is a matrix with the error terms the regression coefficients a can be derived using the lsm 40 a x t x 1 x t y eq 38 shows the mathematical expression of a linear regression analysis in order to achieve a more accurate study the set of data assessed in this study will be treated with a quadratic regression following the same procedure potentially mixed terms can also be included in the expression to account for the correlation of independent variables at the expense of a higher minimum number of simulations required but this is not deemed necessary in this case as the variables are sufficiently uncorrelated as a result in case of a second order polynomial with four independent variables the multivariate polynomial expression can be rewritten as 41 y x a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 1 2 a 3 x 2 a 4 x 2 2 a 5 x 3 a 6 x 3 2 a 7 x 4 a 8 x 4 2 e 5 4 form first order reliability method having obtained the performance function as the expression of safety margin allowable minus actual resistance minus load the form is then used to estimate the reliability index through an iterative process the principle behind this method is based on the fact that the random variables are defined by their first second moments and so on the random variables are transformed in terms of their moments and the reliability index can be assessed by the approximation of the limit state function the probability of failure is computed as 42 p f φ β where β is the reliability index also defined as the minimum distance between the mpp most probable failure point and the origin and φ is the cumulative distribution function of a normal standard variable non normal distributions are accommodated through employing the hasofer lind rackwitz fiessler method choi et al 2006a which employs a normalised tail approximation to also account for non normal distributions the flowchart of the form analysis implemented in the study is based on the form presented in ref choi et al 2006b 6 results and discussion a generic framework for the reliability assessment for wecs has been developed and reported and its constituting blocks are validated by a series of case studies the main components of the reliability assessment framework i e fea model and form are validated separately after the validation the reliability assessment framework has been applied to assess the reliability of wec floaters and improve the floater initial design on the basis of reliability in this study the wec floater is simulated under the fatigue design load in china s bohai area the sea condition data are presented in table 5 6 1 validation case studies are performed to validate the main components of the reliability assessment framework for wec floaters i e fea model and form 6 1 1 validation of fea a case study is performed in order to validate the fea model in this case the wave load is calculated using the method presented in section 3 1 under the sea condition presented in table 5 the calculated wave load is then applied to the buoy in this case the time step in the fea model is chosen as 0 138s corresponding to 1 45 of wave period of 6 2s which is small enough to ensure good convergence the vertical displacement and velocity of the buoy calculated from the fea model presented in section 4 are compared with the results obtained from the analytical model presented in section 3 2 the comparison results are depicted in fig 11 from fig 11 we can see that 1 both vertical displacement and velocity of the floater vary periodically with the wave load 2 there is a phase shift between the vertical displacement and velocity 3 the results from the fea model show reasonable agreement with those from the analytical model in terms of both trend and magnitude with a maximum relative difference of 3 for vertical displacement and of 5 for vertical velocity the results confirm the validity of both fea and the analytical model 6 1 2 validation of the form for the validation of the form a comparison between the combination of the form and rsm and mcs has been performed for the case of a generic frame structure as a direct simulation probabilistic assessment of the floater would be computationally unfeasible the model consists of 40 interconnected members in three levels of the 3d symmetrical geometry with a series of 12 lateral and four vertical loads applied on the structure four stochastic variables are considered as illustrated in fig 12 for the mcs a convergence study was performed which concluded that 107 simulations were adequate to calculate the joint probabilities for all members this is also in line with the rule of thumb which suggests for number of simulations an order of magnitude higher than the inverse of the probabilities to be calculated in this case β values are less than 4 75 which corresponds to a probability of failure of 10 6 from the results presented fig 13 it can be seen that there is a trend of fea rsm to overestimate reliability index values when compared to direct mcs however the difference between predicted values remains consistently below 5 hence the agreement of the two methods can been considered sufficient taking into account that the time required for the fea rsm simulations is a few seconds compared to the mcs they are considered appropriate for problems similar to the one that is considered in this study in a second validation case the results from the matlab form code developed in this work are compared against the results from the mcs the performance function is obtained through post processing stochastic fea simulation results through response surface modelling the comparison results are depicted in fig 14 where the matlab form codes show reasonable agreement with those from mcs the same approach as mentioned previously for the resolution of the analysis was also followed here both in terms of trend and magnitude this further confirms the validity of the matlab form code developed in this work 6 2 case study application of fatigue based reliability assessment following the validation process the fea model is further applied to assess the fatigue reliability of the floater and then improve the floater on the basis of reliability 6 2 1 fatigue reliability the fatigue life limit state performed in this study takes into consideration the widely used method of s n curves according to this method the number of cycles to fatigue failure can be assessed by the equation 43 log n a m log δ s where a is the intercept m is the slope and δ s is the equivalent stress range table 6 presents the parameters of the s n curve used in this study taken from dnv standard dnv rp 2005 reliability index is an important performance parameter and it is a commonly used probabilistic measure of safety for fatigue reliability the reliability index generally varies with time as the total number of cycles of fatigue loads depends on the length of time the reliability assessment framework developed in this work is applied to assess the fatigue reliability of wec floater calculating the time dependent reliability index the calculated reliability index of the floater under fatigue load case is presented in fig 15 as expected the reliability index reduces as time increases it can also be observed that the structure does not achieve the reliability target of the 20 years design life typical value of offshore energy assets and the reliability index drops below the target reliability index 3 71 after about 4 1 years this indicates that the design specification considered for this analysis will experience fatigue failure before the end of its target life the reliability index trend presented in fig 15 which is an output of the present reliability assessment framework provides valuable information for designers regarding how the reliability index reduces with time and if the design achieves the reliability target if the design does not achieve the reliability target improvement of the structure on the basis of the reliability is then needed further this predicted performance can inform the operational management strategy of the asset specifying inspection and predictive maintenance requirements throughout its service life in order to maximise operational availability and reduce downtime additionally performing all the simulations allows us to understand how the structure behaves in terms of maximum von mises stress a local sensitivity analysis can be performed in order to assess what the most critical and important parameters are that can radically change the response and reliability performance of the system fig 16 shows how sensitive to the four design variables the structure is as expected the most critical parameter is the wave force that accounts for 58 of the total sensitivity both stiffness and damping coefficients are around 20 and also expected is the fact that the young s module is only 3 6 2 2 design considerations based on reliability analysis starting from the results shown in section 6 2 1 where reliability values for all components have been calculated a further study is conducted to improve the behaviour of the structure from a fatigue life perspective moreover considering that the critical point of the system is reinforcement a see fig 5 in section 4 1 that goes to failure after about 4 1 years some considerations are made starting from the thickness of this component in order to achieve the reliability target of 20 years some changes have to be made in the design the thickness of reinforcement a which is the first one that is expected to fail is considered as a design variable in this case for refining the design a parametric analysis considering different thickness of reinforcement a is performed studying the fatigue life of the system with the s n curve approach the percentage of increment in the thickness starting from the base load and the design life is represented in fig 17 as can be seen in fig 17 the design life of the model increases with the thickness of reinforcement in this case the target design life of 20 years is reached at a percentage increment of around 140 in the thickness of reinforcement a the practical implication of this result is that the target design life of wec floaters can be achieved through properly engineering the thickness of the floater structure on the basis of reliability in this study fatigue reliability analysis is performed for each incremental thickness of the reinforcement and the results of reliability analysis are then used to inform improvements to the design in order to achieve target reliability levels robustness and efficiency of the method reported herein allow for a further more holistic optimisation approach through appropriate constraints in order to minimise the objective function of mass structure while fulfilling the criterion of target reliability it should be noted that the standard deviation of stochastic variables in this study is assumed to be 15 of the mean which is an assumed value for this case study in absence of more realistic disclosable data the higher value of standard deviation generally infers to higher scatter in stochastic variables which results in reduced reliability levels detailed investigation on available data for accurate modelling of stochastic variables through experimental tests or structural health monitoring system are highly recommended for detailed design of wave energy converters 7 conclusions in this study a reliability assessment framework for point absorber wecs wave energy converters has been developed the framework starts by defining limit states taking account of the fls fatigue limit state a parametric fea finite element analysis model of point absorber wecs is developed considering the stochastic variables e g wave loads and material properties etc the series of fea simulation results are post processed through multivariate regression deriving the performance function expressed in terms of stochastic variables the form first order reliability method is then employed to calculate the reliability index and implemented in a matlab code the proposed framework is applied for the reliability assessment of the notc national ocean technology centre 10 kw multi point wecs the following conclusions can be drawn from the present study both vertical displacement and vertical velocity of the floater calculated from the fea model show reasonable agreement with those from an analytical model also developed in this work which confirms the validity of both fea and analytical models good agreement is achieved when comparing the reliability index calculated from the matlab form code against those from literature and mcs monte carlo simulation which confirms the validity of the matlab form code developed in this work the reliability index of the floater under the fls drops below the target reliability index 3 71 after about 4 1 years which indicates the floater is likely to experience fatigue failure to reach the target life of 20 years some decisions regarding the thickness and design of the structure have to be made in the considered case study increasing the thickness of the reinforcement by around 140 results in the floater achieving the reliability target levels based on the evidence presented in this paper the reliability assessment framework developed and reported in this work is capable of accurately assessing the reliability of point absorber wecs and setting the basis for improving the design of the structure on the basis of reliability the methodology can be further applied in similar problems of ocean energy technologies where complex systems are subject to a variety of uncertain design variables acknowledgements this work was supported by grant ep m020339 1 for

23227,a conceptual design of autonomous underwater glider aug is introduced with a pair of bio inspired hydro wings undergoing travelling wave motion hydrodynamic performance of current aug is investigated by numerically solving the incompressible viscous navier stokes equations of its surrounding flow coupling with the immersed boundary method to capture the moving boundaries the force balance along the stream direction is guaranteed by adjusting the kinematic parameters of the travelling wave motion thus the cruise state of the aug with a constant velocity can be achieved the propulsive efficiency under cruise state is therefore directly and well defined the effects of kinematic parameters on propulsive performance are investigated and the non dimensional strouhal number as a combination of these kinematic parameters turns to be a dominant parameter of the propulsive efficiency there is an optimum range of strouhal number in which the aug achieves its maximum efficiency the results obtained in current study can provide certain technical supports for the design and development of small submersible vehicle keywords autonomous underwater glider aug bio inspiration fluid structure interaction travelling wave 1 introduction autonomous underwater glider aug is a novel autonomous underwater vehicle auv without external active propeller since stommel 1989 first put forward the concept of underwater glider several kinds of augs have been built in succession which are used both in military and civil applications compared with the traditional auv aug has several advantages such as low noise low energy consumption long operational range and endurance and great operational flexibility davis et al 2002 claustre and beguery 2014 chen et al 2015 aug is a buoyancy driven device and it periodically changes its net buoyancy by a hydraulic pump to glide upwards and downwards alternately as aug dives and ascends its internal ballast changes its position to control attitude and its body and wings provide longitudinal hydrodynamic force to drive itself moving forward asakawa et al 2012 mitchell et al 2013 javaid et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 ye and qi 2013 however apart from aforementioned advantages some problems concerning aug should be given due attention one of the most crucial problems is drifting with the current for achieving intense data collection the gliding speed of aug has to be relatively low which is only about 0 5 knot 0 25 m s under such a low speed movement of aug would be easily influenced by ocean current and it is not able to be continually maintained following the initially desired route thus failing to complete specific task hence aug may encounter a risk of mission failure when operated in a strong current li et al 2016 liu et al 2017 therefore additional control strategies are required to make aug s trajectory as desired and meanwhile without significant energy consumption aiming at this extensive studies have been reported recently niu et al 2016 proposed a prototype design of hybrid vehicle to improve aug s gliding speed by using of the additional propeller positioned at the rear part of aug and the trial result shows that the hybrid underwater glider can achieve the maximum gliding speed of 3 knots similarly claus bachmayer 2016 adopted an energy optimal depth controller design methodology for a long range auv presented with applications to a propeller driven hybrid aug jeong et al 2016 designed a novel underwater glider having a high horizontal speed of the maximum 2 5 knots with the help of a controllable buoyancy engine to regulate the amount of buoyancy drastically zhang et al 2017 utilized supercavitation to reduce drag and increase their underwater speed most of the research mentioned above make effort on utilizing external propeller to increase augs gliding speed consequently the external propeller shall import additional drag which will cause negative impact to its endurance and gliding range besides problems of vibration and noise will destroy aug s concealment with the introduction of propeller owing to these alternative solutions to solve this problem from other perspectives are required it is worth noting that in nature many creatures have acquired extraordinary abilities of locomotion such as high efficiency fast manoeuvrability and low noise etc through natural selection and evolution this inspires scientists and engineers to explore the nature of their excellent athletic ability among them fish swimming in lake and sea are typical kind of creatures with extraordinary athletic ability sfakiotakis et al 1999 in the past several decades great endeavours have been devoted in the study on hydrodynamic mechanism of fish swimming triantafyllou et al 2000 2004 as well as the design of robotic fish triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1995 roper et al 2011 raj and thakur 2016 on the other hand a complementary design of bioinspired aug also attracts attentions recently fish et al 2003 georgiades et al 2009 li et al 2016 which can achieve high efficient propulsion by mimicking fish swimming and meanwhile fulfil the requirement of enough space for payload and avoid the deformation fuselage like robotic fish in detail the bioinspired aug consists of two major parts i e a biomimetic propeller and a rigid cantered fuselage with the help of biomimetic propeller e g flapping wing or wavy plate aug can maintain its initial gliding route and at the same time resistance experienced by aug will not increase significantly causing minimal impact to gliding range and endurance instead of using hybrid driven mode the newly designed bioinspired aug is supposed to implant a driven mode of hydrofoil which also means under complex underwater environment aug would be driven by its biomimetic propeller similar with fish in nature whereas in rest time when the environment is relatively stable the aug may undergo usual gliding in this paper a conceptual design of bioinspired aug is introduced with a pair of bioinspired hydro wings undergoing travelling wave motion hydrodynamic performance of current aug is investigated by numerically solving the incompressible viscous navier stokes equations of surrounding flow we would like to figure out the effect of hydro wing parameters on the propulsive efficiency of aug to achieve an improved understanding of physical mechanisms relevant to the biomimetic locomotion adopted by current aug the immersed boundary method is employed to capture the moving boundary of the hydro wings which has been successfully applied in previous studies on fish like flapping wing shao et al 2010b pan et al 2016 undulatory foil shao et al 2010a flexible plate pan et al 2010 2014 etc an evaluation process which is first proposed in our previous work li et al 2016 is also applied to investigate the hydrodynamic propulsive efficiency of current aug in its cruise state in the following the physical model of current aug is presented in sec 2 following by the introduction of numerical method in sec 3 the simulating results and relevant discussion are given in sec 4 conclusion is drawn in the last section 2 physical model fig 1 shows the sketch of current physical model which is made up with one centred fuselage and two side hydro wings the total length of the model fuselage is 1 2 m where the middle part is a cylinder scaled with 0 25 m in diameter and 0 625 m in length the front part is a semi spheroid with 0 175 m in semi major axis and the rear part is also a semi spheroid with 0 4 m in semi major axis the hydro wings are designed with rectangular wing by using the naca0015 profile it has a span length of 0 3 m and a chord length of 0 3m which is chosen as the characteristic length c in the following all the variables are non dimensionised e g length of chamber line hydrodynamic forces following the approach presented in xu and xu 2017 and xu et al 2017 the bioinspired travelling wave motion of the two hydro wings has been as the propulsion method of current aug each point of the hydro wing surface along its chord length direction makes a transverse oscillation and its lateral displacement can be described by the following sinusoidal function 1 y x t a x sin 2 π λ x 2 π f t 2 a x a 0 a 1 x a 2 x 2 where λ is the wave length f is the frequency x the distance from a specific point along the chord length of the hydro wing to the leading edge of the hydro wing and a x is a function used to describe the transverse magnitude of the hydro wing and its expression is shown as eq 2 where a 0 a 1 and a 2 are all constants here we let a 0 0 02 and a 2 2a 1 thus it makes sure the transverse magnitude lies in the maximum depth of the hydro wing s trailing edge as examples fig 2 shows the camber line deformation of the hydro wing in one period under different parameters in order to give an intuitive description of the hydro wing s travelling wave motion fig 3 shows the hydro wing deformation in a whole motion period with the undulation of the hydro wings thrust force is produced to overcome the drag of ocean current in our preliminary design of the aug prototype the hydro wing surface is made of flexible rubber while inside the wing several rigid fin rays are uniformly distributed along the chord length each fin ray is connected with a separate electric motor by a crank train therefore the travelling wave of the wing surface is activated with this mechanism a similar design was adopted by clark and smits 2006 3 numerical method and validation the surrounding water around aug is considered as incompressible and viscous and the non dimensional navier stokes equations of fluid motion is employed as 3 u t u u p 1 re 2 u f 4 u 0 where u is the velocity vector p the pressure re the non dimensional reynolds number which can be calculated as re u 0c ν with u 0 and c the characteristic velocity and length scale and ν the dynamic viscosity and f the additional body force to discretize the navier stokes equations for numerical solutions the crank nicolson scheme is used for viscous terms and the adams bashforth scheme is applied for the other terms in eq 3 in addition the finite difference projection method is used to obtain the velocity and pressure fields for simplification the reynolds number in current study is around 200 taking the characteristic velocity to be one without any additional turbulent model to be applied the immersed boundary ib method is applied to capture the travelling wave motion of the hydro wings the additional body force f of ib method near the moving boundary is modified according to the direct forcing approach in which the body force can be derived as 5 f i n 1 v n 1 u i n δ t r h s i n wherev n 1 is the boundary velocity in the next time step and rhs i n represents all the other terms in eq 3 the main strategy of this method can be concluded as follow the whole domain including the solid immersed body is treated as fluid an added force term which is equal to zero except at the nearby points of the immersed boundary is needed in the government equations to enforce the solid body movement in this method the entire simulations could be carried out with the fixed cartesian grid which improves the efficiency of this simulation approach a detailed description of the numerical method and the relevant validation can be found in our previous papers shao et al 2010b shao and pan 2011 pan et al 2014 2016 in current simulation velocity boundary condition is imposed at inlet and no back flow condition is applied at outlet the other surrounding boundaries are all set as the uniform velocity condition based on our convergence tests for the present problem the computational domain for fluid flow is chosen as 5 10 4 4 4 4 in x y and z directions and the mesh in each direction has a finest spacing of 0 03 the time step is chosen as 0 001 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic performance evaluation of current aug unlike previous studies on one single biomimetic wing foil that there is a non zero fluid force acting on the wing foil in current study we only focus on the cruise state of the aug with a constant velocity therefore the net fluid force acting on the whole aug is nearly zero concerning current aug model the oscillating hydro wings produce thrust to overcome the fluid drag force acting on the fuselage and the force balance along stream direction in one period can be represented as 6 d t 1 γ γ d d τ 1 γ γ t d τ where d represents the drag force acting on the fuselage t represents the thrust force generated by the twin hydro wings and γis an oscillating period meanwhile the output and input power of the aug system can be defined directly the output power can be considered as the power generated by the oscillating hydro wings to maintain the cruise velocity and input power is that consumed for the hydro wings to oscillate with the travelling wave motion in view of this both the output and input powers can be derived as 7 p out p out left p out right u 0 t left u 0 t right 8 p in p in left p in right γ p left v left p right v right d τ here p out and p in are output and input powers of the system u 0 is cruise velocity t left and t right are thrust forces generated by the left and right hydro wings respectively p left and p right are the pressure distributions along the wing surfaces and v left and v right are the velocities along the y direction on wing surfaces with above definitions the propulsive efficiency can be obtained directly as η p out p in in order to achieve the zero net fluid force state of the aug the kinematic parameters for the travelling wave motion are adjusted accordingly for simplicity only the average fluid force in each period is kept to zero the parameters are fixed when the adjustment is achieved a typical result is shown here in this case the parameter a 2 2a 1 in eq 2 is used as an adjustable parameter while the rest kinematic parameters are fixed as a 0 0 02 λ 1 5 and f 1 5hz when a 1 0 16 the net fluid force on the aug is nearly zero and therefore a cruise state is achieved the vertical and horizontal forces of all the components left and right wings and fuselage are shown in fig 4 overall all the forces oscillate periodically with a constant frequency correlated to the travelling wave frequency the force curves of left and right hydro wings collapse to each other as a result of the same geometry shape and symmetrically arranged on either side of the fuselage the mean forces in one single period can also be obtained directly from fig 4 the mean vertical forces f l of all the components are very small o 10 3 as shown in table 1 and the net force along vertical direction is nearly zero neglecting its gravity and buoyancy forces for the force components along horizontal direction each hydro wing is owing a negative mean force f d while the f d of the fuselage is positive indicating that the twin hydro wings produce thrust forces to overcome the drag force acting on the fuselage the resultant force of the whole aug along horizontal direction is also very close to zero therefore eq 6 is fulfilled and the aug is in its cruise state in the following the effects of the kinematic parameters on the propulsive efficiency of the aug are investigated motivated by the biomimetic of animal locomotion the parameters used in current study are chosen in proper ranges as the travelling wave frequency f 0 8 3 0 the travelling wave length λ 0 8 2 5 and the cruise velocity v 0 5 1 2 and the relevant reynolds number varies from 100 to 240 accordingly 4 2 effects of travelling wave frequency on propulsive efficiency in the following two subsections we are going to investigate the effects of travelling wave parameters on the propulsive efficiency of current aug the effect of frequency is first studied in this subsection the oscillating or fluctuating frequency might be one of the most important parameters in biomimetic locomotion triantafyllou et al 1991 shao et al 2010b the dimensionless strouhal number st combing the effect of travelling wave frequency and amplitude is introduced as 9 st 2 h max f u 0 where f and u 0 are the hydrofoils travelling frequency and aug s advancing speed h max represents hydrofoils maximum travelling amplitude along the y direction and it can be calculated from eqs 1 and 2 easily in current simulation the travelling wave length is fixed as λ 2 5 and the travelling wave amplitude a 1 is adjusted to achieve a cruise state the result of frequency effect is shown in fig 5 a and it is seen from the result that the propulsive efficiency for each moving velocity increases to its maximum and then decreases with the increasing of frequency there is an optimum travelling frequency for each moving velocity leading to the highest propulsive efficiency besides it can be also found that the highest propulsive efficiency shows a little decrease when the moving velocity increases which means if we want to gain high moving velocity we have to pay price for cutting down the endurance the magnitudes of corresponding wave amplitudes a 1 is shown in fig 5 b the magnitudes of wave amplitude of all the moving velocity have the same trend the smaller wave frequency the larger wave amplitude and also the small moving velocity corresponding to a small wave amplitude which is consistent with the results of propulsive efficiency as mentioned above the effects the wave frequency wave amplitude and moving velocity can be combined as the effect of the dimensionless number st and the corresponding result of fig 5 a and b is shown in fig 6 the results of all moving velocity almost collapse and the optimum st for maximum propulsive efficiency is around 0 4 0 6 therefore for the study of current aug model strouhal number is still a key parameter for the evolution of propulsive efficiency of biomimetic locomotion 4 3 effects of the travelling wave amplitude on propulsive efficiency the effects of travelling wave amplitude are investigated in this subsection the travelling wave frequency is fixed as f 1 5hz the wave amplitude is varied in the range of a 1 0 0 5 and the wave length λ is adjusted to obtain a state of zero net force fig 7 a shows the result of propulsive efficiency versus travelling wave amplitude as shown in fig 7 a the propulsive efficiency increases monotonous with a 1 to the peak and then decrease with further increase of a 1 the magnitude of maximum efficiency of each moving velocity decreases with the increase of moving velocity which is similar with the trend showing in fig 5 the magnitude of wave length λ to the wave amplitude a 1 is shown in fig 7 b obviously the wave length has a linear dependence on the magnitude of wave amplitude linear fittings are also made in fig 7 b the fitting lines under different moving velocity show the similar slope around 1 8 in contrast the curves of propulsive efficiency versus travelling wave length is also plot in fig 8 according to the same set of data in fig 7 the curves show similar trend with those in fig 7 a whereas the difference is that the corresponding wave lengths of maximum efficiency under different moving velocity are in a relative small range around λ 2 4 and the curves under different moving velocity are close to each other therefore the effect of travelling wave length shows an equilibrium to the combined effects of wave amplitude and moving velocity on the other hand similar to fig 6 the effect of strouhal number on propulsive efficiency is plot in fig 9 the maximum propulsive efficiency is achieved around st 0 6 1 0 which is a little larger than the range in fig 6 4 4 discussions 4 4 1 flow structures around the aug the flow structures around and in the wake of the aug is closely related to the fluid force acting on the aug therefore here we present some typical vortex structures under different conditions to investigate the coherence between vortex topology and hydrodynamic performance of the aug the vortex iso surfaces with λ 2 definition jeong and hussain 1995 in the wake are illustrated in fig 10 for comparison three typical cases under the same advancing velocity is v 0 5 and travelling wave length λ 2 5 and different travelling wave frequencies i e f 1 0 1 2 and 2 0 the corresponding strouhal number are st 0 52 0 43 and 0 24 and the resulted propulsive efficiencies are η 36 42 and 31 5 respectively as can be seen from fig 10 the vortex rings tubes emerge in the wakes of hydro wings under different travelling frequencies this phenomenon is similar with our previous work li et al 2016 it is worth mentioning that the expanding angle or obliquity of the shedding vortex rings i e the angle between the centre line of vortex rings and horizontal line varies one by one for case f 1 0 as shown in fig 10 a the oscillating amplitude a 1 is larger than the one of case f 1 2 fig 10 b and therefore it generates a larger expanding angle of shedding vortex wake corresponding pressure contours and velocity distributions are shown in fig 11 small low pressure area is distributed only around the tail of the wing as shown in fig 11 a and b since the tail is bending downward a low pressure area around the bottom surface of the tail plays a positive role in the propulsion of the wing and the lower pressure the larger thrust force whereas for case f 2 0 fig 10 c a larger expanding angle is also resulted even with a smaller oscillating amplitude comparing with the case for f 1 2 of higher propulsive efficiency it indicates that with a large travelling wave frequency strong momentum exchanging happens during the shedding of the vortex ring it is confirmed by the corresponding pressure contours as shown in fig 11 c a large low pressure area is distributed around the whole bottom surface of the wing in a sum the vortex shedding from the trailing edge of hydro wing is accompanied by the release of energy the shedding vortex ring is inclined to the inflow direction the corresponding released energy is decomposed into horizontal and vertical components and the horizontal part is correlated to the propulsive performance therefore it can be conjectured that the less expanding angle the more horizontal energy is released and the better the propulsive efficiency 4 4 2 reynolds number effects in current study the reynolds number of the flow is fixed around re 200 which might be much lower than the traditional flow condition at which the reynolds number is around 105 to 106 the reason that the flow with a relative low reynolds number in current study can be explained into the following three aspects first our intention of simulation at re 200 is basically from the pioneer simulation work of biomimetic propulsion studies by blondeaux et al 2005 and dong et al 2006 in which propulsive performance of a single biomimetic wing was numerical investigated with reynolds number in the range from 100 to 400 our current study can be considered as an extension of these pioneer works instead to the single biomimetic wing the whole aug model with wing fuselage interaction is simulated meanwhile a corresponding new definition of propulsion efficiency based on the friction of fuselage and thrust of hydro wing is proposed in view of this a close reynolds number with previous work is chosen on the other hand concerning the reynolds number effects our preliminary results indicate that the vortex topologies are similar for cases with different reynolds number the differences among them lie in the width and thickness of the vortex rings similar conclusions were also stated by blondeaux et al 2005 and dong et al 2006 second in spite of the reynolds number effect on thrust and efficiency as reported in ashraf et al 2011 and deng et al 2016 the major concerns in current study is the effects of kinematic parameters with fixed reynolds number the results of aforementioned studies indicate that the thrust efficiency tendencies with the foil thickness at different reynolds number are similar ashraf et al 2011 and also the efficiency tendency with the frequency deng et al 2016 in other words the reynolds number does not have significant effect on the thrust efficiency tendencies with those kinematic parameters therefore the efficiency tendency obtained in our study at re 200 may qualitatively similar with the tendency at higher reynolds number last but not least self propelled micro swimmers are of great interests for in vivo biomedical applications zhang et al 2009 kosa et al 2012 those micro swimmers can be used to diagnose diseases delivery drug etc from a fluid mechanic point of view it is a small scale vehicle moves in a viscous fluid with a low velocity and the relevant reynolds number is normally in the order of 102 the improvement of propulsive efficiency is also an important issue for the design of these micro swimmers current study on the bioinspired aug may also provide insights in the field of micro swimmer design 5 conclusions a conceptual design of aug with a pair of bioinspired hydro wings undergoing travelling wave motion is introduced in this paper and the flow field around the aug is simulated by solving the incompressible viscous navier stokes equations coupled with the optimized immersed boundary method to capture the moving boundaries the hydrodynamic performance of aug as well as the vortex structures in the wake of the aug are investigated and discussed the force balance along the stream direction is guaranteed by adjusting the kinematic parameters of the travelling wave motion thus the cruise state of the aug with a constant velocity can be achieved thereafter the propulsive efficiency under cruise state is well defined here we briefly summarize the results obtained in current work 1 the main kinematic parameters of the hydro wing e g the travelling wave amplitude travelling wave frequency and the wave length has the similar effects on aug s propulsive efficiency concretely propulsive efficiency increases to its maximum and then decreases with the increasing of above parameters to estimate the combined effect of these parameters the non dimensional strouhal number is proposed and there is an optimum range of strouhal number in which the propulsive efficiency reaches its maximum regardless of any single parameter 2 to achieve a cruise state the adjusted wave length has a linear dependence on the magnitude of wave amplitude and the linear fitting slopes under different moving velocities close to each other around 1 8 which can provide a much convenient and support for the control of such bioinspired aug 3 the vortex structures in the wake of current aug have the close connection with the propulsive efficiency and the high propulsive efficiency is usually correlated to a small expanding angle of vortex rings or vortex ring obliquity acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by zhejiang provincial natural science foundations nos

23227,a conceptual design of autonomous underwater glider aug is introduced with a pair of bio inspired hydro wings undergoing travelling wave motion hydrodynamic performance of current aug is investigated by numerically solving the incompressible viscous navier stokes equations of its surrounding flow coupling with the immersed boundary method to capture the moving boundaries the force balance along the stream direction is guaranteed by adjusting the kinematic parameters of the travelling wave motion thus the cruise state of the aug with a constant velocity can be achieved the propulsive efficiency under cruise state is therefore directly and well defined the effects of kinematic parameters on propulsive performance are investigated and the non dimensional strouhal number as a combination of these kinematic parameters turns to be a dominant parameter of the propulsive efficiency there is an optimum range of strouhal number in which the aug achieves its maximum efficiency the results obtained in current study can provide certain technical supports for the design and development of small submersible vehicle keywords autonomous underwater glider aug bio inspiration fluid structure interaction travelling wave 1 introduction autonomous underwater glider aug is a novel autonomous underwater vehicle auv without external active propeller since stommel 1989 first put forward the concept of underwater glider several kinds of augs have been built in succession which are used both in military and civil applications compared with the traditional auv aug has several advantages such as low noise low energy consumption long operational range and endurance and great operational flexibility davis et al 2002 claustre and beguery 2014 chen et al 2015 aug is a buoyancy driven device and it periodically changes its net buoyancy by a hydraulic pump to glide upwards and downwards alternately as aug dives and ascends its internal ballast changes its position to control attitude and its body and wings provide longitudinal hydrodynamic force to drive itself moving forward asakawa et al 2012 mitchell et al 2013 javaid et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 ye and qi 2013 however apart from aforementioned advantages some problems concerning aug should be given due attention one of the most crucial problems is drifting with the current for achieving intense data collection the gliding speed of aug has to be relatively low which is only about 0 5 knot 0 25 m s under such a low speed movement of aug would be easily influenced by ocean current and it is not able to be continually maintained following the initially desired route thus failing to complete specific task hence aug may encounter a risk of mission failure when operated in a strong current li et al 2016 liu et al 2017 therefore additional control strategies are required to make aug s trajectory as desired and meanwhile without significant energy consumption aiming at this extensive studies have been reported recently niu et al 2016 proposed a prototype design of hybrid vehicle to improve aug s gliding speed by using of the additional propeller positioned at the rear part of aug and the trial result shows that the hybrid underwater glider can achieve the maximum gliding speed of 3 knots similarly claus bachmayer 2016 adopted an energy optimal depth controller design methodology for a long range auv presented with applications to a propeller driven hybrid aug jeong et al 2016 designed a novel underwater glider having a high horizontal speed of the maximum 2 5 knots with the help of a controllable buoyancy engine to regulate the amount of buoyancy drastically zhang et al 2017 utilized supercavitation to reduce drag and increase their underwater speed most of the research mentioned above make effort on utilizing external propeller to increase augs gliding speed consequently the external propeller shall import additional drag which will cause negative impact to its endurance and gliding range besides problems of vibration and noise will destroy aug s concealment with the introduction of propeller owing to these alternative solutions to solve this problem from other perspectives are required it is worth noting that in nature many creatures have acquired extraordinary abilities of locomotion such as high efficiency fast manoeuvrability and low noise etc through natural selection and evolution this inspires scientists and engineers to explore the nature of their excellent athletic ability among them fish swimming in lake and sea are typical kind of creatures with extraordinary athletic ability sfakiotakis et al 1999 in the past several decades great endeavours have been devoted in the study on hydrodynamic mechanism of fish swimming triantafyllou et al 2000 2004 as well as the design of robotic fish triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1995 roper et al 2011 raj and thakur 2016 on the other hand a complementary design of bioinspired aug also attracts attentions recently fish et al 2003 georgiades et al 2009 li et al 2016 which can achieve high efficient propulsion by mimicking fish swimming and meanwhile fulfil the requirement of enough space for payload and avoid the deformation fuselage like robotic fish in detail the bioinspired aug consists of two major parts i e a biomimetic propeller and a rigid cantered fuselage with the help of biomimetic propeller e g flapping wing or wavy plate aug can maintain its initial gliding route and at the same time resistance experienced by aug will not increase significantly causing minimal impact to gliding range and endurance instead of using hybrid driven mode the newly designed bioinspired aug is supposed to implant a driven mode of hydrofoil which also means under complex underwater environment aug would be driven by its biomimetic propeller similar with fish in nature whereas in rest time when the environment is relatively stable the aug may undergo usual gliding in this paper a conceptual design of bioinspired aug is introduced with a pair of bioinspired hydro wings undergoing travelling wave motion hydrodynamic performance of current aug is investigated by numerically

discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic performance evaluation of current aug unlike previous studies on one single biomimetic wing foil that there is a non zero fluid force acting on the wing foil in current study we only focus on the cruise state of the aug with a constant velocity therefore the net fluid force acting on the whole aug is nearly zero concerning current aug model the oscillating hydro wings produce thrust to overcome the fluid drag force acting on the fuselage and the force balance along stream direction in one period can be represented as 6 d t 1 γ γ d d τ 1 γ γ t d τ where d represents the drag force acting on the fuselage t represents the thrust force generated by the twin hydro wings and γis an oscillating period meanwhile the output and input power of the aug system

propulsive efficiency can be obtained directly as η p out p in in order to achieve the zero net fluid force state of the aug the kinematic parameters for the travelling wave motion are adjusted accordingly for simplicity only the average fluid force in each period is kept to zero the parameters are fixed when the adjustment is achieved a typical result is shown here in this case the parameter a 2 2a 1 in eq 2 is used as an adjustable parameter while the rest kinematic parameters are fixed as a 0 0 02 λ 1 5 and f 1 5hz when a 1 0 16 the net fluid force on the aug is nearly zero and therefore a cruise state is achieved the vertical and horizontal forces of all the components left and right wings and fuselage are shown in fig 4 overall all the forces oscillate periodically with a constant frequency correlated to the travelling wave frequency the force curves of left and right hydro wings collapse to each other as a result of the same geometry shape and symmetrically arranged on either side of the fuselage the mean forces in one single period can also be obtained directly from fig 4 the mean vertical forces f l of all the components are very small o 10 3 as shown in table 1 and the net force along vertical direction is nearly zero neglecting its gravity and buoyancy forces for the force components along horizontal direction each hydro wing is owing a negative mean force f d while the f d of the fuselage is positive indicating that the twin hydro wings produce thrust forces to overcome the drag force acting on the fuselage the resultant force of the whole aug along horizontal direction is also very close to zero therefore eq 6 is fulfilled and the aug is in its cruise state in the following the effects of the kinematic parameters on the propulsive efficiency of the aug are investigated motivated by the biomimetic of animal locomotion the parameters used in current study are chosen in proper ranges as the travelling wave frequency f 0 8 3 0 the travelling wave length λ 0 8 2 5 and the cruise velocity v 0 5 1 2 and the relevant reynolds number varies from 100 to 240 accordingly 4 2 effects of travelling wave frequency on propulsive efficiency in the following two subsections we are going to investigate the effects of travelling wave parameters on the propulsive efficiency of current aug the effect of frequency is first studied in this subsection the oscillating or fluctuating frequency might be one of the most important parameters in biomimetic locomotion triantafyllou et al 1991 shao et al 2010b the dimensionless strouhal number

hydrofoils maximum travelling amplitude along the y direction and it can be calculated from eqs 1 and 2 easily in current simulation the travelling wave length is fixed as λ 2 5 and the travelling wave amplitude a 1 is adjusted to achieve a cruise state the result of frequency effect is shown in fig 5 a and it is seen from the result that the propulsive efficiency for each moving velocity increases to its maximum and then decreases with the increasing of frequency there is an optimum travelling frequency for each moving velocity leading to the highest propulsive efficiency besides it can be also found that the highest propulsive efficiency shows a little decrease when the moving velocity increases which means if we want to gain high moving velocity we have to pay price for cutting down the endurance the magnitudes of corresponding wave amplitudes a 1 is shown in fig 5 b the magnitudes of wave amplitude of all the moving velocity have the same trend the smaller wave frequency the larger wave amplitude and also the small moving velocity corresponding to a small wave amplitude which is consistent with the results of propulsive efficiency as mentioned above the effects the wave frequency wave amplitude and moving velocity can be combined as the effect of the dimensionless number st and the corresponding result of fig 5 a and b is shown in fig 6 the results of all moving velocity almost collapse and the optimum st for maximum propulsive efficiency is around 0 4 0 6 therefore for the study of current aug model strouhal number is still a key parameter for the evolution of propulsive efficiency of biomimetic locomotion 4 3 effects of the travelling wave amplitude on propulsive efficiency the effects of travelling wave amplitude are investigated in this subsection the travelling wave frequency is fixed as f 1 5hz the wave amplitude is varied in the range of a 1 0 0 5 and the wave length λ is adjusted to obtain a state of zero net force fig 7 a shows the result of propulsive efficiency versus travelling wave amplitude as shown in fig 7 a the propulsive efficiency increases monotonous with a 1 to the peak and then decrease with further increase of a 1 the magnitude of maximum efficiency of each moving velocity decreases with the increase of moving velocity which is similar with the trend showing in fig 5 the magnitude of wave length λ to the wave amplitude a 1 is shown in fig 7 b obviously the wave length has a linear dependence on the magnitude of wave amplitude linear fittings are also made in fig 7 b the fitting lines under different moving velocity show the similar slope around 1 8 in contrast the curves of propulsive efficiency versus travelling wave length is also plot in fig 8 according to the same set of data in fig 7 the curves show similar trend with those in fig 7 a whereas the difference is that the corresponding wave lengths of maximum efficiency under different moving velocity are in a relative small range around λ 2 4 and the curves under different moving velocity are close to each other therefore the effect of travelling wave length shows an equilibrium to the combined effects of wave amplitude and moving velocity on the other hand similar to fig 6 the effect of strouhal number on propulsive efficiency is plot in fig 9 the maximum propulsive efficiency is achieved around st 0 6 1 0 which is a little larger than the range in fig 6 4 4 discussions 4 4 1 flow structures around the aug the flow structures around and in the wake of the aug is closely related to the fluid force acting on the aug therefore here we present some typical vortex structures under different conditions to investigate the coherence between vortex topology and hydrodynamic performance of the aug the vortex iso surfaces with λ 2 definition jeong and hussain 1995 in the wake are illustrated in fig 10 for comparison three typical cases under the same advancing velocity is v 0 5 and travelling wave length λ 2 5 and different travelling wave frequencies i e f 1 0 1 2 and 2 0 the corresponding strouhal number are st 0 52 0 43 and 0 24 and the resulted propulsive efficiencies are η 36 42 and 31 5 respectively as can be seen from fig 10 the vortex rings tubes emerge in the wakes of hydro wings under different travelling frequencies this phenomenon is similar with our previous work li et al 2016 it is worth mentioning that the expanding angle or obliquity of the shedding vortex rings i e the angle between the centre line of vortex rings and horizontal line varies one by one for case f 1 0 as shown in fig 10 a the oscillating amplitude a 1 is larger than the one of case f 1 2 fig 10 b and therefore it generates a larger expanding angle of shedding vortex wake corresponding pressure contours and velocity distributions are shown in fig 11 small low pressure area is distributed only around the tail of the wing as shown in fig 11 a and b since the tail is bending downward a low pressure area around the bottom surface of the tail plays a positive role in the propulsion of the wing and the lower pressure the larger thrust force whereas for case f 2 0 fig 10 c a larger expanding angle is also resulted even with a smaller oscillating amplitude comparing with the case for f 1 2 of higher propulsive efficiency it indicates that with a large travelling wave frequency strong momentum exchanging happens during the shedding of the vortex ring it is confirmed by the corresponding pressure contours as shown in fig 11 c a large low pressure area is distributed around the whole bottom surface of the wing in a sum the vortex shedding from the trailing edge of hydro wing is accompanied by the release of energy the shedding vortex ring is inclined to the inflow direction the corresponding released energy is decomposed into horizontal and vertical components and the horizontal part is correlated to the propulsive performance therefore it can be conjectured that the less expanding angle the more horizontal energy is released and the better the propulsive efficiency 4 4 2 reynolds number effects in current study the reynolds number of the flow is fixed around re 200 which might be much lower than the traditional flow condition at which the reynolds number is around 105 to 106 the reason that the flow with a relative low reynolds number in current study can be explained into the following three aspects first our intention of simulation at re 200 is basically from the pioneer simulation work of biomimetic propulsion studies by blondeaux et al 2005 and dong et al 2006 in which propulsive performance of a single biomimetic wing was numerical investigated with reynolds number in the range from 100 to 400 our current study can be considered as an extension of these pioneer works instead to the single biomimetic wing the whole aug model with wing fuselage interaction is simulated meanwhile a corresponding new definition of propulsion efficiency based on the friction of fuselage and thrust of hydro wing is proposed in view of this a close reynolds number with previous work is chosen on the other hand concerning the reynolds number effects our preliminary results indicate that the vortex topologies are similar for cases with different reynolds number the differences among them lie in the width and thickness of the vortex rings similar conclusions were also stated by blondeaux et al 2005 and dong et al 2006 second in spite of the reynolds number effect on thrust and efficiency as reported in ashraf et al 2011 and deng et al 2016 the major concerns in current study is the effects of kinematic parameters with fixed reynolds number the results of aforementioned studies indicate that the thrust efficiency tendencies with the foil thickness at different reynolds number are similar ashraf et al 2011 and also the efficiency tendency with the frequency deng et al 2016 in other words the reynolds number does not have significant effect on the thrust efficiency tendencies with those kinematic parameters therefore the efficiency tendency obtained in our study at re 200 may qualitatively similar with the tendency at higher reynolds number last but not least self propelled micro swimmers are of great interests for in vivo biomedical applications zhang et al 2009 kosa et al 2012 those micro swimmers can be used to diagnose diseases delivery drug etc from a fluid mechanic point of view it is a small scale vehicle moves in a viscous fluid with a low velocity and the relevant reynolds number is normally in the order of 102 the improvement of propulsive efficiency is also an important issue for the design of these micro swimmers current study on the bioinspired aug may also provide insights in the field of micro swimmer design 5 conclusions a conceptual design of aug with a pair of bioinspired hydro wings undergoing travelling wave motion is introduced in this paper and the flow field around the aug is simulated by solving the incompressible viscous navier stokes equations coupled with the optimized immersed boundary method to capture the moving boundaries the hydrodynamic performance of aug as well as the vortex structures in the wake of the aug are investigated and discussed the force balance along the stream direction is guaranteed by adjusting the kinematic parameters of the travelling wave motion thus the cruise state of the aug with a constant velocity can be achieved thereafter the propulsive efficiency under cruise state is well defined here we briefly summarize the results obtained in current work 1 the main kinematic parameters of the hydro wing e g the travelling wave amplitude travelling wave frequency and the wave length has the similar effects on aug s propulsive efficiency concretely propulsive efficiency increases to its maximum and then decreases with the increasing of above parameters to estimate the combined effect of these parameters the non dimensional strouhal number is proposed and there is an optimum range of strouhal number in which the propulsive efficiency reaches its maximum regardless of any single parameter 2 to achieve a cruise state the adjusted wave length has a linear dependence on the magnitude of wave amplitude and the linear fitting slopes under different moving velocities close to each other around 1 8 which can provide a much convenient and support for the control of such bioinspired aug 3 the vortex structures in the wake of current aug have the close connection with the propulsive efficiency and the high propulsive efficiency is usually correlated to a small expanding angle of vortex rings or vortex ring obliquity acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by zhejiang provincial natural science foundations nos

23228,the long term wind and wave characteristics and their associated stored power are investigated in the south china sea scs from 1986 to 2015 the weather research and forecasting model wrf and wavewatch iii ww iii are continuously performed to simulate a 30 year wind and wave hindcasts in the entire domain comparisons between the simulated and observed wind and wave data show good agreement under extreme typhoon conditions as well the spatio temporal patterns of annual seasonal and monthly averaged wind fields and wind power density significant wave heights and wave potential are presented using the 30 year simulated results our results show that offshore winds and waves with mean annual energy densities reaching up to 1100 w m2 and 65 kw m respectively are relatively stronger than they are nearshore or inland the most abundant power occurs in december and the least abundant appears in may furthermore wind and wave energy roses of average power potential at 15 typical points across the scs are calculated at length the dominant directions for both the wind and waves are consistently nne ne and ene additionally the wave energy is mainly the result of energy periods between 6 and 11 s and significant wave heights between 1 and 6 m keywords wind energy wave energy numerical modelling south china sea 1 introduction as a result of climate warming the limited storage of fossil fuels and the continuous soaring oil expenses the development of renewable energy becomes more and more important than before many alternatives such as solar wind and ocean energy can be selected in the future ueckerdt et al 2015 wind and wave energy are enormous sources of renewable energy due to their limited negative environmental impacts previous valuation of wind and wave energy potential so far have been conducted based on reanalysis datasets and numerical models at a global scale e g arinaga and cheung 2012 zheng and pan 2014 or across various regions e g kamranzad et al 2013 akpınar et al 2016 meanwhile offshore wave energy converters and wind turbines are being continually designed and optimized by different companies and researchers e g muliawan et al 2013 wan et al 2016 wind and wave power are abundantly renewable in china for offshore wind exploitation the newly installed capacity of generation has reached 51 473 mw in the world in particular the top country is china which contributes 45 1 to the total newly generation the rapid investments of the new installed capacity of wind power are the direct results of the chinese government s policy liao 2016 in addition wave energy has also become a hot focus in some domestic research literature liang et al 2013 2014 zheng et al 2013 wang et al 2014 2016 in the north western pacific the largest semi enclosed marginal sea is the south china sea scs as is shown in fig 1 the scs has a topographical advantage for renewable energy development the scs is connected to the surrounding seas such as through the strait of malacca to the indian ocean through the gasper to the sulu sea through the karimata straits to the java sea through the luzon strait to the pacific ocean and through the taiwan strait to the east china sea wind and wave power potential is of great significance to oil and gas development the fishing industry army garrisons islander living and tourism construction to our knowledge a few existing investigations on surface winds and waves have been conducted in the scs or other regions of the china sea based on the long time series of daily averaged wind dataset jiang et al 2013 estimated that the total 10 m wind power in china s offshore regions can up to be about 660 gw based on 23 year 1990 2012 historical wind fields the offshore wind potential in bohai was comprehensively analyzed and assessed wang et al 2014 the assessment showed that the research domain had high density wind power available chang et al 2015 calculated the wind power density characteristics in the strait based on the double parameter weibull distribution function the analysis indicates that the wind energy potential will be slightly larger in the eastern part of the taiwan strait in future climate periods while they decrease by about 3 relative to the previous climate periods besides there are relatively more wave climate and energy analyses than wind investigations in the scs the wave model was utilized to achieve the wave hindcast during the period when two cold fronts and two typhoons passed hong kong in the northern scs wang et al 1992 kohei et al 1998 analyzed the wave characteristics in a port near the vietnam s central coastline in the scs by utilizing real measurements from april 1997 to february 1998 zhu et al 2003 constructed a coupled numerical system of currents tides as well as waves in the costal regions of the scs under the extreme weather conditions such as the tropical cyclones similarly chu and cheng 2008 analyzed the wave states when the typhoon muifa crossed the scs during the winter months in 2004 in addition based on the hindcast data the characteristics of wind wave and the engineering environment in the scs have been studied by wang et al 2014 further the influence of the wind wave on the ocean circulation has been studied by zhang et al 2009 regarding the power exploiting zheng et al 2013 estimated the stored wave and wind power potential across the entire china sea from 1988 to 2009 based on the ccmp wind dataset and wave hindcasts but they provided a relatively inadequate analysis for the scs mirzaei et al 2015 simulated the waves and made an analysis of wave energy in the scs forced but ignored wind energy the planning and operation of offshore wave energy converters and wind turbines is in need of dependable estimates of surface waves wind field and their long term variabilities however it is rare to ﬁnd a sufficient number of buoy observations with longer durations that can be selected to precisely determine the wind and wave fields over the entire domain although the aforementioned wind and wave studies have been conducted in the scs a systematic and reliable investigation on the long run wind and wave conditions and variabilities are yet insufficient or lacking various researches have suggested that high resolution model hindcasts for the wind and wave environment can oﬀer appropriate alternatives for wind and wave fields statistics dallman et al 2014 hence for this objective this paper concentrates on providing a better understanding of the long term temporal and spatial characteristics of wind and wave states in the scs using model hindcasts the weather research and forecasting model wrf skamarock et al 2008 is selected to obtain a 30 year wind hindcasts and wavewatch iii ww iii tolman 2009 is continuously performed to simulate a 30 year wave hindcasts driven by the wind field hindcast derived from the wrf therefore we aim to accurately simulate the wind and wave fields from 1986 to 2015 using the high resolution numerical models to fill the gap in the scs wind and wave studies we will accomplish this by determining the average available wave and wind energy potential and their seasonal and monthly variations there are five sections in this paper methods of estimating the wave and wind power density in the scs are outlined in section 2 the introduction of wind and wave numerical models their detailed configurations and the validated hindcast data are shown in section 3 then the results and discussion are presented in section 4 finally the summary and conclusions are shown in section 5 2 methods for energy density estimation 2 1 methods of wind energy estimation the kinetic potential is defined as the energy that the air vertically crosses a section at a certain wind speed it can be expressed as follows voivontas et al 2001 1 e k 1 2 m v 2 where e k m and v are the wind kinetic potential the air mass and the wind speed respectively besides the air mass can be regarded as the product of between the air density and the air volume crossing the section during a certain period hence the e k may be described as follows 2 e k 1 2 ρ a v t v 2 1 2 ρ a v 3 t where ρ a and t are the air density the sectional area and the period respectively clearly the wind energy potential is more affected by wind speed fluctuations due to the cubic relations and can be expressed as 3 p v 1 2 ρ a v 3 through the preceding mathematical derivation process the wind energy density is greatly dependent on the wind speed and air density therefore it is finally summarized as follows 4 p d ρ v 1 2 ρ v 3 where p d ρ v is the basic unit to conduct the estimation of the energy stored in the wind herein we take 1 292 kg m3 as the sea surface air density in the scs 2 2 methods of wave energy estimation real waves can be universally regarded as the combination of various random wave conditions including a great number of wave ingredients with different directions amplitudes and frequencies further the wave parameters can be described by the directional wave energy spectrum e σ θ therefore the wave power density based on the wave spectrum is 5 j ρ g 0 2 π 0 c g e σ θ d σ d θ where ρ g c g θ and σ are the seawater density the gravity coefficient the group velocity the wave direction and the relative frequency respectively in deep water regions the wave power potential in per unit width of the progressing wave front on the basis of the significant wave height and energy period can as well as be described by tucker and pitt 2001 6 j ρ g 2 64 π t e h s 2 where t e and h s represent the significant period and the significant wave height respectively further based on the following nth spectral moment the spectral moments function can be utilized to determine the h s and t e 7 m n 0 2 π 0 ω n e ω θ d ω d θ where e ω θ and ω represent the variance density spectrum and the absolute radian frequency in terms of the doppler shifted dispersion relation thus the t e and h s of wave conditions are described by respectively 8 h s 4 m 0 9 and t e m 1 m 0 3 model description and hindcast configuration 3 1 wind model description the wind field is of great importance to perform the correct wind simulations which are the basis of wave hindcasts in this paper the wrf model a mesoscale forecasting model as well as assimilation system was selected to simulate the wind field the model contains physical processes and dynamic processes with climate change specifically the ground surface and cloud layers the short wave and long wave radiation are considered into the atmospheric radiation scheme the non local k close or the second order turbulence close scheme is used in the planetary boundary layer besides as a non static model all the calculation processes such as atmospheric simulation integrating numerical weather forecasting and data assimilation are continuously processed based on the arakawa c grid regarding the vertical direction in the wrf model η can be written as follows 10 η p h p h t μ where p hs and p ht represent pressures and μ p hs p ht besides the equations can be expressed as in euler form 11 u t v u μ d α p x α α d η p η φ x f u 12 v t v v μ d α p y α α d η p η φ y f v 13 w t v w g α α d p η μ d f w 14 θ t v θ f θ 15 μ t v 0 16 φ t 1 μ v φ g w 0 17 and q m t v q m f q m where φ is potential f is external force μ is the friction coefficient θ is potential temperature q m is the specific humidity u v and w represent the zonal meridional and vertical wind components g represents the gravity coefficient and π represents the total exner function 3 2 wind model set up and validation the wrf model is set at 0 2 by 0 2 in the horizontal resolution and simulated from january 1986 to december 2015 with hourly outputs the simulated domain covers approximately between 20 longitude 105 e 125 e and 20 latitude 3 n 23 n herein 16 layers are set in the vertical direction and the yonsei university ysu scheme is selected for the lateral boundary the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis is selected as the wind initial fields the reanalysis is at 0 25 by 0 25 in the horizontal resolution and 3 h in temporal resolution the wrf model itself provides a very large number of physical options such as an atmospheric boundary layer turbulence scheme a cumulus parameterization scheme a cloud microphysics scheme short wave radiation and sea and land surface processes based on our previous research experience and the characteristics of the scs the physical processes are chosen as shown in table 1 comparative analysis is made between the observations and the hindcasts winds table 2 three observation stations are chosen including nansha station 9 23 n 112 53 e xisha station 16 50 n 112 20 e and dongsha station 20 40 n 116 43 e the time span is 8768 h from 2000 to 2005 results show that mean errors of the wind speeds and directions at nansha xisha and dongsha are 1 96 m s and 29 6 3 4 m s and 26 4 and 2 73 m s and 25 1 respectively further comparisons are conducted between topex poseidon altimeter observations and the hindcasts winds fig 3 shows the two verifications of the wind speeds given by the altimetry observations and the assimilations the tracks of topex poseidon are from 21 to 31 october 2004 and 10 20 november 2004 comparison results indicate that the assimilations wind fields are in consistent with the topex poseidon data 3 3 wave model description in this paper the ww iii initially developed by ncep is chosen to perform the wave simulation the model contains submodules such as the general governing transport equations that permit full coupling with ocean models modified third order propagation schemes modified physics for wave growth and decay and a modified physics integration scheme except that the ncep utilizes the ww iii to achieve regional and global wave forecasts a great number of researchers have chosen it to investigate the dynamical behaviours of sea surface waves the wave model can better solve the spectral action density balance equation and the non linear energy interaction in terms of waves with different frequencies can be directly computed for the purpose of avoiding the shape limitation in the predictive spectra regarding the wave propagation it can be defined as by 18 d n k θ d t s k θ σ herein n k θ f k θ σ represents the wave action density spectrum of which f k θ represents the wavenumber directional spectrum σ represents the intrinsic radian or relative frequency further s represents the net effect of the source and sink for the spectrum f k θ and θ and k represent the wave direction and wave number respectively besides the equilibrium equation in terms of spectrum n can be written in euler form 19 n t x x n k k n θ θ n s σ 20 x c g u 21 k σ d d s k u s 22 and θ 1 k σ d d m k u m where c g can be determined by θ and c g s and m represent the coordinate in the direction and the coordinate perpendicular to s regarding the net source term s it is generally composed of three respects including the wind wave interaction term s in the non linear wave wave interaction term s nl and the dissipation white capping term s ds it must be noted that the s bot cannot be neglected when in the shallow waters hence the s can be defined as 23 s s i n s n l s d s s b o t specially the input source term can be written as 24 s i n σ θ σ β n σ θ where σ represents the non dimensional wind wave interaction parameter besides the s nl can be modelled based on the methods of discrete interaction approximations the s ds is determined by the linear combinations including the high frequency component s ds h and the low frequency component s ds 1 25 s d s a s d s 1 1 a s d s h where a represents a parameter determined by the frequency approximation regarding the bottom friction source term it is described by 26 s b o t k θ 2 γ n 0 5 g d n k θ where γ and n represent the empirical constant and the ratio of phase velocity to group velocity respectively 3 4 wave model set up and validation the ww iii model was basically implemented in a non stationary mode on the basis of spherical coordinates specially the model execution was set in 24 directions as well as 25 frequencies that are spaced logarithmically from 0 05 hz using a frequency increment factor of 1 1 hz herein it is supposed that no currents are considered the simulations were computed using a maximum global time step of 900 s a maximum courant friedrichs lewy condition time step for x y of 950 s a k theta time step of 900 s and a minimum source term time step of 300 s in the model setting the wind input growths are considered in both linear and exponential expressions in particular the scheme for the wind input parameterization was presented by chalikov and belevich 1993 for the linear growth mode and by komen et al 1984 for the exponential growth mode further in this model configuration several parameters are also considered such as the bottom friction the white capping and the dissipation induced by wave breaking due to shallow sea effect the initial step in the wave computations is to determine the entire simulated region where the wave climate is aimed to be modelled thus a uniform regular rectangular computing grid was used which covers the entire scs fig 1 the grid resolution is set to 0 2 by 0 2 the output time step was selected to be 1 h the wind input data are chosen and introduced at length in section 3 2 the simulated database span is set from 1 january 1986 to 31 december 2015 the ww iii output wave parameters in the dataset includes the mean wave direction significant wave height h s mean period t m01 the zero up crossing period equal to t m02 which is the mean period t z based on in the narrow band approximation the energy period t e represented by the spectral period t m 10 in terms of the spectral moments m 0 and m 1 the directional wave propagation and the normalized spectral frequency width further the wave energy potential is computed based on the space time records of h s and t e obtained in this hindcast dataset comparative analysis is made between the modelled hindcasts and the topex poseidon data similarly with wind fields validations of h s are displayed in fig 4 specially the time spans consist of the same periods in 21 31 october 2004 and in 10 20 november 2004 during which the topex poseidon exactly passed over the scs the modelled hindcasts coincide well with the observations indicating that the surface wave fields over the domain can be simulated well by the ww iii model 3 5 hindcast validation under extreme typhoon conditions typhoons happen frequently during autumn and summer months over the domain and have important effects on the extreme h s in general the measured wave records under typhoon conditions are especially scarce however in this study two moment observations are measured during the passages of typhoon wayne 198616 and typhoon brian 198926 the comparisons and validations of h s between the measured data obtained from qinglan station and modelled hindcasts when the typhoons exactly passed are shown in table 3 clearly the hindcasts results are in good agreement with the measured records which concludes that the ww iii model is a reliable alternative method to reproduce the surface wave fields under typhoon processes over the scs domain furthermore three additional typhoons damrey 200509 rammasum 201409 and kalmaegi 201415 were used to validate the model the typhoon tracks and buoy stations from which the observation data were obtained are showed in fig 2 comparisons of the simulated and observed wind speed and h s are displayed in fig 5 the trend and values between the simulation and the observations show good consistency 4 results and discussion 4 1 annual wind and wave energy estimation in order to obtain the spatial patterns of wind and wave climate a 30 year database simulated from the wrf and ww iii models was chosen annual spatial patterns of wind and wave data were calculated from the total of 262 968 spatial records using the methods introduced in section 2 annual spatial patterns of wind speed and wind energy significant wave heights and wave power are obtained as contour maps in figs 6 7 according to fig 6 wind speeds are between 4 and 7 5 m s with 100 500 w m2 wind power density in most of the scs the largest wind speed greater than 7 5 m s is in the middle of the scs the largest average wave energy is in the upper middle in the scs with a value greater than 500 w m2 the wind power density is relatively low along the coasts potentially because it is dissipated due to land effects herein offshore represents the areas with deeper depths and greater distances from the coastlines similar distributions for significant wave heights as well as wave energy are also obtained in fig 7 the wave power is relatively stronger offshore than nearshore which is likely as a result of that the wave potential becomes dissipating induced by depth water effects most waves are of h s between 0 and 1 8 m with 0 24 kw m potential density in the domain the largest h s exceeding1 8 m occurs in the middle of the scs the largest mean energy density is around the same location greater than 24 kw m therefore both the wave power and wind power have the same geographical distribution characteristics results of simulated annual averaged wave energy in the present study are relatively larger than those simulated by lin et al 2017 this is perhaps due to different wind input data lin et al 2017 used the cross calibrated multi platform ccmp wind field to simulate the waves in the scs however the ccmp wind is relatively lower than the simulated wind in this paper 4 2 seasonal wind and wave energy estimation furthermore the analysis of seasonal spatial patterns of wind speed and wind energy significant wave heights and wave power are also important to promote the understanding of wind and wave behaviours such spatial patterns are shown in contour maps figs 8 11 fig 8 presents the mean seasonal spatial patterns of wind fields the mean wind speed is lowest during spring and becomes increases in the summer autumn and becomes strongest in winter in winter the wind with speeds between 7 and 10 m s occurs in most of the scs while in spring the speeds are primarily less than 6 m s in autumn the larger wind speeds more than 8 m s appears in the north eastern area in other seasons the larger speeds appears in the central area fig 9 shows the mean seasonal spatial patterns of wind energy density the distributions are identical to the wind fields the largest wind power density 700 w m2 occurs in winter while the lowest once again occurs in spring furthermore the locations of larger wind energy flux are similar with the larger wind speeds accordingly figs 10 and 11 show the mean monthly spatial patterns of significant wave heights and energy potential similarly the highest significant wave heights and potential fluxes 2 5 m and 40 kw m respectively occur in winter while they decline to their minima in spring spatially in winter both the significant wave height and the potential density are of their maxima in south western parts of the scs in spring they are at their maxima in the central scs from summer to autumn they are at their maxima in northeastern parts of the scs therefore we can conclude that both the wind and wave have an obvious seasonal variation the seasonal wave energy results in the present study are in good agreement with those by mirzaei et al 2015 and are relatively larger than those by lin et al 2017 4 3 monthly wind and wave energy estimation wind and wave characteristics and their stored energy density are relied on weather states thus they might vary from daily and monthly mean monthly spatial patterns of wind speed and energy density significant wave height and wave energy density are thus calculated based on the average of the hindcasts data in the same month across the 30 year study period fig 12 presents the mean monthly spatial patterns of wind fields the largest wind speed 11 m s occurs in december while the minimum wind speed occurs in may fig 13 shows the mean monthly spatial patterns of wind energy density the distributions are identical to the wind fields the largest wind power density 1100 w m2 occurs in december while the lowest once again occurs in may furthermore from january to march both the wind speed and power potential are at their maxima in the south western portion of the scs from to april to august they are at their maxima in the central scs and from september to december they are at their maxima in the north eastern parts of the scs fig 14 and fig 15 show the mean monthly spatial patterns of significant wave heights and energy potential similarly the highest significant wave heights and potential fluxes 2 8 m and 65 kw m respectively occur in december while they decline to their minima in may spatially from january to march both the significant wave height and the potential density are of their maxima in south western parts of the scs from april to august they are at their maxima in the central scs and from september to december they are at their maxima in north eastern parts of the scs therefore we can conclude that the wave characteristics are probably reliable indicators of the wind conditions as they both exhibit similar variations in features in this study the monthly results in january present a difference with lin et al 2017 and arinaga and cheung 2012 in the northeast of scs lin et al 2017 and arinaga and cheung 2012 showed a high energy zone the difference is due to different wind input data lin et al 2017 used the ccmp wind fields and arinaga and cheung 2012 used the ncep final global tropospheric analysis fnl wind data the ncep ncar reanalysis is selected as the wind initial fields in this paper we have calculated the monthly wind fields in january for four different wind data with results shown in fig 16 the four different wind data show a difference in the northeast but the overall distributions in the all wind data are consistent moreover the uncertain reasons of this difference need further research in the future because of the limit of measure data 4 4 statistical analysis of the wind and wave parameters in order to study the directional characteristics of the wind and wave energy density in different regions fig 17 a and b presents the wind and wave energy potential respectively on the basis of the 30 year simulated hindcasts at 15 points see fig 2 the directions of the nne ne and ene waves play important roles in most of the scs ne waves are the dominant direction at most points while the dominant direction of region p3 is n and the dominant direction of p9 is ene directions from the nne to the sw are the most common wind directions in the beibu bay region p2 which is influenced by monsoons and surrounding land masses fig 18 a and b presents the wave direction distributions much like in the case of wind distributions the directions of the nne ne and ene waves play important roles in most of the scs in the north western portion of the scs ene waves are the most dominant type i e in regions p1 p3 p4 and p6 while the dominant direction is nne in the eastern scs i e in regions p9 p11 p13 and p15 in the open sea of the scs i e in regions p5 p7 p8 p10 p12 and p14 ne waves contribute most of the wave power flux ne and sse are also the recurring wave directions in the beibu bay region p2 therefore wind wave is the dominant wave pattern in the scs to better make clear the constitutions of the wave power resources in terms of the wave periods and heights the simulated records at 15 points are shown using a pattern of joint energy and scatter graphics in fig 19 a and b these graphics represent the occurrence of diversified wave conditions on the basis of the wave energy periods significant wave heights and their own contribution to the annual mean energy based on the 30 year simulated wave database the analysis is required to make sure the better performance of the diversified wave power converters at fixed positions in terms of the methods presented by dunnett and wallace 2009 the sub region within the joint energy and scatter graphics is classified into the standard squares with 1 m and 1 s the numbers in every square represent the occurrences the number of hours of wave conditions with energy periods and significant wave heights belong exactly to the homologous classification the lower numbers in the upper regions of the graphics indicate the low possibility of enormously larger waves this indicates that the range of energy periods is broad in the scs and the majority of wave energy is offered by wave energy periods with 2 15 s and significant wave heights with 0 12 m higher value wave power however are supplied by energy periods with 6 11 s and significant wave heights with 1 6 m 5 conclusions this paper put forward a further investigation on the wind and wave power resources in the scs wind and wave states were continuously simulated based on the wrf and ww iii model from 1986 to 2015 in the scs comparisons of the simulated and observed wind and wave fields show good agreement even under extreme typhoon occurrences results show that the wind and wave energy have similar spatial and temporal distributions the winds and waves offshore whose annual energy densities are up to be 1100 w m2 and 65 kw m respectively are higher than they are inland or nearshore in general the mean wind and wave potential are smallest in the spring and reach increasingly larger values during summer autumn and winter in turn the prevailing wind directions are nne ne and ene in most of the scs regions higher values of wave power are offered by energy periods with 6 11 s and significant wave heights with 1 6 m in a summary this investigation promotes the analysis of wind and wave behaviours in the scs and generates a reliable database for further wind and wave environmental research and resource assessments acknowledgements this work is financially supported by the national natural science foundation

23228,the long term wind and wave characteristics and their associated stored power are investigated in the south china sea scs from 1986 to 2015 the weather research and forecasting model wrf and wavewatch iii ww iii are continuously performed to simulate a 30 year wind and wave hindcasts in the entire domain comparisons between the simulated and observed wind and wave data show good agreement under extreme typhoon conditions as well the spatio temporal patterns of annual seasonal and monthly averaged wind fields and wind power density significant wave heights and wave potential are presented using the 30 year simulated results our results show that offshore winds and waves with mean annual energy densities reaching up to 1100 w m2 and 65 kw m respectively are relatively stronger than they are nearshore or inland the most abundant power occurs in december and the least abundant appears in may furthermore wind and wave energy roses of average power potential at 15 typical points across the scs are calculated at length the dominant directions for both the wind and waves are consistently nne ne and ene additionally the wave energy is mainly the result of energy periods between 6 and 11 s and significant wave heights between 1 and 6 m keywords wind energy wave energy numerical modelling south china sea 1 introduction as a result of climate warming the limited storage of fossil fuels and the continuous soaring oil expenses the development of renewable energy becomes more and more important than before many alternatives such as solar wind and ocean energy can be selected in the future ueckerdt et al 2015 wind and wave energy are enormous sources of renewable energy due to their limited negative environmental impacts previous valuation of wind and wave energy potential so far have been conducted based on reanalysis datasets and numerical models at a global scale e g arinaga and cheung 2012 zheng and pan 2014 or across various regions e g kamranzad et al 2013 akpınar et al 2016 meanwhile offshore wave energy converters and wind turbines are being continually designed and optimized by different companies and researchers e g muliawan et al 2013 wan et al 2016 wind and wave power are abundantly renewable in china for offshore wind exploitation the newly installed capacity of generation has reached 51 473 mw in the world in particular the top country is china which contributes 45 1 to the total newly generation the rapid investments of the new installed capacity of wind power are the direct results of the chinese government s policy liao 2016 in addition wave energy has also become a hot focus in some domestic research literature liang et al 2013 2014 zheng et al 2013 wang et al 2014 2016 in the north western pacific the largest semi enclosed marginal sea is the south china sea scs as is shown in fig 1 the scs has a topographical advantage for renewable energy development the scs is connected to the surrounding seas such as through the strait of malacca to the indian ocean through the gasper to the sulu sea through the karimata straits to the java sea through the luzon strait to the pacific ocean and through the taiwan strait to the east china sea wind and wave power potential is of great significance to oil and gas development the fishing industry army garrisons islander living and tourism construction to our knowledge a few existing investigations on surface winds and waves have been conducted in the scs or other regions of the china sea based on the long time series of daily averaged wind dataset jiang et al 2013 estimated that the total 10 m wind power in china s offshore regions can up to be about 660 gw based on 23 year 1990 2012 historical wind fields the offshore wind potential in bohai was comprehensively analyzed and assessed wang et al 2014 the assessment showed that the research domain had high density wind power available chang et al 2015 calculated the wind power density characteristics in the strait based on the double parameter weibull distribution function the analysis indicates that the wind energy potential will be slightly larger in the eastern part of the taiwan strait in future climate periods while they decrease by about 3 relative to the previous climate periods besides there are relatively more wave climate and energy analyses than wind investigations in the scs the wave model was utilized to achieve the wave hindcast during the period when two cold fronts and two typhoons passed hong kong in the northern scs wang et al 1992 kohei et al 1998 analyzed the wave characteristics in a port near the vietnam s central coastline in the scs by utilizing real measurements from april 1997 to february 1998 zhu et al 2003 constructed a coupled numerical system of currents tides as well as waves in the costal regions of the scs under the extreme weather conditions such as the tropical cyclones similarly chu and cheng 2008 analyzed the wave states when the typhoon muifa crossed the scs during the winter months in 2004 in addition based on the hindcast data the characteristics of wind wave and the engineering environment in the scs have been studied by wang et al 2014 further the influence of the wind wave on the ocean circulation has been studied by zhang et al 2009 regarding the power exploiting zheng et al 2013 estimated the stored wave and wind power potential across the entire china sea from 1988 to 2009 based on the ccmp wind dataset and wave hindcasts but they provided a relatively inadequate analysis for the scs mirzaei et al 2015 simulated the waves and made an analysis of wave energy in the scs forced but ignored wind energy the planning and operation of offshore wave energy converters and wind turbines is in need of dependable estimates of surface waves wind field and their long term variabilities however it is rare to ﬁnd a sufficient number of buoy observations with longer durations that can be selected to precisely determine the wind and wave fields over the entire domain although the aforementioned wind and wave studies have been conducted in the scs a systematic and reliable investigation on the long run wind and wave conditions and variabilities are yet insufficient or lacking various researches have suggested that high resolution model hindcasts for the wind and wave environment can oﬀer appropriate alternatives for wind and wave fields statistics dallman et al 2014 hence for this objective this paper concentrates on providing a better understanding of the long term temporal and spatial characteristics of wind and wave states in the scs using model hindcasts the weather research and forecasting model wrf skamarock et al 2008 is selected to obtain a 30 year wind hindcasts and wavewatch iii ww iii tolman 2009 is continuously performed to simulate a 30 year wave hindcasts driven by the wind field hindcast derived from the wrf therefore we aim to accurately simulate the wind and wave fields from 1986 to 2015 using the high resolution numerical models to fill the gap in the scs wind and wave studies we will accomplish this by determining the average available wave and wind energy potential and their seasonal and monthly variations there are five sections in this paper methods of estimating the wave and wind power density in the scs are outlined in section 2 the introduction of wind and wave numerical models their detailed configurations and the validated hindcast data are shown in section 3 then the results and discussion are presented in section 4 finally the summary and conclusions are shown in section 5 2 methods for energy density estimation 2 1 methods of wind energy estimation the kinetic potential is defined as the energy that the air vertically crosses a section at a certain wind speed it can be expressed as follows voivontas et al 2001 1 e k 1 2 m v 2 where e k m and v are the wind kinetic potential the air mass and the wind speed respectively besides the air mass can be regarded as the product of between the air density and the air volume crossing the section during a certain period hence the e k may be described as follows 2 e k 1 2 ρ a v t v 2 1 2 ρ a v 3 t where ρ a and t are the air density the sectional area and the period respectively clearly the wind energy potential is more affected by wind speed fluctuations due to the cubic relations and can be expressed as 3 p v 1 2 ρ a v 3 through the preceding mathematical derivation process the wind energy density is greatly dependent on the wind speed and air density therefore it is finally summarized as follows 4 p d ρ v 1 2 ρ v 3 where p d ρ v is the basic unit to conduct the estimation of the energy stored in the wind herein we take 1 292 kg m3 as the sea surface air density in the scs 2 2 methods of wave energy estimation real waves can be universally regarded as the combination of various random wave conditions including a great number of wave ingredients with different directions amplitudes and frequencies further the wave parameters can be described by the directional wave energy spectrum e σ θ therefore the wave power density based on the wave spectrum is 5 j ρ g 0 2 π 0 c g e σ θ d σ d θ where ρ g c g θ and σ are the seawater density the gravity coefficient the group velocity the wave direction and the relative frequency respectively in deep water regions the wave power potential in per unit width of the progressing wave front on the basis of the significant wave height and energy period can as well as be described by tucker and pitt 2001 6 j ρ g 2 64 π t e h s 2 where t e and h s represent the significant period and the significant wave height respectively further based on the following nth spectral moment the spectral moments function can be utilized to determine the h s and t e 7 m n 0 2 π 0 ω n e ω θ d ω d θ where e ω θ and ω represent the variance density spectrum and the absolute radian frequency in terms of the doppler shifted dispersion relation thus the t e and h s of wave conditions are described by respectively 8 h s 4 m 0 9 and t e m 1 m 0 3 model description and hindcast configuration 3 1 wind model description the wind field is of great importance to perform the correct wind simulations which are the basis of wave hindcasts in this paper the wrf model a mesoscale forecasting model as well as assimilation system was selected to simulate the wind field the model contains physical processes and dynamic processes with climate change specifically the ground surface and cloud layers the short wave and long wave radiation are considered into the atmospheric radiation scheme the non local k close or the second order turbulence close scheme is used in the planetary boundary layer besides as a non static model all the calculation processes such as atmospheric simulation integrating numerical weather forecasting and data assimilation are continuously processed based on the arakawa c grid regarding the vertical direction in the wrf model η can be written as follows 10 η p h p h t μ where p hs and p ht represent pressures and μ p hs p ht besides the equations can be expressed as in euler form 11 u t v u μ d α p x α α d η p η φ x f u 12 v t v v μ d α p y α α d η p η φ y f v 13 w t v w g α α d p η μ d f w 14 θ t v θ f θ 15 μ t v 0 16 φ t 1 μ v φ g w 0 17 and q m t v q m f q m where φ is potential f is external force μ is the friction coefficient θ is potential temperature q m is the specific humidity u v and w represent the zonal meridional and vertical wind components g represents the gravity coefficient and π represents the total exner function 3 2 wind model set up and validation the wrf model is set at 0 2 by 0 2 in the horizontal resolution and simulated from january 1986 to december 2015 with hourly outputs the simulated domain covers approximately between 20 longitude 105 e 125 e and 20 latitude 3 n 23 n herein 16 layers are set in the vertical direction and the yonsei university ysu scheme is selected for the lateral boundary the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis is selected as the wind initial fields the reanalysis is at 0 25 by 0 25 in the horizontal resolution and 3 h in temporal resolution the wrf model itself provides a very large number of physical options such as an atmospheric boundary layer turbulence scheme a cumulus parameterization scheme a cloud microphysics scheme short wave radiation and sea and land surface processes based on our previous research experience and the characteristics of the scs the physical processes are chosen as shown in table 1 comparative analysis is made between the observations and the hindcasts winds table 2 three observation stations are chosen including nansha station 9 23 n 112 53 e xisha station 16 50 n 112 20 e and dongsha station 20 40 n 116 43 e the time span is 8768 h from 2000 to 2005 results show that mean errors of the wind speeds and directions at nansha xisha and dongsha are 1 96 m s and 29 6 3 4 m s and 26 4 and 2 73 m s and 25 1 respectively further comparisons are conducted between topex poseidon altimeter observations and the hindcasts winds fig 3 shows the two verifications of the wind speeds given by the altimetry observations and the assimilations the tracks of topex poseidon are from 21 to 31 october 2004 and 10 20 november 2004 comparison results indicate that the assimilations wind fields are in consistent with the topex poseidon data 3 3 wave model description in this paper the ww iii initially developed by ncep is chosen to perform the wave simulation the model contains submodules such as the general governing transport equations that permit full coupling with ocean models modified third order propagation schemes modified physics for wave growth and decay and a modified physics integration scheme except that the ncep utilizes the ww iii to achieve regional and global wave forecasts a great number of researchers have chosen it to investigate the dynamical behaviours of sea surface waves the wave model can better solve the spectral action density balance equation and the non linear energy interaction in terms of waves with different frequencies can be directly computed for the purpose of avoiding the shape limitation in the predictive spectra regarding the wave propagation it can be defined as by 18 d n k θ d t s k θ σ herein n k θ f k θ σ represents the wave action density spectrum of which f k θ represents the wavenumber directional spectrum σ represents the intrinsic radian or relative frequency further s represents the net effect of the source and sink for the spectrum f k θ and θ and k represent the wave direction and wave number respectively besides the equilibrium equation in terms of spectrum n can be written in euler form 19 n t x x n k k n θ θ n s σ 20 x c g u 21 k σ d d s k u s 22 and θ 1 k σ d d m k u m where c g can be determined by θ and c g s and m represent the coordinate in the direction and the coordinate perpendicular to s regarding the net source term s it is generally composed of three respects including the wind wave interaction term s in the non linear wave wave interaction term s nl and the dissipation white capping term s ds it must be noted that the s bot cannot be neglected when in the shallow waters hence the s can be defined as 23 s s i n s n l s d s s b o t specially the input source term can be written as 24 s i n σ θ σ β n σ θ where σ represents the non dimensional wind wave interaction parameter besides the s nl can be modelled based on the methods of discrete interaction approximations the s ds is determined by the linear combinations including the high frequency component s ds h and the low frequency component s ds 1 25 s d s a s d s 1 1 a s d s h where a represents a parameter determined by the frequency approximation regarding the bottom friction source term it is described by 26 s b o t k θ 2 γ n 0 5 g d n k θ where γ and n represent the empirical constant and the ratio of phase velocity to group velocity respectively 3 4 wave model set up and validation the ww iii model was basically implemented in a non stationary mode on the basis of spherical coordinates specially the model execution was set in 24 directions as well as 25 frequencies that are spaced logarithmically from 0 05 hz using a frequency increment factor of 1 1 hz herein it is supposed that no currents are considered the simulations were computed using a maximum global time step of 900 s a maximum courant friedrichs lewy condition time step for x y of 950 s a k theta time step of 900 s and a minimum source term time step of 300 s in the model setting the wind input growths are considered in both linear and exponential expressions in particular the scheme for the wind input parameterization was presented by chalikov and belevich 1993 for the linear growth mode and by komen et al 1984 for the exponential growth mode further in this model configuration several parameters are also considered such as the bottom friction the white capping and the dissipation induced by wave breaking due to shallow sea effect the initial step in the wave computations is to determine the entire simulated region where the wave climate is aimed to be modelled thus a uniform regular rectangular computing grid was used which covers the entire scs fig 1 the grid resolution is set to 0 2 by 0 2 the output time step was selected to be 1 h the wind input data are chosen and introduced at length in section 3 2 the simulated database span is set from 1 january 1986 to 31 december 2015 the ww iii output wave parameters in the dataset includes the mean wave direction significant wave height h s mean period t m01 the zero up crossing period equal to t m02 which is the mean period t z based on in the narrow band approximation the energy period t e represented by the spectral period t m 10 in terms of the spectral moments m 0 and m 1 the directional wave propagation and the normalized spectral frequency width further the wave energy potential is computed based on the space time records of h s and t e obtained in this hindcast dataset comparative analysis is made between the modelled hindcasts and the topex poseidon data similarly with wind fields validations of h s are displayed in fig 4 specially the time spans consist of the same periods in 21 31 october 2004 and in 10 20 november 2004 during which the topex poseidon exactly passed over the scs the modelled hindcasts coincide well with the observations indicating that the surface wave fields over the domain can be simulated well by the ww iii model 3 5 hindcast validation under extreme typhoon conditions typhoons happen frequently during autumn and summer months over the domain and have important effects on the extreme h s in general the measured wave records under typhoon conditions are especially scarce however in this study two moment observations are measured during the passages of typhoon wayne 198616 and typhoon brian 198926 the comparisons and validations of h s between the measured data obtained from qinglan station and modelled hindcasts when the typhoons exactly passed are shown in table 3 clearly the hindcasts results are in good agreement with the measured records which concludes that the ww iii model is a reliable alternative method to reproduce the surface wave fields under typhoon processes over the scs domain furthermore three additional typhoons damrey 200509 rammasum 201409 and kalmaegi 201415 were used to validate the model the typhoon tracks and buoy stations from which the observation data were obtained are showed in fig 2 comparisons of the simulated and observed wind speed and h s are displayed in fig 5 the trend and values between the simulation and the observations show good consistency 4 results and discussion 4 1 annual wind and wave energy estimation in order to obtain the spatial patterns of wind and wave climate a 30 year database simulated from the wrf and ww iii models was chosen annual spatial patterns of wind and wave data were calculated from the total of 262 968 spatial records using the methods introduced in section 2 annual spatial patterns of wind speed and wind energy significant wave heights and wave power are obtained as contour maps in figs 6 7 according to fig 6 wind speeds are between 4 and 7 5 m s with 100 500 w m2 wind power density in most of the scs the largest wind speed greater than 7 5 m s is in the middle of the scs the largest average wave energy is in the upper middle in the scs with a value greater than 500 w m2 the wind power density is relatively low along the coasts potentially because it is dissipated due to land effects herein offshore represents the areas with deeper depths and greater distances from the coastlines similar distributions for significant wave heights as well as wave energy are also obtained in fig 7 the wave power is relatively stronger offshore than nearshore which is likely as a result of that the wave potential becomes dissipating induced by depth water effects most waves are of h s between 0 and 1 8 m with 0 24 kw m potential density in the domain the largest h s exceeding1 8 m occurs in the middle of the scs the largest mean energy density is around the same location greater than 24 kw m therefore both the wave power and wind power have the same geographical distribution characteristics results of simulated annual averaged wave energy in the present study are relatively larger than those simulated by lin et al 2017 this is perhaps due to different wind input data lin et al 2017 used the cross calibrated multi platform ccmp wind field to simulate the waves in the scs however the ccmp wind is relatively lower than the simulated wind in this paper 4 2 seasonal wind and wave energy estimation furthermore the analysis of seasonal spatial patterns of wind speed and wind energy significant wave heights and wave power are also important to promote the understanding of wind and wave behaviours such spatial patterns are shown in contour maps figs 8 11 fig 8 presents the mean seasonal spatial patterns of wind fields the mean wind speed is lowest during spring and becomes increases in the summer autumn and becomes strongest in winter in winter the wind with speeds between 7 and 10 m s occurs in most of the scs while in spring the speeds are primarily less than 6 m s in autumn the larger wind speeds more than 8 m s appears in the north eastern area in other seasons the larger speeds appears in the central area fig 9 shows the mean seasonal spatial patterns of wind energy density the distributions are identical to the wind fields the largest wind power density 700 w m2 occurs in winter while the lowest once again occurs in spring furthermore the locations of larger wind energy flux are similar with the larger wind speeds accordingly figs 10 and 11 show the mean monthly spatial patterns of significant wave heights and energy potential similarly the highest significant wave heights and potential fluxes 2 5 m and 40 kw m respectively occur in winter while they decline to their minima in spring spatially in winter both the significant wave height and the potential density are of their maxima in south western parts of the scs in spring they are at their maxima in the central scs from summer to autumn they are at their maxima in northeastern parts of the scs therefore we can conclude that both the wind and wave have an obvious seasonal variation the seasonal wave energy results in the present study are in good agreement with those by mirzaei et al 2015 and are relatively larger than those by lin et al 2017 4 3 monthly wind and wave energy estimation wind and wave characteristics and their stored energy density are relied on weather states thus they might vary from daily and monthly mean monthly spatial patterns of wind speed and energy density significant wave height and wave energy density are thus calculated based on the average of the hindcasts data in the same month across the 30 year study period fig 12 presents the mean monthly spatial patterns of wind fields the largest wind speed 11 m s occurs in december while the minimum wind speed occurs in may fig 13 shows the mean monthly spatial patterns of wind energy density the distributions are identical to the wind fields the largest wind power density 1100 w m2 occurs in december while the lowest once again occurs in may furthermore from january to march both the wind speed and power potential are at their maxima in the south western portion of the scs from to april to august they are at their maxima in the central scs and from september to december they are at their maxima in the north eastern parts of the scs fig 14 and fig 15 show the mean monthly spatial patterns of significant wave heights and energy potential similarly the highest significant wave heights and potential fluxes 2 8 m and 65 kw m respectively occur in december while they decline to their minima in may spatially from january to march both the significant wave height and the potential density are of their maxima in south western parts of the scs from april to august they are at their maxima in the central scs and from september to december they are at their maxima in north eastern parts of the scs therefore we can conclude that the wave characteristics are probably reliable indicators of the wind conditions as they both exhibit similar variations in features in this study the monthly results in january present a difference with lin et al 2017 and arinaga and cheung 2012 in the northeast of scs lin et al 2017 and arinaga and cheung 2012 showed a high energy zone the difference is due to different wind input data lin et al 2017 used the ccmp wind fields and arinaga and cheung 2012 used the ncep final global tropospheric analysis fnl wind data the ncep ncar reanalysis is selected as the wind initial fields in this paper we have calculated the monthly wind fields in january for four different wind data with results shown in fig 16 the four different wind data show a difference in the northeast but the overall distributions in the all wind data are consistent moreover the uncertain reasons of this difference need further research in the future because of the limit of measure data 4 4 statistical analysis of the wind and wave parameters in order to study the directional characteristics of the wind and wave energy density in different regions fig 17 a and b presents the wind and wave energy potential respectively on the basis of the 30 year simulated hindcasts at 15 points see fig 2 the directions of the nne ne and ene waves play important roles in most of the scs ne waves are the dominant direction at most points while the dominant direction of region p3 is n and the dominant direction of p9 is ene directions from the nne to the sw are the most common wind directions in the beibu bay region p2 which is influenced by monsoons and surrounding land masses fig 18 a and b presents the wave direction distributions much like in the case of wind distributions the directions of the nne ne and ene waves play important roles in most of the scs in the north western portion of the scs ene waves are the most dominant type i e in regions p1 p3 p4 and p6 while the dominant direction is nne in the eastern scs i e in regions p9 p11 p13 and p15 in the open sea of the scs i e in regions p5 p7 p8 p10 p12 and p14 ne waves contribute most of the wave power flux ne and sse are also the recurring wave directions in the beibu bay region p2 therefore wind wave is the dominant wave pattern in the scs to better make clear the constitutions of the wave power resources in terms of the wave periods and heights the simulated records at 15 points are shown using a pattern of joint energy and scatter graphics in fig 19 a and b these graphics represent the occurrence of diversified wave conditions on the basis of the wave energy periods significant wave heights and their own contribution to the annual mean energy based on the 30 year simulated wave database the analysis is required to make sure the better performance of the diversified wave power converters at fixed positions in terms of the methods presented by dunnett and wallace 2009 the sub region within the joint energy and scatter graphics is classified into the standard squares with 1 m and 1 s the numbers in every square represent the occurrences the number of hours of wave conditions with energy periods and significant wave heights belong exactly to the homologous classification the lower numbers in the upper regions of the graphics indicate the low possibility of enormously larger waves this indicates that the range of energy periods is broad in the scs and the majority of wave energy is offered by wave energy periods with 2 15 s and significant wave heights with 0 12 m higher value wave power however are supplied by energy periods with 6 11 s and significant wave heights with 1 6 m 5 conclusions this paper put forward a further investigation on the wind and wave power resources in the scs wind and wave states were continuously simulated based on the wrf and ww iii model from 1986 to 2015 in the scs comparisons of the simulated and observed wind and wave fields show good agreement even under extreme typhoon occurrences results show that the wind and wave energy have similar spatial and temporal distributions the winds and waves offshore whose annual energy densities are up to be 1100 w m2 and 65 kw m respectively are higher than they are inland or nearshore in general the mean wind and wave potential are smallest in the spring and reach increasingly larger values during summer autumn and winter in turn the prevailing wind directions are nne ne and ene in most of the scs regions higher values of wave power are offered by energy periods with 6 11 s and significant wave heights with 1 6 m in a summary this investigation promotes the analysis of wind and wave behaviours in the scs and generates a reliable database for further wind and wave environmental research and resource assessments acknowledgements this work is financially supported by the national natural science foundation

military and community services the three terms displacement high speed displacement and planing hulls are now generically used to classify the majority of boats being built today and their different behavior in speed regime and sea keeping savitsky 2014 savitsky and gore 1979 when the volumetric froude number of a craft reaches values greater than 2 planing regime may occur ghassemi and kohansal 2010 almeter 1993 from zero up to these values the bulk of the weight is mostly supported by buoyancy as soon as the froude number exceeds the value of approximately 4 the craft is almost entirely supported by dynamic forces throughout the whole speed range the hydrodynamics associated with the hull could vary considerably in order to predict the overall performances in terms of total encountered resistance and thrust now available codes methods and models find application over a wide range of complexity and accuracy which extends from complete unsteady three dimensional numerical codes bakhtiari et al 2016 wackers et al 2017 çakici et al 2015 to quick simple lumped parameters models savitsky 1964 fossati and muggiasca 2012 matveev 2012 in the numerical field bakhtiari et al 2016 showed an investigation on a stepped planing hull by using cfd approach based on finite volume method in this study the solution domain is discretized with an unstructured grid mesh of tetrahedral cells the rans equations and the k epsilon turbulent model are used in a coupled manner with vof free surface model in order to calculate the turbulent free surface flow around the hull fu et al fu 2012 used the numerical flow analysis nfa to model breaking waves around a ship including both plunging and spilling breaking waves the formation of spray and the entrainment of air nfa solves the navier stokes equations utilizing a cut cell cartesian grid formulation with interface capturing to model the unsteady flow of air and water around moving bodies a panelized surface representation of the ship hull is required as input in terms of body geometry and domain decomposition is used to distribute portions of the grid over a large number of processors hpc ghassemi et al ghassemi and kohansal 2010 ghassemi and ghiasi 2008 used the boundary element method to predict the hydrodynamic characteristics of three dimensional hulls in this method boundary integral equation is derived using green s theorem on the wetted body free water surfaces and combined with a non linear free surface boundary condition the results include pressure lift drag and wave pattern at various froude numbers doctors 1975 and savander et al 2002 applied finite pressure element method and boundary value method to planing hulls respectively reliable relationships between perturbation potential and vortex distribution were obtained in these studies although recent numerical codes ghassemi and kohansal 2010 ghassemi and ghiasi 2008 and computational methods cfd fvm and nfa bakhtiari et al 2016 duman et al 2017 fu 2012 are able to describe complex three dimensional hydrodynamic fields and unsteady motions they still require large computational resources and time consuming in terms of geometry preparation mesh grid generation and or computational domain distribution processes from the second half of the twentieth century onwards various hull shapes and sizes have been studied with both experiments and simple analytical models kapryan and boyd 1955 reported pressure distribution measurements for different prismatic surfaces clement and blount 1963 performed extensive experiments on a systematic series and presented a simplified prediction method for the estimation of planing hull drag savitsky 1964 presented a performance prediction model using the empirical equations for lift drag wetted areas and the center of pressure which is still used as a first estimate for planing hull drag katayama et al 2002 experimentally investigated geometric similar prismatic planing surfaces to predict the hydrodynamic performances at different speed regimes over the past four decades extensive research was conducted on the delft systematic yacht hull series dsyhs by the ship hydromechanics laboratory of the delft university of technology to determine the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on sailing yacht hulls from that research regression formulas for the forces and moments were derived kleijweg 2016a these formulations are still used as reliable and versatile published regressions concerning yacht hulls huetz and alessandrini 2011 fossati et al fossati and muggiasca 2012 used a simple lumped parameters model with the aim to reproduce unsteady sail aerodynamics taking into account three dimensional effects and unsteady mainsail jib interaction in this study the hull is modeled as a single point mass constrained to move on a surface governed by the equations of wave motion in matveev 2012 a method of hydrodynamic discrete sources is applied for two dimensional modeling of stepped planing surfaces the water surface deformations wetted hull lengths and pressure distribution are also included in the formulation axiomatic assumptions limitations or problems are intrinsic and inherent in the use of this type of simple models analytical one dimensional lumped parameters formulation could never be able to capture the highly complex three dimensional phenomena such as free water surface deformation and waves propagation interaction involved in a hull motion by itself different extensions fossati and muggiasca 2012 matveev 2012 are necessary to take into account unsteadiness and geometry spatial temporal distribution leading thus to a more rigorous and complex formulation however these simple models are largely used due to their simplicity and quickness although their inaccuracy and limited range of application savitsky 1964 the system of forces acting on a hull during its motion could be summarized into four main components the lift which is composed by the hydrodynamic force resulting from the relative motion and the hydrostatic buoyancy force the weight of the craft the thrust produced by the propulsor or sail and the total encountered resistance the latter could be further decomposed into several different components being related to friction cross sectional area of the hull transverse three dimensional effects wake profile and sea water conditions very low values of drag to lift ratio are highly desired in modern boat design whether the hull form is focused on geometry optimization for racing purposes or on fuel saving for trade and transport it has been shown by other authors savitsky 1964 clement and blount 1963 that the drag to lift ratio parameter is strictly dependent on the position of the center of gravity cog this one being responsible for the trimming attitude reached by the hull in steady conditions different cog placements correspond to different behaviors of the hull depending on the cruising speed regime kleijweg 2016a in view of this the main outcome of the present work is to investigate on the existence of an optimum cog function l c g f n able to minimize the drag to lift ratio over a relatively wide range of froude number for the sake of this a lumped parameters model is developed in conjunction with a practical numerical scheme and particularized to a specific high performance sailing yacht hull an unsteady three dimensional extension of the savitsky s model savitsky 1964 is applied to calculate the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the hull during its motion the total resistance is determined by using semi empirical models based on regression formulas which could be found in kleijweg 2016a in the next section the physical and mathematical model of the problem will be described subsequently a brief description of the aforementioned numerical scheme used to conduct the parametric studies will be given a dsyhs bare hull model of series 80 is herein used as test hull and the available experimental data kleijweg 2016b are interpolated and implemented in the present formulation it is shown that the present numerical scheme is able to capture optimum trimming conditions and the results of the model are in good agreement with experimental measurements over the specific range of froude number 2 physical model and assumptions in the present work a lumped parameters model based on three dimensional unsteady equations of motion is developed and used in order to capture the main mechanical and hydrodynamic effects of a real hull for a given set of parametric quantities and initial conditions to be in line with the authors goals main effects of interest could be planing regime occurrence lift drag hydrodynamics and unsteady rigid body dynamics water is treated as calm the complex dynamic system of a real craft is returned to a six degrees of freedom point cog of weight m g whose three linear and angular displacement variables are the unknowns of the problem these displacement variables are collected in an output single state vector furthermore the hull is entirely characterized by its overall dimensions l b b b h b and hydrostatic parameters c b c s c p c x load lift resistance and thrust are treated as integrated quantities and concentrated forces acting on their respective application point as depicted in fig 1 3 mathematical formulation when the overall dimensions of the hull and the initial conditions are defined the present scheme utilizes basic unsteady motion and hydrodynamic equations to predict running speed trim dynamic lift and encountered resistance at a given propulsion power load and center of gravity location for the sake of simplicity the general unsteady motion equations of a rigid body in the three directions and rotations are written with respect to two reference frames one of which being positioned on the center of gravity of the hull and stationary with respect to it this is the cog fixed frame of reference cog x b y b z b where not specified the signs of moments and rotations follow the right hand rule and are assumed to be positive in the counterclockwise direction as depicted in fig 1 the other frame of reference cog x w y w z w not shown in fig 1 has the x w axis directed along the velocity vector of the hull relatively to the water the z w axis downward in the plane of symmetry and its origin also fixed to the cog this is the water trajectory frame of reference with respect to the cog x w y w z w reference frame the unsteady equilibrium equations in the three directions could be written as 1 t x w d m g s i n θ b b x w m d v d t 2 t y w c m g c o s θ b s i n ϕ b b y w m v r w 3 t z w l m g c o s θ b c o s ϕ b b z w m v q w where the total hydrodynamic vertical force has been split into its two dynamic lift l and static buoyancy b components in the above equations the subscripts x w y w z w denote the i th component of the force vector when this is written with respect to the cog x w y w z w reference frame with regard to the moment equilibrium equations the cog x b y b z b reference frame will be used instead in order to avoid the time explicit dependency of moment inertia for the three angular directions the equations could be written as follows 4 m x b i x b d p b d t i y b i z b q b r b 5 m y b i y b d q b d t i z b i x b p b r b 6 m z b i z b d r b d t i x b i y b q b p b where they have been particularized to the case of a hull with x b z b as a plane of symmetry and x b y b z b as principal axes for convenience it is useful to write the whole system of equations in the state form by introducing an extra set of six cinematic equations in both linear and angular directions this leads to a single set of twelve differential equations of the 1st order in the state variables x e y e z e x e y e z e ϕ b θ b ψ b ϕ b θ b ψ b this extra set of equations could be constructed through the use of the following cinematic relationships 7 d x e d t v c o s θ w c o s ψ w 8 d y e d t v c o s θ w s i n ψ w 9 d z e d t v s i n θ w for all the variables in the linear directions whereas for the three angular variables 10 d ϕ w d t p w q w s i n ϕ w t a n θ w r w c o s ϕ w t a n θ w 11 d θ w d t q w c o s ϕ w r w s i n ϕ w 12 d ψ w d t q w s i n ϕ w s e c θ w r w c o s ϕ w s e c θ w now the equations are rewritten in a more convenient way by introducing an inertial earth fixed frame of reference e x e y e z e and by using rotation matrices in order to transform the state variables from the water trajectory frame of reference cog x w y w z w to the earth fixed one e x e y e z e a more extensive description about the derivation of the above equations could be found in etkin 1972 the twelve unknown state variables are evaluated numerically by an explicit time integration scheme based on the runge kutta method for solving initial value problems the reader is referred to izzo 2017 for further information about the method before proceeding with the integration of the system obtained by joining all the equations from 1 up to 12 the problem must be closed by adding explicit formulas for lift drag and center of pressure coefficients in the next section semi empirical functions for the hydrodynamic coefficients will be presented and used in the present work 3 1 hydrodynamic lift the lift acting on a hull surface could be separated into two distinct components the dynamic reaction of the fluid against the moving surface and the static buoyant contribution of the displaced volume under the free water surface with regard to conventional hull forms the dynamic lift component has different behaviors depending on cruising speed and or froud number range at lower speed regimes the dynamic lift component is order of magnitude smaller than the buoyant component and it even has a negative impact on the hull s draft trim and wetted surface savitsky 2014 clement 1964 as speeds are increased transition or planing regime may occur and the dynamic lift component could be the same order or greater than the static one from classic aerodynamic theory it is known that for lifting surfaces of low aspect ratio the lift force could be expressed as a function of the trim angle in the following form savitsky 1964 13 c l α a 1 α a 2 α 2 l 1 2 ρ v 2 l w l b w l the flow being in a combination of both longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the main dimension of the surface in principle eq 13 is only applicable to flat or thin lifting surfaces and thus requires additional appropriate manipulations to extend its range of application for prismatic surfaces in the partial and fully developed planing regime savitsky suggested savitsky 1964 the following semi empirical form of eq 13 14 c l α α 1 1 0 0120 l w l b w l v 2 g b w l 0 0055 l w l b w l 5 2 which shows the explicit speed dependency of the hydrodynamic lift component the second term in brackets represents the hydrostatic component of the buoyancy eq 14 is also applicable for a limited range of the trim angle in particular from 2 up to 15 to be in line with the authors goals in the present work an extension of the savitsky s planing surface theory savitsky 1964 will be used in order to explicit the hydrodynamic component of the lift over low values of the froude number as already mentioned before most conventional hulls are characterized by a downward dynamic lift component in the lower speed regimes savitsky 2014 clement 1964 although eq 14 is somehow able to capture these effects by the balance of the two components in brackets it always returns a net upward value for the lift force this is also in contrast with several cfd investigations allroth and wu 2013 huetz and alessandrini 2011 which showed that dynamic suction is present at the transom bottom of conventional hulls in the lower speed regimes to overcome this limitation eq 14 will be conveniently rewritten in the following form 15 c l α α 1 1 0 0120 l w l b w l v 2 g b w l c 1 c 2 u f n 16 s z e ρ g c b ω where the buoyant component has been separated and explicitly modeled through a static displaced volume procedure an additional term u f n has been introduced in eq 15 in order to take into account the negative effects of the hydrodynamic lift component within the lower froude number ranges this additional term comes from the assumption that the negative effects of the hydrodynamic lift component are mainly related to the waves interference phenomena which real hulls experience at low values of the froude number it is assumed here that the term u f n in eq 15 follows the same law of the wake resistance coefficient c w presented by benzaquen et al 2011 leading to the following expression 17 u f n c 1 c w f n c 1 ω l w l 3 2 1 f n 8 0 π 2 d ζ c o s 5 ζ exp 2 π f n c o s ζ 4 where ζ is an integration dummy variable the two parametric quantities c 1 and c 2 in eq 15 have been introduced due to the fact that sinkage effects of hydrodynamic lift are also related to transverse three dimensional effects and to the real form of the hull in terms of transom size bottom lines curvature and bow entrance angle allroth and wu 2013 huetz and alessandrini 2011 in this work the value of these two quantities will be arbitrarily chosen and assigned to a specific test hull in order to obtain good agreement with the available experimental data furthermore it has to be underlined that results for values of the froude number outside the validation range are to be considered as an extrapolation of the present formulation however it is worth noting that for values of the froude number range greater than the unity the term u f n in eq 15 rapid vanishes and savitsky s model savitsky 1964 applies 3 2 hydrodynamic drag in boat designing and with regard to calm water it is common practice to decompose the total hydrodynamic drag force acting on a bare hull into two main components kleijweg 2016a namely the frictional resistance and the residuary resistance in order to predict the total resistance in upright conditions by the use of hydrostatic parameters regression formulas from the database of the delft systematic yacht hull series have been used in this work this database contains the bare hull resistance values obtained with cfd computations for various hull forms speeds and trimming moments the reader could find the expressions and the covered range of the parameters in kleijweg 2016a hence the total resistance coefficient of the bare hull could be evaluated with the following expression 18 c d α d 1 2 ρ v 2 l w l b w l d f d r 1 2 ρ v 2 l w l b w l where 19 d f 1 2 ρ v 2 l w l b w l c f 20 d r ρ g ω a 0 ω 1 3 l w l a 1 l c b l w l a 2 c p a 3 ω 2 3 a w l ω 1 3 l w l a 4 b w l l w l a 5 l c b l c f a 6 b w l h w l a 7 c x and c f is the friction coefficient calculated with the ittc 1957 model ship correlation line ittc 2011 the coefficients a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 and a 7 are all function of the froude number and they are listed in kleijweg 2016a for froude numbers 0 25 up to 0 95 with increments of 0 10 due to the continuous time domain analysis used in the present work a linear interpolation process is applied in order to transform the above regression coefficients in continuous functions of the froude number furthermore it has to be specified that eq 20 is valid only when the hull is in upright conditions i e the assumptions made about the hull equilibrium allow to use the present formulation with no heeling 3 3 center of pressure it is shown in savitsky 1964 savitsky and ward 1954 that the longitudinal position of the center of pressure of planing surfaces could be evaluated by separating the hydrodynamic lift contribute from the hydrostatic one the center of pressure of the dynamic lift component is taken to range from 33 to 75 percent of the mean wetted length forward of the transom of conventional planing surfaces on the other hand the longitudinal position of the application point of the buoyancy force is found to be nearly constant at the 33 percent of the mean wetted length forward of the transom savitsky suggested savitsky 1964 the following semi empirical expression for the total center of pressure excursion 21 c p 0 75 1 5 21 f n 2 b w l l w l 2 39 where c p is the ratio of the longitudinal distance from the transom to the center of pressure divided by the wetted length l w l in the present paper the application point of the buoyancy component is calculated from the geometric centroid of the instant displaced volume ω under the free surface level while the hydrodynamic component is taken to range from 33 to 75 percent of the wetted length l w l according to eq 21 4 numerical scheme to perform a parametric study of the foregoing unsteady equations of motion a numerical scheme is developed and implemented in the present work the numerical scheme is based on two computation cycles of n and n iteration steps respectively a total evolution time δ t is chosen a priori this interval time must be large enough to ensure that the solution reaches steady state conditions in the present study a total evolution time of 100 s was found to be sufficient large to yield steady calculations at all the froude number values during each step of the two cycles all the equations from 1 up to 12 are solved numerically by explicit time integration based on the runge kutta method izzo 2017 gear 1971 forsythe et al 1977 a dynamic controlled time step size is used in this method and the reader could find more specific information about the solution control and stability in izzo 2017 gear 1971 forsythe et al 1977 the solution of the unsteady hydrodynamic problem is first calculated n times in the 1 st cycle at the end of each step i e when the dynamic response of the hull covers the total interval of time δ t input parameters are updated following a 1 st cycle scheduled table of values subsequently the same procedure applies to the 2 nd cycle with n iteration steps at the end of each cycle a vector of the desired output variables is stored for post processing operations the solution of the problem is calculated a total of n x n times to be in line with the main goal of the present work a minimizing process is introduced at the end of the numerical scheme this process collects all the minimum values of the total resistance of the hull obtained throughout all the iterations fig 2 describes the numerical scheme used here 5 validation to establish the reliability of the present numerical results a validation analysis is performed validation analysis consists of a qualitative comparison of numerical and experimental results the validation is performed for a sysser 85 bare hull model from dsyhs database kleijweg 2016a 2016b within a specific froude number range i e from 0 25 up to 0 75 lines planes overall dimensions and hydrostatic parameters of the model could be found in kleijweg 2016a and are listed here in fig 3 and table 1 for convenience experimental resistance measurements conducted by other authors kleijweg 2016b are selected for the validation of the present numerical results the sysser 85 parent model of the new delft systematic yacht hull series dsyhs was tested in the 1 towing tank of the ship hydromechanics laboratory at the delft university of technology for various speeds and applied trimming moments the numerical test conditions of the present paper are chosen according to the experimental measurements of the total resistance for the same hull model the reader could find an extended description of the test settings and resistance measurements in kleijweg 2016b fig 4 shows a comparison between kleijweg s experimental measurements kleijweg 2016b and numerical results obtained with the present model although its basis on lumped parameters and simplifying assumptions the model has shown good agreement with the experimental results the corresponding comparison errors being between 0 2 and 19 percent for the output quantities within the specific froude number range as reported in fig 4 the trends in the total resistance trim and heave curves are well captured by the model showing good qualitative quantitative agreement between numerical and experimental results however it has to be underlined that the hydrostatic parameters of eq 20 and the parametric quantities c 1 and c 2 of eq 15 as well have been chosen ad hoc and arbitrarily for the specific sysser 85 model table 1 used in present computations in particular a global value of c 1 c 2 0 05 has been assigned for the two parametric quantities within the examined froude number range 0 25 0 75 although the arbitrary choice of the two quantities is not crucial for high values of the froude number due to the vanishing of the integral term in eq 17 it could be a limitation for the lower speed ranges matching with experimental measurements is strongly affected by these parametric quantities and additional experimental database is needed when both shapes and dimensions of the hull model are changed or altered 6 numerical results and discussion 6 1 fixed cog maximum excursion range this section of the paper presents the numerical results which have been obtained through the use of the above formulation results are related to the same sysser 85 hull model of the validation test case and the experimental measurements kleijweg 2016b what is expected from the present analysis is the existence of an optimum cog function l c g f n which is able to minimize over a specified range of froude number the total resistance encountered by the hull during its motion the term optimum is not referred here to a unique function which is obtained through analytical derivation but only to an its numerical approximation as will be seen the quality of the approximation is governed by the total number of iterations n n used in the numerical scheme by comparison with kleijweg s experimental results kleijweg 2016a 2016b fig 5 it could be seen that the existence of such a function is possible for a given maximum excursion of the center of gravity of the hull fig 5 shows in particular the total resistance encountered by the sysser 85 test hull model in three different trimmed conditions in the experimental setting an additional scaled weight is attached to a slider rod and used to allow crew trimming moments for a given maximum excursion only three crew positions are examined in kleijweg 2016a 2016b namely back middle and cog as it could be seen in fig 5 and to the first approximation the examined froud number range could be subdivided into three parts of lower encountered resistance a forward crew position is highly desirable in the lower speed range f n from 0 25 up to about 0 40 while the back one is the best choice at higher speeds only close to the hump speed of the hull f n from 0 40 up to about 0 55 it seems that a middle position of the crew could be beneficial in terms of resistance reduction without loss of generality the same above considerations could be done when the crew weight and related trimming effects are accomplished by varying the mass and the cog of the whole system hull crew from this point of view present numerical investigation shows for many cog placements that the total resistance of the hull has an envelope curve within the examined froude number range furthermore for a given cog maximum excursion it is also shown the existence of a froude number sub range in which none of the three above mentioned back middle and forward cog positions is optimum in terms of resistance reduction fig 6 shows the numerical results obtained through the use of the present formulation and numerical scheme for the sysser 85 hull model reported in table 1 the total resistance is plotted versus the water line froude number at several cog stations in this specific case a high maximum excursion of 0 4 m has been chosen for the center of gravity of the hull the forward position measured from the transom is equal to 0 923 m while the back one is 0 523 m the numerical scheme has run n 1 n 1 441 times where both n and n have been chosen equal to 20 steady values of all the state and output variables have been stored in an n 1 n 1 vector matrix at the end of each cycle all the elements of the output matrix have been linearly interpolated in order to obtain the curves listed in fig 6 as it could be seen in the figure the slope of the resistance curve varies considerably as soon as the center of gravity reaches the extreme backward position of its excursion range the farther the backward position is the stronger the effect on the slope becomes accordingly to literature this behavior has been well reproduced and presented also by several other authors savitsky and ward 1976 clement and blount 1963 kleijweg 2016a fig 6 also shows the cog function l c g f n orange line which is able to minimize the total resistance within the whole examined froude number range from 0 up to about 1 35 the resistance encountered by the hull when the cog follows the function l c g f n is also plotted in fig 6 green line this curve d m i n represents the envelope of all the resistance curves obtained by varying the cog position of the hull furthermore as already mentioned before it is shown the existence of a mid froude number sub range in this particular case from 0 5 up to about 1 0 in which none of the three distinct back middle and forward cog positions is optimum in terms of resistance reduction however it has to be underlined that the extension of this sub range could be altered if a different total number of computation steps n n was used this could be easily seen in fig 7 where the total encountered resistance is obtained from linear interpolation of the output data and plotted as a three dimensional surface function of both the froude number and the cog position l c g each node of the surface mesh represents an iteration solution of the numerical scheme when the froude number is specified with respect to the water line length values beyond 0 8 1 0 are speed ranges in which planing regime transition could occur conventional high performance sailing yachts could reach these relatively high speed regimes only in presence of much available power for example in cases of high wind speed or large sail surfaces indeed while each point of the optimum trim function l c g f n represents a stationary condition in which the encountered resistance is minimized with respect to the cruising speed it is also true that it is the worst condition to get benefit from the transition regime and planing anticipation starting from a point well above the hump speed f n theoretically 30 equal to 0 4 a slight increase in thrust i e encountered wind gusts or sea waves could result in a large increase of speed when the hull is closer to the planing regime this effect however is more severe as soon as the cog reaches the most backward position of its maximum excursion range and hence moves away from the optimum trimming curve 6 2 varying cog maximum excursion range in the previous section the function l c g f n has been found by fixing an arbitrary cog maximum excursion in the longitudinal direction of the hull this section presents the numerical results referred to the case of varying cog maximum excursion limits to the aid of this the preceding extreme back and forward cog positions 0 523 m and 0 923 m respectively have been slightly extended by an amount equal to 0 1 m fig 8 shows the total encountered resistance when the center of gravity of the hull is placed at three extreme forward positions while fig 9 shows the same results for three extreme backward positions although the same maximum excursion range of 0 1 m both back and forward positions have shown different behaviors in terms of resistance curve the effect on the slope being more severe as soon as the center of gravity moves towards the rear part of the hull moreover fig 9 shows that the most backward cog positions used here could be capable of full planing regime establishing this is well noticed in figure for f n 0 4 where there is a sub range in which very small increments of the total encountered resistance are associated with large increments of the froude number such behavior has been well reproduced before by other authors sahoo et al 1999 savitsky and ward 1976 clement and blount 1963 it has to be underlined however that the curve trend showed in fig 9 represents the result of a linear interpolation process of the solution steady states obtained by the use of the present formulation in the planing regime transition range a value of n and n much higher than izzo 2017 shall be used if a better approximation of the curve trend is desired as already said before in lower speed regimes a cog position which is as forward as possible is highly desired by the boat designer due to the resistance reduction at the same way in higher speed regimes a cog position as backward as possible is also beneficial the maximum forward and backward limits of the center of gravity are mostly affected by the net balance of the forces and moments acting on the hull if this is intended for a low speed regime bow down trimming moments of the thrust relatively small even farther cog positions are allowed the cog placement is not of course the only way by which boat designers could change the trimming attitudes of the hull and the relating performances as it could be found in literature savitsky and gore 1979 savitsky and ward 1976 the curve trending of the total resistance could be severe affected also by all the geometric and hydrostatic parameters see eq 20 for instance the slenderness ratio i e l w l b w l seems to have the same effect on the slope savitsky and gore 1979 the curve warps and moves towards lower values of the froude number as the slenderness ratio is decreased both the cog placement and the slenderness ratio of the hull are hence two different parameters that dictate the maximum allowable excursion of the cog itself leading the latter to be a good compromise when there is no much chance of cog sliding 7 conclusions in the present paper a numerical investigation has been conducted in order to identify an optimum cog position function which is able to minimize the total resistance encountered by a high performance sailing yacht hull within a specified froude number range and in upright conditions for a given maximum excursion range numerical results have shown that such a function could exist together with a froude number sub range where none of the three extreme back middle and forward cog placements is optimum in terms of resistance reduction to conduct parametric studies on the basic hull performance a numerical scheme based on an unsteady three dimensional lumped parameters model has been developed and implemented in the present paper unsteady three dimensional equations of motion and hydrodynamics are solved numerically by explicit time integration method despite the generality of the model results are particularized and presented for the case of steady performances of the hull in the longitudinal plane of symmetry future areas of work include parametric studies on unsteadiness effects and motion out of plane of symmetry acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the university of bologna for supporting this research study

military and community services the three terms displacement high speed displacement and planing hulls are now generically used to classify the majority of boats being built today and their different behavior in speed regime and sea keeping savitsky 2014 savitsky and gore 1979 when the volumetric froude number of a craft reaches values greater than 2 planing regime may occur ghassemi and kohansal 2010 almeter 1993 from zero up to these values the bulk of the weight is mostly supported by buoyancy as soon as the froude number exceeds the value of approximately 4 the craft is almost entirely supported by dynamic forces throughout the whole speed range the hydrodynamics associated with the hull could vary considerably in order to predict the overall performances in terms of total encountered resistance and thrust now available codes methods and models find application over a wide range of complexity and accuracy which extends from complete unsteady three dimensional numerical codes bakhtiari et al 2016 wackers et al 2017 çakici et al 2015 to quick simple lumped parameters models savitsky 1964 fossati and muggiasca 2012 matveev 2012 in the numerical field bakhtiari et al 2016 showed an investigation on a stepped planing hull by using cfd approach based on finite volume method in this study the solution domain is discretized with an unstructured grid mesh of tetrahedral cells the rans equations and the k epsilon turbulent model are used in a coupled manner with vof free surface model in order to calculate the turbulent free surface flow around the hull fu et al fu 2012 used the numerical flow analysis nfa to model breaking waves around a ship including both plunging and spilling breaking waves the formation of spray and the entrainment of air nfa solves the navier stokes equations utilizing a cut cell cartesian grid formulation with interface capturing to model the unsteady flow of air and water around moving bodies a panelized surface representation of the ship hull is required as input in terms of body geometry and domain decomposition is used to distribute portions of the grid over a large number of processors hpc ghassemi et al ghassemi and kohansal 2010 ghassemi and ghiasi 2008 used the boundary element method to predict the hydrodynamic characteristics of three dimensional hulls in this method boundary integral equation is derived using green s theorem on the wetted body free water surfaces and combined with a non linear free surface boundary condition the results include pressure lift drag and wave pattern at various froude numbers doctors 1975 and savander et al 2002 applied finite pressure element method and boundary value method to planing hulls respectively reliable relationships between perturbation potential and vortex distribution were obtained in these studies although recent numerical codes ghassemi and kohansal 2010 ghassemi and ghiasi 2008 and computational methods cfd fvm and nfa bakhtiari et al 2016 duman et al 2017 fu 2012 are able to describe complex three dimensional hydrodynamic fields and unsteady motions they still require large computational resources and time consuming in terms of geometry preparation mesh grid generation and or computational domain distribution processes from the second half of the twentieth century onwards various hull shapes and sizes have been studied with both experiments and simple analytical models kapryan and boyd 1955 reported pressure distribution measurements for different prismatic surfaces clement and blount 1963 performed extensive experiments on a systematic series and presented a simplified prediction method for the estimation of planing hull drag savitsky 1964 presented a performance prediction model using the empirical equations for lift drag wetted areas and the center of pressure which is still used as a first estimate for planing hull drag katayama et al 2002 experimentally investigated geometric similar prismatic planing surfaces to predict the hydrodynamic performances at different speed regimes over the past four decades extensive research was conducted on the delft systematic yacht hull series dsyhs by the ship hydromechanics laboratory of the delft university of technology to determine the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on sailing yacht hulls from that research regression formulas for the forces and moments were derived kleijweg 2016a these formulations are still used as reliable and versatile published regressions concerning yacht hulls huetz and alessandrini 2011 fossati et al fossati and muggiasca 2012 used a simple lumped parameters model with the aim to reproduce unsteady sail aerodynamics taking into account three dimensional effects and unsteady mainsail jib interaction in this study the hull is modeled as a single point mass constrained to move on a surface governed by the equations of wave motion in matveev 2012 a method of hydrodynamic discrete sources is applied for two dimensional modeling of stepped planing surfaces the water surface deformations wetted hull lengths and pressure distribution are also included in the formulation axiomatic assumptions limitations or problems are intrinsic and inherent in the use of this type of simple models analytical one dimensional lumped parameters formulation could never be able to capture the highly complex three dimensional phenomena such as free water surface deformation and waves propagation interaction involved in a hull motion by itself different extensions fossati and muggiasca 2012 matveev 2012 are necessary to take into account unsteadiness and geometry spatial temporal distribution leading thus to a more rigorous and complex formulation however these simple models are largely used due to their simplicity and quickness although their inaccuracy and limited range of application savitsky 1964 the system of forces acting on a hull during its motion could be summarized into four main components the lift which is composed by the hydrodynamic force resulting from the relative motion and the hydrostatic buoyancy force the weight of the craft the thrust produced by the propulsor or sail and the total encountered resistance the latter could be further decomposed into several different components being related to friction cross sectional area of the hull transverse three dimensional effects wake profile and sea water conditions very low values of drag to lift ratio are highly desired in modern boat design whether the hull form is focused on geometry optimization for racing purposes or on fuel saving for trade and transport it has been shown by other authors savitsky 1964 clement and blount 1963 that the drag to lift ratio parameter is strictly dependent on the position of the center of gravity cog this one being responsible for the trimming attitude reached by the hull in steady conditions different cog placements correspond to different behaviors of the hull depending on the cruising speed regime kleijweg 2016a in view of this the main outcome of the present work is to investigate on the existence of an optimum cog function l c g f n able to minimize the drag to lift ratio over a relatively wide range of froude number for the sake of this a lumped parameters model is developed in conjunction with a practical numerical scheme and particularized to a specific high performance sailing yacht hull an unsteady three dimensional extension of the savitsky s model savitsky 1964 is applied to calculate the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the hull during its motion the total resistance is determined by using semi empirical models based on regression formulas which could be found in kleijweg 2016a in the next section the physical and mathematical model of the problem will be described subsequently a brief description of the aforementioned numerical scheme used to conduct the parametric studies will be given a dsyhs bare hull model of series 80 is herein used as test hull and the available experimental data kleijweg 2016b are interpolated and implemented in the present formulation it is shown that the present numerical scheme is able to capture optimum trimming conditions and the results of the model are in good agreement with experimental measurements over the specific range of froude number 2 physical model and assumptions in the present work a lumped parameters model based on three dimensional unsteady equations of motion is developed and used in order to capture the main mechanical and hydrodynamic effects of a real hull for a given set of parametric quantities and initial conditions to be in line with the authors goals main effects of interest could be planing regime occurrence lift drag hydrodynamics and unsteady rigid body dynamics water is treated as calm the complex dynamic system of a real craft is returned to a six degrees of freedom point cog of weight m g whose three linear and angular displacement variables are the unknowns of the problem these displacement variables are collected in an output single state vector furthermore the hull is entirely characterized by its overall dimensions l b b b h b and hydrostatic parameters c b c s c p c x load lift resistance and thrust are treated as integrated quantities and concentrated forces acting on their respective application point as depicted in fig 1 3 mathematical formulation when the overall dimensions of the hull and the initial conditions are defined the present scheme utilizes basic unsteady motion and hydrodynamic equations to predict running speed trim dynamic lift and encountered resistance at a given propulsion power load and center of gravity location for the sake of simplicity the general unsteady motion equations of a rigid body in the three directions and rotations are written with respect to two reference frames one of which being positioned on the center of gravity of the hull and stationary with respect to it this is the cog fixed frame of reference cog x b y b z b where not specified the signs of moments and rotations follow the right hand rule and are assumed to be positive in the counterclockwise direction as depicted in fig 1 the other frame of reference cog x w y w z w not shown in fig 1 has the x w axis directed along the velocity vector of the hull relatively to the water the z w axis downward in the plane of symmetry and its origin also fixed to the cog this is the water trajectory frame of reference with respect to the cog x w y w z w reference frame the unsteady equilibrium equations in the three directions could be written as 1 t x w d m g s i n θ b b x w m d v d t 2 t y w c m g c o s θ b s i n ϕ b b y w m v r w 3 t z w l m g c o s θ b c o s ϕ b b z w m v q w where the total hydrodynamic vertical force has been split into its two dynamic lift l and static buoyancy b components in the above equations the subscripts x w y w z w denote the i th component of the force vector when this is written with respect to the cog x w y w z w reference frame with regard to the moment equilibrium equations the cog x b y b z b reference frame will be used instead in order to avoid the time explicit dependency of moment inertia for the three angular directions the equations could be written as follows 4 m x b i x b d p b d t i y b i z b q b r b 5 m y b i y b d q b d t i z b i x b p b r b 6 m z b i z b d r b d t i x b i y b q b p b where they have been particularized to the case of a hull with x b z b as a plane of symmetry and x b y b z b as principal axes for convenience it is useful to write the whole system of equations in the state form by introducing an extra set of six cinematic equations in both linear and angular directions this leads to a single set of twelve differential equations of the 1st order in the state variables x e y e z e x e y e z e ϕ b θ b ψ b ϕ b θ b ψ b this extra set of equations could be constructed through the use of the following cinematic relationships 7 d x e d t v c o s θ w c o s ψ w 8 d y e d t v c o s θ w s i n ψ w 9 d z e d t v s i n θ w for all the variables in the linear directions whereas for the three angular variables 10 d ϕ w d t p w q w s i n ϕ w t a n θ w r w c o s ϕ w t a n θ w 11 d θ w d t q w c o s ϕ w r w s i n ϕ w 12 d ψ w d t q w s i n ϕ w s e c θ w r w c o s ϕ w s e c θ w now the equations are rewritten in a more convenient way by introducing an inertial earth fixed frame of reference e x e y e z e and by using rotation matrices in order to transform the state variables from the water trajectory frame of reference cog x w y w z w to the earth fixed one e x e y e z e a more extensive description about the derivation of the above equations could be found in etkin 1972 the twelve unknown state variables are evaluated numerically by an explicit time integration scheme based on the runge kutta method for solving initial value problems the reader is referred to izzo 2017 for further information about the method before proceeding with the integration of the system obtained by joining all the equations from 1 up to 12 the problem must be closed by adding explicit formulas for lift drag and center of pressure coefficients in the next section semi empirical functions for the hydrodynamic coefficients will be presented and used in the present work 3 1 hydrodynamic lift the lift acting on a hull surface could be separated into two distinct components the dynamic reaction of the fluid against the moving surface and the static buoyant contribution of the displaced volume under the free water surface with regard to conventional hull forms the dynamic lift component has different behaviors depending on cruising speed and or froud number range at lower speed regimes the dynamic lift component is order of magnitude smaller than the buoyant component and it even has a negative impact on the hull s draft trim and wetted surface savitsky 2014 clement 1964 as speeds are increased transition or planing regime may occur and the dynamic lift component could be the same order or greater than the static one from classic aerodynamic theory it is known that for lifting surfaces of low aspect ratio the lift force could be expressed as a function of the trim angle in the following form savitsky 1964 13 c l α a 1 α a 2 α 2 l 1 2 ρ v 2 l w l b w l the flow being in a combination of both longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the main dimension of the surface in principle eq 13 is only applicable to flat or thin lifting surfaces and thus requires additional appropriate manipulations to extend its range of application for prismatic surfaces in the partial and fully developed planing regime savitsky suggested savitsky 1964 the following semi empirical form of eq 13 14 c l α α 1 1 0 0120 l w l b w l v 2 g b w l 0 0055 l w l b w l 5 2 which shows the explicit speed dependency of the hydrodynamic lift component the second term in brackets represents the hydrostatic component of the buoyancy eq 14 is also applicable for a limited range of the trim angle in particular from 2 up to 15 to be in line with the authors goals in the present work an extension of the savitsky s planing surface theory savitsky 1964 will be used in order to explicit the hydrodynamic component of the lift over low values of the froude number as already mentioned before most conventional hulls are characterized by a downward dynamic lift component in the lower speed regimes savitsky 2014 clement 1964 although eq 14 is somehow able to capture these effects by the balance of the two components in brackets it always returns a net upward value for the lift force this is also in contrast with several cfd investigations allroth and wu 2013 huetz and alessandrini 2011 which showed that dynamic suction is present at the transom bottom of conventional hulls in the lower speed regimes to overcome this limitation eq 14 will be conveniently rewritten in the following form 15 c l α α 1 1 0 0120 l w l b w l v 2 g b w l c 1 c 2 u f n 16 s z e ρ g c b ω where the buoyant component has been separated and explicitly modeled through a static displaced volume procedure an additional term u f n has been introduced in eq 15 in order to take into account the negative effects of the hydrodynamic lift component within the lower froude number ranges this additional term comes from the assumption that the negative effects of the hydrodynamic lift component are mainly related to the waves interference phenomena which real hulls experience at low values of the froude number it is assumed here that the term u f n in eq 15 follows the same law of the wake resistance coefficient c w presented by benzaquen et al 2011 leading to the following expression 17 u f n c 1 c w f n c 1 ω l w l 3 2 1 f n 8 0 π 2 d ζ c o s 5 ζ exp 2 π f n c o s ζ 4 where ζ is an integration dummy variable the two parametric quantities c 1 and c 2 in eq 15 have been introduced due to the fact that sinkage effects of hydrodynamic lift are also related to transverse three dimensional effects and to the real form of the hull in terms of transom size bottom lines curvature and bow entrance angle allroth and wu 2013 huetz and alessandrini 2011 in this work the value of these two quantities will be arbitrarily chosen and assigned to a specific test hull in order to obtain good agreement with the available experimental data furthermore it has to be underlined that results for values of the froude number outside the validation range are to be considered as an extrapolation of the present formulation however it is worth noting that for values of the froude number range greater than the unity the term u f n in eq 15 rapid vanishes and savitsky s model savitsky 1964 applies 3 2 hydrodynamic drag in boat designing and with regard to calm water it is common practice to decompose the total hydrodynamic drag force acting on a bare hull into two main components kleijweg 2016a namely the frictional resistance and the residuary resistance in order to predict the total resistance in upright conditions by the use of hydrostatic parameters regression formulas from the database of the delft systematic yacht hull series have been used in this work this database contains the bare hull resistance values obtained with cfd computations for various hull forms speeds and trimming moments the reader could find the expressions and the covered range of the parameters in kleijweg 2016a hence the total resistance coefficient of the bare hull could be evaluated with the following expression 18 c d α d 1 2 ρ v 2 l w l b w l d f d r 1 2 ρ v 2 l w l b w l where 19 d f 1 2 ρ v 2 l w l b w l c f 20 d r ρ g ω a 0 ω 1 3 l w l a 1 l c b l w l a 2 c p a 3 ω 2 3 a w l ω 1 3 l w l a 4 b w l l w l a 5 l c b l c f a 6 b w l h w l a 7 c x and c f is the friction coefficient calculated with the ittc 1957 model ship correlation line ittc 2011 the coefficients a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 and a 7 are all function of the froude number and they are listed in kleijweg 2016a for froude numbers 0 25 up to 0 95 with increments of 0 10 due to the continuous time domain analysis used in the present work a linear interpolation process is applied in order to transform the above regression coefficients in continuous functions of the froude number furthermore it has to be specified that eq 20 is valid only when the hull is in upright conditions i e the assumptions made about the hull equilibrium allow to use the present formulation with no heeling 3 3 center of pressure it is shown in savitsky 1964 savitsky and ward 1954 that the longitudinal position of the center of pressure of planing surfaces could be evaluated by separating the hydrodynamic lift contribute from the hydrostatic one the center of pressure of the dynamic lift component is taken to range from 33 to 75 percent of the mean wetted length forward of the transom of conventional planing surfaces on the other hand the longitudinal position of the application point of the buoyancy force is found to be nearly constant at the 33 percent of the mean wetted length forward of the transom savitsky suggested savitsky 1964 the following semi empirical expression for the total center of pressure excursion 21 c p 0 75 1 5 21 f n 2 b w l l w l 2 39 where c p is the ratio of the longitudinal distance from the transom to the center of pressure divided by the wetted length l w l in the present paper the application point of the buoyancy component is calculated from the geometric centroid of the instant displaced volume ω under the free surface level while the hydrodynamic component is taken to range from 33 to 75 percent of the wetted length l w l according to eq 21 4 numerical scheme to perform a parametric study of the foregoing unsteady equations of motion a numerical scheme is developed and implemented in the present work the numerical scheme is based on two computation cycles of n and n iteration steps respectively a total evolution time δ t is chosen a priori this interval time must be large enough to ensure that the solution reaches steady state conditions in the present study a total evolution time of 100 s was found to be sufficient large to yield steady calculations at all the froude number values during each step of the two cycles all the equations from 1 up to 12 are solved numerically by explicit time integration based on the runge kutta method izzo 2017 gear 1971 forsythe et al 1977 a dynamic controlled time step size is used in this method and the reader could find more specific information about the solution control and stability in izzo 2017 gear 1971 forsythe et al 1977 the solution of the unsteady hydrodynamic problem is first calculated n times in the 1 st cycle at the end of each step i e when the dynamic response of the hull covers the total interval of time δ t input parameters are updated following a 1 st cycle scheduled table of values subsequently the same procedure applies to the 2 nd cycle with n iteration steps at the end of each cycle a vector of the desired output variables is stored for post processing operations the solution of the problem is calculated a total of n x n times to be in line with the main goal of the present work a minimizing process is introduced at the end of the numerical scheme this process collects all the minimum values of the total resistance of the hull obtained throughout all the iterations fig 2 describes the numerical scheme used here 5 validation to establish the reliability of the present numerical results a validation analysis is performed validation analysis consists of a qualitative comparison of numerical and experimental results the validation is performed for a sysser 85 bare hull model from dsyhs database kleijweg 2016a 2016b within a specific froude number range i e from 0 25 up to 0 75 lines planes overall dimensions and hydrostatic parameters of the model could be found in kleijweg 2016a and are listed here in fig 3 and table 1 for convenience experimental resistance measurements conducted by other authors kleijweg 2016b are selected for the validation of the present numerical results the sysser 85 parent model of the new delft systematic yacht hull series dsyhs was tested in the 1 towing tank of the ship hydromechanics laboratory at the delft university of technology for various speeds and applied trimming moments the numerical test conditions of the present paper are chosen according to the experimental measurements of the total resistance for the same hull model the reader could find an extended description of the test settings and resistance measurements in kleijweg 2016b fig 4 shows a comparison between kleijweg s experimental measurements kleijweg 2016b and numerical results obtained with the present model although its basis on lumped parameters and simplifying assumptions the model has shown good agreement with the experimental results the corresponding comparison errors being between 0 2 and 19 percent for the output quantities within the specific froude number range as reported in fig 4 the trends in the total resistance trim and heave curves are well captured by the model showing good qualitative quantitative agreement between numerical and experimental results however it has to be underlined that the hydrostatic parameters of eq 20 and the parametric quantities c 1 and c 2 of eq 15 as well have been chosen ad hoc and arbitrarily for the specific sysser 85 model table 1 used in present computations in particular a global value of c 1 c 2 0 05 has been assigned for the two parametric quantities within the examined froude number range 0 25 0 75 although the arbitrary choice of the two quantities is not crucial for high values of the froude number due to the vanishing of the integral term in eq 17 it could be a limitation for the lower speed ranges matching with experimental measurements is strongly affected by these parametric quantities and additional experimental database is needed when both shapes and dimensions of the hull model are changed or altered 6 numerical results and discussion 6 1 fixed cog maximum excursion range this section of the paper presents the numerical results which have been obtained through the use of the above formulation results are related to the same sysser 85 hull model of the validation test case and the experimental measurements kleijweg 2016b what is expected from the present analysis is the existence of an optimum cog function l c g f n which is able to minimize over a specified range of froude number the total resistance encountered by the hull during its motion the term optimum is not referred here to a unique function which is obtained through analytical derivation but only to an its numerical approximation as will be seen the quality of the approximation is governed by the total number of iterations n n used in the numerical scheme by comparison with kleijweg s experimental results kleijweg 2016a 2016b fig 5 it could be seen that the existence of such a function is possible for a given maximum excursion of the center of gravity of the hull fig 5 shows in particular the total resistance encountered by the sysser 85 test hull model in three different trimmed conditions in the experimental setting an additional scaled weight is attached to a slider rod and used to allow crew trimming moments for a given maximum excursion only three crew positions are examined in kleijweg 2016a 2016b namely back middle and cog as it could be seen in fig 5 and to the first approximation the examined froud number range could be subdivided into three parts of lower encountered resistance a forward crew position is highly desirable in the lower speed range f n from 0 25 up to about 0 40 while the back one is the best choice at higher speeds only close to the hump speed of the hull f n from 0 40 up to about 0 55 it seems that a middle position of the crew could be beneficial in terms of resistance reduction without loss of generality the same above considerations could be done when the crew weight and related trimming effects are accomplished by varying the mass and the cog of the whole system hull crew from this point of view present numerical investigation shows for many cog placements that the total resistance of the hull has an envelope curve within the examined froude number range furthermore for a given cog maximum excursion it is also shown the existence of a froude number sub range in which none of the three above mentioned back middle and forward cog positions is optimum in terms of resistance reduction fig 6 shows the numerical results obtained through the use of the present formulation and numerical scheme for the sysser 85 hull model reported in table 1 the total resistance is plotted versus the water line froude number at several cog stations in this specific case a high maximum excursion of 0 4 m has been chosen for the center of gravity of the hull the forward position measured from the transom is equal to 0 923 m while the back one is 0 523 m the numerical scheme has run n 1 n 1 441 times where both n and n have been chosen equal to 20 steady values of all the state and output variables have been stored in an n 1 n 1 vector matrix at the end of each cycle all the elements of the output matrix have been linearly interpolated in order to obtain the curves listed in fig 6 as it could be seen in the figure the slope of the resistance curve varies considerably as soon as the center of gravity reaches the extreme backward position of its excursion range the farther the backward position is the stronger the effect on the slope becomes accordingly to literature this behavior has been well reproduced and presented also by several other authors savitsky and ward 1976 clement and blount 1963 kleijweg 2016a fig 6 also shows the cog function l c g f n orange line which is able to minimize the total resistance within the whole examined froude number range from 0 up to about 1 35 the resistance encountered by the hull when the cog follows the function l c g f n is also plotted in fig 6 green line this curve d m i n represents the envelope of all the resistance curves obtained by varying the cog position of the hull furthermore as already mentioned before it is shown the existence of a mid froude number sub range in this particular case from 0 5 up to about 1 0 in which none of the three distinct back middle and forward cog positions is optimum in terms of resistance reduction however it has to be underlined that the extension of this sub range could be altered if a different total number of computation steps n n was used this could be easily seen in fig 7 where the total encountered resistance is obtained from linear interpolation of the output data and plotted as a three dimensional surface function of both the froude number and the cog position l c g each node of the surface mesh represents an iteration solution of the numerical scheme when the froude number is specified with respect to the water line length values beyond 0 8 1 0 are speed ranges in which planing regime transition could occur conventional high performance sailing yachts could reach these relatively high speed regimes only in presence of much available power for example in cases of high wind speed or large sail surfaces indeed while each point of the optimum trim function l c g f n represents a stationary condition in which the encountered resistance is minimized with respect to the cruising speed it is also true that it is the worst condition to get benefit from the transition regime and planing anticipation starting from a point well above the hump speed f n theoretically 30 equal to 0 4 a slight increase in thrust i e encountered wind gusts or sea waves could result in a large increase of speed when the hull is closer to the planing regime this effect however is more severe as soon as the cog reaches the most backward position of its maximum excursion range and hence moves away from the optimum trimming curve 6 2 varying cog maximum excursion range in the previous section the function l c g f n has been found by fixing an arbitrary cog maximum excursion in the longitudinal direction of the hull this section presents the numerical results referred to the case of varying cog maximum excursion limits to the aid of this the preceding extreme back and forward cog positions 0 523 m and 0 923 m respectively have been slightly extended by an amount equal to 0 1 m fig 8 shows the total encountered resistance when the center of gravity of the hull is placed at three extreme forward positions while fig 9 shows the same results for three extreme backward positions although the same maximum excursion range of 0 1 m both back and forward positions have shown different behaviors in terms of resistance curve the effect on the slope being more severe as soon as the center of gravity moves towards the rear part of the hull moreover fig 9 shows that the most backward cog positions used here could be capable of full planing regime establishing this is well noticed in figure for f n 0 4 where there is a sub range in which very small increments of the total encountered resistance are associated with large increments of the froude number such behavior has been well reproduced before by other authors sahoo et al 1999 savitsky and ward 1976 clement and blount 1963 it has to be underlined however that the curve trend showed in fig 9 represents the result of a linear interpolation process of the solution steady states obtained by the use of the present formulation in the planing regime transition range a value of n and n much higher than izzo 2017 shall be used if a better approximation of the curve trend is desired as already said before in lower speed regimes a cog position which is as forward as possible is highly desired by the boat designer due to the resistance reduction at the same way in higher speed regimes a cog position as backward as possible is also beneficial the maximum forward and backward limits of the center of gravity are mostly affected by the net balance of the forces and moments acting on the hull if this is intended for a low speed regime bow down trimming moments of the thrust relatively small even farther cog positions are allowed the cog placement is not of course the only way by which boat designers could change the trimming attitudes of the hull and the relating performances as it could be found in literature savitsky and gore 1979 savitsky and ward 1976 the curve trending of the total resistance could be severe affected also by all the geometric and hydrostatic parameters see eq 20 for instance the slenderness ratio i e l w l b w l seems to have the same effect on the slope savitsky and gore 1979 the curve warps and moves towards lower values of the froude number as the slenderness ratio is decreased both the cog placement and the slenderness ratio of the hull are hence two different parameters that dictate the maximum allowable excursion of the cog itself leading the latter to be a good compromise when there is no much chance of cog sliding 7 conclusions in the present paper a numerical investigation has been conducted in order to identify an optimum cog position function which is able to minimize the total resistance encountered by a high performance sailing yacht hull within a specified froude number range and in upright conditions for a given maximum excursion range numerical results have shown that such a function could exist together with a froude number sub range where none of the three extreme back middle and forward cog placements is optimum in terms of resistance reduction to conduct parametric studies on the basic hull performance a numerical scheme based on an unsteady three dimensional lumped parameters model has been developed and implemented in the present paper unsteady three dimensional equations of motion and hydrodynamics are solved numerically by explicit time integration method despite the generality of the model results are particularized and presented for the case of steady performances of the hull in the longitudinal plane of symmetry future areas of work include parametric studies on unsteadiness effects and motion out of plane of symmetry acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the university of bologna for supporting this research study
