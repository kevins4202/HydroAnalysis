21245,observations of ocean currents are important information in the fields of ocean science and engineering reciprocal acoustic transmissions have the potential to operationally measure tidal currents in coastal seas this study investigates the capability of the reciprocal transmissions to measure tidal currents particularly in relation to high frequency variations we conducted a reciprocal acoustic transmission experiment in an area of complex coastlines in the seto inland sea japan in october 2019 during this experiment a burst transmission was used and the system performed six transmissions with 1 min intervals between them every 10 min the estimated path averaged currents agreed with the currents obtained from a shipboard acoustic doppler current profiler adcp on an hourly basis and had captured high frequency variations that were not captured by the hourly adcp observations the measurement noise of the estimated currents which was determined as the variation within the six transmissions was 2 5 cm s 1 and was small enough to trace the variations in the currents over the time series even for the variations with periods considerably shorter than m2 tide the reciprocal transmission s capability to capture high frequency variations will improve the capability to reproduce current velocity fields when inversion or data assimilation methods are applied keywords reciprocal acoustic transmissions current velocity measurement high frequency variation in tidal currents comparison with adcp observations 1 introduction ocean currents are important information in ocean science and engineering for example it is well known that ocean currents transport and redistribute heat and salt and that the ocean circulation plays an important role in the earth s climate system ocean currents also transport nutrients and fish larvae which are important for fisheries biology and ecology moreover strong ocean currents are sources of renewable energy and information about current velocities in coastal seas is essential for evaluating their energy potential and for ensuring that operations for power generation can be safely and efficiently conducted while recent numerical ocean models can precisely predict current fields over a wide area ocean current observations are required for validating model predictions and for allowing predictions to be improved by applying data assimilation methods e g wilkin et al 2017 acoustic methods are widely used in ocean observations e g howe et al 2019 including the measurements of ocean currents for example acoustic doppler current profilers adcps can be used to capture spatiotemporal variations in ocean currents by operating a ship that has the adcps installed over the area of interest shipboard adcp observations regarding operational and long term applications however the use of shipboard adcps to provide information about current velocities at different temporal scales requires considerable effort reciprocal acoustic transmissions worcester 1977 munk et al 1995 is a potentially useful method for operationally obtaining information on currents in coastal and inland seas with complex coastlines path averaged current velocities and the sound speed can be estimated from the travel times of sound pulses that are reciprocally transmitted and received between horizontally separated transceivers the sums of the reciprocal travel times provide the information about sound speed which can be converted to temperature and the differences in the reciprocal travel times differential travel times provide the information about current velocities worcester 1977 munk et al 1995 if multiple transceivers are deployed one can measure the travel times of acoustic pulses that propagate in the ocean in various directions these multiple travel time data are used to estimate the spatial distributions of the sound speed and currents by using inverse or data assimilation methods the method is referred to as ocean acoustic tomography oat and was proposed by munk and wunsch 1979 to measure and understand the mesoscale variations associated with general ocean circulation which is difficult to capture using conventional moorings and ship observations the oat method was developed in deep sea environments e g howe et al 2019 but has been used to measure strong tidal currents and tidal vortexes in coastal and inland seas in these situations it is referred to as coastal acoustic tomography cat e g kaneko et al 2020 multiple cat studies have successfully demonstrated the capability to detect tidal currents such as semi diurnal variations daily inequality and neap spring beat see kaneko et al 2020 and references therein in coastal inland seas deploying acoustic transceivers from quays makes system maintenance easy and enables long term operational observations to be made with this advantage one target of cat is to operationally provide information on current velocity fields i e real time monitoring systems in coastal seas semi diurnal and diurnal tidal currents are often dominant in shallow seas there are higher frequency variations in currents some of which are associated with overtides and compound tides e g parker 1991 spatial variations in such tidal currents can be rapid due to depth variations and convoluted coastlines overtides and compound tides cause the flood ebb asymmetry in tidal currents and this asymmetry affects sediment transport and coastal morphology e g brown and davies 2010 therefore information on currents associated with overtides is essential for coastal zone assessment and management generally the magnitudes of the current velocity of overtides and compound tides and also other high frequency variations are considerably smaller than those of major tidal constituents such as the m 2 tide thus precise observations are required observed travel time data and path averaged current time series generally exhibit oscillating variations due to measurement noise although the ratio of the strong tidal signals such as m 2 tide to measurement noises i e signal to noise ratio snr are sufficiently high in general in previous cat studies travel time data have often been smoothed by using moving average filters in order to decrease measurement noises e g kaneko et al 2020 and references therein also measurement noises have been estimated using root mean squared differences from 1 hour moving average filtered data e g zhang et al 2016 taniguchi et al 2018 for precise observations of tidal currents including high frequency variations it is desirable that the time periods of moving average filters are sufficiently short so that moving average filters do not suppress not only measurement noises but also signals of high frequency variation in currents e g zhu et al 2017a cat can capture high frequency variations without moving average filters for large variations such as tidal bores zhu et al 2012 kawanisi et al 2017 with sufficient snr but for small magnitude variations it is difficult to determine whether the observed variations were caused by ocean currents or measurement noises e g fig 10 of yamaoka et al 2002 in a cat experiment in hiroshima bay japan observed path averaged currents exhibited high frequency variation and the observed variation would become convincing if the variation was able to be traced over the time series of each transmission data zhang et al 2015 taniguchi et al 2020 in october 2019 we conducted a preliminary experiment of the reciprocal acoustic transmission using a pair of transceivers deployed within an area of complex coastlines and islands in the seto inland sea japan fig 1 aiming for developing a real time monitoring system of current velocity fields in the future one purpose of this experiment was to understand how precisely we can observe path averaged currents focusing particularly on high frequency variations since repeating transmissions in sufficiently short time intervals is essential to detect high frequency variations in our preliminary experiment the reciprocal transmissions were performed in burst mode thomson and emery 2014 in which six transmissions with one minute interval between them were repeated every 10 min using such transmission data this study estimates the measurement noise in the observed path averaged current by examining the variation in the path averaged current over a short period of the burst transmission we will show that the measurement noise of the observed path averaged currents is small enough to trace track the variations in the currents with small magnitude and with periods considerably shorter than m 2 tide the reciprocal transmission s capability to capture high frequency variations of small magnitude shown in this study will improve the cat s capability to reproduce current velocity fields when inversion or data assimilation methods are applied this study also shows effectiveness of the reciprocal transmission by comparing results with that obtained from hourly shipboard adcp observations the observed path averaged current exhibited high frequency variations that were not captured by the hourly shipboard adcp observations 2 method and data 2 1 acoustic travel time and path averaged current the travel time denoted by τ of an acoustic pulse propagating in the ocean depends on the sound speed c r z and the current velocity v r z over a traveling ray path γ and can be expressed in the following form munk et al 1995 1 τ γ d s c r z v r z r where s is arc length of the ray and r is a unit vector in the direction tangential to the ray thus v r z r indicates the projection of the current velocity onto the path i e velocity component in the ray direction note that r depends on the ray paths oat considers the travel time perturbation caused by variations in the sound speed and the current velocity from a reference ocean the reciprocal transmissions separate the effects of the sound speed and current velocity munk et al 1995 the differential travel times denoted by τ d of the acoustic pulses traveling in opposite directions between transceivers may be related to the horizontal current velocity u r z and reference sound speed c 0 r z in the following form howe et al 1987 2 τ d 2 0 l u r z c 0 2 r z d r where l is the horizontal distance between the transceivers and z z r in the equation the velocity component in the ray direction v r z r is replaced by u r z which is the horizontal component r component of v r z r the reason for this replacement is that we ignore the contribution of the vertical component of v r z r to τ d because the vertical components of ocean currents are generally smaller than horizontal components furthermore ray paths are nearly horizontal therefore the projection onto the ray direction decreases vertical contributions we consider path averaged values of u r z and c 0 r z and regard them as constants with u m and c m for the path averaged current and reference sound speed respectively eq 2 then reduces to a simple equation relating u m to τ d zheng et al 1997 3 u m c m 2 2 l τ d the path averaged sound speed c m can be derived from ctd observations or from the sum of the reciprocal travel times zheng et al 1997 ray simulations are used to learn how acoustic pulses propagate through the ocean we simulated the paths and travel times of rays in an environment where the sound speed was independent of the range by numerically integrating the following equations bowlin et al 1992 dushaw and colosi 1998 4 d θ d r 1 c d c d z a d z d r tan θ b d t d r sec θ c c where θ is the angle of the ray with respect to the horizontal axis the sound speed profile c z was computed using the temperature and salinity data obtained from the field experiment section 2 2 the numerical integration was performed using the classical fourth order runge kutta method with a horizontal step size of 2 m the sea floor and sea surface were considered to be acoustic mirrors i e the reflections at the bottom and surface were treated as specular we examined the rays launched from the sound source in the range of 3 to 3 with an increment of 0 02 and selected those rays for which the depth at the receiver range was within 0 5 m of a specified receiver depth rays with wider launch angles experience multiple reflections at the sea floor and surface and the signals of those paths would be sufficiently attenuated at the receiver for practical transmissions 2 2 field experiments a reciprocal transmission experiment using two acoustic stations was conducted in an area in the northwest of hiuchi nada over the 12 days from october 7 to october 19 2019 the travel time measurement system used for this study was based on the one used in a moving ship tomography study huang et al 2019 the system consisted of three primary items a microcontroller with peripheral electrical circuits a gnss global navigation satellite system receiver module and antenna and an electro acoustic transducer the transducer was a sonotube 008 d13 from the chelsea technology group which worked as both the transmitter and receiver i e as a transceiver at a frequency of about 13 khz the gnss receiver module was a u blox lea m8t which can output two precise pulses square waves with an accuracy of 20 ns and a time pulse jitter of 11 ns we set the frequencies of the two pulses to 1 hz and 8 mhz the 1 hz pulse was the trigger signal for the start of the sound transmission and was used to synchronize the transmissions from the two acoustic stations the 8 mhz signal was fed into a frequency divider generating the carrier frequency of the sound signal and a reference signal for demodulation of the received signal the gnss receiver module provided the time and date information the microcontroller used this time information to operate scheduled tasks such as periodic sound transmission the received signals were amplified and demodulated into in phase and quadrature components these two signals were digitized by a 12 bit analog to digital converter in the microcontroller at a sampling frequency equal to twice the carrier frequency of the transmitted signal the digitized data were then recorded on an sd memory card on the electrical circuit board fig 1 shows a map of the observation site and the location of the transceiver the distance between the two stations was 2842 m fig 2 shows diagrams of the deployment for the transceivers at the northern station the system was placed on a quay of a fishing harbor and the acoustic transceiver was deployed from the quay by attaching the transceiver to a rope that had a weight at one end the other end of the rope was tied to a pole on the quay and the rope was stretched tight between the weight on the sea floor and the pole on the quay the resulting tension was used to fix the transceiver the transceiver was placed 2 m above the sea floor the mean water depth at the deployment position was 5 2 m and the depth ranged from 3 5 to 6 9 m depending on the tides at the southern station the acoustic system was placed on a floating pier used by the ohkunoshima island passenger ferry the transceiver was moored using a weight a subsurface buoy and a rope the transceiver was placed 3 m above the sea floor however this depth varied with time because of the tilt of the mooring due to the tidal current the mean water depth was 7 3 m and the depth ranged from 5 6 to 9 0 m depending on the tides in oat and cat experiments precise measurements of the acoustic travel times are achieved using a pulse compression method munk et al 1995 as in earlier cat experiments kaneko et al 2020 the transmitted signal in our experiment was a binary phase shift keyed signal encoded by a pseudo random binary sequence called a maximal length sequence often referred to as an m sequence table 1 summarizes the signal parameters for this experiment in general smaller values for the number of carrier cycles are desirable in terms of time resolution in the experiment the value of five carrier waves which is nearly equal to the value of the quality factor of the transducer s equivalent circuit were selected in order to get the transducer resonance in each phase change snr of transmitted received signal varies largely in reciprocal transmissions in shallow waters e g taniguchi et al 2020 thus we would like to use long duration signal to ensure sufficiently high snr even in bad conditions for acoustic propagation in the experiment longer duration signal for example four periods of 10 order m sequence or two periods of 11 order m sequence was able to use but we were worried about that reverberation might affect the signal arrival from the paired station because of insufficient times between the end of transmission and the signal arrival thus we used three periods of 10 order m sequence using six periods of 9 order m sequence would result in nearly identical snr however the two stations transmitted a specific signal that had different m sequences but the same sequence length the m sequence signal was generated and amplified using a full bridge inverter and a step up voltage transformer in the present system for ease of implementation the carrier signal was a square wave rather than a sinusoidal one the amplified signal was fed into the transducer with an additional tuning inductor the source level at full resonance was estimated to be 188 db re 1 μ pa at 1 m but actual source level may have been less than 188 db because of the frequent phase changes in the signal in this experiment the reciprocal transmissions were performed in burst transmission burst sampling mode thomson and emery 2014 in general burst transmissions are useful for suppressing high frequency noise in this study burst transmissions were used to know the variations in the measured path averaged currents over a relatively short period the details of the schedule for the burst transmission in our experiment were as follows the two acoustic stations simultaneously transmitted the signal six times at intervals of 1 min e g transmissions were made at 00 00 00 01 00 02 00 03 00 04 and 00 05 the system then slept for 5 min before continuing with the next six transmissions which in this case would be made at 00 10 00 11 00 12 00 13 00 14 and 00 15 in this manner the system repeated the six transmissions with 1 min intervals between them every 10 min while using the burst transmission mode we expected that the current velocity fields at the observation site would be nearly steady over 5 min of the burst transmission note that repeating transmissions with 1 min or more shorter intervals continually i e rather than burst transmission increase the number of data and would enable discussion in more detail however neither huge batteries nor solar panels for charging were used in this experiment and therefore we decrease the number of transmission by employing burst mode transmissions to decrease the power consumption we conducted shipboard adcp observations on october 15 to obtain velocity data for comparison with the acoustic transmission data the adcp used in the experiment was a wh adcp teledyne rd instruments inc the details of the operating parameters for the adcp observations are summarized in table 2 the shipboard adcp observations were made hourly from 07 00 to 17 00 first a fishing boat that had the adcp installed departed from near the north station at 7 00 and moved toward the south station at an average ship speed of about 3 4 knots taking about 20 min to complete the journey because the floating pier at the south station was continually used by ferry boats we allowed the adcp s transect to deviate from that of the acoustic transmission path for safety reasons fig 1 the ship tracks were recorded using a differential gps in order to correct the adcp s compass error e g zhu et al 2014 at 08 00 the boat departed from near the south station and crossed to near the north station in all 11 cross sections of velocity data were obtained from these adcp observations on the same day that the adcp observations were made we conducted conductivity temperature depth ctd observations four times at the location indicated by the yellow square in fig 1 the observed vertical profiles of temperature and salinity were used to compute the sound speed profile and this sound speed profile was used in the ray simulation 2 3 data processing for each transmission arrival patterns of the acoustic pulses were determined by computing the cross correlation functions cross correlogram between the received signal after demodulation and the replica of the transmitted m sequence when the signal to noise ratio snr for the highest peak in the arrival pattern was less than 12 db it was considered that the transmission had failed on this occasion the value of this threshold 12 db was determined for a subjective reason with trial and error we recognized some signal arrivals with the peak heights less than 12 db in some received data but for other data we found that there were noises pseudo peaks with the peak heights close to 12 db the noise level was estimated from the median value of the arrival time series over 50 ms including the highest arrival peak to determine the differential travel times from the reciprocal arrival patterns we adopted a method described in huang et al 2019 for our burst transmission data first the differential travel times for each transmission were determined by computing the normalized cross correlation of the reciprocal arrival patterns the differential travel time was defined as the lag time at the maximum peak of the computed cross correlation function if the maximum value of the cross correlation function was less than 0 7 it was considered that the reciprocal transmission had failed on this occasion reciprocal arrival patterns should show high cross correlation i e arrival patterns are similar to each other when the reciprocal transmissions are performed successfully the threshold of 0 7 was determined by trial and error we find the peak higher than 0 7 of the cross correlation generally resulted in plausible differential travel times next the median of the six differential travel times for each burst was computed note that there were usually six differential travel times for each burst however this was not always the case because there were certain failed transmissions we then recalculated the differential travel time for each transmission by identifying the local maximum of the cross correlation function whose lag time was closest to the computed median value this procedure was able to eliminate gross errors caused by selecting wrong peaks of the cross correlation functions additionally at this stage if the difference between the recalculated differential travel time and the median value was larger than 0 385 ms the differential travel time data for this transmission were not used lastly the estimated differential travel times for each transmission were converted to the path averaged currents using eq 3 in this study a positive value of u m indicates that the direction of the path averaged current was toward the north station we computed the weighted arithmetic means of the six path averaged currents in each burst and consider this weighted means as the representative values of the path averaged current for the 5 min period of each burst the weights were derived by multiplying two quantities the snr of the maximum arrival peak in the arrival patterns and the cross correlation value at the selected peak local maximum for snr the smaller of the two snrs of the reciprocal arrival patterns was used the path averaged currents thus had low weights when the currents were obtained from the reciprocal arrival patterns with low snrs and low values of the cross correlation function the root mean squared rms difference between each path averaged current and the weighted means was computed to know how largely the estimated path averaged currents fluctuated over the 5 min period which is considered as the measurement noise the uncertainty in the representative value of the path averaged currents in each burst was determined by the confidence interval t s n where s and n is respectively the sample standard deviation and the number of the usable path averaged currents in each burst the value of t is derived from the cumulative t distribution with a specified number of degrees of freedom and confidence level e g thomson and emery 2014 when the number of the usable path averaged currents in each burst period was less than two the uncertainty was calculated as 16 cm s 1 based on the signal digit duration of 0 385 ms table 1 the shipboard adcp outputs the vertical profile of the current velocity along the transect to compare the two current velocity values of the reciprocal transmissions and the adcps the adcp s velocity was converted to a value comparable to the path averaged current according to the following procedure first we corrected adcp s compass error by finding the differences between the two ship tracks obtained from the adcp s bottom tracking function and the differential gps and then computed absolute velocity of adcp using the compass corrected bottom tracking ship velocities e g zhu et al 2014 the computed adcp velocities were moving averaged and re sampled at an equispaced interval of 20 m although the actual ship tracks deviated from straight lines connecting the departure and arrival locations they were small thus we assumed that the adcp velocities were obtained along the straight lines connecting the departure and arrival locations for the moving averages and re samples next the adcp s velocity the east west and north south components at each location was projected onto the direction corresponding to the reciprocal transmission path then the projected velocity was averaged over the appropriate range of depths at each location the adcp cannot measure ocean currents near the surface first blank and the bottom bottom blank about 6 of the water depth in this study we did not take these first and bottom blanks into account for the depth averages lastly these projected and depth averaged velocities were averaged over the adcp transect from the departure to arrival locations 3 results 3 1 ray simulation and acoustic transmission data fig 3 shows the result of the ray simulation a the sound speed profile used in the simulation and the predicted b ray paths and c travel times the measured temperature and salinity were almost uniform over the entire water depth not shown here consequently the sound speed increased with depth at a nearly constant rate of about 0 02 s 1 because of the increase in the pressure with depth in this sound speed profile acoustic pulses refract upward as they propagate the simulation predicted a direct ray surface reflected rays and surface and bottom reflected rays since there is some uncertainty in the bottom topography data used in the simulation there may be some uncertainty in the paths of the rays that experience bottom reflection the direct ray surface reflected rays and some of the surface and bottom reflected rays arrived at the receiver at nearly the same time rays with red color within the digit duration of the transmission signal shown in table 1 therefore the arrivals of these rays would produce a single peak in arrival patterns other surface and bottom reflected rays arrived at the receiver with a delay of 0 5 2 ms compared to the first arrival since the direct ray and surface reflected rays passed through the layer 10 20 m below the surface the differential travel times of these rays were considered to represent the corresponding surface current however as will be seen below the vertical variation in the current was small at the observation site therefore the path averaged current could also be considered to represent the current averaged over the full depth section averaged current the nearly constant vertical profiles of temperature and salinity also implied that the vertical variation in the current was small well mixed and almost homogeneous density fig 4 shows a an example of observed reciprocal arrival patterns and b a time series of the travel times and magnitudes of observed arrival peaks referred to as dot plot e g munk et al 1995 in general for each transmission the first arrival peak is the highest and multiple smaller arrivals follow the first arrival peaks are stable have a sufficiently high snr and are traceable over the time series the smaller peaks of the late arrivals are traceable but only over short periods and do not reciprocally exist sometimes these characteristics are common throughout the observation period the result of the ray simulation indicates that the first arrival peak consists of the arrivals of multiple rays separated by short time intervals fig 3 this is also implied by the observed arrival patterns fig 4a the full width at half maximum of the first arrival peak in fig 4a is wider than the digit duration of the signal 0 385 ms table 1 the number of subsequent smaller peaks shown in the dot plots fig 4b is often different from that predicted by the ray simulation ray paths can change with time because of the sea level variation and associated changes in the locations of the surface and bottom reflections in this study the differential travel times were defined from the lag times of the cross correlation function of the reciprocal arrival patterns section 2 3 because the first arrival peak was the highest and much higher than other subsequent peaks the cross correlation function of the reciprocal arrival patterns depended largely on the first arrivals in the reciprocal direction therefore the differential travel times determined from the cross correlation function would be nearly identical to the differential travel times of the first arrival peaks fig 5 shows the time series of the snrs of the maximum arrival peaks the snrs of the maximum peaks are generally high but have a broad range the range in the snr was about 10 db before october 15 but increased to more than 15 db after that although we do not fully understand the causes of the periodic increase decrease of snr some decreases in snr during the daytime were associated with the operation of the passenger ferry boat close to the transmission line and at the floating pier on which the south station was placed the sudden decrease in the snr on october 15 may have been attributed to a problem with the mooring at the south station during the recovery of this mooring the bottom weight was retrieved first and the subsurface buoy last indicating that the buoy may somehow have become stuck being caught by something the transducer might not have been correctly directed toward the north station after october 15 3 2 current velocity data fig 6 shows the temporal changes in the current along the adcp transect and the vertical section of the adcp velocity obtained from the 11 surveys that began at 7 00 with a 1 hour interval the adcp results show that a semi diurnal variation has a maximum current of about 2 m s 1 along the water channel the east west direction fig 1 the horizontal variation in the current velocity was relatively complex by contrast the vertical variation was relatively uniform table 3 lists the two section averaged adcp currents for the two averaging depths the surface 20 m and the full depth the differences between these two sets of results are small the rms difference between the two depth averaged currents is 0 9 cm s 1 when comparing the path averaged current with the adcp current we used the range and full depth averaged adcp velocity fig 7 shows the temporal variation in sea level and estimated path averaged current over the observation period the neap to spring variation is clear with the ranges in the current magnitude being about 0 2 m s 1 during the neap tide and 0 4 m s 1 during the spring tide the reason for the relatively small magnitude of the observed path averaged currents is that the reciprocal transmission line was nearly perpendicular to the main flow direction fig 6a the strong current in the direction of the main channel contributed little to the path averaged current projected on to the transmission line the variation looks noisy but this is due to high frequency variation as shown below fig 8 shows the detailed view of the time series of the estimated path averaged currents and the weighted means along with the 90 confidence intervals over the whole observation period in the time series plot high frequency variations that are superimposed on the semi diurnal variation are noticeable particularly during the spring tide these high frequency variations can be traced over the time series and the confidence interval is sufficiently narrow to suggest these high frequency variations are not attributed to noise the high frequency variations are only prominent at typical tidal phases for example 1 h to 3 h variations are conspicuous during the last halves of the flood and ebb tides the confidence interval is generally narrow but notably wide sometimes particularly some periods for october 16 19 i e after the decrease in snr occurred during these periods the number of successful transmissions was relatively low and the estimated path averaged currents differ from each other in each burst transmission the six transmissions with the 1 min intervals in each burst resulted in similar path averaged currents indicating small measurement noise the rms difference between each path averaged current and the weighted means for whole the observation period is 2 5 cm s 1 in some cases the differences are attributed to variations in the actual current velocity i e the current velocity varied within the 5 min periods if the variations in the current velocity are accounted for by replacing the weighted means with linear regression values for each six burst transmission the rms difference decreases to 1 8 cm s 1 this value is nearly equal to the value of the current velocity corresponding to the sampling frequency 1 6 cm s 1 most of the reciprocal acoustic transmissions thus has high repeatability differently determined travel times or differential travel times can result in different estimates of path averaged currents e g taniguchi et al 2018 fig 9 shows a comparison of the results of the two types of estimates the one is determined by the lag time of the cross correlation function section 2 3 and the other is by threshold criteria for the first arrival peak for the estimates made using the threshold criteria we first determined travel times from each of the reciprocal arrival patterns by identifying the time at which the arrival pulse magnitude first exceeded half the maximum magnitude then we computed the differential travel times and corresponding path averaged currents for the typical arrival pattern obtained in this experiment fig 4 the two methods produced nearly identical path averaged currents re selecting the local maximum of the cross correlation function using the median of the six burst data eliminated some outliers in the results of the threshold method fig 10 shows a comparison of the path averaged current of the reciprocal transmission with the section averaged adcp current although the path averaged current somewhat scatters during some periods the two currents agree with each other the rms difference of the two currents is 9 9 cm s 1 note that the two currents were sampled in different manners and some of the rms difference is caused by the difference of the sampling manners the path averaged current exhibits the high frequency variations that are not captured by the hourly adcp observations for example while the values of the adcp currents are nearly constant about 0 2 m s 1 from 7 00 to 10 00 the path averaged current exhibits a relatively large variation with a period of about 1 5 h it is particularly noticeable that the path averaged current varies by 0 6 m s 1 over a period of 30 min from 0 3 m s 1 at 9 00 to 0 3 m s 1 at 9 30 both sets of results show relatively rapid current changes certain times from 10 00 to 11 00 from negative to positive values from 13 00 to 14 00 also from negative to positive values and from 16 00 to 17 00 from positive to negative values the results of the adcp observations show that the main flow direction fluctuates with respect to the west east direction fig 6b i e the signs of the projected current around the main flow 1000 2000 m are negative southward positive northward and negative again at 10 00 11 00 and 12 00 respectively panels f g and h in fig 6 causing rapid changes in the velocity component in the direction of the reciprocal transmission line the high frequency variations that are not captured by the adcp during other periods e g from 9 00 to about 10 20 are also possibly attributed to fluctuations in the current direction 4 discussion and conclusions this study aimed to demonstrate the capability of reciprocal acoustic transmissions to precisely measure high frequency variations in tidal currents in coastal shallow water for this purpose it is important to know how largely the measured path averaged currents fluctuate because of measurement noises a source of the measurement noises may be the interference of the multi arrival rays specifically instantaneous variation fluctuation in current velocity and sound speed in the turbulent ocean can vary the composition of the multi arrival rays in the observed arrival peaks for each transmission causing the variation in the estimates of the path averaged currents for each transmission in conditions of multi arrival rays the uncertainty of the estimated travel time and resulting path averaged current is sometimes estimated from the time resolution of the transmitted signal for multi arrival rays e g kaneko et al 2020 which corresponds to the digit duration of the transmitted m sequence 0 385 ms for our signal table 1 the resulting uncertainty is about 0 152 m s 1 although the first and largest arrival peak observed in our results would be contribution from multi arrival rays the time separation of those multi arrival rays are about 0 1 ms fig 4 and are shorter than the time resolution thus the uncertainty based on the time resolution of multi arrival rays 0 152 m s 1 is an overestimation in our results it is also noted that the half width at half maximum of the observed arrival pulses fig 4 was only 0 05 ms larger than that of a conceptual arrival pulse due to a single ray arrival if we use this value we obtain the uncertainty due to multi arrival rays of about 0 02 m s 1 to examine the variation in the observed path averaged currents over short periods a burst transmission method was used i e the six 1 min interval transmissions were repeated every 10 min in the experiment the six transmissions in each burst period provided nearly identical estimates of the path averaged current the rms difference between each path averaged current and the weighted means was 2 5 cm s 1 which is similar to the uncertainty estimated from the width of the observed arrival pulse the histogram of the differences between each path averaged current and the weighted means was in the form of a bell shaped curve not shown here similar to the normal distribution however the kurtosis of this histogram was more than twice that of a normal distribution this indicates that when compared with a normal distribution there were more data corresponding to a difference close to zero or to relatively large differences therefore the reciprocal transmissions at the observation site had a high repeatability most of the time as expected the differences from the weighted mean tended to be large when the values of the cross correlation function of the reciprocal arrival patterns were relatively low although still over 0 7 for detailed discussion however we had to increase the number of transmissions with shorter time intervals the number of successful transmissions for some periods was low and the current velocity varied somewhat over 5 min of burst transmission if the variations in the current velocity are accounted for the rms difference decreases to 1 8 cm s 1 this value is nearly equal to the lowest current velocity value defined by the sampling frequency of the present system therefore for precise analysis it is also desirable to use a transducer that operates at a higher frequency and broader signal bandwidths although designs of the sound signals must be made carefully because the snr of received signals varies widely with time measurement noise in this experiment was sufficiently small so that one can trace the variations in the observed currents of each transmission over the time series for such precise observations we will be able to use each path averaged current data without moving average filters when applying inversion or data assimilation methods using data without low pass filters would be desirable for precise reconstructions of instantaneous current velocity fields there found suspicious estimates sometimes and burst transmissions are useful for detecting and removing suspicious estimates burst transmissions may also be useful to inversion and data assimilation methods the mean and standard deviation obtained by burst transmissions can be used as the data and its error variances previous studies of cat s data assimilation have specified normal distributions with a standard deviation that is constant over the time homogeneous in time park and kaneko 2000 lin et al 2005 zhu et al 2017b note that however repeating transmissions continually with a sufficiently short time interval is always desirable and will enable further discussion provided the increased data storage or amount of data to be transferred for real time monitoring and power supply requirements are not a constraint hanifa et al 2020 reported a 3 h variation in the current in their reciprocal transmission experiment carried out in bali strait indonesia the characteristics of their data were that the magnitude of these 3 h variations was comparable to that of the semi diurnal variation and that the 3 h variation only appeared during a certain period of a specific phase of the semi diurnal variation hanifa et al 2020 hanifa et al 2020 suggested that this 3 h variation was related to an internal seiche that was synchronized with the semi diurnal tides the high frequency variations found in our results had the same features the high frequency variations in the path averaged currents occurred at the end of the flood and ebb tides and were coincide with a strong current in the direction of the main flow channel as can be seen from the adcp results fig 6 these variations have been attributed to fluctuations in the flow direction the magnitudes of these high frequency variations in the path averaged currents were comparable to those of the semi diurnal variations this is because the reciprocal transmission path was nearly perpendicular to the direction of the main channel the magnitude of the semi diurnal variation in the current was about 2 0 m s 1 in the direction of the main channel the path averaged current along one transmission line does not provide sufficient information to discuss the processes of these high frequency variations in further detail the reciprocal transmissions become increasingly useful when they are performed between multiple transmission pairs and when inversion or data assimilation methods are applied to the path averaged current along multiple transmission paths e g zhu et al 2017b zhang et al 2017 it is expected that the precise observations of path averaged currents shown in this study can further improve the capability to reproduce current velocity fields by those inversion or data assimilation methods reciprocal acoustic transmissions can provide precise information about currents in coastal shallow seas although the reciprocal transmissions have been studied for long time our results which have showed the possibility of detecting high frequency variations in coastal currents encourage us to further develop the use of reciprocal acoustic transmissions for accurately reproducing current fields and for studying coastal processes at various temporal scales the reciprocal acoustic transmissions captured the high frequency variations that were not captured by the hourly adcp observations capturing similar high frequency variation using shipboard adcps would require the continuous operation of the shipboard adcp in the seto inland sea it is difficult to make long term and or operational observations using shipboard adcps or moorings equipped with adcps because of heavy shipping and fishing activities therefore reciprocal acoustic transmissions will be particularly useful method if the power supplies are supported by solar cells adityawarman et al 2011 the acoustic transmissions can be performed over a long period with sufficiently short intervals long term observations of the reciprocal acoustic transmissions are particularly useful for the study on residual currents and throughflow in the seto inland sea zhang et al 2016 taniguchi et al 2018

21245,observations of ocean currents are important information in the fields of ocean science and engineering reciprocal acoustic transmissions have the potential to operationally measure tidal currents in coastal seas this study investigates the capability of the reciprocal transmissions to measure tidal currents particularly in relation to high frequency variations we conducted a reciprocal acoustic transmission experiment in an area of complex coastlines in the seto inland sea japan in october 2019 during this experiment a burst transmission was used and the system performed six transmissions with 1 min intervals between them every 10 min the estimated path averaged currents agreed with the currents obtained from a shipboard acoustic doppler current profiler adcp on an hourly basis and had captured high frequency variations that were not captured by the hourly adcp observations the measurement noise of the estimated currents which was determined as the variation within the six transmissions was 2 5 cm s 1 and was small enough to trace the variations in the currents over the time series even for the variations with periods considerably shorter than m2 tide the reciprocal transmission s capability to capture high frequency variations will improve the capability to reproduce current velocity fields when inversion or data assimilation methods are applied keywords reciprocal acoustic transmissions current velocity measurement high frequency variation in tidal currents comparison with adcp observations 1 introduction ocean currents are important information in ocean science and engineering for example it is well known that ocean currents transport and redistribute heat and salt and that the ocean circulation plays an important role in the earth s climate system ocean currents also transport nutrients and fish larvae which are important for fisheries biology and ecology moreover strong ocean currents are sources of renewable energy and information about current velocities in coastal seas is essential for evaluating their energy potential and for ensuring that operations for power generation can be safely and efficiently conducted while recent numerical ocean models can precisely predict current fields over a wide area ocean current observations are required for validating model predictions and for allowing predictions to be improved by applying data assimilation methods e g wilkin et al 2017 acoustic methods are widely used in ocean observations e g howe et al 2019 including the measurements of ocean currents for example acoustic doppler current profilers adcps can be used to capture spatiotemporal variations in ocean currents by operating a ship that has the adcps installed over the area of interest shipboard adcp observations regarding operational and long term applications however the use of shipboard adcps to provide information about current velocities at different temporal scales requires considerable effort reciprocal acoustic transmissions worcester 1977 munk et al 1995 is a potentially useful method for operationally obtaining information on currents in coastal and inland seas with complex coastlines path averaged current velocities and the sound speed can be estimated from the travel times of sound pulses that are reciprocally transmitted and received between horizontally separated transceivers the sums of the reciprocal travel times provide the information about sound speed which can be converted to temperature and the differences in the reciprocal travel times differential travel times provide the information about current velocities worcester 1977 munk et al 1995 if multiple transceivers are deployed one can measure the travel times of acoustic pulses that propagate in the ocean in various directions these multiple travel time data are used to estimate the spatial distributions of the sound speed and currents by using inverse or data assimilation methods the method is referred to as ocean acoustic tomography oat and was proposed by munk and wunsch 1979 to measure and understand the mesoscale variations associated with general ocean circulation which is difficult to capture using conventional moorings and ship observations the oat method was developed in deep sea environments e g howe et al 2019 but has been used to measure strong tidal currents and tidal vortexes in coastal and inland seas in these situations it is referred to as coastal acoustic tomography cat e g kaneko et al 2020 multiple cat studies have successfully demonstrated the capability to detect tidal currents such as semi diurnal variations daily inequality and neap spring beat see kaneko et al 2020 and references therein in coastal inland seas deploying acoustic transceivers from quays makes system maintenance easy and enables long term operational observations to be made with this advantage one target of cat is to operationally provide information on current velocity fields i e real time monitoring systems in coastal seas semi diurnal and diurnal tidal currents are often dominant in shallow seas there are higher frequency variations in currents some of which are associated with overtides and compound tides e g parker 1991 spatial variations in such tidal currents can be rapid due to depth variations and convoluted coastlines overtides and compound tides cause the flood ebb asymmetry in tidal currents and this asymmetry affects sediment transport and coastal morphology e g brown and davies 2010 therefore information on currents associated with overtides is essential for coastal zone assessment and management generally the magnitudes of the current velocity of overtides and compound tides and also other high frequency variations are considerably smaller than those of major tidal constituents such as the m 2 tide thus precise observations are required observed travel time data and path averaged current time series generally exhibit oscillating variations due to measurement noise although the ratio of the strong tidal signals such as m 2 tide to measurement noises i e signal to noise ratio snr are sufficiently high in general in previous cat studies travel time data have often been smoothed by using moving average filters in order to decrease measurement noises e g kaneko et al 2020 and references therein also measurement noises have been estimated using root mean squared differences from 1 hour moving average filtered data e g zhang et al 2016 taniguchi et al 2018 for precise observations of tidal currents including high frequency variations it is desirable that the time periods of moving average filters are sufficiently short so that moving average filters do not suppress not only measurement noises but also signals of high frequency variation in currents e g zhu et al 2017a cat can capture high frequency variations without moving average filters for large variations such as tidal bores zhu et al 2012 kawanisi et al 2017 with sufficient snr but for small magnitude variations it is difficult to determine whether the observed variations were caused by ocean currents or measurement noises e g fig 10 of yamaoka et al 2002 in a cat experiment in hiroshima bay japan observed path averaged currents exhibited high frequency variation and the observed variation would become convincing if the variation was able to be traced over the time series of each transmission data zhang et al 2015 taniguchi et al 2020 in october 2019 we conducted a preliminary experiment of the reciprocal acoustic transmission using a pair of transceivers deployed within an area of complex coastlines and islands in the seto inland sea japan fig 1 aiming for developing a real time monitoring system of current velocity fields in the future one purpose of this experiment was to understand how precisely we can observe path averaged currents focusing particularly on high frequency variations since repeating transmissions in sufficiently short time intervals is essential to detect high frequency variations in our preliminary experiment the reciprocal transmissions were performed in burst mode thomson and emery 2014 in which six transmissions with one minute interval between them were repeated every 10 min using such transmission data this study estimates the measurement noise in the observed path averaged current by examining the variation in the path averaged current over a short period of the burst transmission we will show that the measurement noise of the observed path averaged currents is small enough to trace track the variations in the currents with small magnitude and with periods considerably shorter than m 2 tide the reciprocal transmission s capability to capture high frequency variations of small magnitude shown in this study will improve the cat s capability to reproduce current velocity fields when inversion or data assimilation methods are applied this study also shows effectiveness of the reciprocal transmission by comparing results with that obtained from hourly shipboard adcp observations the observed path averaged current exhibited high frequency variations that were not captured by the hourly shipboard adcp observations 2 method and data 2 1 acoustic travel time and path averaged current the travel time denoted by τ of an acoustic pulse propagating in the ocean depends on the sound speed c r z and the current velocity v r z over a traveling ray path γ and can be expressed in the following form munk et al 1995 1 τ γ d s c r z v r z r where s is arc length of the ray and r is a unit vector in the direction tangential to the ray thus v r z r indicates the projection of the current velocity onto the path i e velocity component in the ray direction note that r depends on the ray paths oat considers the travel time perturbation caused by variations in the sound speed and the current velocity from a reference ocean the reciprocal transmissions separate the effects of the sound speed and current velocity munk et al 1995 the differential travel times denoted by τ d of the acoustic pulses traveling in opposite directions between transceivers may be related to the horizontal current velocity u r z and reference sound speed c 0 r z in the following form howe et al 1987 2 τ d 2 0 l u r z c 0 2 r z d r where l is the horizontal distance between the transceivers and z z r in the equation the velocity component in the ray direction v r z r is replaced by u r z which is the horizontal component r component of v r z r the reason for this replacement is that we ignore the contribution of the vertical component of v r z r to τ d because the vertical components of ocean currents are generally smaller than horizontal components furthermore ray paths are nearly horizontal therefore the projection onto the ray direction decreases vertical contributions we consider path averaged values of u r z and c 0 r z and regard them as constants with u m and c m for the path averaged current and reference sound speed respectively eq 2 then reduces to a simple equation relating u m to τ d zheng et al 1997 3 u m c m 2 2 l τ d the path averaged sound speed c m can be derived from ctd observations or from the sum of the reciprocal travel times zheng et al 1997 ray simulations are used to learn how acoustic pulses propagate through the ocean we simulated the paths and travel times of rays in an environment where the sound speed was independent of the range by numerically integrating the following equations bowlin et al 1992 dushaw and colosi 1998 4 d θ d r 1 c d c d z a d z d r tan θ b d t d r sec θ c c where θ is the angle of the ray with respect to the horizontal axis the sound speed profile c z was computed using the temperature and salinity data obtained from the field experiment section 2 2 the numerical integration was performed using the classical fourth order runge kutta method with a horizontal step size of 2 m the sea floor and sea surface were considered to be acoustic mirrors i e the reflections at the bottom and surface were treated as specular we examined the rays launched from the sound source in the range of 3 to 3 with an increment of 0 02 and selected those rays for which the depth at the receiver range was within 0 5 m of a specified receiver depth rays with wider launch angles experience multiple reflections at the sea floor and surface and the signals of those paths would be sufficiently attenuated at the receiver for practical transmissions 2 2 field experiments a reciprocal transmission experiment using two acoustic stations was conducted in an area in the northwest of hiuchi nada over the 12 days from october 7 to october 19 2019 the travel time measurement system used for this study was based on the one used in a moving ship tomography study huang et al 2019 the system consisted of three primary items a microcontroller with peripheral electrical circuits a gnss global navigation satellite system receiver module and antenna and an electro acoustic transducer the transducer was a sonotube 008 d13 from the chelsea technology group which worked as both the transmitter and receiver i e as a transceiver at a frequency of about 13 khz the gnss receiver module was a u blox lea m8t which can output two precise pulses square waves with an accuracy of 20 ns and a time pulse jitter of 11 ns we set the frequencies of the two pulses to 1 hz and 8 mhz the 1 hz pulse was the trigger signal for the start of the sound transmission and was used to synchronize the transmissions from the two acoustic stations the 8 mhz signal was fed into a frequency divider generating the carrier frequency of the sound signal and a reference signal for demodulation of the received signal the gnss receiver module provided the time and date information the microcontroller used this time information to operate scheduled tasks such as periodic sound transmission the received signals were amplified and demodulated into in phase and quadrature components these two signals were digitized by a 12 bit analog to digital converter in the microcontroller at a sampling frequency equal to twice the carrier frequency of the transmitted signal the digitized data were then recorded on an sd memory card on the electrical circuit board fig 1 shows a map of the observation site and the location of the transceiver the distance between the two stations was 2842 m fig 2 shows diagrams of the deployment for the transceivers at the northern station the system was placed on a quay of a fishing harbor and the acoustic transceiver was deployed from the quay by attaching the transceiver to a rope that had a weight at one end the other end of the rope was tied to a pole on the quay and the rope was stretched tight between the weight on the sea floor and the pole on the quay the resulting tension was used to fix the transceiver the transceiver was placed 2 m above the sea floor the mean water depth at the deployment position was 5 2 m and the depth ranged from 3 5 to 6 9 m depending on the tides at the southern station the acoustic system was placed on a floating pier used by the ohkunoshima island passenger ferry the transceiver was moored using a weight a subsurface buoy and a rope the transceiver was placed 3 m above the sea floor however this depth varied with time because of the tilt of the mooring due to the tidal current the mean water depth was 7 3 m and the depth ranged from 5 6 to 9 0 m depending on the tides in oat and cat experiments precise measurements of the acoustic travel times are achieved using a pulse compression method munk et al 1995 as in earlier cat experiments kaneko et al 2020 the transmitted signal in our experiment was a binary phase shift keyed signal encoded by a pseudo random binary sequence called a maximal length sequence often referred to as an m sequence table 1 summarizes the signal parameters for this experiment in general smaller values for the number of carrier cycles are desirable in terms of time resolution in the experiment the value of five carrier waves which is nearly equal to the value of the quality factor of the transducer s equivalent circuit were selected in order to get the transducer resonance in each phase change snr of transmitted received signal varies largely in reciprocal transmissions in shallow waters e g taniguchi et al 2020 thus we would like to use long duration signal to ensure sufficiently high snr even in bad conditions for acoustic propagation in the experiment longer duration signal for example four periods of 10 order m sequence or two periods of 11 order m sequence was able to use but we were worried about that reverberation might affect the signal arrival from the paired station because of insufficient times between the end of transmission and the signal arrival thus we used three periods of 10 order m sequence using six periods of 9 order m sequence would result in nearly identical snr however the two stations transmitted a specific signal that had different m sequences but the same sequence length the m sequence signal was generated and amplified using a full bridge inverter and a step up voltage transformer in the present system for ease of implementation the carrier signal was a square wave rather than a sinusoidal one the amplified signal was fed into the transducer with an additional tuning inductor the source level at full resonance was estimated to be 188 db re 1 μ pa at 1 m but actual source level may have been less than 188 db because of the frequent phase changes in the signal in this experiment the reciprocal transmissions were performed in burst transmission burst sampling mode thomson and emery 2014 in general burst transmissions are useful for suppressing high frequency noise in this study burst transmissions were used to know the variations in the measured path averaged currents over a relatively short period the details of the schedule for the burst transmission in our experiment were as follows the two acoustic stations simultaneously transmitted the signal six times at intervals of 1 min e g transmissions were made at 00 00 00 01 00 02 00 03 00 04 and 00 05 the system then slept for 5 min before continuing with the next six transmissions which in this case would be made at 00 10 00 11 00 12 00 13 00 14 and 00 15 in this manner the system repeated the six transmissions with 1 min intervals between them every 10 min while using the burst transmission mode we expected that the current velocity fields at the observation site would be nearly steady over 5 min of the burst transmission note that repeating transmissions with 1 min or more shorter intervals continually i e rather than burst transmission increase the number of data and would enable discussion in more detail however neither huge batteries nor solar panels for charging were used in this experiment and therefore we decrease the number of transmission by employing burst mode transmissions to decrease the power consumption we conducted shipboard adcp observations on october 15 to obtain velocity data for comparison with the acoustic transmission data the adcp used in the experiment was a wh adcp teledyne rd instruments inc the details of the operating parameters for the adcp observations are summarized in table 2 the shipboard adcp observations were made hourly from 07 00 to 17 00 first a fishing boat that had the adcp installed departed from near the north station at 7 00 and moved toward the south station at an average ship speed of about 3 4 knots taking about 20 min to complete the journey because the floating pier at the south station was continually used by ferry boats we allowed the adcp s transect to deviate from that of the acoustic transmission path for safety reasons fig 1 the ship tracks were recorded using a differential gps in order to correct the adcp s compass error e g zhu et al 2014 at 08 00 the boat departed from near the south station and crossed to near the north station in all 11 cross sections of velocity data were obtained from these adcp observations on the same day that the adcp observations were made we conducted conductivity temperature depth ctd observations four times at the location indicated by the yellow square in fig 1 the observed vertical profiles of temperature and salinity were used to compute the sound speed profile and this sound speed profile was used in the ray simulation 2 3 data processing for each transmission arrival patterns of the acoustic pulses were determined by computing the cross correlation functions cross correlogram between the received signal after demodulation and the replica of the transmitted m sequence when the signal to noise ratio snr for the highest peak in the arrival pattern was less than 12 db it was considered that the transmission had failed on this occasion the value of this threshold 12 db was determined for a subjective reason with trial and error we recognized some signal arrivals with the peak heights less than 12 db in some received data but for other data we found that there were noises pseudo peaks with the peak heights close to 12 db the noise level was estimated from the median value of the arrival time series over 50 ms including the highest arrival peak to determine the differential travel times from the reciprocal arrival patterns we adopted a method described in huang et al 2019 for our burst transmission data first the differential travel times for each transmission were determined by computing the normalized cross correlation of the reciprocal arrival patterns the differential travel time was defined as the lag time at the maximum peak of the computed cross correlation function if the maximum value of the cross correlation function was less than 0 7 it was considered that the reciprocal transmission had failed on this occasion reciprocal arrival patterns should show high cross correlation i e arrival patterns are similar to each other when the reciprocal transmissions are performed successfully the threshold of 0 7 was determined by trial and error we find the peak higher than 0 7 of the cross correlation generally resulted in plausible differential travel times next the median of the six differential travel times for each burst was computed note that there were usually six differential travel times for each burst however this was not always the case because there were certain failed transmissions we then recalculated the differential travel time for each transmission by identifying the local maximum of the cross correlation function whose lag time was closest to the computed median value this procedure was able to eliminate gross errors caused by selecting wrong peaks of the cross correlation functions additionally at this stage if the difference between the recalculated differential travel time and the median value was larger than 0 385 ms the differential travel time data for this transmission were not used lastly the estimated differential travel times for each transmission were converted to the path averaged currents using eq 3 in this study a positive value of u m indicates that the direction of the path averaged current was toward the north station we computed the weighted arithmetic means of the six path averaged currents in each burst and consider this weighted means as the representative values of the path averaged current for the 5 min period of each burst the weights were derived by multiplying two quantities the snr of the maximum arrival peak in the arrival patterns and the cross correlation value at the selected peak local maximum for snr the smaller of the two snrs of the reciprocal arrival patterns was used the path averaged currents thus had low weights when the currents were obtained from the reciprocal arrival patterns with low snrs and low values of the cross correlation function the root mean squared rms difference between each path averaged current and the weighted means was computed to know how largely the estimated path averaged currents fluctuated over the 5 min period which is considered as the measurement noise the uncertainty in the representative value of the path averaged currents in each burst was determined by the confidence interval t s n where s and n is respectively the sample standard deviation and the number of the usable path averaged currents in each burst the value of t is derived from the cumulative t distribution with a specified number of degrees of freedom and confidence level e g thomson and emery 2014 when the number of the usable path averaged currents in each burst period was less than two the uncertainty was calculated as 16 cm s 1 based on the signal digit duration of 0 385 ms table 1 the shipboard adcp outputs the vertical profile of the current velocity along the transect to compare the two current velocity values of the reciprocal transmissions and the adcps the adcp s velocity was converted to a value comparable to the path averaged current according to the following procedure first we corrected adcp s compass error by finding the differences between the two ship tracks obtained from the adcp s bottom tracking function and the differential gps and then computed absolute velocity of adcp using the compass corrected bottom tracking ship velocities e g zhu et al 2014 the computed adcp velocities were moving averaged and re sampled at an equispaced interval of 20 m although the actual ship tracks deviated from straight lines connecting the departure and arrival locations they were small thus we assumed that the adcp velocities were obtained along the straight lines connecting the departure and arrival locations for the moving averages and re samples next the adcp s velocity the east west and north south components at each location was projected onto the direction corresponding to the reciprocal transmission path then the projected velocity was averaged over the appropriate range of depths at each location the adcp cannot measure ocean currents near the surface first blank and the bottom bottom blank about 6 of the water depth in this study we did not take these first and bottom blanks into account for the depth averages lastly these projected and depth averaged velocities were averaged over the adcp transect from the departure to arrival locations 3 results 3 1 ray simulation and acoustic transmission data fig 3 shows the result of the ray simulation a the sound speed profile used in the simulation and the predicted b ray paths and c travel times the measured temperature and salinity were almost uniform over the entire water depth not shown here consequently the sound speed increased with depth at a nearly constant rate of about 0 02 s 1 because of the increase in the pressure with depth in this sound speed profile acoustic pulses refract upward as they propagate the simulation predicted a direct ray surface reflected rays and surface and bottom reflected rays since there is some uncertainty in the bottom topography data used in the simulation there may be some uncertainty in the paths of the rays that experience bottom reflection the direct ray surface reflected rays and some of the surface and bottom reflected rays arrived at the receiver at nearly the same time rays with red color within the digit duration of the transmission signal shown in table 1 therefore the arrivals of these rays would produce a single peak in arrival patterns other surface and bottom reflected rays arrived at the receiver with a delay of 0 5 2 ms compared to the first arrival since the direct ray and surface reflected rays passed through the layer 10 20 m below the surface the differential travel times of these rays were considered to represent the corresponding surface current however as will be seen below the vertical variation in the current was small at the observation site therefore the path averaged current could also be considered to represent the current averaged over the full depth section averaged current the nearly constant vertical profiles of temperature and salinity also implied that the vertical variation in the current was small well mixed and almost homogeneous density fig 4 shows a an example of observed reciprocal arrival patterns and b a time series of the travel times and magnitudes of observed arrival peaks referred to as dot plot e g munk et al 1995 in general for each transmission the first arrival peak is the highest and multiple smaller arrivals follow the first arrival peaks are stable have a sufficiently high snr and are traceable over the time series the smaller peaks of the late arrivals are traceable but only over short periods and do not reciprocally exist sometimes these characteristics are common throughout the observation period the result of the ray simulation indicates that the first arrival peak consists of the arrivals of multiple rays separated by short time intervals fig 3 this is also implied by the observed arrival patterns fig 4a the full width at half maximum of the first arrival peak in fig 4a is wider than the digit duration of the signal 0 385 ms table 1 the number of subsequent smaller peaks shown in the dot plots fig 4b is often different from that predicted by the ray simulation ray paths can change with time because of the sea level variation and associated changes in the locations of the surface and bottom reflections in this study the differential travel times were defined from the lag times of the cross correlation function of the reciprocal arrival patterns section 2 3 because the first arrival peak was the highest and much higher than other subsequent peaks the cross correlation function of the reciprocal arrival patterns depended largely on the first arrivals in the reciprocal direction therefore the differential travel times determined from the cross correlation function would be nearly identical to the differential travel times of the first arrival peaks fig 5 shows the time series of the snrs of the maximum arrival peaks the snrs of the maximum peaks are generally high but have a broad range the range in the snr was about 10 db before october 15 but increased to more than 15 db after that although we do not fully understand the causes of the periodic increase decrease of snr some decreases in snr during the daytime were associated with the operation of the passenger ferry boat close to the transmission line and at the floating pier on which the south station was placed the sudden decrease in the snr on october 15 may have been attributed to a problem with the mooring at the south station during the recovery of this mooring the bottom weight was retrieved first and the subsurface buoy last indicating that the buoy may somehow have become stuck being caught by something the transducer might not have been correctly directed toward the north station after october 15 3 2 current velocity data fig 6 shows the temporal changes in the current along the adcp transect and the vertical section of the adcp velocity obtained from the 11 surveys that began at 7 00 with a 1 hour interval the adcp results show that a semi diurnal variation has a maximum current of about 2 m s 1 along the water channel the east west direction fig 1 the horizontal variation in the current velocity was relatively complex by contrast the vertical variation was relatively uniform table 3 lists the two section averaged adcp currents for the two averaging depths the surface 20 m and the full depth the differences between these two sets of results are small the rms difference between the two depth averaged currents is 0 9 cm s 1 when comparing the path averaged current with the adcp current we used the range and full depth averaged adcp velocity fig 7 shows the temporal variation in sea level and estimated path averaged current over the observation period the neap to spring variation is clear with the ranges in the current magnitude being about 0 2 m s 1 during the neap tide and 0 4 m s 1 during the spring tide the reason for the relatively small magnitude of the observed path averaged currents is that the reciprocal transmission line was nearly perpendicular to the main flow direction fig 6a the strong current in the direction of the main channel contributed little to the path averaged current projected on to the transmission line the variation looks noisy but this is due to high frequency variation as shown below fig 8 shows the detailed view of the time series of the estimated path averaged currents and the weighted means along with the 90 confidence intervals over the whole observation period in the time series plot high frequency variations that are superimposed on the semi diurnal variation are noticeable particularly during the spring tide these high frequency variations can be traced over the time series and the confidence interval is sufficiently narrow to suggest these high frequency variations are not attributed to noise the high frequency variations are only prominent at typical tidal phases for example 1 h to 3 h variations are conspicuous during the last halves of the flood and ebb tides the confidence interval is generally narrow but notably wide sometimes particularly some periods for october 16 19 i e after the decrease in snr occurred during these periods the number of successful transmissions was relatively low and the estimated path averaged currents differ from each other in each burst transmission the six transmissions with the 1 min intervals in each burst resulted in similar path averaged currents indicating small measurement noise the rms difference between each path averaged current and the weighted means for whole the observation period is 2 5 cm s 1 in some cases the differences are attributed to variations in the actual current velocity i e the current velocity varied within the 5 min periods if the variations in the current velocity are accounted for by replacing the weighted means with linear regression values for each six burst transmission the rms difference decreases to 1 8 cm s 1 this value is nearly equal to the value of the current velocity corresponding to the sampling frequency 1 6 cm s 1 most of the reciprocal acoustic transmissions thus has high repeatability differently determined travel times or differential travel times can result in different estimates of path averaged currents e g taniguchi et al 2018 fig 9 shows a comparison of the results of the two types of estimates the one is determined by the lag time of the cross correlation function section 2 3 and the other is by threshold criteria for the first arrival peak for the estimates made using the threshold criteria we first determined travel times from each of the reciprocal arrival patterns by identifying the time at which the arrival pulse magnitude first exceeded half the maximum magnitude then we computed the differential travel times and corresponding path averaged currents for the typical arrival pattern obtained in this experiment fig 4 the two methods produced nearly identical path averaged currents re selecting the local maximum of the cross correlation function using the median of the six burst data eliminated some outliers in the results of the threshold method fig 10 shows a comparison of the path averaged current of the reciprocal transmission with the section averaged adcp current although the path averaged current somewhat scatters during some periods the two currents agree with each other the rms difference of the two currents is 9 9 cm s 1 note that the two currents were sampled in different manners and some of the rms difference is caused by the difference of the sampling manners the path averaged current exhibits the high frequency variations that are not captured by the hourly adcp observations for example while the values of the adcp currents are nearly constant about 0 2 m s 1 from 7 00 to 10 00 the path averaged current exhibits a relatively large variation with a period of about 1 5 h it is particularly noticeable that the path averaged current varies by 0 6 m s 1 over a period of 30 min from 0 3 m s 1 at 9 00 to 0 3 m s 1 at 9 30 both sets of results show relatively rapid current changes certain times from 10 00 to 11 00 from negative to positive values from 13 00 to 14 00 also from negative to positive values and from 16 00 to 17 00 from positive to negative values the results of the adcp observations show that the main flow direction fluctuates with respect to the west east direction fig 6b i e the signs of the projected current around the main flow 1000 2000 m are negative southward positive northward and negative again at 10 00 11 00 and 12 00 respectively panels f g and h in fig 6 causing rapid changes in the velocity component in the direction of the reciprocal transmission line the high frequency variations that are not captured by the adcp during other periods e g from 9 00 to about 10 20 are also possibly attributed to fluctuations in the current direction 4 discussion and conclusions this study aimed to demonstrate the capability of reciprocal acoustic transmissions to precisely measure high frequency variations in tidal currents in coastal shallow water for this purpose it is important to know how largely the measured path averaged currents fluctuate because of measurement noises a source of the measurement noises may be the interference of the multi arrival rays specifically instantaneous variation fluctuation in current velocity and sound speed in the turbulent ocean can vary the composition of the multi arrival rays in the observed arrival peaks for each transmission causing the variation in the estimates of the path averaged currents for each transmission in conditions of multi arrival rays the uncertainty of the estimated travel time and resulting path averaged current is sometimes estimated from the time resolution of the transmitted signal for multi arrival rays e g kaneko et al 2020 which corresponds to the digit duration of the transmitted m sequence 0 385 ms for our signal table 1 the resulting uncertainty is about 0 152 m s 1 although the first and largest arrival peak observed in our results would be contribution from multi arrival rays the time separation of those multi arrival rays are about 0 1 ms fig 4 and are shorter than the time resolution thus the uncertainty based on the time resolution of multi arrival rays 0 152 m s 1 is an overestimation in our results it is also noted that the half width at half maximum of the observed arrival pulses fig 4 was only 0 05 ms larger than that of a conceptual arrival pulse due to a single ray arrival if we use this value we obtain the uncertainty due to multi arrival rays of about 0 02 m s 1 to examine the variation in the observed path averaged currents over short periods a burst transmission method was used i e the six 1 min interval transmissions were repeated every 10 min in the experiment the six transmissions in each burst period provided nearly identical estimates of the path averaged current the rms difference between each path averaged current and the weighted means was 2 5 cm s 1 which is similar to the uncertainty estimated from the width of the observed arrival pulse the histogram of the differences between each path averaged current and the weighted means was in the form of a bell shaped curve not shown here similar to the normal distribution however the kurtosis of this histogram was more than twice that of a normal distribution this indicates that when compared with a normal distribution there were more data corresponding to a difference close to zero or to relatively large differences therefore the reciprocal transmissions at the observation site had a high repeatability most of the time as expected the differences from the weighted mean tended to be large when the values of the cross correlation function of the reciprocal arrival patterns were relatively low although still over 0 7 for detailed discussion however we had to increase the number of transmissions with shorter time intervals the number of successful transmissions for some periods was low and the current velocity varied somewhat over 5 min of burst transmission if the variations in the current velocity are accounted for the rms difference decreases to 1 8 cm s 1 this value is nearly equal to the lowest current velocity value defined by the sampling frequency of the present system therefore for precise analysis it is also desirable to use a transducer that operates at a higher frequency and broader signal bandwidths although designs of the sound signals must be made carefully because the snr of received signals varies widely with time measurement noise in this experiment was sufficiently small so that one can trace the variations in the observed currents of each transmission over the time series for such precise observations we will be able to use each path averaged current data without moving average filters when applying inversion or data assimilation methods using data without low pass filters would be desirable for precise reconstructions of instantaneous current velocity fields there found suspicious estimates sometimes and burst transmissions are useful for detecting and removing suspicious estimates burst transmissions may also be useful to inversion and data assimilation methods the mean and standard deviation obtained by burst transmissions can be used as the data and its error variances previous studies of cat s data assimilation have specified normal distributions with a standard deviation that is constant over the time homogeneous in time park and kaneko 2000 lin et al 2005 zhu et al 2017b note that however repeating transmissions continually with a sufficiently short time interval is always desirable and will enable further discussion provided the increased data storage or amount of data to be transferred for real time monitoring and power supply requirements are not a constraint hanifa et al 2020 reported a 3 h variation in the current in their reciprocal transmission experiment carried out in bali strait indonesia the characteristics of their data were that the magnitude of these 3 h variations was comparable to that of the semi diurnal variation and that the 3 h variation only appeared during a certain period of a specific phase of the semi diurnal variation hanifa et al 2020 hanifa et al 2020 suggested that this 3 h variation was related to an internal seiche that was synchronized with the semi diurnal tides the high frequency variations found in our results had the same features the high frequency variations in the path averaged currents occurred at the end of the flood and ebb tides and were coincide with a strong current in the direction of the main flow channel as can be seen from the adcp results fig 6 these variations have been attributed to fluctuations in the flow direction the magnitudes of these high frequency variations in the path averaged currents were comparable to those of the semi diurnal variations this is because the reciprocal transmission path was nearly perpendicular to the direction of the main channel the magnitude of the semi diurnal variation in the current was about 2 0 m s 1 in the direction of the main channel the path averaged current along one transmission line does not provide sufficient information to discuss the processes of these high frequency variations in further detail the reciprocal transmissions become increasingly useful when they are performed between multiple transmission pairs and when inversion or data assimilation methods are applied to the path averaged current along multiple transmission paths e g zhu et al 2017b zhang et al 2017 it is expected that the precise observations of path averaged currents shown in this study can further improve the capability to reproduce current velocity fields by those inversion or data assimilation methods reciprocal acoustic transmissions can provide precise information about currents in coastal shallow seas although the reciprocal transmissions have been studied for long time our results which have showed the possibility of detecting high frequency variations in coastal currents encourage us to further develop the use of reciprocal acoustic transmissions for accurately reproducing current fields and for studying coastal processes at various temporal scales the reciprocal acoustic transmissions captured the high frequency variations that were not captured by the hourly adcp observations capturing similar high frequency variation using shipboard adcps would require the continuous operation of the shipboard adcp in the seto inland sea it is difficult to make long term and or operational observations using shipboard adcps or moorings equipped with adcps because of heavy shipping and fishing activities therefore reciprocal acoustic transmissions will be particularly useful method if the power supplies are supported by solar cells adityawarman et al 2011 the acoustic transmissions can be performed over a long period with sufficiently short intervals long term observations of the reciprocal acoustic transmissions are particularly useful for the study on residual currents and throughflow in the seto inland sea zhang et al 2016 taniguchi et al 2018 additionally precise information on currents over long periods can also be valuable validation data for high spatial resolution numerical models in coastal studies credit authorship contribution

21246,vibration based damage detection techniques play an important role in health monitoring of offshore structures this study explores the possibility to use the one dimensional convolutional neural network cnn to extract the damage sensitive features automatically from the raw strain response data of a structure under a certain excitation without requiring any hand crafted feature extraction the validity of the proposed method is verified by using a numerical simulation of a jacket type offshore platform under a regular and a random wave excitations in different directions respectively the damage localization and damage severity identification are conducted with considering several damage cases including different damage locations and the effect of noise the data preprocessing procedure based on convolution and deconvolution for noisy data is proposed to enhance the capability of feature extraction and noise immunity of cnn furthermore the experimental studies of a jacket type offshore platform model subjected to a sinusoidal excitation a white noise excitation and an impulse excitation are respectively investigated to check the applicability of the method in which the major damage and minor damage on single and multiple locations are involved results indicate this approach has an excellent performance on structural damage detection keywords damage localization damage severity convolutional neural network deconvolution jacket type offshore platform 1 introduction due to the complex marine environments and human factors the offshore platforms will inevitably be damaged during their service life and the structural health monitoring especially vibration based damage detection technique has a vital role to play in ensuring the safety of marine operations and the integrity management of offshore structures mojtahedi et al 2011 wang et al 2018 liu et al 2014 a vibration based damage detection method is a global method which aims to identify the presence location and severity of the damages of the monitored structure by translating its measured vibration response into damage indicators vibration based damage detection techniques can be categorized as parametric and nonparametric methods abdeljaber et al 2017 in parametric methods modal identification algorithms are applied to determine the modal parameters such as natural frequencies and modal shapes from the measured vibration response with respect to the intact and damaged structures then the changes of modal parameters and their derivatives are usually applied to obtain the damage sensitive features over the last few decades significant progress has been achieved in the parametric methods many approaches based on modal frequency modal shape and their derivatives changes have been developed to solve issues in different structures from basic structures such as beams and plates to complex structures such as bridges and offshore platforms cao et al 2014 shi et al 2000 hu et al 2007 ren et al 2008 vo duy et al 2016 kaveh and zolghadr 2015 hosseinlou et al 2017 detailed review about these techniques can be found in refs li 2010 fan and qiao 2011 among these techniques modal strain energy based methods which are the derivatives of mode shapes have been widely used for damage identification of offshore structures in recent years liu et al 2014 b adopted an improved modal strain energy method by defining stiffness correction factors for damage localization of jacket type offshore wind turbines liu et al 2017 used grouping modal strain energy to detect structural damage of offshore platforms based on incomplete modal information wang and xu 2019 presented a review of the modal strain energy related damage identification methods and then comparative studies for offshore platforms were carried out with four typical methods nevertheless there are still some challenging problems for these parametric methods in application such as incomplete modal data measurement noise and ill conditioned systems of linear equations li et al 2008 bao and shi 2019 bao et al 2020 wang et al 2019 on the other hand nonparametric also called signal based approaches aim to extract damage sensitive features directly from the measured signals instead of requiring modal parameters of the structure abdeljaber et al 2017 lin et al 2017 almost all of these signal based methods relies on modern signal processing or statistics cavadas et al 2013 detected damage by statistical features using a data driven method on moving load responses amezquita sanchez and adeli 2016 presented a review of some signal processing techniques for damage detection of civil structures blachowski et al 2017 used axial strain accelerations method based on simple statistical signal processing for measured acceleration signals to localize the damage in truss structures although the nonparametric approaches need not identify modal parameters or solve any global optimization problems the biggest challenge of these methods is to efficiently handle the large and noisy data measured from many sensors on an online structural health monitoring basis however most of machine learning methods can provide a way to solve such problem because of their strong redundancy and fault tolerance in recent years machine learning methods for damage detection have developed the wide range of the signal based approaches and also increasingly attracted attention especially the technology represented by neural networks has played an important role in structural damage recognition during the past few years great effort has been made in the researchers within the neural networks based structural damage detection methods wu et al 2010 proposed a decentralized parametric identification method for sub structure damage identification by using neural networks based on the displacement velocity and the restoring force of the sub structures azam et al 2019 adopted a supervised learning strategy for structural damage detection using artificial neural networks and proper orthogonal decomposition method which was validated by a finite element model of truss bridge gu et al 2017 used artificial neural networks to identify damage location and severity of a simply supported beam considering varying temperature these studies showed that the conventional neural networks methods can provide good performances on identifying the structural damage however these methods are easily affected by the noise in the input data and are also time consuming for solving complicated problems with multiple hidden layers truong et al 2020 nowadays deep learning has been widely used in computer vision sohn et al 2011 speech recognition bengio et al 2013 and image processing andreas et al 2019 and has achieved satisfactory results deep learning algorithms have good pattern classification and generalization capabilities and have great potential applications in structural damage recognition compared with ordinary neural networks and support vector machines deep learning has great advantages in terms of classification capabilities and efficiency in processing data as a type of deep learning algorithms convolutional neural network cnn is an end to end learning method model using gradient descent algorithm to get the parameters of the model so that the network has the ability to extract model features avoiding the complicated feature extraction process in conventional machine learning methods generally the typical deep neural network directly uses the traditional supervised learning training algorithm for direct training and the calculation cost is relatively large while the cnn reduces the training parameters involved in the network reduces the complexity of the model through weight sharing and has a good generalization ability bengio 2009 at present cnn has practically made great breakthrough in speech recognition computer vision and object detection with two dimensional data input lecun et al 2015 mohamed et al 2012 goodfellow et al 2015 more recently cnn has been applied into the field of structural damage detection for example abdeljaber et al 2017 used cnn to perform vibration based damage detection on a grandstand simulator plane frame structure and results showed excellent performances of the method levent et al 2019 applied a compact adaptive one dimensional cnn to study the performance of a universal real time fault diagnosis system for inductive bearing lin et al 2017 designed a deep cnn to detect the damage position of a simply supported beam and the visualization of the hidden layers was carried out to help one understand how the network works truong et al 2020 used a deep feedforward neural networks dfnn to predict the damage position and severity of truss structures based on noisy incomplete modal data results showed good performance of the dfnn method in damage detection liu and zhang 2019 adopted image driven cnn method for inspection of structural fuse member damage condition case studies of a perforated steel shear link beam and a dogbone steel plate specimen indicated the effectiveness of the method xu et al 2019 applied a modified faster region based cnn for automatically identifying and localizing the multi type seismic damage of reinforced concrete columns on the basis of four hundred postearthquake damaged structural images zhang et al 2019 adopted one dimensional cnn to perfectly identify tiny local structural stiffness and mass changes for t shaped steel beam a short steel girder bridge and a long steel girder bridge respectively based on acceleration data however only single damage location for each case is considered without validating the cnn on multiple damages detection on different planes khodabandehlou et al 2019 used two dimensional deep cnn to successfully predict predefined damage states of a reinforced concrete highway bridge model based on acceleration response data obtained from the shake table testing however the cnn methods for damage identification reported in the literatures almost works for simple structures or simple damage cases and many of them are based on two dimensional image data so far there have been few applications of cnn for multiple damage identification of three dimensional complex structures based on one dimensional raw time series data in this paper cnn is briefly introduced firstly and a one dimensional cnn model is then established to identify the damage locations and severities of a numerical three dimensional jacket type offshore platform several damage cases including single and multiple damage locations and different levels of noise and damage severities under a regular and a random wave excitations in different directions are considered respectively in order to enhance the capability of feature extraction and noise immunity of cnn the data preprocessing procedure based on convolution and deconvolution for noisy data is introduced furthermore the experimental studies of a jacket type offshore platform model under a sinusoidal excitation a white noise excitation and an impulse excitation are respectively conducted to evaluate the performance of the one dimensional cnn for structural damage detection method in which the major damage and minor damage on single and multiple locations are involved 2 brief introduction of cnn the structure diagram of one dimensional cnn used in this paper is illustrated in fig 1 which mainly includes a series of convolutional layers and pooling layers and a fully connected dense layer in the end the convolutional layer uses several convolution kernels to provide the distinctive feature outputs then the pooling layer follows the convolutional layer and reduces the dimension of feature map which can improve the computation efficiency finally the fully connected layer displays the extracted features in the form of probability nonlinear activation function is used to enhance the fitting ability of the model and dropout operation is used to avoid over fitting in which the keep prob is usually set to 0 5 the main components of cnn is introduced briefly in the following sections and more details can be found in ciresan et al 2010 2 1 convolutional layer convolutional layer uses convolutional kernels to convolute the local area of the input signal or feature and generate the corresponding feature apart from the application background of cnn convolution refers to the weighted superposition of one function and another function on one dimension in cnn the simple diagram of convolution is shown in fig 2 the input of cnn in this study is time series value o i is the output of the convolutional layer i which can be expressed as 1 o i f o i 1 w i b where o i 1 is the output of the convolutional layer i 1 w i is the weight of convolutional layer i b is the offset vector and f is the activation function 2 2 pooling layer the pooling layer also known as the sampling layer is usually divided into the upsampling layer and the subsampling layer in the application of two dimensional image processing both the upsampling layer and the subsampling layer are usually used however in the one dimensional time series processing in this study only the subsampling layer is needed which is briefly introduced as follows the subsampling layer mainly includes the maximum pooling layer and average pooling layer the main function of the subsampling layer is to reduce the dimension of the feature map and reduce the risk of over fitting during the model training the subsampling layer generally follows the convolutional layer which can be expressed as 2 p i f d o w n o i a i where d o w n is subsampling function and a i is bias vector of sampling layer i 2 3 activation function in the neural network in order to learn the complex mapping relationship the activation function needs to be applied to transform the output of the upper layer nonlinearly there have been four main activation functions such as sigmoid tanh relu and leaky relu up to now recently the relu glorot et al 2011 and leaky relu maas et al 2013 activation functions have been widely used the form of relu is shown in eq 3 and fig 3 a compared with sigmoid and tanh functions relu function has no problem of the gradient disappearance in the positive direction of x axis in addition the convergence speed of neural network training using relu function is much faster than that using sigmoid and tanh functions krizhevsky et al 2012 however the problem of gradient disappearance still exists in the negative direction of x axis in view of these possible problems in order to speed up convergence and avoid gradient disappearance leaky relu function is designed which is illustrated in eq 4 and fig 3 b with α 0 1 for clarity however α 0 01 is highly applied now which is also adopted in this paper 3 relu x x x 0 0 x 0 4 leaky relu x x x 0 α x α 0 01 x 0 2 4 fully connected dense layer the fully connected layer plays the role of classifier in the cnn it uses the convolutional layer pooling layer and other operations to map the learned feature representations to the labeled space of the sample after the fully connected operation softmax function will then be used to get the probability distribution for each class label the form of softmax function is as follows 5 softmax y i e y i i 1 n e y i where y i i 1 2 n is the output of the fully connected layer n is the number of class labels 2 5 objective function for a classification problem cross entropy is used as the objective function to evaluate the difference between the correct value and the predicted value given two probability distributions p and q the cross entropy h p q is as follows 6 h p q x p x log q x where x is the index of the label vector used in this paper p represents the correct label vector and q represents the predicted value cross entropy describes the distance between two probability distributions p and q or it can be said that it describes the difficulty of expressing probability distribution p through probability distribution q the smaller the cross entropy is the stronger the predictive ability of the model is that is to say the better the generalization ability of the model is for a linear regression problem mean square error is most popularly utilized as the objective function to judge the precision of the prediction results the mean square error is expressed as follows 7 m s e 1 m k 1 m z k z k 2 where m is the number of samples z k is the correct value and z k is the predicted value in order to minimize the output value of the objective function adam s small batch random gradient descent algorithm kingma and ba 2014 is used in this paper 3 numerical simulation 3 1 description of the jacket type offshore platform the jacket type offshore platform model established by ansys software is shown in fig 4 the superstructure is equivalent to four mass points each of which is 70 000 kg the layer spacing between the upper and lower layers of the offshore platform from top to bottom is 8 m 10 m 10 m 10 m 10 m and 5 m respectively the specific dimensions of each part of the model are listed in table 1 the mass density of the structure is 7850 kg m3 poisson s ratio is 0 3 and the young s modulus is 210 gpa the water depth is 40 m and water density is 1025 kg m3 in the real operation of the offshore platform the components near the sea level are vulnerable to ship collision and corrosion so they are selected to simulate the damage locations in this study i e the components between the second and third layer of the structure assuming that the offshore platform is excited by two kinds of wave one is a regular wave with wave height of 8 m and period of 7 4 s from x direction and the other is a random wave simulated by superimposing 10 different regular wave components in pipe59 water motion table in ansys from y direction the axial strain response data of certain components related to the intact and damaged offshore platforms under the two kinds of wave are collected respectively in this study the damage of one component is simulated by reducing the young s modulus of the component the damage detection of the platform under a regular wave in x direction and a random wave in y direction are conducted respectively 3 2 damage localization for minor damage under a regular wave all the damage severities simulated are very minor from 2 to 5 4 damage cases are considered in this section including 3 cases for the full members and 1 case for multiple elements of a pile leg pl a transverse brace tb and a slanted brace sb which are listed in table 2 it is noted that there are 5 scenarios i e one intact and four different damage locations for each of the 4 damage cases respectively the 4 different single damage locations for case 1 are shown in fig 5 the damage severities of the 4 full pls are 2 3 4 and 5 respectively similarly fig 6 demonstrates the 4 single damage locations for case 2 with damage severities from 2 to 5 respectively fig 7 illustrates the 4 multi damage scenarios with different damage severities for case 3 e g the damage severities for the first damage scenario are 5 for full pl 2 for full tb and 3 for full sb in addition the damage case on elements a quarter of the full member is clarified in fig 8 and table 2 the location of axial strain response data acquisition related to 5 scenarios of each of 4 damage cases are fixed and above the sea level see fig 9 it is found that there are 4 data collection locations on tbs and 4 data collection locations on pls fig 10 shows the axial strain response data obtained from the eighth point in fig 9 for the 5 scenarios in case 1 under the regular wave significant difference of these time domain data can be found between 5 damage severity and other scenarios however the difference among scenarios of intact and damage severity less than 5 is slight in order to eliminate the influence of singular samples on the data it is necessary to standardize the data eq 8 shows the standardized method 8 d s d o r i g i n a l d o r i g i n a l σ d o r i g i n a l where d o r i g i n a l is the original data d o r i g i n a l is the mean value of the original data σ d o r i g i n a l is the standard deviation of the original data and d s is the standardized data 3 2 1 construction of cnn as illustrated in fig 11 one dimensional cnn includes two steps training stage and testing stage in the training stage the model parameters of the neural network are updated by reducing the difference between the predicted and the true location label in other words minimizing the extreme value of the loss function about the model parameters on the other hand in the testing stage the unused data are put into the updated trained neural network and the effectiveness of this method will be judged by testing the prediction ability of the neural network to these data the configuration of the cnn proposed in this study is shown in fig 1 the cnn consists of four convolutional layers four max pooling layers two flat layers and one softmax layer the details of the cnn architecture including the input size output size kernel number kernel size etc of each layer are shown in table 3 additionally the batch size is set to 65 and the sequence length is set to 128 in this numerical study during the training process of the cnn the adam s algorithm is used with learning rate of 0 001 exponential decay rate for the first moment estimates of 0 9 exponential decay rate for the second moment estimates of 0 999 and small constant for numerical stability of 10 8 for each of 4 damage cases there are 5 scenarios including one intact and four different damage positions in each scenario the strain response data are collected from 8 positions as shown in fig 9 data length obtained from each position is 128 s and sampling frequency is 100 hz hence the dimension of data set of each scenario is 8 128 100 and then the dimension of whole data set of 5 scenarios in one damage case is 5 8 128 100 in other words there are a total of 1000 data sets and the size of each data set input is 64 8 which is also shown in fig 1 in this study 75 of the total data sets 750 data sets after random recombination are used as the training sets 10 of the training sets 75 data sets as the validation sets and 25 of the total data sets 250 data sets as the test sets as cnn is a supervised learning method each datum used needs to be marked table 4 lists the labels for intact and damaged components of the structure related to 4 damage cases the intact structure for all the 4 damage cases are marked as 1 and the four damage locations of each case see figs 5 8 are marked as 2 3 4 and 5 respectively furthermore fig 12 illustrates the convergence history of the accuracy and loss function for the training and testing after 200 epochs of case 1 it is found that the accuracy and the loss value of the trained and tested network are both converged and stable even after 25 epochs the total training and testing process time with the epoch of 200 is 14 63 s note that the configuration of the computer used is cpu intel core i7 8750h with 16 gb of memory capacity and 1 tb samsung hard disk the system environment is windows 64 bit version 10 python 3 7 in later analysis the cnn is trained and tested for all the 4 damage cases with 200 epochs 3 2 2 results of the damage localization table 5 shows that the total predicted accuracy of cnn for intact and four damage locations on full pls is 98 4 two of which is 100 in addition one can find that only 1 sample is mistakenly identified among 50 samples for actual label 1 and label 5 respectively and 2 samples are mistakenly identified for actual label 3 table 6 shows the total prediction accuracy of damage location on full tbs can reach 99 2 and there are only 2 false prediction for actual label 3 at the same time when the platform is damaged in multiple sections it can be seen from table 7 that the total prediction accuracy is 100 the results demonstrate that cnn method has very good performances on damage detection and localization for full members of the platform even though the damage is very minor no matter single damage location or multiple damage locations furthermore the prediction accuracy of multiple damage locations on elements a quarter of full member of the structure are listed in table 8 it is found that the total prediction accuracy is 88 8 less than that of case 3 however the result is reasonable and not bad considering the multiple damage is very minor and localized 3 2 3 damage localization under noise condition in order to investigate the performance of the one dimensional cnn for damage localization under noise condition the total damage identification accuracy for case 1 i e very minor damage are compared under 0 10 and 20 noise levels respectively the noisy data is simulated as 9 d n o i s y d o r i g i n a l 1 ε r where d n o i s y is the noisy data d o r i g i n a l is the raw data ε is noise level r is gaussian white noise with mean of 0 and variance of 1 additionally the case of 4 full pls with damage severity of all 5 i e minor damage is also considered for comparison from table 9 it is found that the prediction accuracy of the cnn decreases with the increase of noise level for both of the two damage cases for the very minor damage case the prediction accuracy is 55 3 under the noise level 10 in contrast for the minor damage case the prediction accuracy is still higher than 90 when the noise level is 10 that means the cnn has better performance of noise resistance with the increase of damage severity however the effect of big noise level on the prediction accuracy is great in order to enhance the capability of feature extraction and noise immunity of cnn the data preprocessing procedure based on convolution and deconvolution for noisy data is introduced the flowchart of the data preprocessing for case 1 is illustrated in fig 13 the noisy data is simulated by adding noise to the raw data collected from 8 data collection channels for each of 5 scenarios the convolution and deconvolution procedure with leaky relu activation function and adam optimization for noisy data is then conducted respectively the convolution and deconvolution kernels can be optimized with the goal to minimize the difference between the noisy and reconstructed signals after that the new data set with the same dimension as the raw data set can be obtained and is then input into the one dimensional cnn see fig 1 for damage localization the obtained data from channel 8 with 20 noise level related to 5 scenarios is shown in fig 14 a from which one cannot identify the difference of the noisy signals clearly however fig 14 b shows very significant difference among the signals of the 5 scenarios after data preprocessing that indicates the data preprocessing procedure could improve the capability of feature extraction and noise immunity of the one dimensional cnn based on the new data set as expected the total prediction accuracy for both of the two damage cases under different noise levels is all 100 see table 10 note that each signal related to the 5 scenarios after data preprocessing is not the constant value but with small amplitude 3 3 damage localization for minor damage under a random wave in this section the damage localization for multiple damage i e case 3 and case 4 of the platform under a random wave excitation in y direction are studied fig 15 shows the axial strain response data obtained from the eighth point in fig 9 for the 5 scenarios in case 3 under the random wave there are significant difference among the time domain data of these scenarios except for the damage scenarios of 1 2 and 3 the performances of cnn method for damage localization for case 3 and 4 under a random wave excitation is shown in tables 11 and 12 respectively it can be seen from table 11 that the total predicted accuracy of damage location on multiple members is 100 table 12 shows the total prediction accuracy of damage location on multiple elements is 60 4 compared with the results under a regular wave excitation in tables 7 and 8 it is found that the cnn method has a very good ability of damage localization for full members of the structure however the results are not satisfied for very minor multiple damage locations on local elements especially under a random wave excitation the cnn method for damage localization under a random wave excitation based on noisy data with and without data preprocessing are also conducted respectively fig 16 a shows the obtained data from the eighth point with 10 noise level related to 5 scenarios in case 3 and their difference is not obvious fig 16 b shows the signals of the 5 scenarios after data preprocessing with significant difference in amplitude the total prediction accuracy of cnn based on 10 noise data is 85 2 see table 13 in comparison with 100 based on new data set after data preprocessing see table 14 3 4 damage severity identification in this section different damage severities are simulated for the case of different damage locations on full members pl tb sb and their random combination see fig 17 under the regular wave excitation in x direction and the random wave excitation in y direction respectively without loss of generality the damage severity is randomly created in range of 0 50 at 1 interval note that the location of the axial strain response data acquisition for this case are same as that illustrated in fig 9 for the regression problem the leaky relu is employed to be the activation function and mean square error is utilized as the loss function in this section table 15 lists 5 cases of damage severity identification under a regular wave excitation including 2 single damage cases 2 two damage cases and 1 triple damage case results show the identification error is very small with the maximum error 3 6 and the minimum error 0 meanwhile the results of damage severity identification under a random wave excitation for 5 cases i e 1 single damage case 1 two damage case and 3 triple damage cases are listed in table 16 with the maximum error 6 0 and the minimum error 0 note that both of the case 5 in tables 15 and 16 are minor and close damage severities cases the results indicate that the one dimensional cnn method has a good performance of damage severity identification even for the minor and close damage severities in what follows the performance of cnn method for damage severity identification under a random wave excitation based on 20 noise level data with and without data preprocessing are also demonstrated respectively the results of the damage severity identification for 5 cases same as cases in table 16 are listed in table 17 it is found that the maximum error is 117 5 for the identification of case 5 using cnn with noisy data however the error is very small for the identification using cnn with data preprocessing based on convolution and deconvolution for noisy data no more than 4 4 experimental study to verify the effectiveness of the one dimensional cnn method for damage identification in practical application the experimental study of a jacket type offshore platform model is carried out the scaled model is inserted into a sand bucket which is fixed on the shaking table see fig 18 a total of 20 strain gauges connected in a half bridge manner i e 10 groups are pasted on 10 members of the model such as tbs sbs and pls see fig 19 the major and minor damage of the members of the structure are simulated in this study respectively the major damage means the member is completely disconnected which is simulated by unscrewing all the bolts and removing a small section of the member as shown in fig 19 while the minor damage of a member is simulated by unscrewing several bolts on it but the member and the section are still in contact three damage locations on a tb a sb and a pl respectively are applied to simulate the major and minor damage cases as the measured data is inevitably contaminated by noise in the lab or field test the data preprocessing method based on convolution and deconvolution for the measured signals is firstly employed in this study after that the one dimensional cnn method for damage identification of the model is implemented based on the processed data 4 1 major damage cases under a sinusoidal excitation major damage cases including an intact 3 single damage locations and 3 multiple damage locations cases are listed in table 18 a sinusoidal excitation with the amplitude 10 mm and the period 1 s is applied to the model by the shaking table the strain response signals with sampling frequency 1024 hz and sampling time 60 s are collected by the dynamic data acquisition system of utekacqu with 10 channels fig 20 shows the collected data from channel 9 under damage cases 1 and 7 respectively it is seen that the amplitude of signals in case 7 three damage locations is larger than that in case 1 intact as expected in each of 7 damage cases the strain response data are collected from 10 channels as shown in fig 19 the data preprocessing procedure for signals measured from each channel is conducted and the processed data set with the same dimension as the original data set is obtained and then input into the one dimensional cnn for damage localization as the signal length obtained from each channel is 60 s with the sampling frequency 1024 hz the dimension of data set of each damage case is 10 60 1024 and then the dimension of whole data set of 7 damage cases is 7 10 60 1024 that means a total of 3360 data sets can be constructed and the size of each data set is 128 10 in the cnn model 70 of the total data sets 2352 data sets after random recombination are used as the training sets 10 of the training sets 236 data sets as the validation sets and 30 of the total data sets 1008 data sets as the test sets table 18 lists the labels for intact and different damaged members of the structure related to 7 major damage cases respectively the damage localization results is shown in table 19 it is found that the prediction accuracy of each case is 100 no matter for intact single damage location or multiple damage locations case 4 2 minor damage cases under a white noise excitation minor damage cases under a white noise excitation including an intact a single damage location and two multiple damage locations cases are listed in table 20 a white noise excitation with mean 0 and variance 1 is applied to the model by the shaking table the strain response signals with sampling frequency 1024 hz and sampling time 60 s are collected from 10 channels by the dynamic data acquisition system in each of 4 cases fig 21 shows the collected data from channel 9 under damage cases 1 and 3 respectively it is seen that the amplitude of signals in case 3 two damage locations is significantly different from that in case 1 intact as expected after the data preprocessing procedure for signals measured from each channel is conducted the new data set is input into the one dimensional cnn for damage localization a total of 1920 data sets is constructed in the cnn model and the size of each data set is 128 10 similarly 70 of the total data sets 1344 data sets after random recombination are used as the training sets 10 of the training sets 135 data sets as the validation sets and 30 of the total data sets 576 data sets as the test sets table 21 shows perfect performance prediction accuracy 99 8 of cnn for damage localization for the minor damage cases under a white noise excitation 4 3 minor damage cases under an impulse excitation minor damage cases under an impulse excitation including an intact a single damage location and a multiple damage locations cases are listed in table 22 an impulse excitation about 30 n is applied by an impact hammer to the center of top deck of the model in the normal direction to the motion of the shaking table in section 4 1 the strain response signals with sampling frequency 1024 hz and sampling length 25 s are collected from 10 channels by the dynamic data acquisition system in each of 3 cases fig 22 shows the measured data from channel 5 under different damage cases respectively it is seen that the amplitude of strain response data of case 3 is the largest and that of case 1 is the smallest as expected due to the signals attenuate quickly only the big strain response amplitude of each of the 3 cases about 1 s i e from the beginning of the excitation to signal attenuation to nearly zero are applied to implement the damage identification a total of 96 data sets is constructed in the cnn model and the size of each data set is 32 10 similarly 70 of the total data sets 67 data sets after random recombination are used as the training sets 10 of the training sets 7 data sets as the validation sets and 30 of the total data sets 29 data sets as the test sets table 23 shows the damage localization results for the minor damage cases it is found that the prediction accuracy of each case is 100 that indicates the one dimensional cnn method can be applied to identify the damage locations of a jacket type offshore platform effectively even the damage is minor and the data sets are small it should be mentioned that the one dimensional cnn method for damage localization of the jacket type offshore platform model under above 3 kinds of excitation without data preprocessing are also carried out respectively the results are also promising with high prediction accuracy more than 98 which are not presented here for lack of space the reason of the perfect performance of cnn using directly the raw measured data may be that the noise in the measurement environment is small take fig 22 for example the curve is smooth and to some extent the cnn has good noise robustness 5 conclusions this paper presents a one dimensional cnn method for vibration based structural damage identification this method can learn the extraction of damage sensitive features automatically from the raw strain response data without requiring any hand crafted feature extraction the data preprocessing procedure based on convolution and deconvolution is proposed to improve the capability of feature extraction of cnn under noise condition the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by numerical and experimental studies of jacket type offshore platforms the conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the cnn method reaches a very high performance level in identifying and localizing the damage for no matter the single or the multiple full member damage scenarios the total damage prediction accuracy is more than 98 under a regular or a random wave excitation in the numerical study even though the damage severity is very minor 2 5 however the minor multiple damage on local elements a quarter of the full member of the structure is difficult to localize using the cnn method with accuracy 88 8 under a regular wave excitation and 60 4 under a random wave excitation 2 the damage severity can also be properly estimated by the proposed one dimensional cnn method using a linear regression model which is verified through the numerical cases of different damage locations on full members under a regular wave excitation and a random wave excitation respectively results show that the identified damage severities agree well with the actual damage severities even if the minor and close damage severities occurs 3 the proposed data preprocessing procedure can significantly enhance the capability of feature extraction and noise immunity of the one dimensional cnn based on the processed data set the total damage localization accuracy of cnn with data preprocessing is 100 for signals under even 20 noise condition in the numerical study and also almost 100 in the experimental study for major damage cases under a sinusoidal excitation minor damage cases under a white noise excitation and an impulse excitation respectively in addition the damage severity identification of cnn with data preprocessing is also remarkably improved with errors no more than 4 in comparison with maximum error 117 5 based on 20 noise level data 4 this study inspires us that the proposed method combined with some types of embedded and distributed strain measurement system and wireless sensor network could provide a promising application in real time structural health monitoring of offshore structures it should be noted that the cnn method relies on the category of the training set and it is expensive or even impossible to construct all encompassing training set in real scenarios which is still a problem to be solved in the future the structure members which are important and prone to external damage under the operation conditions could be the priority in the training set construction additionally it is significant to utilize the industrial big data to develop more robust and reliable deep networks credit authorship contribution statement xingxian bao conceptualization methodology

21246,vibration based damage detection techniques play an important role in health monitoring of offshore structures this study explores the possibility to use the one dimensional convolutional neural network cnn to extract the damage sensitive features automatically from the raw strain response data of a structure under a certain excitation without requiring any hand crafted feature extraction the validity of the proposed method is verified by using a numerical simulation of a jacket type offshore platform under a regular and a random wave excitations in different directions respectively the damage localization and damage severity identification are conducted with considering several damage cases including different damage locations and the effect of noise the data preprocessing procedure based on convolution and deconvolution for noisy data is proposed to enhance the capability of feature extraction and noise immunity of cnn furthermore the experimental studies of a jacket type offshore platform model subjected to a sinusoidal excitation a white noise excitation and an impulse excitation are respectively investigated to check the applicability of the method in which the major damage and minor damage on single and multiple locations are involved results indicate this approach has an excellent performance on structural damage detection keywords damage localization damage severity convolutional neural network deconvolution jacket type offshore platform 1 introduction due to the complex marine environments and human factors the offshore platforms will inevitably be damaged during their service life and the structural health monitoring especially vibration based damage detection technique has a vital role to play in ensuring the safety of marine operations and the integrity management of offshore structures mojtahedi et al 2011 wang et al 2018 liu et al 2014 a vibration based damage detection method is a global method which aims to identify the presence location and severity of the damages of the monitored structure by translating its measured vibration response into damage indicators vibration based damage detection techniques can be categorized as parametric and nonparametric methods abdeljaber et al 2017 in parametric methods modal identification algorithms are applied to determine the modal parameters such as natural frequencies and modal shapes from the measured vibration response with respect to the intact and damaged structures then the changes of modal parameters and their derivatives are usually applied to obtain the damage sensitive features over the last few decades significant progress has been achieved in the parametric methods many approaches based on modal frequency modal shape and their derivatives changes have been developed to solve issues in different structures from basic structures such as beams and plates to complex structures such as bridges and offshore platforms cao et al 2014 shi et al 2000 hu et al 2007 ren et al 2008 vo duy et al 2016 kaveh and zolghadr 2015 hosseinlou et al 2017 detailed review about these techniques can be found in refs li 2010 fan and qiao 2011 among these techniques modal strain energy based methods which are the derivatives of mode shapes have been widely used for damage identification of offshore structures in recent years liu et al 2014 b adopted an improved modal strain energy method by defining stiffness correction factors for damage localization of jacket type offshore wind turbines liu et al 2017 used grouping modal strain energy to detect structural damage of offshore platforms based on incomplete modal information wang and xu 2019 presented a review of the modal strain energy related damage identification methods and then comparative studies for offshore platforms were carried out with four typical methods nevertheless there are still some challenging problems for these parametric methods in application such as incomplete modal data measurement noise and ill conditioned systems of linear equations li et al 2008 bao and shi 2019 bao et al 2020 wang et al 2019 on the other hand nonparametric also called signal based approaches aim to extract damage sensitive features directly from the measured signals instead of requiring modal parameters of the structure abdeljaber et al 2017 lin et al 2017 almost all of these signal based methods relies on modern signal processing or statistics cavadas et al 2013 detected damage by statistical features using a data driven method on moving load responses amezquita sanchez and adeli 2016 presented a review of some signal processing techniques for damage detection of civil structures blachowski et al 2017 used axial strain accelerations method based on simple statistical signal processing for measured acceleration signals to localize the damage in truss structures although the nonparametric approaches need not identify modal parameters or solve any global optimization problems the biggest challenge of these methods is to efficiently handle the large and noisy data measured from many sensors on an online structural health monitoring basis however most of machine learning methods can provide a way to solve such problem because of their strong redundancy and fault tolerance in recent years machine learning methods for damage detection have developed the wide range of the signal based approaches and also increasingly attracted attention especially the technology represented by neural networks has played an important role in structural damage recognition during the past few years great effort has been made in the researchers within the neural networks based structural damage detection methods wu et al 2010 proposed a decentralized parametric identification method for sub structure damage identification by using neural networks based on the displacement velocity and the restoring force of the sub structures azam et al 2019 adopted a supervised learning strategy for structural damage detection using artificial neural networks and proper orthogonal decomposition method which was validated by a finite element model of truss bridge gu et al 2017 used artificial neural networks to identify damage location and severity of a simply supported beam considering varying temperature these studies showed that the conventional neural networks methods can provide good performances on identifying the structural damage however these methods are easily affected by the noise in the input data and are also time consuming for solving complicated problems with multiple hidden layers truong et al 2020 nowadays deep learning has been widely used in computer vision sohn et al 2011 speech recognition bengio et al 2013 and image processing andreas et al 2019 and has achieved satisfactory results deep learning algorithms have good pattern classification and generalization capabilities and have great potential applications in structural damage recognition compared with ordinary neural networks and support vector machines deep learning has great advantages in terms of classification capabilities and efficiency in processing data as a type of deep learning algorithms convolutional neural network cnn is an end to end learning method model using gradient descent algorithm to get the parameters of the model so that the network has the ability to extract model features avoiding the complicated feature extraction process in conventional machine learning methods generally the typical deep neural network directly uses the traditional supervised learning training algorithm for direct training and the calculation cost is relatively large while the cnn reduces the training parameters involved in the network reduces the complexity of the model through weight sharing and has a good generalization ability bengio 2009 at present cnn has practically made great breakthrough in speech recognition computer vision and object detection with two dimensional data input lecun et al 2015 mohamed et al 2012 goodfellow et al 2015 more recently cnn has been applied into the field of structural damage detection for example abdeljaber et al 2017 used cnn to perform vibration based damage detection on a grandstand simulator plane frame structure and results showed excellent performances of the method levent et al 2019 applied a compact adaptive one dimensional cnn to study the performance of a universal real time fault diagnosis system for inductive bearing lin et al 2017 designed a deep cnn to detect the damage position of a simply supported beam and the visualization of the hidden layers was carried out to help one understand how the network works truong et al 2020 used a deep feedforward neural networks dfnn to predict the damage position and severity of truss structures based on noisy incomplete modal data results showed good performance of the dfnn method in damage detection liu and zhang 2019 adopted image driven cnn method for inspection of structural fuse member damage condition case studies of a perforated steel shear link beam and a dogbone steel plate specimen indicated the effectiveness of the method xu et al 2019 applied a modified faster region based cnn for automatically identifying and localizing the multi type seismic damage of reinforced concrete columns on the basis of four hundred postearthquake damaged structural images zhang et al 2019 adopted one dimensional cnn to perfectly identify tiny local structural stiffness and mass changes for t shaped steel beam a short steel girder bridge and a long steel girder bridge respectively based on acceleration data however only single damage location for each case is considered without validating the cnn on multiple damages detection on different planes khodabandehlou et al 2019 used two dimensional deep cnn to successfully predict predefined damage states of a reinforced concrete highway bridge model based on acceleration response data obtained from the shake table testing however the cnn methods for damage identification reported in the literatures almost works for simple structures or simple damage cases and many of them are based on two dimensional image data so far there have been few applications of cnn for multiple damage identification of three dimensional complex structures based on one dimensional raw time series data in this paper cnn is briefly introduced firstly and a one dimensional cnn model is then established to identify the damage locations and severities of a numerical three dimensional jacket type offshore platform several damage cases including single and multiple damage locations and different levels of noise and damage severities under a regular and a random wave excitations in different directions are considered respectively in order to enhance the capability of feature extraction and noise immunity of cnn the data preprocessing procedure based on convolution and deconvolution for noisy data is introduced furthermore the experimental studies of a jacket type offshore platform model under a sinusoidal excitation a white noise excitation and an impulse excitation are respectively conducted to evaluate the performance of the one dimensional cnn for structural damage detection method in which the major damage and minor damage on single and multiple locations are involved 2 brief introduction of cnn the structure diagram of one dimensional cnn used in this paper is illustrated in fig 1 which mainly includes a series of convolutional layers and pooling layers and a fully connected dense layer in the end the convolutional layer uses several convolution kernels to provide the distinctive feature outputs then the pooling layer follows the convolutional layer and reduces the dimension of feature map which can improve the computation efficiency finally the fully connected layer displays the extracted features in the form of probability nonlinear activation function is used to enhance the fitting ability of the model and dropout operation is used to avoid over fitting in which the keep prob is usually set to 0 5 the main components of cnn is introduced briefly in the following sections and more details can be found in ciresan et al 2010 2 1 convolutional layer convolutional layer uses convolutional kernels to convolute the local area of the input signal or feature and generate the corresponding feature apart from the application background of cnn convolution refers to the weighted superposition of one function and another function on one dimension in cnn the simple diagram of convolution is shown in fig 2 the input of cnn in this study is time series value o i is the output of the convolutional layer i which can be expressed as 1 o i f o i 1 w i b where o i 1 is the output of the convolutional layer i 1 w i is the weight of convolutional layer i b is the offset vector and f is the activation function 2 2 pooling layer the pooling layer also known as the sampling layer is usually divided into the upsampling layer and the subsampling layer in the application of two dimensional image processing both the upsampling layer and the subsampling layer are usually used however in the one dimensional time series processing in this study only the subsampling layer is needed which is briefly introduced as follows the subsampling layer mainly includes the maximum pooling layer and average pooling layer the main function of the subsampling layer is to reduce the dimension of the feature map and reduce the risk of over fitting during the model training the subsampling layer generally follows the convolutional layer which can be expressed as 2 p i f d o w n o i a i where d o w n is subsampling function and a i is bias vector of sampling layer i 2 3 activation function in the neural network in order to learn the complex mapping relationship the activation function needs to be applied to transform the output of the upper layer nonlinearly there have been four main activation functions such as sigmoid tanh relu and leaky relu up to now recently the relu glorot et al 2011 and leaky relu maas et al 2013 activation functions have been widely used the form of relu is shown in eq 3 and fig 3 a compared with sigmoid and tanh functions relu function has no problem of the gradient disappearance in the positive direction of x axis in addition the convergence speed of neural network training using relu function is much faster than that using sigmoid and tanh functions krizhevsky et al 2012 however the problem of gradient disappearance still exists in the negative direction of x axis in view of these possible problems in order to speed up convergence and avoid gradient disappearance leaky relu function is designed which is illustrated in eq 4 and fig 3 b with α 0 1 for clarity however α 0 01 is highly applied now which is also adopted in this paper 3 relu x x x 0 0 x 0 4 leaky relu x x x 0 α x α 0 01 x 0 2 4 fully connected dense layer the fully connected layer plays the role of classifier in the cnn it uses the convolutional layer pooling layer and other operations to map the learned feature representations to the labeled space of the sample after the fully connected operation softmax function will then be used to get the probability distribution for each class label the form of softmax function is as follows 5 softmax y i e y i i 1 n e y i where y i i 1 2 n is the output of the fully connected layer n is the number of class labels 2 5 objective function for a classification problem cross entropy is used as the objective function to evaluate the difference between the correct value and the predicted value given two probability distributions p and q the cross entropy h p q is as follows 6 h p q x p x log q x where x is the index of the label vector used in this paper p represents the correct label vector and q represents the predicted value cross entropy describes the distance between two probability distributions p and q or it can be said that it describes the difficulty of expressing probability distribution p through probability distribution q the smaller the cross entropy is the stronger the predictive ability of the model is that is to say the better the generalization ability of the model is for a linear regression problem mean square error is most popularly utilized as the objective function to judge the precision of the prediction results the mean square error is expressed as follows 7 m s e 1 m k 1 m z k z k 2 where m is the number of samples z k is the correct value and z k is the predicted value in order to minimize the output value of the objective function adam s small batch random gradient descent algorithm kingma and ba 2014 is used in this paper 3 numerical simulation 3 1 description of the jacket type offshore platform the jacket type offshore platform model established by ansys software is shown in fig 4 the superstructure is equivalent to four mass points each of which is 70 000 kg the layer spacing between the upper and lower layers of the offshore platform from top to bottom is 8 m 10 m 10 m 10 m 10 m and 5 m respectively the specific dimensions of each part of the model are listed in table 1 the mass density of the structure is 7850 kg m3 poisson s ratio is 0 3 and the young s modulus is 210 gpa the water depth is 40 m and water density is 1025 kg m3 in the real operation of the offshore platform the components near the sea level are vulnerable to ship collision and corrosion so they are selected to simulate the damage locations in this study i e the components between the second and third layer of the structure assuming that the offshore platform is excited by two kinds of wave one is a regular wave with wave height of 8 m and period of 7 4 s from x direction and the other is a random wave simulated by superimposing 10 different regular wave components in pipe59 water motion table in ansys from y direction the axial strain response data of certain components related to the intact and damaged offshore platforms under the two kinds of wave are collected respectively in this study the damage of one component is simulated by reducing the young s modulus of the component the damage detection of the platform under a regular wave in x direction and a random wave in y direction are conducted respectively 3 2 damage localization for minor damage under a regular wave all the damage severities simulated are very minor from 2 to 5 4 damage cases are considered in this section including 3 cases for the full members and 1 case for multiple elements of a pile leg pl a transverse brace tb and a slanted brace sb which are listed in table 2 it is noted that there are 5 scenarios i e one intact and four different damage locations for each of the 4 damage cases respectively the 4 different single damage locations for case 1 are shown in fig 5 the damage severities of the 4 full pls are 2 3 4 and 5 respectively similarly fig 6 demonstrates the 4 single damage locations for case 2 with damage severities from 2 to 5 respectively fig 7 illustrates the 4 multi damage scenarios with different damage severities for case 3 e g the damage severities for the first damage scenario are 5 for full pl 2 for full tb and 3 for full sb in addition the damage case on elements a quarter of the full member is clarified in fig 8 and table 2 the location of axial strain response data acquisition related to 5 scenarios of each of 4 damage cases are fixed and above the sea level see fig 9 it is found that there are 4 data collection locations on tbs and 4 data collection locations on pls fig 10 shows the axial strain response data obtained from the eighth point in fig 9 for the 5 scenarios in case 1 under the regular wave significant difference of these time domain data can be found between 5 damage severity and other scenarios however the difference among scenarios of intact and damage severity less than 5 is slight in order to eliminate the influence of singular samples on the data it is necessary to standardize the data eq 8 shows the standardized method 8 d s d o r i g i n a l d o r i g i n a l σ d o r i g i n a l where d o r i g i n a l is the original data d o r i g i n a l is the mean value of the original data σ d o r i g i n a l is the standard deviation of the original data and d s is the standardized data 3 2 1 construction of cnn as illustrated in fig 11 one dimensional cnn includes two steps training stage and testing stage in the training stage the model parameters of the neural network are updated by reducing the difference between the predicted and the true location label in other words minimizing the extreme value of the loss function about the model parameters on the other hand in the testing stage the unused data are put into the updated trained neural network and the effectiveness of this method will be judged by testing the prediction ability of the neural network to these data the configuration of the cnn proposed in this study is shown in fig 1 the cnn consists of four convolutional layers four max pooling layers two flat layers and one softmax layer the details of the cnn architecture including the input size output size kernel number kernel size etc of each layer are shown in table 3 additionally the batch size is set to 65 and the sequence length is set to 128 in this numerical study during the training process of the cnn the adam s algorithm is used with learning rate of 0 001 exponential decay rate for the first moment estimates of 0 9 exponential decay rate for the second moment estimates of 0 999 and small constant for numerical stability of 10 8 for each of 4 damage cases there are 5 scenarios including one intact and four different damage positions in each scenario the strain response data are collected from 8 positions as shown in fig 9 data length obtained from each position is 128 s and sampling frequency is 100 hz hence the dimension of data set of each scenario is 8 128 100 and then the dimension of whole data set of 5 scenarios in one damage case is 5 8 128 100 in other words there are a total of 1000 data sets and the size of each data set input is 64 8 which is also shown in fig 1 in this study 75 of the total data sets 750 data sets after random recombination are used as the training sets 10 of the training sets 75 data sets as the validation sets and 25 of the total data sets 250 data sets as the test sets as cnn is a supervised learning method each datum used needs to be marked table 4 lists the labels for intact and damaged components of the structure related to 4 damage cases the intact structure for all the 4 damage cases are marked as 1 and the four damage locations of each case see figs 5 8 are marked as 2 3 4 and 5 respectively furthermore fig 12 illustrates the convergence history of the accuracy and loss function for the training and testing after 200 epochs of case 1 it is found that the accuracy and the loss value of the trained and tested network are both converged and stable even after 25 epochs the total training and testing process time with the epoch of 200 is 14 63 s note that the configuration of the computer used is cpu intel core i7 8750h with 16 gb of memory capacity and 1 tb samsung hard disk the system environment is windows 64 bit version 10 python 3 7 in later analysis the cnn is trained and tested for all the 4 damage cases with 200 epochs 3 2 2 results of the damage localization table 5 shows that the total predicted accuracy of cnn for intact and four damage locations on full pls is 98 4 two of which is 100 in addition one can find that only 1 sample is mistakenly identified among 50 samples for actual label 1 and label 5 respectively and 2 samples are mistakenly identified for actual label 3 table 6 shows the total prediction accuracy of damage location on full tbs can reach 99 2 and there are only 2 false prediction for actual label 3 at the same time when the platform is damaged in multiple sections it can be seen from table 7 that the total prediction accuracy is 100 the results demonstrate that cnn method has very good performances on damage detection and localization for full members of the platform even though the damage is very minor no matter single damage location or multiple damage locations furthermore the prediction accuracy of multiple damage locations on elements a quarter of full member of the structure are listed in table 8 it is found that the total prediction accuracy is 88 8 less than that of case 3 however the result is reasonable and not bad considering the multiple damage is very minor and localized 3 2 3 damage localization under noise condition in order to investigate the performance of the one dimensional cnn for damage localization under noise condition the total damage identification accuracy for case 1 i e very minor damage are compared under 0 10 and 20 noise levels respectively the noisy data is simulated as 9 d n o i s y d o r i g i n a l 1 ε r where d n o i s y is the noisy data d o r i g i n a l is the raw data ε is noise level r is gaussian white noise with mean of 0 and variance of 1 additionally the case of 4 full pls with damage severity of all 5 i e minor damage is also considered for comparison from table 9 it is found that the prediction accuracy of the cnn decreases with the increase of noise level for both of the two damage cases for the very minor damage case the prediction accuracy is 55 3 under the noise level 10 in contrast for the minor damage case the prediction accuracy is still higher than 90 when the noise level is 10 that means the cnn has better performance of noise resistance with the increase of damage severity however the effect of big noise level on the prediction accuracy is great in order to enhance the capability of feature extraction and noise immunity of cnn the data preprocessing procedure based on convolution and deconvolution for noisy data is introduced the flowchart of the data preprocessing for case 1 is illustrated in fig 13 the noisy data is simulated by adding noise to the raw data collected from 8 data collection channels for each of 5 scenarios the convolution and deconvolution procedure with leaky relu activation function and adam optimization for noisy data is then conducted respectively the convolution and deconvolution kernels can be optimized with the goal to minimize the difference between the noisy and reconstructed signals after that the new data set with the same dimension as the raw data set can be obtained and is then input into the one dimensional cnn see fig 1 for damage localization the obtained data from channel 8 with 20 noise level related to 5 scenarios is shown in fig 14 a from which one cannot identify the difference of the noisy signals clearly however fig 14 b shows very significant difference among the signals of the 5 scenarios after data preprocessing that indicates the data preprocessing procedure could improve the capability of feature extraction and noise immunity of the one dimensional cnn based on the new data set as expected the total prediction accuracy for both of the two damage cases under different noise levels is all 100 see table 10 note that each signal related to the 5 scenarios after data preprocessing is not the constant value but with small amplitude 3 3 damage localization for minor damage under a random wave in this section the damage localization for multiple damage i e case 3 and case 4 of the platform under a random wave excitation in y direction are studied fig 15 shows the axial strain response data obtained from the eighth point in fig 9 for the 5 scenarios in case 3 under the random wave there are significant difference among the time domain data of these scenarios except for the damage scenarios of 1 2 and 3 the performances of cnn method for damage localization for case 3 and 4 under a random wave excitation is shown in tables 11 and 12 respectively it can be seen from table 11 that the total predicted accuracy of damage location on multiple members is 100 table 12 shows the total prediction accuracy of damage location on multiple elements is 60 4 compared with the results under a regular wave excitation in tables 7 and 8 it is found that the cnn method has a very good ability of damage localization for full members of the structure however the results are not satisfied for very minor multiple damage locations on local elements especially under a random wave excitation the cnn method for damage localization under a random wave excitation based on noisy data with and without data preprocessing are also conducted respectively fig 16 a shows the obtained data from the eighth point with 10 noise level related to 5 scenarios in case 3 and their difference is not obvious fig 16 b shows the signals of the 5 scenarios after data preprocessing with significant difference in amplitude the total prediction accuracy of cnn based on 10 noise data is 85 2 see table 13 in comparison with 100 based on new data set after data preprocessing see table 14 3 4 damage severity identification in this section different damage severities are simulated for the case of different damage locations on full members pl tb sb and their random combination see fig 17 under the regular wave excitation in x direction and the random wave excitation in y direction respectively without loss of generality the damage severity is randomly created in range of 0 50 at 1 interval note that the location of the axial strain response data acquisition for this case are same as that illustrated in fig 9 for the regression problem the leaky relu is employed to be the activation function and mean square error is utilized as the loss function in this section table 15 lists 5 cases of damage severity identification under a regular wave excitation including 2 single damage cases 2 two damage cases and 1 triple damage case results show the identification error is very small with the maximum error 3 6 and the minimum error 0 meanwhile the results of damage severity identification under a random wave excitation for 5 cases i e 1 single damage case 1 two damage case and 3 triple damage cases are listed in table 16 with the maximum error 6 0 and the minimum error 0 note that both of the case 5 in tables 15 and 16 are minor and close damage severities cases the results indicate that the one dimensional cnn method has a good performance of damage severity identification even for the minor and close damage severities in what follows the performance of cnn method for damage severity identification under a random wave excitation based on 20 noise level data with and without data preprocessing are also demonstrated respectively the results of the damage severity identification for 5 cases same as cases in table 16 are listed in table 17 it is found that the maximum error is 117 5 for the identification of case 5 using cnn with noisy data however the error is very small for the identification using cnn with data preprocessing based on convolution and deconvolution for noisy data no more than 4 4 experimental study to verify the effectiveness of the one dimensional cnn method for damage identification in practical application the experimental study of a jacket type offshore platform model is carried out the scaled model is inserted into a sand bucket which is fixed on the shaking table see fig 18 a total of 20 strain gauges connected in a half bridge manner i e 10 groups are pasted on 10 members of the model such as tbs sbs and pls see fig 19 the major and minor damage of the members of the structure are simulated in this study respectively the major damage means the member is completely disconnected which is simulated by unscrewing all the bolts and removing a small section of the member as shown in fig 19 while the minor damage of a member is simulated by unscrewing several bolts on it but the member and the section are still in contact three damage locations on a tb a sb and a pl respectively are applied to simulate the major and minor damage cases as the measured data is inevitably contaminated by noise in the lab or field test the data preprocessing method based on convolution and deconvolution for the measured signals is firstly employed in this study after that the one dimensional cnn method for damage identification of the model is implemented based on the processed data 4 1 major damage cases under a sinusoidal excitation major damage cases including an intact 3 single damage locations and 3 multiple damage locations cases are listed in table 18 a sinusoidal excitation with the amplitude 10 mm and the period 1 s is applied to the model by the shaking table the strain response signals with sampling frequency 1024 hz and sampling time 60 s are collected by the dynamic data acquisition system of utekacqu with 10 channels fig 20 shows the collected data from channel 9 under damage cases 1 and 7 respectively it is seen that the amplitude of signals in case 7 three damage locations is larger than that in case 1 intact as expected in each of 7 damage cases the strain response data are collected from 10 channels as shown in fig 19 the data preprocessing procedure for signals measured from each channel is conducted and the processed data set with the same dimension as the original data set is obtained and then input into the one dimensional cnn for damage localization as the signal length obtained from each channel is 60 s with the sampling frequency 1024 hz the dimension of data set of each damage case is 10 60 1024 and then the dimension of whole data set of 7 damage cases is 7 10 60 1024 that means a total of 3360 data sets can be constructed and the size of each data set is 128 10 in the cnn model 70 of the total data sets 2352 data sets after random recombination are used as the training sets 10 of the training sets 236 data sets as the validation sets and 30 of the total data sets 1008 data sets as the test sets table 18 lists the labels for intact and different damaged members of the structure related to 7 major damage cases respectively the damage localization results is shown in table 19 it is found that the prediction accuracy of each case is 100 no matter for intact single damage location or multiple damage locations case 4 2 minor damage cases under a white noise excitation minor damage cases under a white noise excitation including an intact a single damage location and two multiple damage locations cases are listed in table 20 a white noise excitation with mean 0 and variance 1 is applied to the model by the shaking table the strain response signals with sampling frequency 1024 hz and sampling time 60 s are collected from 10 channels by the dynamic data acquisition system in each of 4 cases fig 21 shows the collected data from channel 9 under damage cases 1 and 3 respectively it is seen that the amplitude of signals in case 3 two damage locations is significantly different from that in case 1 intact as expected after the data preprocessing procedure for signals measured from each channel is conducted the new data set is input into the one dimensional cnn for damage localization a total of 1920 data sets is constructed in the cnn model and the size of each data set is 128 10 similarly 70 of the total data sets 1344 data sets after random recombination are used as the training sets 10 of the training sets 135 data sets as the validation sets and 30 of the total data sets 576 data sets as the test sets table 21 shows perfect performance prediction accuracy 99 8 of cnn for damage localization for the minor damage cases under a white noise excitation 4 3 minor damage cases under an impulse excitation minor damage cases under an impulse excitation including an intact a single damage location and a multiple damage locations cases are listed in table 22 an impulse excitation about 30 n is applied by an impact hammer to the center of top deck of the model in the normal direction to the motion of the shaking table in section 4 1 the strain response signals with sampling frequency 1024 hz and sampling length 25 s are collected from 10 channels by the dynamic data acquisition system in each of 3 cases fig 22 shows the measured data from channel 5 under different damage cases respectively it is seen that the amplitude of strain response data of case 3 is the largest and that of case 1 is the smallest as expected due to the signals attenuate quickly only the big strain response amplitude of each of the 3 cases about 1 s i e from the beginning of the excitation to signal attenuation to nearly zero are applied to implement the damage identification a total of 96 data sets is constructed in the cnn model and the size of each data set is 32 10 similarly 70 of the total data sets 67 data sets after random recombination are used as the training sets 10 of the training sets 7 data sets as the validation sets and 30 of the total data sets 29 data sets as the test sets table 23 shows the damage localization results for the minor damage cases it is found that the prediction accuracy of each case is 100 that indicates the one dimensional cnn method can be applied to identify the damage locations of a jacket type offshore platform effectively even the damage is minor and the data sets are small it should be mentioned that the one dimensional cnn method for damage localization of the jacket type offshore platform model under above 3 kinds of excitation without data preprocessing are also carried out respectively the results are also promising with high prediction accuracy more than 98 which are not presented here for lack of space the reason of the perfect performance of cnn using directly the raw measured data may be that the noise in the measurement environment is small take fig 22 for example the curve is smooth and to some extent the cnn has good noise robustness 5 conclusions this paper presents a one dimensional cnn method for vibration based structural damage identification this method can learn the extraction of damage sensitive features automatically from the raw strain response data without requiring any hand crafted feature extraction the data preprocessing procedure based on convolution and deconvolution is proposed to improve the capability of feature extraction of cnn under noise condition the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by numerical and experimental studies of jacket type offshore platforms the conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the cnn method reaches a very high performance level in identifying and localizing the damage for no matter the single or the multiple full member damage scenarios the total damage prediction accuracy is more than 98 under a regular or a random wave excitation in the numerical study even though the damage severity is very minor 2 5 however the minor multiple damage on local elements a quarter of the full member of the structure is difficult to localize using the cnn method with accuracy 88 8 under a regular wave excitation and 60 4 under a random wave excitation 2 the damage severity can also be properly estimated by the proposed one dimensional cnn method using a linear regression model which is verified through the numerical cases of different damage locations on full members under a regular wave excitation and a random wave excitation respectively results show that the identified damage severities agree well with the actual damage severities even if the minor and close damage severities occurs 3 the proposed data preprocessing procedure can significantly enhance the capability of feature extraction and noise immunity of the one dimensional cnn based on the processed data set the total damage localization accuracy of cnn with data preprocessing is 100 for signals under even 20 noise condition in the numerical study and also almost 100 in the experimental study for major damage cases under a sinusoidal excitation minor damage cases under a white noise excitation and an impulse excitation respectively in addition the damage severity identification of cnn with data preprocessing is also remarkably improved with errors no more than 4 in comparison with maximum error 117 5 based on 20 noise level data 4 this study inspires us that the proposed method combined with some types of embedded and distributed strain measurement system and wireless sensor network could provide a promising application in real time structural health monitoring of offshore structures it should be noted that the cnn method relies on the category of the training set and it is expensive or even impossible to construct all encompassing training set in real scenarios which is still a problem to be solved in the future the structure members which are important and prone to external damage under the operation conditions could be the priority in the training set construction

21247,since the geometrical dimensions of stiffened panels including length and thickness are very different considering fabrication the complete similarity method is generally not realistic or economic to scale thin wall models for testing the present paper aims to figure out a partial similarity method to design testing small scale models for stiffened panels which could consider the effects of buckling behaviours and dimensional distortions the partial similarity method corresponding to different collapse modes is proposed to design small scale testing models according to the principal influential parameters of plate column and torsional slenderness instead of only geometrical dimensions seven specimens were tested for assessing the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels under in plane compressive loads which are used to verify the fe modelling technology the influences of various partial similarity methods on the collapse behaviours are discussed by using experimental and numerical results the strategy of proposed partial similarity method by considering different principle parameters combinations for various collapse modes could give close results

equivalent yield stress for the stiffened panel σ u ultimate strength in the longitudinal direction m buckling number of plates 1 introduction the hull girder is generally subjected to bending moments caused by cargo weight and wave loads during voyage and operation which could cause the longitudinal compression of the stiffened panels on the deck or bottom of ship structures the load carrying capacity of stiffened panel is an important strength aspect to ensure the safety of ship structures the methods for assessing the ultimate strength of stiffened panels usually include the simple closed form formulation incremental iterative method simplified element method finite element method fem and experiment the simple closed form formulation was firstly proposed by caldwell 1965 and improved by some researchers such as zhang khan zhang and khan 2009 lin 1985 paik and thayamballi 1997 the incremental iterative method was initially introduced by smith 1977 and already adopted in csr h requirement iacs 2014 the simplified element method such as idealized structural unit method was utilized by ueda and rashed 1984 the finite element fe analyses including the implicit static analysis xu et al 2017a and explicit dynamic analysis xu et al 2017b are often adopted to calculate the ultimate strength of ship structures the experiment is also an important method to validity the theoretical method two representative experiments with full size models are the american destroyers preston and bruce kell 1931 in 1930 and the british destroyer albuera lang and warren 1952 in 1950 however due to time consuming and financial costs for full scale prototypes small scale models are frequently used in the experiments to investigate the collapse behaviours as the physical representation of actual ship structures several small scale hull girders under bending moments were tested to investigate collapse behaviours of ship structures by dowlinget al dowling et al 1976 gordo et al gordo and guedessoares 2009 saad eldeen saad eldeen et al 2011 garbatov garbatov et al 2015a and liu et al 2018 using experimental and numerical methods wang et al 2019 2020 investigated the ultimate bending moment and torsion moment of hull girder for container ships it was found that the shearing buckling of side plate is the main reason that causes the collapse of ship structures three different length of stiffened panels with short gordo and guedessoares 2008 intermediate gordo and guedessoares 2011 and long gordo and guedessoares 2012 three bays under axial compression were tested until collapse to investigate the influences of stiffener types xu et al xu and guedessoares 2013a 2013b used the experimental and numerical methods to study the influences of boundary conditions on the collapse strength of stiffened panels due to the stiffened panels belonging to thin walled structures the length and breadth of local plates are much larger than the thickness which might be unrealistic to scale models in an equal proportion for all dimensions considering manufacture thus the partial similarity methods instead of the completely geometrical similarity method are simultaneously employed in experiments a proper partial similarity method that could establish the relationships of collapse strength between the actual structures and small scale models is still a challenge sonin 2001 especially for thin wall structure because of the scaling of the stiffened panels under in plane compression might change the buckling modes and then cause that the small and full scale models have different load carrying capacities at the same time since the torsional rigidity is vital to affect the collapse behaviours of stiffeners with tripping buckling xu et al 2018 the same plate and column slenderness could not ensure that the ultimate strength are the same in some cases xu et al 2013 the closed form formulae do not include the influential parameters in tripping buckling mode which may induce unacceptably different ultimate strength between different scale models kong et al 2020 conducted the collapse test of stiffened panels under in plane compression and then discussed the influences of geometrical dimensions on the collapse behaviours however until nowadays there is very little experimental research on the similarity of stiffened panels considering buckling behaviours the present study aims to propose a reliable partial similarity method that could consider the buckling behaviours of stiffened plates during scaling models using different similarity methods seven scale specimens having various buckling modes were designed and tested under in plane compression and the corresponding results are used to verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed similarity method using tests and numerical simulation the influences of various scaling methods on the collapse behaviour of stiffened panels are investigated 2 similarity methods four kinds of similitude strategies including proposed partial similarity method are used to scale down the actual stiffened panels consisting of ship hull girder the scaling effects of different similarity methods on the buckling deformations and ultimate strength are discussed to figure out a proper similarity method that could consider the buckling modes 2 1 completely geometrical similarity method the completely geometrical similarity method keeps the equalscale ratio of length breadth and thicknessbetween the small and full scalestiffened panels the plate slenderness torsional slenderness and column slenderness of stiffened panels maintain almost the same for different scale models which could make sure that the structural mechanical behaviours between various scale models aretheoretically the same butthis similarity methodcould be adopted only for particularly dimensional combinations of stiffeners and plates considering the manufacture of testing specimens for experiments 2 2 dimensional analysis method the buckingham π theorem buckingham 1914 is an effective approach for computing sets of dimensionless parameters from given variables thereby the number of independent quantities could be decreased from the original p to p q where q is the maximum number of dimensionally independent variables the final expression is given as follows 1 π 1 f π 2 π 3 π p q normally the scale ratios of a small scale model in length breadth and thickness in eq 1 should be a constant value however ship structures belong to the thin walled structures in which both the length l and breadth b of structural members are much larger than the thickness t of plate this characteristic indicates that the ratios of thickness between the small and full scale models are different with that for length and breadth dimensions as following 2 l f l s b f b s c l t f t s c t where the subscripts f and s represent full and small scale models respectively for stiffened panels subjected to in plane compressive force the similarity criterion derived from eqns 1 and 2 become the following expression 3 c f c σ c l c t 1 where c f c σ means force ratio and stress ratio between the full and small scale models respectively this so called dimensional directional analysis araneda 1996 is often adopted in the design of scale testing models for static linear analysis however when the large geometric nonlinear behaviours are considered the buckling mode might change during scaling models and then effect the ultimate strength which were not taken in account in ref garbatov et al 2015b xu et al 2019 2 3 empirical formulae for design purposes the empirical formulae are often used to assess the ultimate strength of stiffened panels zhang khan zhang and khan 2009 developed a semi analytical formulation for calculating the ultimate strength of stiffened panels under uniaxial compressive loads which was derived from the numerical data that is given as follows 4 σ u σ y s e q 1 β 0 28 1 1 λ 3 2 f o r λ 2 if β 1 0 take β 1 0 the principal parameters are defined as follows 5 plate slenderness β b t p σ y p e 6 column slenderness λ l π r σ y s e q e 7 radius of gyration r i a lin 1985 and paik thayamballi paik and thayamballi 1997 proposed the similar formulae by the least square method to predict the ultimate strength of stiffened panels based on numerical and experimental data respectively their formulations have the same format but differ in coefficients as follows 8 σ u σ y s e q 1 c 0 c 1 λ 2 c 2 β 2 c 3 λ 2 β 2 c 4 λ 4 where the corresponding coefficients c i are given in table 1 recently kim et al 2017 2018 proposed another expression of empirical formulation for evaluating the ultimate strength of stiffened panels under uniaxial longitudinal compression which takes the following form 9 σ u σ y s e q 1 0 8884 e λ 2 1 0 4121 e β for 0 5 λ 5 0 2 4 proposed partial similarity method since the additional torsional rigidity of stiffeners could significantly influences the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels with tripping buckling mode sonin 2001 the torsional slenderness λ ω of stiffened panels should be included to consider the interactive effects of stiffener and attached plates which is given by choung et al 2012 10 λ ω σ y s e q σ ω σ y s e q a i 0 2 π 2 e i ω μ ω l 2 g i t where μ ω is given as 0 5 for fixed boundary at both transverse ending edges which means that the transverse end edges could not warp or rotate the expression of the other parameters is given by 11 i 0 i x i y a i ω b 3 t p 3 4 h 3 t w 3 36 h h w t p 2 for stiffened panels with bar stiffeners i t i 1 n i i t i 1 n b i t i 3 3 theoretically large geometrical and material nonlinearities generally exist in the progressively collapse processes of stiffened panels which are governed by different dominant parameters for various buckling modes the column slenderness λ is derived from euler s column buckling formula without considering torsional and local buckling deformations while the torsional slenderness λ ω arises from the elastic flexural torsional buckling formulae without considering the column type deflections hence plate slenderness β could to some degree ensure the collapse behaviours of local plates column slenderness λ indicates that stiffened panels have the close bending rigidity as a unit and then behave similarly in terms of column type deformations torsional slenderness λ ω representing the torsional stiffness of the stiffener with attached plate could reflect the tripping buckling behaviours the buckling modes of stiffened panels depend on the principle influential parameters of λ β and λ ω theoretically it is sometimes difficult to keep the column slenderness λ plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λ ω of the small and full scale stiffened panels are the same by using partial similarity method hence according to the characteristicof λ β and λ ω the principle strategies of the proposed partial similarity method in the present paper is to assume that plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ are the same between full and small scale models for beam column buckling and values of the both plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λ ω for tripping buckling should be maintained the same for various scale models 3 experimental descriptions 3 1 dimensional descriptions of the test specimens longitudinal stiffeners are the fundamental ship structural components to resist the global hull bending loads table 2 shows the scantling of the stiffened panels in which the prototype models used as reference in the tests based on the benchmark in issc2012 issc 2012 beam column and tripping buckling modes frequently occur during the hogging and sagging deformations of the ship hull iacs 2014 which have entirely different collapse mechanisms paikj 2018 and have been considered in the tests the actual ship structures consist of continuous multiple spans bays stiffened panel which affects the constraint conditions of stiffened panels the difference of ultimate strength among different boundary conditions in longitudinal edges is slightly and acceptable amdahl moreover one span model with one stiffener was introduced by paik thayamballi paik and thayamballi 2007 to investigate the collapse behaviours of the stiffened panels hence which was also adopted in the present tests as shown in fig 1 in table 2 the full scale models with f1s and f2s are the prototypical stiffened panels of ship structures which were only considered in the numerical simulations for comparisons the collapse behaviours and ultimate strength of the specimens f1s0 and f2s0 using completely geometrical similarities should be almost the same with that of full scale models which intend to represent the prototype in the tests that could be used as verification three partial similarity methods including proposed partial similarity method si dimensional analysis sⅱ and empirical formulae sⅲ are used to scale the models for discussing the influences of dimensional distortions seven specimens under uniaxial longitudinal compressive loads have been tested in which the beam column buckling and stiffener tripping buckling are included to investigate the influences of the collapse modes by using different similarity methods for beam column buckling mode the proposed partial similarity and empirical formulae methods both consider the plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ for the testing specimens namely the geometrical dimensions of the small scale models f1si and f1sⅲ are the same hence only three specimens have been tested for beam column buckling mode four types of similitude strategies were used to scale the full size ship structures for experiments in which the means of s i are explained as follows s0 completely geometrical similarity method in which the scale ratios of the length width and thickness between prototype models and test coupons are close to 5 3 which are slightly different because the plate thickness should be integer during manufacture si proposed partial similarity method the plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ are kept the same between the full and small scale models for beam column buckling modes plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λ ω are maintained the same between the full and small scale models for tripping buckling mode sⅱ dimensional directional analysis method the length and thickness ratios of the full scale models to small scale models are 5 31 and 4 25 according to eq 2 respectively sⅲ empirical formulae the plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ are the same between the full and small scale models 3 2 strain gauges setting of the testing specimens five strain gauges were longitudinally installed on the surfaces of testing specimens as shown in fig 2 in which two strain gauges e1 and e2 were set on the stiffeners and three strain gauges e3 e4 and e5 were installed on the attached plates the strain gauges e1 e2 and e3 could give the information of buckling modes while e4 and e5 were set along the intersection line between the stiffener and attached plate which could reflect the differences of strain distributions in the longitudinal direction the half bridge strain gauge circuit was adopted to eliminate the impacts against the lead wire resistance and ambient temperature variation 3 3 experimental setup the small scale stiffened panels with one stiffener were longitudinally compressed by a mts landmark servo hydraulic universal testing machine with the maximum working load 300 kn the experimental setup and supporting system are illustrated in fig 3 in which the central axis of steel cylinders aligned with the centroid of end transverse sections of the test coupons the uniaxial compressive movementwas applied from bottom to up by the actuator the top constraints could be considered as fixed support while the bottom steel cylinder was constrained in radial displacement but free in axial rotation to protect the actuator since the free axial rotation of bottom actuator influences slightly the ultimate strength of the stiffened plates with one stiffener under compression for the longitudinal unloaded edges the difference of ultimate strength of stiffened panels under various constraints is relatively small amdahl hence the longitudinal edges of the testing coupons were kept free during testing moreover v groove steel in the experiments of xu et al xu and guedessoares 2012 2013a allowed the transverse loaded edges of stiffened panel coupons to freely rotate for approximately simulating the simply supported boundary conditions which may be inefficiently constrained and underestimate the ultimate compression capacity hence the transverse loaded edges of the testing specimens were fixed by the additional thick supporting steel plates with bolts as used by paik and thayamballi 1997 see fig 3 the cross area of supporting plates with 30 mm thickness should be relatively large to ensure uniform longitudinal displacements at the transverse end edges of the testing coupons 3 4 experiment procedures after welding and assembling the residual stress exists in stiffened panels hence during the experimental process two initial loading cycles were performed firstly which intended to release the welding residual stress and meanwhile decrease the effects of the gaps between the testing coupons and supporting plates gordo and guedessoares 2012 the actual ultimate loads are unknown before the tests hence 25 and 50 of the load carrying capacity of the testing specimens assessed by the fe analyses in advance were considered as the upper limit of compressive loads in the first and second loading cycles which should release the welding residual stress without inducing large plastic deformations the longitudinal movement in the third loading cycle continually increased until the collapse of stiffened panel coupons the loading speed of the bottom actuator was constantly set as 0 5 mm min in the tests which should be small enough to be considered as quasi static process the force and displacement sensors strain measurement system automatically recorded the data of force displacement and histories of strain during the whole loading and unloading processes the nominal measured displacements were the imposed movements of the bottom actuator 4 nonlinear fe analysis 4 1 numerical models the mechanical properties of steel used in the fe analyseswere measured by the standard tensile tests which were conducted on a shimadzu electronic universal testing machine with the maximum pulling capacity of 100 kn the testing coupons were made of ah32 ship building steel of which the nominal yield strength is generally at least 315 mpa while the ultimate tensile strength ranges between 440 and 570 mpa in the requirements of china classification society ccs s and 2015 rules for mate 2015 three tensile specimens in fig 4 a were longitudinally cut from a steel plate with 3 mm thickness to obtain the material mechanical properties including 4 and 5 mm thickness steel plates the uniform elongation before necking is independent of specimen size while the post necking elongation dramatically increases with the increase of specimen size the yield stress elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength are also almost independent of specimen size with the thickness between 1 and 5 mm strnadel and brumek 2013 which indicates that the effects of plate thickness could be neglected for tensile tests when it is relatively small meanwhile for the test coupons with 3 mm thickness both the dimensions of test specimens and measured mechanical properties of steel ah32 satisfy the respectively recommended ranges in the requirements of ccs which ensure the tensile tests results are reliable and available hence only the tensile tests for 3 mm thickness plate were conducted the testing machine gradually raised the tensile force leading to the gradual elongation and final fracture of the tensile specimens the tensile velocity with 1 mm min was controlled by imposed displacements the longitudinal strain histories were captured by an extensometer with the gauge length of 30 mm fig 4 b illustrates the engineering stress strain curves of steel from the tensile tests from the measured data the elastic modulus and yield strength of steel material are 206 gpa and 322 mpa respectively possion s ratio is assumed as 0 3 for considering the material strain hardening properties the piecewise linear stress strain curve with multi linear isotropic hardening miso were adopted to model the relationship of true stress and true strain in fig 4 b the stiffened panels were modelled by shell 181 element with reduced integration in ansys code which has five integration points through the thickness that could capture the yielding progress as illustrated in later sections the unloading and loading curves for the second loading cycle are close each other namely the residual plastic strain is small after two loading cycles this means that the residual stress relief technique applied by two small amplitude cyclic loading could effectively reduce the shakedown effect the present study aims to find out a reasonable configuration of boundary condition that can both reproduce the working conditions of ship structures and be realized in the laboratory hence the influences of welding residual stress were not considered in the fe analyses since two initial load cycles were used to release them the ratio of element size to thickness was set as at least 5 that was suggested by issc 2009 committee ⅲ 1 issc 2009 arc length method was adopted to solve the nonlinear static problems which could provide pre and post buckling behaviours of the stiffened panels 4 2 geometrical initial imperfections the fabrication processes including welding and assembling generally generate the initial imperfections which could affect the ultimate strength and post collapse behaviours of stiffened panels the real initial imperfections could reduce the possible uncertainty between test and numerical models however there exist irregular spatial variations in the actual initial deflections which are different for various testing specimens the comparison of results includes the full scale prototypes that are not tested and the corresponding real initial imperfections are not available the purpose of the present paper mainly focuses on the similarity scaling methods for stiffened panels hence to keep the uniformity of input parameters in the comparison the assumed initial imperfections instead of real imperfections are used herein for the full and small scaled models the real initial deformations and corresponding equivalent formulae with fourier series would have close ultimate strength but slightly different collapse deformation distributions xu and guedessoares 2013c based on the statistics of measured data the equivalent geometrical initial deflections are normally divided into three types which are expressed as following fourier series kmiecik et al 1995 these prescribed initial imperfections have been introduced in issc 2012 kim et al 2018 and widely used which is given as follows initial deflection of local plate 12 w 0 p l a 0 sin m π z l sin π x b b 0 sin π z l sin π x b column type deflection of stiffener 13 w 0 s b 0 sin π z l sin π x b sideways initial deflection of stiffener 14 v s c 0 y h w sin π z l for average level of initial deformations the amplitudes in these above formulae are given by a 0 0 1 β 2 t p and b 0 c 0 0 0015 l the buckling number of plates m is normally defined as a minimum integer satisfying the following equation 15 l s m m 1 the prescribed displacements calculated from eqs 12 14 including global and local initial deformations were imposed on the fe models before collapse analysis 4 3 boundary conditions and loads the boundary conditions and loading in the fe analyses should be similar to the actual experimental conditions as possible based on the compression tests see fig 3 the constraint conditions at transverse loaded end edges were modelled as fixed boundary conditions in table 3 the transverse frames were assumed strong enough to supporting the longitudinal members hence the nodes on each transverse end section were rigidly linked through defining a rigid region to arespective individual master point which was located at the centre of the neutral axis of transverse end cross section the prescribed constraints and loadswere applied on the two master nodes the longitudinal compressive displacements were imposed on the master points that couple with transverse edges 5 results analysis and discussions 5 1 ultimate strength analysis seven stiffened panels in table 2 are used to investigate the influences of various similarity methods on the collapse modes and ultimate strength between the small and full scale models in which different collapse modes including beam column f1s0 f1sⅱ and stiffener tripping buckling f2s0 f2sⅲ were considered the average longitudinal stress is defined as the value of the imposed external force divided by corresponding cross sectional area of the stiffened panels in which the external force is the total reaction force in the fe analysis or measured compressive force in the tests while the average longitudinal strain is defined as the ratio of the movement on the loading transverse edge to the overall length of the stiffened panels in which the movement is the imposed displacement in the fe analysis or measured movement of the actuator in the tests table 4 presents the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels in the tests and numerical simulations there are several aspects of uncertainties that could cause the differences of the ultimatestrength and deformation between the experimental and numerical methods e g welding residual stress amplitudes of initial imperfections as well as the gaps between the testing coupons and supporting system the minimum and maximum differences of the load carrying capacities between the fem and experiments are about 1 and 8 the mean value and standard deviation of the ratios between the ultimate strength of the tests and numerical simulations are 3 7 and 0 007 respectively considering the uncertainties of fabrication of specimens and laboratory conditions the difference of ultimate strength assessed by the experimental and numerical methods is small and acceptable which illustrates that the technology of numerical modelling could be used in the further study the ultimate strength of the small scale models f1s0 and f2s0 using completely geometrical similarity method are almost the same with that of full scale prototypes f1s and f2s which illustrates that the results of the specimens f1s0 and f2s0 used in the tests could be use as the references for verification because their principal parameters in the equilibrium equations constitutive relations and compatibility conditions that govern the structural response are the same between small scale model and full scale prototype which could give the similar results jones 1974 table 5 shows the differences of the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels with various similarity methods in which rσu fem is the ratio of ultimate strength of the small scale models to the full scale models and rσu test is the ratio of ultimate strength of the small scale models with various similarity methods to the small scale models with completely similarity methods the average differences of the ultimate strength of the specimens between the full and small scale models are 0 7 6 5 and 9 8 for the proposed method dimensional analysis and empirical formulae respectively the partial similarity method using the empirical formulae gives maximum different error during scaling models especially for tripping buckling mode because the empirical formulations generally assume that the ultimate strength only depends on the plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ this assumption means that the ultimate strength of small and full scale models with the same β and λ are the same when these empirical formulations are used to scale model however because the torsional rigidity is also vital to affect the collapse behaviours of stiffeners with tripping buckling the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels with different scales ratios are still different sonin 2001 the dimensional analysis method mainly considers the transformation of structural dimension and response between the full and small scale models which does not consider the effect of buckling behaviours that causes 6 5 difference thus the current partial similarity method should be improved to consider the various buckling behaviours of stiffened panels hence a partial similarity method used different principle parameters for various buckling is proposed it can be seen that the model scaling with the proposed similarity method affects slightly on the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels because for beam column buckling mode the proposed similarity method controls the same dominant column slenderness λ and plate slenderness β which mainly consider the effects of bending stiffness of stiffeners with attached plate for tripping buckling mode additional torsional slenderness λ ω representing the torsional rigidity of stiffeners is considered in which the proposed similarity method has the same β and λ ω when the partial similarity method is adopted for scaling thin wall structure the strategy by considering different principle parameters combinations for different collapse modes would be a good option for designing testing models 5 2 collapse behaviours analysis fig 5 shows the recorded strain histories on strain gauges e1 e5 for the stiffened panels f1s0 and f1sⅱ the positive and negative values of the strains indicate tensile and compressive strains respectively from fig 5 a the longitudinal strain histories between strain gauges e1 and e2 are similar while the strain curve of strain gauge e3 suddenly rises prior to the strain gauges of e1 and e2 the strains on longitudinal middle part of the stiffeners are usually tensile strains e1 and e2 which are opposite to the conjunction part between attached plate and stiffener e4 and e5 hence the characteristics of strain behaviours indicate that the buckling mode of this stiffened panel is plate induced beam column collapse however the measured strain histories have different trends for the stiffener induced beam column buckling mode from fig 5 b due to the large plastic deformations induced from the local buckling of stiffeners the stiffener induced buckling mode has much larger change range of strain histories than that in the plate induced buckling mode the strain on middle top edge of the stiffeners in the longitudinal direction may change from compressive strain to tensile strain hence it is suggested that the similarity methods should maintain the same buckling mode of the stiffened plates with various scales the measured strain histories with tripping buckling are illustrated in fig 6 for the stiffened panel f2s0 which are different from the stiffened panel f1s0 with beam column buckling beam column and tripping buckling modes have different characteristics of collapse deformations and strain distributions which indicate that the stress strain relationships and collapse mechanisms are correspondent to buckling modes as expected figs 7 10 show the collapse deformations of the stiffened panels in the experimental and numerical analyses the collapse deformations in the fe analyses are similar to that in the tests the collapse modes of f2s0 f2si f2sⅱ and f2sⅲ are the same that could be classified as tripping buckling of stiffener this means that the three partial similarity methods also could keep the same buckling mode for the tripping buckling of stiffener however the beam column buckling modes could be caused by plate induced or stiffener induced paik and thayamballi 2007 which is sensitive with the geometrical dimensions the collapse mode of the stiffened panel f1sⅱ using dimensional analysis method is stiffened induced beam column buckling which is different with that of f1s0 with plate induced beam column buckling mode this illustrates that the dimensional analysis similarity method would cause the change of the collapse mode during scaling models for beam column buckling mode hence it is necessary to propose new partial similarity method for considering the buckling mode of thin wall structures it can be seen that the collapse modes of the stiffened panels f1s0 and f1si are the same that could be classified as plate induced beam column buckling from the comparisons of collapse modes of testing specimens with beam column buckling mode the proposed partial similarity method could keep collapse modes of small scale model the same with that of full scale prototype 5 3 average stress average strain relationships fig 11 and fig 12 shows the curves of average stress versus average strain in the fe analyses and experiments respectively in the tests the initial structural moduli between the full and small scale models for the three partial similarity methods completely geometrical similarity proposed similarity method dimensional analysis are similar this means that the three partial similarity methods could be used to scale model if the buckling behaviours are not included however the stress strain curves of the stiffened panel f1sⅱin fig 11 b using dimensional analysis sharply drop after collapse whose post collapse behaviour is different with that of f1s0 this partial similarity method with dimensional analysis may change the post collapse behaviours and the collapse mode that can be seen from the comparison of fig 9 a and e the average stress histories of the stiffened panels f1s0 and f1si gradually decrease after collapse which are similar this indicates that the proposed partial similarity method could give similar average stress histories for pre and post buckling during scaling models the loading paths of the stiffened panels are the same before collapse in the fe analyses as expected however the initial structural modulus in the third load cycle is slightly larger than that of the first and second loading cycles as shown in fig 11 because there exist the welding residual stress and the gaps between the supporting structure and specimens actually the first and second loading cycles intend to release welding residual stress and reduce the influence of the gaps between the specimens and supporting structure this also indicates that it is necessary to eliminate the installation and fabrication errors in the tests the differences of ultimate strength of the stiffened panels between the tests and fem in table 4 are small and acceptable considering the uncertainties of laboratory conditions but their initial structural modulus are different because the recorded axial displacements in the tests are the imposed movements of the bottom actuator which included the longitudinal shortenings of both the steel cylinders and test coupons see fig 3 the axial shortening of cylinders exerts different impacts on the total measured displacements which depends on not only the stress state but also the length of supporting structures although the cross section of the supporting cylinders is larger than that of the specimens the length of cylinders is also much larger than test specimens there exists axial deformation of the supporting steel cylinders due to compressive loads hence for obtaining more accuracy of the structural shortening the movement measurement equipment is suggested to set on the specimen s edges to reduce the influences of supporting structures due to its deformations besides the local contact gaps between the specimens and supporting structure see fig 13 are inevitable to be completely eliminated in the experimental installation and manufacture of the testing coupons the contact conditions between the transverse end edges and supporting plates might slightly vary for various testing coupons fig 13 a shows the contact condition between the testing coupons and supporting plate in front view in which there exist local gaps marked in red lines meanwhile fig 13 b illustrates the typical end edge of middle longitudinal section in which the actual outline plotted in black line is not vertical as theoretical outline due to welding deformations and assembling precision these phenomena indicate that the real contact zones are not the whole transverse section but only local structures in some cases which induce larger compression strain in the elastic stage and easier entering the plastic state thus the local contact structures between the test coupons and supporting plate would be much greatly shortened under compressive loads especially when a large part of contact zone enters inelastic state the effect of local contact gaps is another reason of errors for measured displacements in the tests the local contact zone with gaps could affect on the stress strain relationship and then the initial structural modulus of the testing specimens the gaps between the supporting cylinders and local contact structures influence the measured shortening which cause the measured strain in the tests is larger than the calculated strain in the numerical method and then influence the initial structural modulus by contrast due to the equilibrium of stress in a quasi static system the steel cylinders and local contact structures can fully transfer compression loads equally along the test coupons disregarding the size and shape of contact surfaces this explains that the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels between the fem and test are very close but their stress strain curves are different at the beginning of loading namely the measured stress of the testing specimens could be considered accurate but the measured strain and initial structural modulus might be not the same with actual value during fabrication process of the testing specimens and supporting structures the local contact gaps should be reduced as possible to increase the testing precision 5 4 discussions of similarity methods table 4 shows that the ultimate strength and average stress strain curves of the small scale models with completely geometrical similarity method f1s0 and f2s0 are almost the same with the prototype model f1s and f2s in the numerical analyses for both beam column and tripping buckling as expected this means that the results of the small scale model using completely geometrical similarity method could be used for verifications nevertheless to scale thin walled structures for testing the completely geometrical similarity is generally difficult to be employed to scale stiffened panels due to the limitations of geometrical dimension for most of cases the partial similarity strategies with different scale ratios between length and thickness should be developed however the partial similarity methods would to some degree change the geometrical features of stiffened plates which cause dimensional distortions and then induce the change of collapse modes the first important aspect is to find the principal parameters that dominate the influences of dimensional distortions on collapse behaviours to investigate the influences of various partial similarity methods on the collapse behaviours the average stress strain curves of the attached plate and stiffener in the fe analyses are plotted separately in fig 14 and fig 15 the average stress strain curves on the attached plates with dimensional analysis are different with the others this means the dimensional direction analysis might not appropriate for considering the buckling behaviours of stiffened panels under compressive loads the ultimate strength and stress strain relationships with proposed method f1si are very close to that with the full scale prototype f1s from table 4 and figs 11 and 14 since plate slenderness β reflects the stiffness of local plates while column slenderness λ denotes the bending rigidity of stiffened panels as a beam unit which are the critical principle parameters with slight influences of dimensional distortions for beam column buckling mode the proposed partial similarity method keeps the full and small scale models have the same β and λ which could ensures their collapse deformations and ultimate strength are close for the stiffened panels with beam column buckling for tripping buckling mode the stress strain curve of the attached stiffeners f2sⅲ with empirical formulae is different with that of the full scale model in fig 15 b because of the column slenderness λ is not the dominate parameter to govern the tripping buckling of stiffener in this case the torsional slenderness λ ω should be considered from figs 12 and 15 it can be seen that the ultimate strength and average stress strain curves of the small scale models with proposed similarity method f2si are similar to that of the prototype f2s this phenomenon indicates that plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λ ω could govern the tripping buckling process since β represents the stiffness of local plates and λ ω denotes the torsional stiffness of the stiffener with attached plate the proposed similarity method that ensures the close β and λ ω could give the similar ultimate strength for small scale models with tripping buckling mode this means that different principal parameters combination for partial similarity methods should be used for various collapse modes since it is sometimes difficult to keep the plate slenderness β column slenderness λ and torsional slenderness λ ω of the full and small scale models are all the same at the same time the stress strain curves for attached plate or stiffener for dimensional analysis are different from that of prototype model f1s in figs 14 and 15 which eventually results in different buckling mode and ultimate strength thus the dimensional analysis might not appropriate when the buckling behaviours are considered in summary the completely geometrical similarity produces almost the same buckling behaviours among various scale stiffened panels but may be not practical considering fabrication of specimens the dimensional analysis method might change the collapse modes for the partial similarity methods the dominant parameters in tripping buckling mode should be different from beam column buckling mode because of different collapse mechanisms hence plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ govern the buckling process with beam column buckling mode but the principal slenderness becomes β and torsional slenderness λ ω instead of λ for tripping buckling mode the proposed similarity method maintaining the close β λ for beam column and β λ ω for tripping buckling could obtain the similar collapse behaviours which should be a good option for scaling testing models for the assessment of ultimate strength of stiffened panels while the empirical formulae excluding torsional slenderness λ ω may induce larger errors of ultimate strength for tripping buckling the strategy of partial similarity method for various collapse modes still could be used to other buckling modes e g web local buckling mode however in which the principle parameter combinations that influence collapse mode should be considered during scaling test models 6 conclusions considering the fabrication of testing specimens the completely geometrical similarity may not be economical or practical for thin wall structures e g stiffened panels moreover the partial similarity methods would lead to dimensional distortions when the buckling behaviours are accounted for hence various similarity methods are used to design small scale models whose collapse behaviours are investigated in the experiments and numerical simulations the following conclusions are developed 1 the dimensional direction analysis could be used to scale model for static linear analysis but might not appropriate for considering the buckling behaviours of stiffened panels under compressive loads the testing results of small scale model using completely geometrical similarity method could be used as reference for verifications 2 the partial similarity method might cause the change of the collapse mode and then influence the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels for designing the small scale testing models under longitudinal compression the buckling behaviours should be considered for the assessment of ultimate strength of stiffened panels 3 it is suggested that different determinate parameters should be considered for various collapse modes to reduce the dimensional distortion during model scaling when partial similitude method is adopted in the model scaling both plate slenderness and column slenderness are the priority considered parameters for beam column collapse mode however for tripping buckling mode column slenderness and torsional slenderness should be considered firstly 4 the proposed strategy of partial similarity method by considering different principle parameters combinations for various collapse modes could give the same collapse mode and similar average stress

21247,since the geometrical dimensions of stiffened panels including length and thickness are very different considering fabrication the complete similarity method is generally not realistic or economic to scale thin wall models for testing the present paper aims to figure out a partial similarity method to design testing small scale models for stiffened panels which could consider the effects of buckling behaviours and dimensional distortions the partial similarity method corresponding to different collapse modes is proposed to design small scale testing models according to the principal influential parameters of plate column and torsional slenderness instead of only geometrical dimensions seven specimens were tested for assessing the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels under in plane compressive loads which are used to verify the fe modelling technology the influences of various partial similarity methods on the collapse behaviours are discussed by using experimental and numerical results the strategy of proposed partial similarity method by considering different principle parameters combinations for various collapse modes could give close results

caused by cargo weight and wave loads during voyage and operation which could cause the longitudinal compression of the stiffened panels on the deck or bottom of ship structures the load carrying capacity of stiffened panel is an important strength aspect to ensure the safety of ship structures the methods for assessing the ultimate strength of stiffened panels usually include the simple closed form formulation incremental iterative method simplified element method finite element method fem and experiment the simple closed form formulation was firstly proposed by caldwell 1965 and improved by some researchers such as zhang khan zhang and khan 2009 lin 1985 paik and thayamballi 1997 the incremental iterative method was initially introduced by smith 1977 and already adopted in csr h requirement iacs 2014 the simplified element method such as idealized structural unit method was utilized by ueda and rashed 1984 the finite element fe analyses including the implicit static analysis xu et al 2017a and explicit dynamic analysis xu et al 2017b are often adopted to calculate the ultimate strength of ship structures the experiment is also an important method to validity the theoretical method two representative experiments with full size models are the american destroyers preston and bruce kell 1931 in 1930 and the british destroyer albuera lang and warren 1952 in 1950 however due to time consuming and financial costs for full scale prototypes small scale models are frequently used in the experiments to investigate the collapse behaviours as the physical representation of actual ship structures several small scale hull girders under bending moments were tested to investigate collapse behaviours of ship structures by dowlinget al dowling et al 1976 gordo et al gordo and guedessoares 2009 saad eldeen saad eldeen et al 2011 garbatov garbatov et al 2015a and liu et al 2018 using experimental and numerical methods wang et al 2019 2020 investigated the ultimate bending moment and torsion moment of hull girder for container ships it was found that the shearing buckling of side plate is the main reason that causes the collapse of ship structures three different length of stiffened panels with short gordo and guedessoares 2008 intermediate gordo and guedessoares 2011 and long gordo and guedessoares 2012 three bays under axial compression were tested until collapse to investigate the influences of stiffener types xu et al xu and guedessoares 2013a 2013b used the experimental and numerical methods to study the influences of boundary conditions on the collapse strength of stiffened panels due to the stiffened panels belonging to thin walled structures the length and breadth of local plates are much larger than the thickness which might be unrealistic to scale models in an equal proportion for all dimensions considering manufacture thus the partial similarity methods instead of the completely geometrical similarity method are simultaneously employed in experiments a proper partial similarity method that could establish the relationships of collapse strength between the actual structures and small scale models is still a challenge sonin 2001 especially for thin wall structure because of the scaling of the stiffened panels under in plane compression might change the buckling modes and then cause that the small and full scale models have different load carrying capacities at the same time since the torsional rigidity is vital to affect the collapse behaviours of stiffeners with tripping buckling xu et al 2018 the same plate and column slenderness could not ensure that the ultimate strength are the same in some cases xu et al 2013 the closed form formulae do not include the influential parameters in tripping buckling mode which may induce unacceptably different ultimate strength between different scale models kong et al 2020 conducted the collapse test of stiffened panels under in plane compression and then discussed the influences of geometrical dimensions on the collapse behaviours however until nowadays there is very little experimental research on the similarity of stiffened panels considering buckling behaviours the present study aims to propose a reliable partial similarity method that could consider the buckling behaviours of stiffened plates during scaling models using different similarity methods seven scale specimens having various buckling modes were designed and tested under in plane compression and the corresponding results are used to verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed similarity method using tests and numerical simulation the influences of various scaling methods on the collapse behaviour of stiffened panels are investigated 2 similarity methods four kinds of similitude strategies including proposed partial similarity method are used to scale down the actual stiffened panels consisting of ship hull girder the scaling effects of different similarity methods on the buckling deformations and ultimate strength are discussed to figure out a proper similarity method that could consider the buckling modes 2 1 completely geometrical similarity method the completely geometrical similarity method keeps the equalscale ratio of length breadth and thicknessbetween the small and full scalestiffened panels the plate slenderness torsional slenderness and column slenderness of stiffened panels maintain almost the same for different scale models which could make sure that the structural mechanical behaviours between various scale models aretheoretically the same butthis similarity methodcould be adopted only for particularly dimensional combinations of stiffeners and plates considering the manufacture of testing specimens for experiments 2 2 dimensional analysis method the buckingham π theorem buckingham 1914 is an effective approach for computing sets of dimensionless parameters from given variables thereby the number of independent quantities could be decreased from the original p to p q where q is the maximum number of dimensionally independent variables the final expression is given as follows 1 π 1 f π 2 π 3 π p q normally the scale ratios of a small scale model in length breadth and thickness in eq 1 should be a constant value however ship structures belong to the thin walled structures in which both the length l and breadth b of structural members are much larger than the thickness t of plate this characteristic indicates that the ratios of thickness between the small and full scale models are different with that for length and breadth dimensions as following 2 l f l s b f b s c l t f t s c t where the subscripts f and s represent full and small scale models respectively for stiffened panels subjected to in plane compressive force the similarity criterion derived from eqns 1 and 2 become the following expression 3 c f c σ c l c t 1 where c f c σ means force ratio and stress ratio between the full and small scale models respectively this so called dimensional directional analysis araneda 1996 is often adopted in the design of scale testing models for static linear analysis however when the large geometric nonlinear behaviours are considered the buckling mode might change during scaling models and then effect the ultimate strength which were not taken in account in ref garbatov et al 2015b xu et al 2019 2 3 empirical formulae for design purposes the empirical formulae are often used to assess the ultimate strength of stiffened panels zhang khan zhang and khan 2009 developed a semi analytical formulation for calculating the ultimate strength of stiffened panels under uniaxial compressive loads which was derived from the numerical data that is given as follows 4 σ u σ y s e q 1 β 0 28 1 1 λ 3 2 f o r λ 2 if β 1 0 take β 1 0 the principal parameters are defined as follows 5 plate slenderness β b t p σ y p e 6 column slenderness λ l π r σ y s e q e 7 radius of gyration r i a lin 1985 and paik thayamballi paik and thayamballi 1997 proposed the similar formulae by the least square method to predict the ultimate strength of stiffened panels based on numerical and experimental data respectively their formulations have the same format but differ in coefficients as follows 8 σ u σ y s e q 1 c 0 c 1 λ 2 c 2 β 2 c 3 λ 2 β 2 c 4 λ 4 where the corresponding coefficients c i are given in table 1 recently kim et al 2017 2018 proposed another expression of empirical formulation for evaluating the ultimate strength of stiffened panels under uniaxial longitudinal compression which takes the following form 9 σ u σ y s e q 1 0 8884 e λ 2 1 0 4121 e β for 0 5 λ 5 0 2 4 proposed partial similarity method since the additional torsional rigidity of stiffeners could significantly influences the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels with tripping buckling mode sonin 2001 the torsional slenderness λ ω of stiffened panels should be included to consider the interactive effects of stiffener and attached plates which is given by choung et al 2012 10 λ ω σ y s e q σ ω σ y s e q a i 0 2 π 2 e i ω μ ω l 2 g i t where μ ω is given as 0 5 for fixed boundary at both transverse ending edges which means that the transverse end edges could not warp or rotate the expression of the other parameters is given by 11 i 0 i x i y a i ω b 3 t p 3 4 h 3 t w 3 36 h h w t p 2 for stiffened panels with bar stiffeners i t i 1 n i i t i 1 n b i t i 3 3 theoretically large geometrical and material nonlinearities generally exist in the progressively collapse processes of stiffened panels which are governed by different dominant parameters for various buckling modes the column slenderness λ is derived from euler s column buckling formula without considering torsional and local buckling deformations while the torsional slenderness λ ω arises from the elastic flexural torsional buckling formulae without considering the column type deflections hence plate slenderness β could to some degree ensure the collapse behaviours of local plates column slenderness λ indicates that stiffened panels have the close bending rigidity as a unit and then behave similarly in terms of column type deformations torsional slenderness λ ω representing the torsional stiffness of the stiffener with attached plate could reflect the tripping buckling behaviours the buckling modes of stiffened panels depend on the principle influential parameters of λ β and λ ω theoretically it is sometimes difficult to keep the column slenderness λ plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λ ω of the small and full scale stiffened panels are the same by using partial similarity method hence according to the characteristicof λ β and λ ω the principle strategies of the proposed partial similarity method in the present paper is to assume that plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ are the same between full and small scale models for beam column buckling and values of the both plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λ ω for tripping buckling should be maintained the same for various scale models 3 experimental descriptions 3 1 dimensional descriptions of the test specimens longitudinal stiffeners are the fundamental ship structural components to resist the global hull bending loads table 2 shows the scantling of the stiffened panels in which the prototype models used as reference in the tests based on the benchmark in issc2012 issc 2012 beam column and tripping buckling modes frequently occur during the hogging and sagging deformations of the ship hull iacs 2014 which have entirely different collapse mechanisms paikj 2018 and have been considered in the tests the actual ship structures consist of continuous multiple spans bays stiffened panel which affects the constraint conditions of stiffened panels the difference of ultimate strength among different boundary conditions in longitudinal edges is slightly and acceptable amdahl moreover one span model with one stiffener was introduced by paik thayamballi paik and thayamballi 2007 to investigate the collapse behaviours of the stiffened panels hence which was also adopted in the present tests as shown in fig 1 in table 2 the full scale models with f1s and f2s are the prototypical stiffened panels of ship structures which were only considered in the numerical simulations for comparisons the collapse behaviours and ultimate strength of the specimens f1s0 and f2s0 using completely geometrical similarities should be almost the same with that of full scale models which intend to represent the prototype in the tests that could be used as verification three partial similarity methods including proposed partial similarity method si dimensional analysis sⅱ and empirical formulae sⅲ are used to scale the models for discussing the influences of dimensional distortions seven specimens under uniaxial longitudinal compressive loads have been tested in which the beam column buckling and stiffener tripping buckling are included to investigate the influences of the collapse modes by using different similarity methods for beam column buckling mode the proposed partial similarity and empirical formulae methods both consider the plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ for the testing specimens namely the geometrical dimensions of the small scale models f1si and f1sⅲ are the same hence only three specimens have been tested for beam column buckling mode four types of similitude strategies were used to scale the full size ship structures for experiments in which the means of s i are explained as follows s0 completely geometrical similarity method in which the scale ratios of the length width and thickness between prototype models and test coupons are close to 5 3 which are slightly different because the plate thickness should be integer during manufacture si proposed partial similarity method the plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ are kept the same between the full and small scale models for beam column buckling modes plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λ ω are maintained the same between the full and small scale models for tripping buckling mode sⅱ dimensional directional analysis method the length and thickness ratios of the full scale models to small scale models are 5 31 and 4 25 according to eq 2 respectively sⅲ empirical formulae the plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ are the same between the full and small scale models 3 2 strain gauges setting of the testing specimens five strain gauges were longitudinally installed on the surfaces of testing specimens as shown in fig 2 in which two strain gauges e1 and e2 were set on the stiffeners and three strain gauges e3 e4 and e5 were installed on the attached plates the strain gauges e1 e2 and e3 could give the information of buckling modes while e4 and e5 were set along the intersection line between the stiffener and attached plate which could reflect the differences of strain distributions in the longitudinal direction the half bridge strain gauge circuit was adopted to eliminate the impacts against the lead wire resistance and ambient temperature variation 3 3 experimental setup the small scale stiffened panels with one stiffener were longitudinally compressed by a mts landmark servo hydraulic universal testing machine with the maximum working load 300 kn the experimental setup and supporting system are illustrated in fig 3 in which the central axis of steel cylinders aligned with the centroid of end transverse sections of the test coupons the uniaxial compressive movementwas applied from bottom to up by the actuator the top constraints could be considered as fixed support while the bottom steel cylinder was constrained in radial displacement but free in axial rotation to protect the actuator since the free axial rotation of bottom actuator influences slightly the ultimate strength of the stiffened plates with one stiffener under compression for the longitudinal unloaded edges the difference of ultimate strength of stiffened panels under various constraints is relatively small amdahl hence the longitudinal edges of the testing coupons were kept free during testing moreover v groove steel in the experiments of xu et al xu and guedessoares 2012 2013a allowed the transverse loaded edges of stiffened panel coupons to freely rotate for approximately simulating the simply supported boundary conditions which may be inefficiently constrained and underestimate the ultimate compression capacity hence the transverse loaded edges of the testing specimens were fixed by the additional thick supporting steel plates with bolts as used by paik and thayamballi 1997 see fig 3 the cross area of supporting plates with 30 mm thickness should be relatively large to ensure uniform longitudinal displacements at the transverse end edges of the testing coupons 3 4 experiment procedures after welding and assembling the residual stress exists in stiffened panels hence during the experimental process two initial loading cycles were performed firstly which intended to release the welding residual stress and meanwhile decrease the effects of the gaps between the testing coupons and supporting plates gordo and guedessoares 2012 the actual ultimate loads are unknown before the tests hence 25 and 50 of the load carrying capacity of the testing specimens assessed by the fe analyses in advance were considered as the upper limit of compressive loads in the first and second loading cycles which should release the welding residual stress without inducing large plastic deformations the longitudinal movement in the third loading cycle continually increased until the collapse of stiffened panel coupons the loading speed of the bottom actuator was constantly set as 0 5 mm min in the tests which should be small enough to be considered as quasi static process the force and displacement sensors strain measurement system automatically recorded the data of force displacement and histories of strain during the whole loading and unloading processes the nominal measured displacements were the imposed movements of the bottom actuator 4 nonlinear fe analysis 4 1 numerical models the mechanical properties of steel used in the fe analyseswere measured by the standard tensile tests which were conducted on a shimadzu electronic universal testing machine with the maximum pulling capacity of 100 kn the testing coupons were made of ah32 ship building steel of which the nominal yield strength is generally at least 315 mpa while the ultimate tensile strength ranges between 440 and 570 mpa in the requirements of china classification society ccs s and 2015 rules for mate 2015 three tensile specimens in fig 4 a were longitudinally cut from a steel plate with 3 mm thickness to obtain the material mechanical properties including 4 and 5 mm thickness steel plates the uniform elongation before necking is independent of specimen size while the post necking elongation dramatically increases with the increase of specimen size the yield stress elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength are also almost independent of specimen size with the thickness between 1 and 5 mm strnadel and brumek 2013 which indicates that the effects of plate thickness could be neglected for tensile tests when it is relatively small meanwhile for the test coupons with 3 mm thickness both the dimensions of test specimens and measured mechanical properties of steel ah32 satisfy the respectively recommended ranges in the requirements of ccs which ensure the tensile tests results are reliable and available hence only the tensile tests for 3 mm thickness plate were conducted the testing machine gradually raised the tensile force leading to the gradual elongation and final fracture of the tensile specimens the tensile velocity with 1 mm min was controlled by imposed displacements the longitudinal strain histories were captured by an extensometer with the gauge length of 30 mm fig 4 b illustrates the engineering stress strain curves of steel from the tensile tests from the measured data the elastic modulus and yield strength of steel material are 206 gpa and 322 mpa respectively possion s ratio is assumed as 0 3 for considering the material strain hardening properties the piecewise linear stress strain curve with multi linear isotropic hardening miso were adopted to model the relationship of true stress and true strain in fig 4 b the stiffened panels were modelled by shell 181 element with reduced integration in ansys code which has five integration points through the thickness that could capture the yielding progress as illustrated in later sections the unloading and loading curves for the second loading cycle are close each other namely the residual plastic strain is small after two loading cycles this means that the residual stress relief technique applied by two small amplitude cyclic loading could effectively reduce the shakedown effect the present study aims to find out a reasonable configuration of boundary condition that can both reproduce the working conditions of ship structures and be realized in the laboratory hence the influences of welding residual stress were not considered in the fe analyses since two initial load cycles were used to release them the ratio of element size to thickness was set as at least 5 that was suggested by issc 2009 committee ⅲ 1 issc 2009 arc length method was adopted to solve the nonlinear static problems which could provide pre and post buckling behaviours of the stiffened panels 4 2 geometrical initial imperfections the fabrication processes including welding and assembling generally generate the initial imperfections which could affect the ultimate strength and post collapse behaviours of stiffened panels the real initial imperfections could reduce the possible uncertainty between test and numerical models however there exist irregular spatial variations in the actual initial deflections which are different for various testing specimens the comparison of results includes the full scale prototypes that are not tested and the corresponding real initial imperfections are not available the purpose of the present paper mainly focuses on the similarity scaling methods for stiffened panels hence to keep the uniformity of input parameters in the comparison the assumed initial imperfections instead of real imperfections are used herein for the full and small scaled models the real initial deformations and corresponding equivalent formulae with fourier series would have close ultimate strength but slightly different collapse deformation distributions xu and guedessoares 2013c based on the statistics of measured data the equivalent geometrical initial deflections are normally divided into three types which are expressed as following fourier series kmiecik et al 1995 these prescribed initial imperfections have been introduced in issc 2012 kim et al 2018 and widely used which is given as follows initial deflection of local plate 12 w 0 p l a 0 sin m π z l sin π x b b 0 sin π z l sin π x b column type deflection of stiffener 13 w 0 s b 0 sin π z l sin π x b sideways initial deflection of stiffener 14 v s c 0 y h w sin π z l for average level of initial deformations the amplitudes in these above formulae are given by a 0 0 1 β 2 t p and b 0 c 0 0 0015 l the buckling number of plates m is normally defined as a minimum integer satisfying the following equation 15 l s m m 1 the prescribed displacements calculated from eqs 12 14 including global and local initial deformations were imposed on the fe models before collapse analysis 4 3 boundary conditions and loads the boundary conditions and loading in the fe analyses should be similar to the actual experimental conditions as possible based on the compression tests see fig 3 the constraint conditions at transverse loaded end edges were modelled as fixed boundary conditions in table 3 the transverse frames were assumed strong enough to supporting the longitudinal members hence the nodes on each transverse end section were rigidly linked through defining a rigid region to arespective individual master point which was located at the centre of the neutral axis of transverse end cross section the prescribed constraints and loadswere applied on the two master nodes the longitudinal compressive displacements were imposed on the master points that couple with transverse edges 5 results analysis and discussions 5 1 ultimate strength analysis seven stiffened panels in table 2 are used to investigate the influences of various similarity methods on the collapse modes and ultimate strength between the small and full scale models in which different collapse modes including beam column f1s0 f1sⅱ and stiffener tripping buckling f2s0 f2sⅲ were considered the average longitudinal stress is defined as the value of the imposed external force divided by corresponding cross sectional area of the stiffened panels in which the external force is the total reaction force in the fe analysis or measured compressive force in the tests while the average longitudinal strain is defined as the ratio of the movement on the loading transverse edge to the overall length of the stiffened panels in which the movement is the imposed displacement in the fe analysis or measured movement of the actuator in the tests table 4 presents the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels in the tests and numerical simulations there are several aspects of uncertainties that could cause the differences of the ultimatestrength and deformation between the experimental and numerical methods e g welding residual stress amplitudes of initial imperfections as well as the gaps between the testing coupons and supporting system the minimum and maximum differences of the load carrying capacities between the fem and experiments are about 1 and 8 the mean value and standard deviation of the ratios between the ultimate strength of the tests and numerical simulations are 3 7 and 0 007 respectively considering the uncertainties of fabrication of specimens and laboratory conditions the difference of ultimate strength assessed by the experimental and numerical methods is small and acceptable which illustrates that the technology of numerical modelling could be used in the further study the ultimate strength of the small scale models f1s0 and f2s0 using completely geometrical similarity method are almost the same with that of full scale prototypes f1s and f2s which illustrates that the results of the specimens f1s0 and f2s0 used in the tests could be use as the references for verification because their principal parameters in the equilibrium equations constitutive relations and compatibility conditions that govern the structural response are the same between small scale model and full scale prototype which could give the similar results jones 1974 table 5 shows the differences of the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels with various similarity methods in which rσu fem is the ratio of ultimate strength of the small scale models to the full scale models and rσu test is the ratio of ultimate strength of the small scale models with various similarity methods to the small scale models with completely similarity methods the average differences of the ultimate strength of the specimens between the full and small scale models are 0 7 6 5 and 9 8 for the proposed method dimensional analysis and empirical formulae respectively the partial similarity method using the empirical formulae gives maximum different error during scaling models especially for tripping buckling mode because the empirical formulations generally assume that the ultimate strength only depends on the plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ this assumption means that the ultimate strength of small and full scale models with the same β and λ are the same when these empirical formulations are used to scale model however because the torsional rigidity is also vital to affect the collapse behaviours of stiffeners with tripping buckling the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels with different scales ratios are still different sonin 2001 the dimensional analysis method mainly considers the transformation of structural dimension and response between the full and small scale models which does not consider the effect of buckling behaviours that causes 6 5 difference thus the current partial similarity method should be improved to consider the various buckling behaviours of stiffened panels hence a partial similarity method used different principle parameters for various buckling is proposed it can be seen that the model scaling with the proposed similarity method affects slightly on the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels because for beam column buckling mode the proposed similarity method controls the same dominant column slenderness λ and plate slenderness β which mainly consider the effects of bending stiffness of stiffeners with attached plate for tripping buckling mode additional torsional slenderness λ ω representing the torsional rigidity of stiffeners is considered in which the proposed similarity method has the same β and λ ω when the partial similarity method is adopted for scaling thin wall structure the strategy by considering different principle parameters combinations for different collapse modes would be a good option for designing testing models 5 2 collapse behaviours analysis fig 5 shows the recorded strain histories on strain gauges e1 e5 for the stiffened panels f1s0 and f1sⅱ the positive and negative values of the strains indicate tensile and compressive strains respectively from fig 5 a the longitudinal strain histories between strain gauges e1 and e2 are similar while the strain curve of strain gauge e3 suddenly rises prior to the strain gauges of e1 and e2 the strains on longitudinal middle part of the stiffeners are usually tensile strains e1 and e2 which are opposite to the conjunction part between attached plate and stiffener e4 and e5 hence the characteristics of strain behaviours indicate that the buckling mode of this stiffened panel is plate induced beam column collapse however the measured strain histories have different trends for the stiffener induced beam column buckling mode from fig 5 b due to the large plastic deformations induced from the local buckling of stiffeners the stiffener induced buckling mode has much larger change range of strain histories than that in the plate induced buckling mode the strain on middle top edge of the stiffeners in the longitudinal direction may change from compressive strain to tensile strain hence it is suggested that the similarity methods should maintain the same buckling mode of the stiffened plates with various scales the measured strain histories with tripping buckling are illustrated in fig 6 for the stiffened panel f2s0 which are different from the stiffened panel f1s0 with beam column buckling beam column and tripping buckling modes have different characteristics of collapse deformations and strain distributions which indicate that the stress strain relationships and collapse mechanisms are correspondent to buckling modes as expected figs 7 10 show the collapse deformations of the stiffened panels in the experimental and numerical analyses the collapse deformations in the fe analyses are similar to that in the tests the collapse modes of f2s0 f2si f2sⅱ and f2sⅲ are the same that could be classified as tripping buckling of stiffener this means that the three partial similarity methods also could keep the same buckling mode for the tripping buckling of stiffener however the beam column buckling modes could be caused by plate induced or stiffener induced paik and thayamballi 2007 which is sensitive with the geometrical dimensions the collapse mode of the stiffened panel f1sⅱ using dimensional analysis method is stiffened induced beam column buckling which is different with that of f1s0 with plate induced beam column buckling mode this illustrates that the dimensional analysis similarity method would cause the change of the collapse mode during scaling models for beam column buckling mode hence it is necessary to propose new partial similarity method for considering the buckling mode of thin wall structures it can be seen that the collapse modes of the stiffened panels f1s0 and f1si are the same that could be classified as plate induced beam column buckling from the comparisons of collapse modes of testing specimens with beam column buckling mode the proposed partial similarity method could keep collapse modes of small scale model the same with that of full scale prototype 5 3 average stress average strain relationships fig 11 and fig 12 shows the curves of average stress versus average strain in the fe analyses and experiments respectively in the tests the initial structural moduli between the full and small scale models for the three partial similarity methods completely geometrical similarity proposed similarity method dimensional analysis are similar this means that the three partial similarity methods could be used to scale model if the buckling behaviours are not included however the stress strain curves of the stiffened panel f1sⅱin fig 11 b using dimensional analysis sharply drop after collapse whose post collapse behaviour is different with that of f1s0 this partial similarity method with dimensional analysis may change the post collapse behaviours and the collapse mode that can be seen from the comparison of fig 9 a and e the average stress histories of the stiffened panels f1s0 and f1si gradually decrease after collapse which are similar this indicates that the proposed partial similarity method could give similar average stress histories for pre and post buckling during scaling models the loading paths of the stiffened panels are the same before collapse in the fe analyses as expected however the initial structural modulus in the third load cycle is slightly larger than that of the first and second loading cycles as shown in fig 11 because there exist the welding residual stress and the gaps between the supporting structure and specimens actually the first and second loading cycles intend to release welding residual stress and reduce the influence of the gaps between the specimens and supporting structure this also indicates that it is necessary to eliminate the installation and fabrication errors in the tests the differences of ultimate strength of the stiffened panels between the tests and fem in table 4 are small and acceptable considering the uncertainties of laboratory conditions but their initial structural modulus are different because the recorded axial displacements in the tests are the imposed movements of the bottom actuator which included the longitudinal shortenings of both the steel cylinders and test coupons see fig 3 the axial shortening of cylinders exerts different impacts on the total measured displacements which depends on not only the stress state but also the length of supporting structures although the cross section of the supporting cylinders is larger than that of the specimens the length of cylinders is also much larger than test specimens there exists axial deformation of the supporting steel cylinders due to compressive loads hence for obtaining more accuracy of the structural shortening the movement measurement equipment is suggested to set on the specimen s edges to reduce the influences of supporting structures due to its deformations besides the local contact gaps between the specimens and supporting structure see fig 13 are inevitable to be completely eliminated in the experimental installation and manufacture of the testing coupons the contact conditions between the transverse end edges and supporting plates might slightly vary for various testing coupons fig 13 a shows the contact condition between the testing coupons and supporting plate in front view in which there exist local gaps marked in red lines meanwhile fig 13 b illustrates the typical end edge of middle longitudinal section in which the actual outline plotted in black line is not vertical as theoretical outline due to welding deformations and assembling precision these phenomena indicate that the real contact zones are not the whole transverse section but only local structures in some cases which induce larger compression strain in the elastic stage and easier entering the plastic state thus the local contact structures between the test coupons and supporting plate would be much greatly shortened under compressive loads especially when a large part of contact zone enters inelastic state the effect of local contact gaps is another reason of errors for measured displacements in the tests the local contact zone with gaps could affect on the stress strain relationship and then the initial structural modulus of the testing specimens the gaps between the supporting cylinders and local contact structures influence the measured shortening which cause the measured strain in the tests is larger than the calculated strain in the numerical method and then influence the initial structural modulus by contrast due to the equilibrium of stress in a quasi static system the steel cylinders and local contact structures can fully transfer compression loads equally along the test coupons disregarding the size and shape of contact surfaces this explains that the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels between the fem and test are very close but their stress strain curves are different at the beginning of loading namely the measured stress of the testing specimens could be considered accurate but the measured strain and initial structural modulus might be not the same with actual value during fabrication process of the testing specimens and supporting structures the local contact gaps should be reduced as possible to increase the testing precision 5 4 discussions of similarity methods table 4 shows that the ultimate strength and average stress strain curves of the small scale models with completely geometrical similarity method f1s0 and f2s0 are almost the same with the prototype model f1s and f2s in the numerical analyses for both beam column and tripping buckling as expected this means that the results of the small scale model using completely geometrical similarity method could be used for verifications nevertheless to scale thin walled structures for testing the completely geometrical similarity is generally difficult to be employed to scale stiffened panels due to the limitations of geometrical dimension for most of cases the partial similarity strategies with different scale ratios between length and thickness should be developed however the partial similarity methods would to some degree change the geometrical features of stiffened plates which cause dimensional distortions and then induce the change of collapse modes the first important aspect is to find the principal parameters that dominate the influences of dimensional distortions on collapse behaviours to investigate the influences of various partial similarity methods on the collapse behaviours the average stress strain curves of the attached plate and stiffener in the fe analyses are plotted separately in fig 14 and fig 15 the average stress strain curves on the attached plates with dimensional analysis are different with the others this means the dimensional direction analysis might not appropriate for considering the buckling behaviours of stiffened panels under compressive loads the ultimate strength and stress strain relationships with proposed method f1si are very close to that with the full scale prototype f1s from table 4 and figs 11 and 14 since plate slenderness β reflects the stiffness of local plates while column slenderness λ denotes the bending rigidity of stiffened panels as a beam unit which are the critical principle parameters with slight influences of dimensional distortions for beam column buckling mode the proposed partial similarity method keeps the full and small scale models have the same β and λ which could ensures their collapse deformations and ultimate strength are close for the stiffened panels with beam column buckling for tripping buckling mode the stress strain curve of the attached stiffeners f2sⅲ with empirical formulae is different with that of the full scale model in fig 15 b because of the column slenderness λ is not the dominate parameter to govern the tripping buckling of stiffener in this case the torsional slenderness λ ω should be considered from figs 12 and 15 it can be seen that the ultimate strength and average stress strain curves of the small scale models with proposed similarity method f2si are similar to that of the prototype f2s this phenomenon indicates that plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λ ω could govern the tripping buckling process since β represents the stiffness of local plates and λ ω denotes the torsional stiffness of the stiffener with attached plate the proposed similarity method that ensures the close β and λ ω could give the similar ultimate strength for small scale models with tripping buckling mode this means that different principal parameters combination for partial similarity methods should be used for various collapse modes since it is sometimes difficult to keep the plate slenderness β column slenderness λ and torsional slenderness λ ω of the full and small scale models are all the same at the same time the stress strain curves for attached plate or stiffener for dimensional analysis are different from that of prototype model f1s in figs 14 and 15 which eventually results in different buckling mode and ultimate strength thus the dimensional analysis might not appropriate when the buckling behaviours are considered in summary the completely geometrical similarity produces almost the same buckling behaviours among various scale stiffened panels but may be not practical considering fabrication of specimens the dimensional analysis method might change the collapse modes for the partial similarity methods the dominant parameters in tripping buckling mode should be different from beam column buckling mode because of different collapse mechanisms hence plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ govern the buckling process with beam column buckling mode but the principal slenderness becomes β and torsional slenderness λ ω instead of λ for tripping buckling mode the proposed similarity method maintaining the close β λ for beam column and β λ ω for tripping buckling could obtain the similar collapse behaviours which should be a good option for scaling testing models for the assessment of ultimate strength of stiffened panels while the empirical formulae excluding torsional slenderness λ ω may induce larger errors of ultimate strength for tripping buckling the strategy of partial similarity method for various collapse modes still could be used to other buckling modes e g web local buckling mode however in which the principle parameter combinations that influence collapse mode should be considered during scaling test models 6 conclusions considering the fabrication of testing specimens the completely geometrical similarity may not be economical or practical for thin wall structures e g stiffened panels moreover the partial similarity methods would lead to dimensional distortions when the buckling behaviours are accounted for hence various similarity methods are used to design small scale models whose collapse behaviours are investigated in the experiments and numerical simulations the following conclusions are developed 1 the dimensional direction analysis could be used to scale model for static linear analysis but might not appropriate for considering the buckling behaviours of stiffened panels under compressive loads the testing results of small scale model using completely geometrical similarity method could be used as reference for verifications 2 the partial similarity method might cause the change of the collapse mode and then influence the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels for designing the small scale testing models under longitudinal compression the buckling behaviours should be considered for the assessment of ultimate strength of stiffened panels 3 it is suggested that different determinate parameters should be considered for various collapse modes to reduce the dimensional distortion during model scaling when partial similitude method is adopted in the model scaling both plate slenderness and column slenderness are the priority considered parameters for beam column collapse mode however for tripping buckling mode column slenderness and torsional slenderness should be considered firstly 4 the proposed strategy of partial similarity method by considering different principle parameters combinations for various collapse modes could give the same collapse mode and similar average stress history for pre and post buckling which would be a good option for designing testing models credit authorship contribution statement ming cai xu conceptualization methodology supervision zhao jun song

21248,the independent escape capsule an important facility of submarine search and rescue sar system gains extensive attention recently however researches on its ejection performance are rare not to mention the studies of structural design in terms of this theme in this paper the vibration absorptive materials clinging to the inner wall of its housing are used and hydrodynamic responses of the capsule at a particular orientation in steady uniform currents under various design parameters such as rigidity friction coefficient and thickness are simulated in order to study this interdisciplinary problem of fluid structure interaction and multi body dynamics a simulation model loosely coupled scheme based on fluent version 13 0 1 is adopted with complement of the contact force between the capsule and the vibration absorptive materials specifically fluent is used to assess the hydrodynamic force acting on the capsule distributed force mode and material mechanics method are adopted to obtain the contact force and then fourth order runge kutta method is implemented to calculate the motion equations of the capsule discussion of motion characteristics of the capsule indicates that this vibration absorptive design helps the ejection of the capsule mechanism of vibration absorptive design is discussed and some design suggestions are given keywords fluid structure interaction hydrodynamic motion ejection performance vibration absorptive materials independent escape capsule 1 introduction the independent escape capsule is widely equipped in submarines of navies of various nations helischer 1986 pichugin and kondratenko 1998 and lapenna 2010 compared three different kinds of existing submarine search and rescue sar facilities individual escape group escape and group rescue devices and indicated that the independent escape capsule one of group escape devices provides the most reliable way to rescue crews the improved response time and design depth of capsule help crews escape from the disabled submarine in time in deep sea scenario grob 2007 lapenna 2009 however researches of this equipment are rare until now the independent escape capsule is generally a thin walled axisymmetric structure similar to submarine pressure hull exposed to the strong hydrostatic pressure underwater liang et al 2004 ross et al 2005 radha and rajagopalan 2006 pan and cui 2010 and mackay et al 2011 studied the structural strength of different kinds of thin walled rotary structures such as ring stiffened cylinder sphere and multiple intersecting spheres seals are the vital components of capsule and they help maintain the watertight and installation of capsule yokoyama et al 1998 shen et al 2016 and wu et al 2017 discussed the sealability of o ring seals the capsule ascends toward sea surface after separation from its housing which is a similar problem of the submarine rising maneuvers cadcom inc 1970 developed a program modsec to calculate this real time motion of capsule during ascent watt 2007 and bettle et al 2009 studied stability problem of buoyantly rising submarine a good seakeeping quality of capsule under relentless wave wind and current is needed to ensure the safety of survivors upon reaching sea level lapenna 2009 studied the static stability and dynamic stability of a surfacing rescue container src seakeeping characteristics of the similar rotary structure such as buoy were also discussed carpenter et al 1995 leonard et al 2000 search of the open literature sources indicates that the relevant studies of capsule are rare and most of them are on the structural strength check installation and seakeeping quality of capsule the ejection performance of capsule is in urgent need of research because assessment of the possibility that the capsule becomes permanently lodged in its housing as it ejected is directly connected with the implementation of the function of the escape capsule recently several literatures published by the same authors of this paper have discussed the ejection process of capsule zhang et al 2017 attempted to use a direct analysis approach to simulate the ejection process of capsule in still water hydrodynamic force on the capsule was assessed by fluent beforehand and then introduced into the finite element model in abaqus dassault systèmes simulia corp 2007 to solve the dynamic equations of capsule in order to get rid of getting stuck the gap between the capsule and its housing was calculated under the assumption that the capsule should not contact with the inner wall of its housing during the whole ejection process yu 2006 however this direct analysis approach does not account for the real time fluid structure interaction fsi phenomenon and the capsule would still slide along its housing in some actual contact scenarios which lead to the small design gap in engineering application with simultaneous consideration of the limited installation space for the capsule inside submarine in order to solve the numerical divergence difficulty of this fsi problem of the capsule in its narrow housing with small gap zhang et al 2019a proposed a simulation model loosely coupled scheme based on fluent to simulate the hydrodynamic behavior of rigid body with strong added mass effect caused by the small gap in still water at each time step hydrodynamic force on the capsule was obtained by fluent firstly and then added mass force of the capsule was decomposed from hydrodynamic force to build the new single degree of freedom 1 dof motion equation of rigid body at last the fourth order runge kutta method was applied to solve this new 1 dof motion equation motion parameters in the depth direction of the vertically ejected rigid body under its net buoyancy from a narrow space into an open field were obtained and the corresponding flow field was analyzed it is well known that the upright condition of capsule in the disabled submarine is hard to maintain and ocean environment cannot be neglect ocean current exerts the lateral load on underwater structures burgdorf 1987 teigen et al 1999 fang et al 2008 dong et al 2015 under which the capsule would inevitably rotate and touch the inner wall of its housing during the ejection process zhang et al 2019b proposed a loosely couple scheme for this fsi problem under variable constraint conditions provided by its narrow housing in which plane hydrodynamic motion and random contact force between two rigid bodies the capsule and its housing were simulated the ejection performance of capsule at a particular orientation 45 in different current velocities 0 3 m s and 0 5144 m s was assessed it is found that the capsule bounces back and forth vibrates heavily during ejection process and eventually gets stuck in its housing due to the huge contact force generated between the rigid capsule and its housing even though the tiny friction coefficient 0 1 is adopted the ejection performance of capsule needs to be improved in order to guarantee the realization of its function as to carry crews successfully out of the wrecked submarine it is not an easy task under the given physical design of capsule and its housing the similar ejection problem of the submarine launched missile on the stage of out of its tube is studied as well as its structural design it is found that adaptors or vibration reduction pads are usually packed between the missile and its launching tube sun et al 2014 wang et al 2018 they provide lateral support and shock protection during the launching process to help maintain the attitude of missile when leaving its tube besides the researches of the effect of adaptors or vibration reduction pads on the hydrodynamic behavior of submarine launched missile are also rarely seen until now enlightened by this structural design of missile launching system the vibration absorptive design would be introduced for a good ejection performance of the independent escape capsule the aim of this paper is to solve the fsi problem of the ejection process of capsule under different vibration absorptive materials in current environment the motion parameters and trajectory of capsule are compared and the mechanism of vibration absorptive design on the ejection performance of capsule is discussed the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the simulation model loosely coupled scheme proposed in zhang et al 2019b is introduced briefly and the distributed force mode and material mechanics method for the calculation of contact force between the capsule and vibration absorptive materials are described the added masses of capsule at a particular orientation 45 are calculated in section 3 in section 4 numerical verification of the simulation model is given and the ejection process of a capsule under vibration absorptive materials is presented section 5 studies the effects of rigidity friction coefficient and thickness of the vibration absorptive materials on the hydrodynamic behavior of capsule and the mechanism of vibration absorptive design is discussed the major conclusions are given in section 6 2 numerical model fig 1 a shows the physical model of the independent escape capsule inside its housing with four strips of vibration absorptive materials the attitude of the capsule is determined by the hovering attitude of the disabled submarine two cutaway views in fig 1 a introduce the details of the capsule as well as the vibration absorptive materials the capsule is a homogeneous cylinder with two hemi ellipsoidal end caps and its main parameters are listed in table 1 the breadth and thickness of one strip of the vibration absorptive materials are denoted by b m and t m respectively considering the axisymmetric structure of the capsule plane motion is discussed if ocean current is in its axisymmetric plane the two dimensional simulation is undertaken in consideration of this plane motion and saving the computational resources fig 1 b describes the fsi problem of the hydrodynamic behavior of capsule during the ejection process under its net buoyancy the difference between buoyancy f b and gravity g the capsule is treated as a moving rigid body interacting with fluid flow under variable constraint conditions provided by the vibration absorptive materials flow field and the vibration absorptive materials provide hydrodynamic force denoted by force f h and moment m h and contact force denoted by normal force n and friction force f on the capsule for the calculation of its movement respectively the motion characteristics obtained offer boundary conditions to simulate flow field and establish the constitutive relation of the vibration absorption materials in return in order to solve this fsi problem of ejection process of the capsule using vibration absorptive design the loosely coupled scheme as shown in fig 2 proposed in zhang et al 2019b is adopted with the distributed force mode and material mechanics method being implemented for the calculation of contact force between the rigid capsule and vibration absorptive materials 2 1 hydrodynamic force calculation the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are used to describe the incompressible and homogeneous flow field around the moving capsule 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x i ρ g i p x i x j μ u i x

are obtained the hydrodynamic force on the capsule can be obtained as 3 f h s p n d s 4 m h s p r n d s where s denotes the surface of the capsule n is the unit normal vector directed outward from the fluid region r is the position vector 2 2 contact force calculation this paper does not discuss the specific components of the vibration absorptive materials and only the main characteristics of the materials are investigated such as rigidity friction coefficient and thickness the two dimensional figure in fig 3 shows the contact behavior between the capsule and the vibration absorptive materials which is different from that of two rigid bodies zhang et al 2019b distributed loads are formed on the contacting surfaces and are perpendicular to the surface of the capsule two typical types of distributed load triangular distributed load on l ab and trapezoid distributed load on l de would occur during ejection process considering the small rotational displacement of the capsule inside its limited housing the deformation of point c on the contacting surface is chosen as depicted in fig 3 the constitutive relation of linear elasticity is adopted the distributed force n c and moment m nc at point c are 5 n c k δ d c δ l c n 6 m n c k δ d c δ l c r n where k is the rigidity of the vibration absorptive materials δd c and δl c are the deformation and the corresponding contacting length at point c respectively n is the unit normal vector of the distributed force the overall normal force along l ab or l de can be expressed as 7 n l k δ d n d l 8 m n l k δ d r n d l the basic coulomb model is adopted to describe the friction behavior between the capsule and vibration absorptive materials in which two contacting surfaces can bear friction force up to a certain magnitude before they begin to slide relatively to each other and the maximum friction force is determined by the normal force and the friction coefficient the friction force is expressed as 9 f μ f l k δ d τ d l 10 m f μ f l k δ d r τ d l where μ f is the friction coefficient without considering the lubrication of water between the capsule and vibration absorptive materials τ is the unit tangential vector 2 3 motion equations considering strong added mass effect the independent escape capsule undertakes variable accelerated motion under its net buoyancy during ejection process meanwhile the accelerated capsule drives the adjacent fluid to move this inertial force formed by the adjacent fluid namely the added mass force hinders the movement of the capsule the added mass force of capsule is huge in its narrow housing zhang et al 2019a brummelen 2009 ryzhakov et al 2013 dunbar et al 2015 and naseri et al 2018 indicated that this strong added mass effect would lead to the numerical troubles such as instability and divergence of loosely coupled scheme in order to overcome those numerical difficulties artificial added mass method causin et al 2005 förster et al 2007 yvin et al 2018 provides a reference solution and then zhang et al 2019a and b derived new motion equations of the capsule in which hydrodynamic force is decomposed into resistance and added mass force the details of derivation process refer to our previously published paper zhang et al 2019b here only the obtained plane motion equations in o xy plane considering strong added mass effect are introduced 11 m λ 11 t δ t a x l

cartesian coordinates superscript l denotes the results obtained by the loosely coupled scheme fourth order runge kutta method is used to solve those differential equations 3 added mass calculation as the proposed loosely coupled scheme zhang et al 2019b suggested the added mass of capsule should be calculated before the simulation of the hydrodynamic behavior of capsule fig 4 shows the two dimensional computational domain of the capsule at a particular orientation the angle between housing fixed coordinate o x y and earth coordinate o εη is set as 45 which is the maximum designed angle of the disabled submarine the ejection performance of capsule should be guaranteed inside this inclined submarine housing the inner diameter of the housing b is 0 600 m leaving the gap between the outer surface of the capsule and the inner surface of its housing equals to 0 100 m 0 050 m in each side the open domain outside the housing of the capsule is of the adequate depth 2 5h and width 3h h is the height of capsule non slip wall boundary condition is adopted at the top and bottom surfaces of the computational domain as well as the surfaces of the housing the two lateral surfaces are also set as non slip wall boundary condition in the calculation of added mass of capsule firstly the proper grid system and time step are chosen through the convergence study of hydrodynamic force on the capsule then the added masses of capsule at the inclined housing 45 are computed and curve fitting method is applied to obtain the added mass curves of the capsule during its ejection process 3 1 convergence of hydrodynamic force hybrid mesh is used to discrete the computational domain fig 5 shows the coarse g1 medium g2 and fine g3 grid systems the heights of the first layer mesh around the capsule in these three grid systems are 8 mm 4 mm and 1 mm respectively besides three different time steps 0 01s 0 001s and 0 0001s are used user defined function udf in fluent is used to define the accelerated motion of the capsule the uniform acceleration v y t t is illustrated for the mesh and time step sensitivity studies the capsule starts to eject from its initial installation position y 0 0 m fig 6 shows the obtained hydrodynamic force curves hydrodynamic force converges with increasing mesh density and decreasing time step the grid system g2 and time step δt 0 001s produce the convergent result and are adopted in the following calculation of the added mass of capsule 3 2 added mass curves of the capsule the shape of flow field of the narrow domain influences the added mass of the inside object zhang et al 2019a and b the main changes of flow field are induced by the movement of the capsule along its axis direction y axis in fig 4 in its housing and are considered to calculate the added mass of capsule at different positions during ejection process curve fitting method is then used to obtain the added mass curves the capsule undergoes plane motion in its o xy plane and then three different uniformly accelerated motions v x t t v y t t ω z t t are defined the translational added masses of the capsule along its x and y axes are denoted by λ 11 and λ 22 respectively the rotational added mass around z axis is λ 66 fig 7 illustrates velocity contour around the capsule at three different positions y 0 0 m y 0 1 200 m y 0 2 600 m at t 0 02s the velocity of flow in calculation of λ 11 as seen in fig 7 a at the same corresponding positions is the largest among these three different calculations which is followed by that in calculation of λ 66 as seen in fig 7 c and the velocity of flow dragged by the uniformly accelerated capsule v y t t is the smallest as seen in fig 7 b the flow around the top end cap spreads around as the capsule departs from its housing from y 0 0 m in left to y 0 2 600 m in right and the velocity of flow falls with the decrease of the blockage effect of its housing it is also noted that the values of velocity around the capsule are similar to those of the vertically ejected capsule in its housing zhang et al 2019b added masses of the capsule can be calculated once the flow details are obtained in this case the same fitting formulas zhang et al 2019b of added mass curves are obtained 14 c 11 y 0 47 025 24 812 y 0 0 y 0 0 200 10 942 y 0 2 43 808 y 0 50 387 0 200 y 0 1 200 22 101 7 107 y 0 1 200 y 0 1 800 13 915 2

22 and λ 66 respectively 4 hydrodynamic motion of the capsule under vibration absorptive materials the hydrodynamic motion of capsule under the vibration absorptive materials is simulated with the added mass curves obtained above the rigidity friction coefficient and thickness of the vibration absorptive materials are 2 000 105n m 0 6 and 0 035 m respectively the computational domain of the ejected capsule at a particular orientation in current environment is presented in fig 4 the velocity of ocean current is 0 5144 m s the direction of ocean current is represented by the angle between the flow velocity and y axis of housing fixed coordinate system consequently two different ocean currents 135 and 45 are considered different from the boundary conditions defined in section 3 the two lateral surfaces of the computational domain are set as velocity inlet and pressure outlet respectively numerical verification of the ejection process of capsule under vibration absorptive materials by the proposed loosely coupled scheme is introduced through grid and time step sensitive studies firstly and then the motion characteristics of the capsule at a particular orientation in ocean current are presented 4 1 numerical verification the hydrodynamic motion of the capsule in its inclined housing 45 in ocean current 135 is studied to verify the numerical simulations by the loosely coupled scheme three grid systems as seen in fig 5 are adopted three different time steps are 0 005s 0 001s and 0 0005s respectively before simulating the fsi problem of hydrodynamic motion of the ejected capsule in ocean current a proper initial flow field is needed firstly the ocean current 135 environment is obtained by transient calculation of flow field with capsule keeping still in its inclined housing fig 8 shows the steady flow details around top cap of the capsule using medium grid system g2 and time step of 0 001s the value of pressure on the top cap of the capsule as seen in fig 8 a shows little difference velocity vector as seen in fig 8 b indicates that some eddies exist at two shoulders around top cap of the capsule hydrodynamic force on the capsule is obtained by integrating the pressure on the surface of the capsule fig 9 gives the hydrodynamic force curves it can be seen that force component curves convergence to stable values at the end of the simulation the lateral force f h ε along ε axis in earth coordinate is slightly smaller than 0 which means the hydrodynamic force of ocean current push the capsule along ε direction the lateral force f h η along η axis in earth coordinate is larger than 0 and it drags the capsule up towards the sea surface moment m h equals to 0 ocean current does not drive the capsule to rotate the capsule is ejected in the flow obtained above under the action of its residual buoyancy loosely coupled scheme is then adopted at each time step flow field is calculated by fluent and the pressure on the surface of the capsule is integrated to obtain its hydrodynamic force as for contact force between the capsule and vibration absorptive materials the trajectory of capsule is firstly used to judge whether contact occurs or not and then the constitutive relation of linear elasticity is adopted to calculate this contact force the mathematic expressions for contact force refer to eqs 7 10 hydrodynamic force and contact force are substituted into the plane motion equations of capsule as well as the added masses obtained in section 3 fourth order runge kutta method is used to compute those differential equations the obtained motion characteristics provide boundary conditions of flow calculation in return at the next time step fig 10 compares translational velocities of the ejected capsule inside its inclined housing in ocean currents 135 using three different grid systems and time steps v ε and v η are translational velocities of reference point o as seen in fig 4 of the capsule in earth coordinate the velocity curves obtained by the loosely coupled scheme are monotonically convergent with the increase of grid densities and decrease of time steps there are small differences between solutions using medium and fine grid systems or using time steps of 0 001s and 0 0005s the medium grid system g2 and time step of 0 001s produce convergent solutions and thereby be adopted in the following case studies in order to save computation resource and simulation time 4 2 ejection process of the capsule the ejection processes of the capsule in two different ocean currents 135 and 45 are discussed here fig 11 gives the hydrodynamic force curves during the ejection process of the capsule hydrodynamic force on the reference point o as seen in fig 4 of the capsule is divided into three components lateral force f h ε lift force f h η and moment m h in o εη plane lateral force and lift force curves show the same trend as for those two forces obtained in ocean current 135 their values stay stable at the beginning of the ejection process and are followed by two big fluctuations between which the same stable value at the beginning is seen after t 7 351s they back to the stable value and then some oscillations occur from about t 8 451s to t 9 801s which are followed by a rapid increase and a slow decrease from t 10 851s to t 14s lateral force and lift force change with different values the stable values of lateral and lift forces are about 30 n and 700 n respectively three peak values reach about 1000 n 650 n and 1650 n in sequence for lateral force while those for lift force are 2600 n 1300 n and 2500 n different from force curves in ocean current 135 there is another fluctuation from t 9 751s to t 11 401s in lateral and lift force curves in current 45 which is followed by some oscillations with decreasing trend moment on the capsule oscillates with large amplitude the maximum amplitude in current 135 exceeds 17000 n m while that in current 45 is about 8500 n m fig 12 shows the motion characteristics of the referent point of the capsule during its ejection process v ε and v η are the translational components of the velocity of the capsule along ε and η axes in earth coordinate respectively ω z is its rotational component ε η and θ are the corresponding displacements in o εη plane the capsule starts to float under its net buoyancy the resultant force of buoyancy f b and gravity g it is believed that the capsule would move upwards along η axis with no movement in the lateral direction along ε axis however it can be seen from fig 12 a and c or fig 12 b and d that the components of velocity and displacement along η and ε axis have almost the same values at the beginning of the ejection process this phenomenon is caused by added masses of the capsule c 11 is much bigger than c 22 and then the movement of the capsule along x axis in capsule fixed coordinate driven by the component of net buoyancy along x axis is small so the capsule moves along its y axis at the beginning of the ejection process rather than along η axis in earth coordinate all the velocity curves show increasing trend during the whole ejection process with some decreases and small fluctuations except that the curve of v ε in ocean current 135 ends up with a fall the value of v ε in ocean current 135 at the end of calculation is less than 0 1 m s minus sign means the capsule moves along the ε axis while that in current 45 is about 0 5 m s the rotational velocity ω z of the capsule oscillates around 0 rad s then it falls slowly from 0 rad s at t 12s to about 0 3 rad s at t 14s in ocean current 135 while ω z in ocean current 45 ends up with a sharp increase to nearly 0 3 rad s at t 13 34s as for the spatial displacements ε and η their values increase nonlinearly with time the value of ε is smaller than 0 m it means that the capsule moves along ε axis and the capsule floats toward sea level with η 0 m the rotational displacement θ of the capsule fluctuates around 0 rad and then it increases from 0 rad at t 10s to 0 264 rad at t 14s in ocean current 135 while it falls to 0 035 rad at t 13 34s in ocean current 45 fig 13 a and b give the trajectories of the capsule in two different ocean currents 135 and 45 as well as the attitude of the capsule outside of its housing at the end of simulation those two attitudes of the capsule are consistent with the rotational displacement curves in fig 12 c and d in which the rotational displacement of the capsule in ocean current 45 is smaller than that in ocean current 135 at the end of simulation ocean current 45 exerts positive moment on the capsule to hinder its rotational movement four red curves represent the trajectories of four corner points of the capsule from which the contact behavior between the capsule and the vibration absorptive materials could be judged the dashed rectangular boxes mark the positions along the height of the capsule s housing where contact occurs the capsule contacts with the vibration absorptive materials at four different positions during the whole ejection process the capsule interacts with only one strip of the vibration absorptive materials in ocean current 135 while it collides with both two strips of materials attached to the inner surfaces of the housing in ocean current 45 the periods when contact happens are also introduced it can be seen from figs 11 and 12 that those are also times when hydrodynamic force and velocities changes that is to say contact behavior between the capsule and vibration absorptive materials causes the sudden change of hydrodynamic force on the capsule as well as motion characteristics of the capsule this is an important conclusion that would be used to analyze the effect of different vibration absorptive material parameters on the ejection performance of the capsule 5 vibration absorptive design the ejection process of the capsule under vibration absorptive materials in ocean current is simulated above the rigidity represented by k friction coefficient represented by μ f and thickness represented by t m of the vibration absorptive materials are 2 000 105n m 0 6 and 0 035 m respectively it is known from the study above that contact force generated between the capsule and vibration absorptive materials changes hydrodynamic force on the capsule and hydrodynamic movement of the capsule during ejection process different vibration absorptive designs would alter the contact behavior between the capsule and the materials in this section the effects of three main design parameters rigidity friction coefficient and thickness of the vibration absorptive materials on the ejection performance of capsule are studied and the mechanism of vibration absorptive design is discussed in order to promote the ejection performance of the capsule 5 1 the effect of rigidity the friction coefficient and thickness of the vibration absorptive materials keep μ f 0 6 and t m 0 035 m another three different rigidities 1 500 105n m 1 750 105n m and 4 000 108n m are discussed fig 14 gives hydrodynamic force on the reference point of the capsule during its ejection process in two different ocean currents 135 and 45 different from fig 11 two components of hydrodynamic force f h x and f h y in housing fixed coordinate o x y as shown in fig 4 are shown which are obtained through coordinate transformation between earth coordinate o εη and o x y it can be seen that the stable values of f h x and f h y are the same under different rigidities while their peak values of different fluctuations increase with increasing rigidity of the materials hydrodynamic force curves under rigidities 1 500 105n m and 1 750 105n m show the same trend with same amount of fluctuations as those under rigidity of 2 000 105n m while force curves under rigidity 4 000 108n m has more fluctuations the fluctuations under rigidity 4 000 108n m last for a shorter time than those under smaller rigidities it is noted that f h x and f h y soar at the end of ejection process under rigidity 4 000 108n m and f h x in ocean current 135 oscillates severely after t 12s fig 15 shows translational velocities v x and v y of the reference point of the capsule in two different ocean currents 135 and 45 as well as their corresponding displacements x and y those motion characteristics are also obtained through coordinate transformation between coordinates of o εη and o x y in fig 15 a and b v y shows increasing trend during whole ejection process with some decreases while v x fluctuates around 0 m s the changing rate of v x is smaller than that of v y however it can be seen from fig 14 that the changing amplitude of f h x is much bigger than that of f h y added masses of the capsule are the cause c 11 is much bigger than c 22 and then the acceleration of the capsule driven by f h x is smaller than that by f h y hydrodynamic force components soared in value under rigidity 4 000 108n m lead to the drastic change of the corresponding velocity components which can be seen at about t 10s and t 11 5s in ocean current 135 and t 10 7s in ocean current 45 at the end of simulation in ocean current 135 v x increases above 0 m s when rigidity is smaller than 2 000 105n m while it oscillates severely around 0 m s under rigidity of 4 000 108n m at the end of simulation in ocean current 45 v x increases before it drops below 0 m s in fig 15 c and d displacement x increases above 0 m and then fluctuates around 0 015 m which is also the value of the gap b d 2 t m between the capsule and vibration absorptive materials in each side at the end displacement x increases again in ocean current 135 expect that it oscillates around 0 m under rigidity 4 000 108n m while displacement x in ocean current 45 increases followed by a decrease and it also oscillates at the end of simulation when rigidity is 4 000 108n m as for displacement y it increases nonlinearly when rigidity is smaller than 2 000 105n m and it decreases at the end under rigidity 4 000 108n m the discussion of motion characteristics in housing fixed coordinate o x y helps judge the movements of the capsule inside its housing the oscillated displacement x indicates that the capsule bounces severely inside its housing the displacement y represents the sliding distance of the capsule along its housing if y is larger than 2 5 m it means that the capsule escapes from its housing successfully and the ejection process of the capsule is finished it can be seen from fig 15 c and d that several displacements y are smaller than 2 5 m their trajectories during whole ejection process are analyzed and two typical situations are presented in fig 16 fig 16 illustrates the trajectories of the capsule under vibration absorptive materials with two different rigidities 1 750 105n m and 4 000 108n m as well as the position of the capsule represented by the blue dashed outline in fig 16 a at the end of simulation at the end of simulation the surface of the capsule touches the inner surface of its housing in fig 16 a which indicates the failure of the vibration absorptive materials with rigidity of 1 750 105n m four color curves represent the trajectories of four corner points of the capsule in fig 16 b from which the contact behavior between the capsule and the vibration absorptive materials could be judged it can be seen that the capsule vibrates or bounces severely in its housing if rigid of the vibration absorptive materials is as big as 4 000 108n m and the ejection process of the capsule also fails the materials with rigidity of 4 000 108n m can be regarded as rigid body comparison with the trajectories of the capsule under smaller rigidities such as shown in fig 13 explains why the materials bond to the inner surface of housing are named as vibration absorptive materials through the analyses of hydrodynamic force motion characteristics and trajectories of the capsule during its whole ejection process a conclusion can be drawn that the increase of momentum along y axis and the decrease of momentum along x axis of the capsule help promote its ejection performance however contact force between the capsule and the vibration absorptive materials hinders the motion of the capsule along y axis and provide energy to increase the momentum of the capsule along x axis in the meantime small rigidity of the vibration absorptive materials reduces the effect of contact force on the movement of the capsule during its ejection process it is recommended to decrease rigidity of the vibration absorptive materials reasonably to avoid their failure and at the same time promote the ejection performance of the capsule 5 2 the effect of friction coefficient the tangential force between the capsule and the vibration absorptive materials affects the momentum of the capsule along y axis so the rigidity and thickness of the vibration absorptive materials keep k 2 000 105n m and t m 0 035 m and another three different friction coefficients 0 1 0 4 and 0 8 are applied fig 17 compares hydrodynamic force on the capsule under different friction coefficients hydrodynamic force curves present different patterns and smoother curves are obtained with increasing the friction coefficient four intact fluctuations are seen under friction coefficient of 0 8 which followed by three fluctuations with some oscillations under friction coefficient of 0 6 force curves under friction coefficients 0 1 and 0 4 oscillate randomly after the first intact fluctuation the time when the fluctuations of force curves occur is different under different friction coefficients as for the peak value of hydrodynamic force f h x shows little difference under different friction coefficients while f h y grows with increasing the friction coefficient fig 18 shows the motion characteristics of the reference point of the capsule during its ejection process as for velocity curves under friction coefficients 0 1 0 4 and 0 6 v x fluctuates around 0 m s and then it increases above 0 m s quickly at the end of simulation in ocean current 135 while it increases followed by a decrease to below 0 m s in ocean current 45 v y shows increasing trend during whole ejection process with some decreases it is noted that velocity curves during the whole ejection process are smooth expect for the velocity curves under friction coefficients 0 1 and 0 4 at some specific periods for example the velocity curves both v x and v y under friction coefficient 0 1 in ocean current 135 oscillates severely from about t 5 8s to t 9s when hydrodynamic force curves both f h x and f h y as shown in fig 17 also oscillate as for velocity curves under friction coefficient 0 8 they show different patterns they fluctuate and decrease to 0 m s gradually the huge force f h y under friction coefficient 0 8 hinders the motion of the capsule as for displacement curves in fig 18 c and d y increases nonlinearly above 2 5 m with time expect for y under friction coefficient 0 8 displacement x increases above 0 m and then fluctuates around 0 015 m before it increases quickly above 0 015 m at the end of simulation in ocean current 135 while it decreases to below 0 m at some periods in ocean current 45 displacement x under friction coefficient 0 8 stays at 0 015 m at the end of simulation it is concluded that the decrease of friction coefficient of the vibration absorptive materials improves the ejection performance of the capsule it efficiently reduces the time of ejection process and increases the ejected velocity v y but the capsule bounces inside its housing more severely with decreasing the friction coefficient of the vibration absorptive materials 5 3 the effect of thickness fig 16 a presents a failing situation of the vibration absorptive materials so the rigidity and friction coefficient of the vibration absorptive materials keep k 2 000 105n m and μ f 0 6 and another four different thicknesses 0 020 m 0 025 m 0 030 m and 0 045 m are applied fig 19 compares the motion characteristics of the reference point of the capsule under vibration absorptive materials with different thicknesses as for velocity curves v x fluctuates around 0 m s while v y shows increasing trend during whole ejection process with some decreases the decrease of v y happens later with decreasing thickness and the amplitudes of fluctuations of v x grow with decreasing thickness the large amplitude of v x means the large normal force generated between the capsule and the vibration absorptive materials which would easily lead to the failure of the materials so it can be seen from fig 19 c and d that displacements y are smaller than 2 5 m under thickness such as t m 0 020 m and the failure of vibration absorptive materials happens at the end of simulation it is concluded that the increase of the thickness could effectively protect the vibration absorptive material from failure but there is an exception case when t m 0 030 m in ocean current 135 this is because that the ejection process of the capsule is a process of countless collisions with the vibration absorptive materials contact force provides the energy to alter the velocity of the capsule and the momentum of the capsule accumulates during the ejection process it can be seen from fig 19 a that the accumulated maximum velocity v x at about t 10 5s under t m 0 030 m is much bigger than that at about t 9 2s under t m 0 025 m the vibration absorptive materials with t m 0 030 m fail at the end of simulation while the capsule escapes from its housing successfully under the materials with t m 0 025 m in ocean current 135 besides the increase of thickness makes the ejected velocity smaller and even the negative velocity v y of the capsule is seen in the case of t m 0 045 m in ocean current 45 this is a dangerous situation that should be paid more attention during the ejection process of the capsule 6 conclusions the main contribution of this paper is concerned with the proposed vibration absorptive design for the improvement of ejection performance of the independent escape capsule in which vibration absorptive materials adhere to the inner surface of the housing of the capsule the loosely coupled scheme zhang et al 2019b is developed with the complement of contact behavior between the rigid capsule and vibration absorptive materials and adopted to simulate the fsi problem of hydrodynamic motion of the capsule during ejection process firstly numerical verification of this loosely coupled scheme is introduced through grid and time step sensitive studies and then the hydrodynamic behavior of the capsule in ocean currents using vibration absorptive materials at a particular orientation 45 the maximum designed angle of the disabled submarine is simulated hydrodynamic force and motion parameters velocity displacement and trajectory are presented the capsule successfully escapes from its housing by using this vibration absorptive design finally the effects of three main different design parameters rigidity friction coefficient and thickness of the vibration absorptive materials on the ejection performance of the capsule are studied and the mechanism of vibration absorptive design is illustrated discussion of motion characteristics of the capsule indicates that the mechanism of the vibration absorptive design is to increase the capsule s momentum along y axis and decrease the momentum along x axis compared to the ejection process of the capsule under the rigid materials with rigidity of 4 000 108n m the capsule under materials with smaller rigidity vibrates slightly inside its housing the decrease of momentum of the capsule along x axis and its ejection performance is much better it is recommended that the decrease of friction coefficient of the vibration absorptive materials works best the increase of the momentum of the capsule along y axis in term of promoting the ejection performance of the capsule the decrease of rigidity effectively reduces the vibration of the capsule and the increase of thickness of the materials avoids the failure of the vibration absorptive materials during ejection process rigidity and thickness of the vibration absorptive materials should be considered synthetically to obtain a good ejection performance in the future model test of the ejected capsule is planned to validate the accuracy of the convergent solutions obtained by the loosely coupled scheme considering contact behavior between the capsule and its

21248,the independent escape capsule an important facility of submarine search and rescue sar system gains extensive attention recently however researches on its ejection performance are rare not to mention the studies of structural design in terms of this theme in this paper the vibration absorptive materials clinging to the inner wall of its housing are used and hydrodynamic responses of the capsule at a particular orientation in steady uniform currents under various design parameters such as rigidity friction coefficient and thickness are simulated in order to study this interdisciplinary problem of fluid structure interaction and multi body dynamics a simulation model loosely coupled scheme based on fluent version 13 0 1 is adopted with complement of the contact force between the capsule and the vibration absorptive materials specifically fluent is used to assess the hydrodynamic force acting on the capsule distributed force mode and material mechanics method are adopted to obtain the contact force and then fourth order runge kutta method is implemented to calculate the motion equations of the capsule discussion of motion characteristics of the capsule indicates that this vibration absorptive design helps the ejection of the capsule mechanism of vibration absorptive design is discussed and some design suggestions are given keywords fluid structure interaction hydrodynamic motion ejection performance vibration absorptive materials independent escape capsule 1 introduction the independent escape capsule is widely equipped in submarines of navies of various nations helischer 1986 pichugin and kondratenko 1998 and lapenna 2010 compared three different kinds of existing submarine search and rescue sar facilities individual escape group escape and group rescue devices and indicated that the independent escape capsule one of group escape devices provides the most reliable way to rescue crews the improved response time and design depth of capsule help crews escape from the disabled submarine in time in deep sea scenario grob 2007 lapenna 2009 however researches of this equipment are rare until now the independent escape capsule is generally a thin walled axisymmetric structure similar to submarine pressure hull exposed to the strong hydrostatic pressure underwater liang et al 2004 ross et al 2005 radha and rajagopalan 2006 pan and cui 2010 and mackay et al 2011 studied the structural strength of different kinds of thin walled rotary structures such as ring stiffened cylinder sphere and multiple intersecting spheres seals

the capsule ascends toward sea surface after separation from its housing which is a similar problem of the submarine rising maneuvers cadcom inc 1970 developed a program modsec to calculate this real time motion of capsule during ascent watt 2007 and bettle et al 2009 studied stability problem of buoyantly rising submarine a good seakeeping quality of capsule under relentless wave wind and current is needed to ensure the safety of survivors upon reaching sea level lapenna 2009 studied the static stability and dynamic stability of a surfacing rescue container src seakeeping characteristics of the similar rotary structure such as buoy were also discussed carpenter et al 1995 leonard et al 2000 search of the open literature sources indicates that the relevant studies of capsule are rare and most of them are on the structural strength check installation and seakeeping quality of capsule the ejection performance of capsule is in urgent need of research because assessment of the possibility that the capsule becomes permanently lodged in its housing as it ejected is directly connected with the implementation of the function of the escape capsule recently several literatures published by the same authors of this paper have discussed the ejection process of capsule zhang et al 2017 attempted to use a direct analysis approach to simulate the ejection process of capsule in still water hydrodynamic force on the capsule was assessed by fluent beforehand and then introduced into the finite element model in abaqus dassault systèmes simulia corp 2007 to solve the dynamic equations of capsule in order to get rid of getting stuck the gap between the capsule and its housing was calculated under the assumption that the capsule should not contact with the inner wall of its housing during the whole ejection process yu 2006 however this direct analysis approach does not account for the real time fluid structure interaction fsi phenomenon and the capsule would still slide along its housing in some actual contact scenarios which lead to the small design gap in engineering application with simultaneous consideration of the limited installation space for the capsule inside submarine in order to solve the numerical divergence difficulty of this fsi problem of the capsule in its narrow housing with small gap zhang et al 2019a proposed a simulation model loosely coupled scheme based on fluent to simulate the hydrodynamic behavior of rigid body with strong added mass effect caused by the small gap in still water at each time step hydrodynamic force on the capsule was obtained by fluent firstly and then added mass force of the capsule was decomposed from hydrodynamic force to build the new single degree of freedom 1 dof motion equation of rigid body at last the fourth order runge kutta method was applied to solve this new 1 dof motion equation motion parameters in the depth direction of the vertically ejected rigid body under its net buoyancy from a narrow space into an open field were obtained and the corresponding flow field was analyzed it is well known that the upright condition of capsule in the disabled submarine is hard to maintain and ocean environment cannot be neglect ocean current exerts the lateral load on underwater structures burgdorf 1987 teigen et al 1999 fang et al 2008 dong et al 2015 under which the capsule would inevitably rotate and touch the inner wall of its housing during the ejection process zhang et al 2019b proposed a loosely couple scheme for this fsi problem under variable constraint conditions provided by its narrow housing in which plane hydrodynamic motion and random contact force between two rigid bodies the capsule and its housing were simulated the ejection performance of capsule at a particular orientation 45 in different current velocities 0 3 m s and 0 5144 m s was assessed it is found that the capsule bounces back and forth vibrates heavily during ejection process and eventually gets stuck in its housing due to the huge contact force generated between the rigid capsule and its housing even though the tiny friction coefficient 0 1 is adopted the ejection performance of capsule needs to be improved in order to guarantee the realization of its function as to carry crews successfully out of the wrecked submarine it is not an easy task under the given physical design of capsule and its housing the similar ejection problem of the submarine launched missile on the stage of out of its tube is studied as well as its structural design it is found that adaptors or vibration reduction pads are usually packed between the missile and its launching tube sun et al 2014 wang et al 2018 they provide lateral support and shock protection during the launching process to help maintain the attitude of missile when leaving its tube besides the researches of the effect of adaptors or vibration reduction pads on the hydrodynamic behavior of submarine launched missile are also rarely seen until now enlightened by this structural design of missile launching system the vibration absorptive design would be introduced for a good ejection performance of the independent escape capsule the aim of this paper is to solve the fsi problem of the ejection process of capsule under different vibration absorptive materials in current environment the motion parameters and trajectory of capsule are compared and the mechanism of vibration absorptive design on the ejection performance of capsule is discussed the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the simulation model loosely coupled scheme proposed in zhang et al 2019b is introduced briefly and the distributed force mode and material mechanics method for the calculation of contact force between the capsule and vibration absorptive materials are described the added masses of capsule at a particular orientation 45 are calculated in section 3 in section 4 numerical verification of the simulation model is given and the ejection process of a capsule under vibration absorptive materials is presented section 5 studies the effects of rigidity friction coefficient and thickness of the vibration absorptive materials on the hydrodynamic behavior of capsule and the mechanism of vibration absorptive design is discussed the major conclusions are given in section 6 2 numerical model fig 1 a shows the physical model of the independent escape capsule inside its housing with four strips of vibration absorptive materials the attitude of the capsule is determined by the hovering attitude of the disabled submarine two cutaway views in fig 1 a introduce the details of the capsule as well as the vibration absorptive materials the capsule is a homogeneous cylinder with two hemi ellipsoidal end caps and its main parameters are listed in table 1 the breadth and thickness of one strip of the vibration absorptive materials are denoted by b m and t m respectively considering the axisymmetric structure of the capsule plane motion is discussed if ocean current is in its axisymmetric plane the two dimensional simulation is undertaken in consideration of this plane motion and saving the computational resources fig 1 b describes the fsi problem of the hydrodynamic behavior of capsule during the ejection process under its net buoyancy the difference between buoyancy f b and gravity g the capsule is treated as a moving rigid body interacting with fluid flow under variable constraint conditions provided by the vibration absorptive materials flow field and the vibration absorptive materials provide hydrodynamic force denoted by force f h and moment m h and contact force denoted by normal force n and friction force f on the capsule for the calculation of its movement respectively the motion characteristics obtained offer boundary conditions to simulate flow field and establish the constitutive relation of the vibration absorption materials in return in order to solve this fsi problem of ejection process of the capsule using vibration absorptive design the loosely coupled scheme as shown in fig 2 proposed in zhang et al 2019b is adopted with the distributed force mode and material mechanics method being implemented for the calculation of contact force between the rigid capsule and vibration absorptive materials 2 1 hydrodynamic force calculation the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are used to describe the incompressible and homogeneous flow field around the moving capsule 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x i ρ g i p x i x j μ u i x

represent x and y axes of cartesian coordinates respectively superscript denotes ensemble average of the physical variables standard k ϵ turbulence model is used for equation closure once flow details are obtained the hydrodynamic force on the capsule can be obtained as 3 f h s p n d s 4 m h s p r n d s where s denotes the surface of the capsule n is the unit normal vector directed outward from the fluid region r is the position vector 2 2 contact force calculation this paper does not discuss the specific components of the vibration absorptive materials and only the main characteristics of the materials are investigated such as rigidity friction coefficient and thickness the two dimensional figure in fig 3 shows the contact behavior between the capsule and the vibration absorptive materials which is different from that of two rigid bodies zhang et al 2019b distributed loads are formed on the contacting surfaces and are perpendicular to the surface of the capsule two typical types of distributed load triangular distributed load on l ab and trapezoid distributed load on l de would occur during ejection process considering the small rotational displacement of the capsule inside its limited housing the deformation of point c on the contacting surface is chosen as depicted in fig 3 the constitutive relation of linear elasticity is adopted the distributed force n c and moment m nc at point c are 5 n c k δ d c δ l c n 6 m n c k δ d c δ l c r n where k is the rigidity of the vibration absorptive materials δd c and δl c are the deformation and the corresponding contacting length at point c respectively n is the unit normal vector of the distributed force the overall normal force along l ab or l de can be expressed as 7 n l k δ d n d l 8 m n l k δ d r n d l the basic coulomb model is adopted to describe the friction behavior between the capsule and vibration absorptive materials in which two contacting surfaces can bear friction force up to a certain magnitude before they begin to slide relatively to each other and the maximum friction force is determined by the normal force and the friction coefficient the friction force is expressed as 9 f μ f l k δ d τ d l 10 m f μ f l k δ d r τ d l where μ f is the friction coefficient without considering the lubrication of water between the capsule and vibration absorptive materials τ is the unit tangential vector 2 3 motion equations considering strong added mass effect the independent escape capsule undertakes variable accelerated motion under its net buoyancy during ejection process meanwhile the accelerated capsule drives the adjacent fluid to move this inertial force formed by the adjacent fluid namely the added mass force hinders the movement of the capsule the added mass force of capsule is huge in its narrow housing zhang et al 2019a brummelen 2009 ryzhakov et al 2013 dunbar et al 2015 and naseri et al 2018 indicated that this strong added mass effect would lead to the numerical troubles such as instability and divergence of loosely coupled scheme in order to overcome those numerical difficulties artificial added mass method causin et al 2005 förster et al 2007 yvin et al 2018 provides a reference solution and then zhang et al 2019a and b derived new motion equations of the capsule in which hydrodynamic force is decomposed into resistance and added mass force the details of derivation process refer to our previously published paper zhang et al 2019b here only the obtained plane motion equations in o xy plane considering strong added mass effect are introduced 11 m λ 11 t δ t a x l

δ t ω z t m n z t δ t m f z t δ t where m and i are the mass and inertia of the capsule respectively a and ω are the spatial and angular acceleration respectively subscripts x y z represent axes of cartesian coordinates superscript l denotes the results obtained by the loosely coupled scheme fourth order runge kutta method is used to solve those differential equations 3 added mass calculation as the proposed loosely coupled scheme zhang et al 2019b suggested the added mass of capsule should be calculated before the simulation of the hydrodynamic behavior of capsule fig 4 shows the two dimensional computational domain of the capsule at a particular orientation the angle between housing fixed coordinate o x y and earth coordinate o εη is set as 45 which is the maximum designed angle of the disabled submarine the ejection performance of capsule should be guaranteed inside this inclined submarine housing the inner diameter of the housing b is 0 600 m leaving the gap between the outer surface of the capsule and the inner surface of its housing equals to 0 100 m 0 050 m in each side the open domain outside the housing of the capsule is of the adequate depth 2 5h and width 3h h is the height of capsule non slip wall boundary condition is adopted at the top and bottom surfaces of the computational domain as well as the surfaces of the housing the two lateral surfaces are also set as non slip wall boundary condition in the calculation of added mass of capsule firstly the proper grid system and time step are chosen through the convergence study of hydrodynamic force on the capsule then the added masses of capsule at the inclined housing 45 are computed and curve fitting method is applied to obtain the added mass curves of the capsule during its ejection process 3 1 convergence of hydrodynamic force hybrid mesh is used to discrete the computational domain fig 5 shows the coarse g1 medium g2 and fine g3 grid systems the heights of the first layer mesh around the capsule in these three grid systems are 8 mm 4 mm and 1 mm respectively besides three different time steps 0 01s 0 001s and 0 0001s are used user defined function udf in fluent is used to define the accelerated motion of the capsule the uniform acceleration v y t t is illustrated for the mesh and time step sensitivity studies the capsule starts to eject from its initial installation position y 0 0 m fig 6 shows the obtained hydrodynamic force curves hydrodynamic force converges with increasing mesh density and decreasing time step the grid system g2 and time step δt 0 001s produce the convergent result and are adopted in the following calculation of the added mass of capsule 3 2 added mass curves of the capsule the shape of flow field of the narrow domain influences the added mass of the inside object zhang et al 2019a and b the main changes of flow field are induced by the movement of the capsule along its axis direction y axis in fig 4 in its housing and are considered to calculate the added mass of capsule at different positions during ejection process curve fitting method is then used to obtain the added mass curves the capsule undergoes plane motion in its o xy plane and then three different uniformly accelerated motions v x t t v y t t ω z t t are defined the translational added masses of the capsule along its x and y axes are denoted by λ 11 and λ 22 respectively the rotational added mass around z axis is λ 66 fig 7 illustrates velocity contour around the capsule at three different positions y 0 0 m y 0 1 200 m y 0 2 600 m at t 0 02s the velocity of flow in calculation of λ 11 as seen in fig 7 a at the same corresponding positions is the largest among these three different calculations which is followed by that in calculation of λ 66 as seen in fig 7 c and the velocity of flow dragged by the uniformly accelerated capsule v y t t is the smallest as seen in fig 7 b the flow around the top end cap spreads around as the capsule departs from its housing from y 0 0 m in left to y 0 2 600 m in right and the velocity of flow falls with the decrease of the blockage effect of its housing it is also noted that the values of velocity around the capsule are similar to those of the vertically ejected capsule in its housing zhang et al 2019b added masses of the capsule can be calculated once the flow details are obtained in this case the same fitting formulas zhang et al 2019b of added mass curves are obtained 14 c 11 y 0 47 025 24 812 y 0 0 y 0 0 200 10 942 y 0 2 43 808 y 0 50 387 0 200 y 0 1 200 22 101 7 107 y 0 1 200 y 0 1 800 13 915 2

22 and λ 66 respectively 4 hydrodynamic motion of the capsule under vibration absorptive materials the hydrodynamic motion of capsule under the vibration absorptive materials is simulated with the added mass curves obtained above the rigidity friction coefficient and thickness of the vibration absorptive materials are 2 000 105n m 0 6 and 0 035 m respectively the computational domain of the ejected capsule at a particular orientation in current environment is presented in fig 4 the velocity of ocean current is 0 5144 m s the direction of ocean current is represented by the angle between the flow velocity and y axis of housing fixed coordinate system consequently two different ocean currents 135 and 45 are considered different from the boundary conditions defined in section 3 the two lateral surfaces of the computational domain are set as velocity inlet and pressure outlet respectively numerical verification of the ejection process of capsule under vibration absorptive materials by the proposed loosely coupled scheme is introduced through grid and time step sensitive studies firstly and then the motion characteristics of the capsule at a particular orientation in ocean current are presented 4 1 numerical verification the hydrodynamic motion of the capsule in its inclined housing 45 in ocean current 135 is studied to verify the numerical simulations by the loosely coupled scheme three grid systems as seen in fig 5 are adopted three different time steps are 0 005s 0 001s and 0 0005s respectively before simulating the fsi problem of hydrodynamic motion of the ejected capsule in ocean current a proper initial flow field is needed firstly the ocean current 135 environment is obtained by transient calculation of flow field with capsule keeping still in its inclined housing fig 8 shows the steady flow details around top cap of the capsule using medium grid system g2 and time step of 0 001s the value of pressure on the top cap of the capsule as seen in fig 8 a shows little difference velocity vector as seen in fig 8 b indicates that some eddies exist at two shoulders around top cap of the capsule hydrodynamic force on the capsule is obtained by integrating the pressure on the surface of the capsule fig 9 gives the hydrodynamic force curves it can be seen that force component curves convergence to stable values at the end of the simulation the lateral force f h ε along ε axis in earth coordinate is slightly smaller than 0 which means the hydrodynamic force of ocean current push the capsule along ε direction the lateral force f h η along η axis in earth coordinate is larger than 0 and it drags the capsule up towards the sea surface moment m h equals to 0 ocean current does not drive the capsule to rotate the capsule is ejected in the flow obtained above under the action of its residual buoyancy loosely coupled scheme is then adopted at each time step flow field is calculated by fluent and the pressure on the surface of the capsule is integrated to obtain its hydrodynamic force as for contact force between the capsule and vibration absorptive materials the trajectory of capsule is firstly used to judge whether contact occurs or not and then the constitutive relation of linear elasticity is adopted to calculate this contact force the mathematic expressions for contact force refer to eqs 7 10 hydrodynamic force and contact force are substituted into the plane motion equations of capsule as well as the added masses obtained in section 3 fourth order runge kutta method is used to compute those differential equations the obtained motion characteristics provide boundary conditions of flow calculation in return at the next time step fig 10 compares translational velocities of the ejected capsule inside its inclined housing in ocean currents 135 using three different grid systems and time steps v ε and v η are translational velocities of reference point o as seen in fig 4 of the capsule in earth coordinate the velocity curves obtained by the loosely coupled scheme are monotonically convergent with the increase of grid densities and decrease of time steps there are small differences between solutions using medium and fine grid systems or using time steps of 0 001s and 0 0005s the medium grid system g2 and time step of 0 001s produce convergent solutions and thereby be adopted in the following case studies in order to save computation resource and simulation time 4 2 ejection process of the capsule the ejection processes of the capsule in two different ocean currents 135 and 45 are discussed here fig 11 gives the hydrodynamic force curves during the ejection process of the capsule hydrodynamic force on the reference point o as seen in fig 4 of the capsule is divided into three components lateral force f h ε lift force f h η and moment m h in o εη plane lateral force and lift force curves show the same trend as for those two forces obtained in ocean current 135 their values stay stable at the beginning of the ejection process and are followed by two big fluctuations between which the same stable value at the beginning is seen after t 7 351s they back to the stable value and then some oscillations occur from about t 8 451s to t 9 801s which are followed by a rapid increase and a slow decrease from t 10 851s to t 14s lateral force and lift force change with different values the stable values of lateral and lift forces are about 30 n and 700 n respectively three peak values reach about 1000 n 650 n and 1650 n in sequence for lateral force while those for lift force are 2600 n 1300 n and 2500 n different from force curves in ocean current 135 there is another fluctuation from t 9 751s to t 11 401s in lateral and lift force curves in current 45 which is followed by some oscillations with decreasing trend moment on the capsule oscillates with large amplitude the maximum amplitude in current 135 exceeds 17000 n m while that in current 45 is about 8500 n m fig 12 shows the motion characteristics of the referent point of the capsule during its ejection process v ε and v η are the translational components of the velocity of the capsule along ε and η axes in earth coordinate respectively ω z is its rotational component ε η and θ are the corresponding displacements in o εη plane the capsule starts to float under its net buoyancy the resultant force of buoyancy f b and gravity g it is believed that the capsule would move upwards along η axis with no movement in the lateral direction along ε axis however it can be seen from fig 12 a and c or fig 12 b and d that the components of velocity and displacement along η and ε axis have almost the same values at the beginning of the ejection process this phenomenon is caused by added masses of the capsule c 11 is much bigger than c 22 and then the movement of the capsule along x axis in capsule fixed coordinate driven by the component of net buoyancy along x axis is small so the capsule moves along its y axis at the beginning of the ejection process rather than along η axis in earth coordinate all the velocity curves show increasing trend during the whole ejection process with some decreases and small fluctuations except that the curve of v ε in ocean current 135 ends up with a fall the value of v ε in ocean current 135 at the end of calculation is less than 0 1 m s minus sign means the capsule moves along the ε axis while that in current 45 is about 0 5 m s the rotational velocity ω z of the capsule oscillates around 0 rad s then it falls slowly from 0 rad s at t 12s to about 0 3 rad s at t 14s in ocean current 135 while ω z in ocean current 45 ends up with a sharp increase to nearly 0 3 rad s at t 13 34s as for the spatial displacements ε and η their values increase nonlinearly with time the value of ε is smaller than 0 m it means that the capsule moves along ε axis and the capsule floats toward sea level with η 0 m the rotational displacement θ of the capsule fluctuates around 0 rad and then it increases from 0 rad at t 10s to 0 264 rad at t 14s in ocean current 135 while it falls to 0 035 rad at t 13 34s in ocean current 45 fig 13 a and b give the trajectories of the capsule in two different ocean currents 135 and 45 as well as the attitude of the capsule outside of its housing at the end of simulation those two attitudes of the capsule are consistent with the rotational displacement curves in fig 12 c and d in which the rotational displacement of the capsule in ocean current 45 is smaller than that in ocean current 135 at the end of simulation ocean current 45 exerts positive moment on the capsule to hinder its rotational movement four red curves represent the trajectories of four corner points of the capsule from which the contact behavior between the capsule and the vibration absorptive materials could be judged the dashed rectangular boxes mark the positions along the height of the capsule s housing where contact occurs the capsule contacts with the vibration absorptive materials at four different positions during the whole ejection process the capsule interacts with only one strip of the vibration absorptive materials in ocean current 135 while it collides with both two strips of materials attached to the inner surfaces of the housing in ocean current 45 the periods when contact happens are also introduced it can be seen from figs 11 and 12 that those are also times when hydrodynamic force and velocities changes that is to say contact behavior between the capsule and vibration absorptive materials causes the sudden change of hydrodynamic force on the capsule as well as motion characteristics of the capsule this is an important conclusion that would be used to analyze the effect of different vibration absorptive material parameters on the ejection performance of the capsule 5 vibration absorptive design the ejection process of the capsule under vibration absorptive materials in ocean current is simulated above the rigidity represented by k friction coefficient represented by μ f and thickness represented by t m of the vibration absorptive materials are 2 000 105n m 0 6 and 0 035 m respectively it is known from the study above that contact force generated between the capsule and vibration absorptive materials changes hydrodynamic force on the capsule and hydrodynamic movement of the capsule during ejection process different vibration absorptive designs would alter the contact behavior between the capsule and the materials in this section the effects of three main design parameters rigidity friction coefficient and thickness of the vibration absorptive materials on the ejection performance of capsule are studied and the mechanism of vibration absorptive design is discussed in order to promote the ejection performance of the capsule 5 1 the effect of rigidity the friction coefficient and thickness of the vibration absorptive materials keep μ f 0 6 and t m 0 035 m another three different rigidities 1 500 105n m 1 750 105n m and 4 000 108n m are discussed fig 14 gives hydrodynamic force on the reference point of the capsule during its ejection process in two different ocean currents 135 and 45 different from fig 11 two components of hydrodynamic force f h x and f h y in housing fixed coordinate o x y as shown in fig 4 are shown which are obtained through coordinate transformation between earth coordinate o εη and o x y it can be seen that the stable values of f h x and f h y are the same under different rigidities while their peak values of different fluctuations increase with increasing rigidity of the materials hydrodynamic force curves under rigidities 1 500 105n m and 1 750 105n m show the same trend with same amount of fluctuations as those under rigidity of 2 000 105n m while force curves under rigidity 4 000 108n m has more fluctuations the fluctuations under rigidity 4 000 108n m last for a shorter time than those under smaller rigidities it is noted that f h x and f h y soar at the end of ejection process under rigidity 4 000 108n m and f h x in ocean current 135 oscillates severely after t 12s fig 15 shows translational velocities v x and v y of the reference point of the capsule in two different ocean currents 135 and 45 as well as their corresponding displacements x and y those motion characteristics are also obtained through coordinate transformation between coordinates of o εη and o x y in fig 15 a and b v y shows increasing trend during whole ejection process with some decreases while v x fluctuates around 0 m s the changing rate of v x is smaller than that of v y however it can be seen from fig 14 that the changing amplitude of f h x is much bigger than that of f h y added masses of the capsule are the cause c 11 is much bigger than c 22 and then the acceleration of the capsule driven by f h x is smaller than that by f h y hydrodynamic force components soared in value under rigidity 4 000 108n m lead to the drastic change of the corresponding velocity components which can be seen at about t 10s and t 11 5s in ocean current 135 and t 10 7s in ocean current 45 at the end of simulation in ocean current 135 v x increases above 0 m s when rigidity is smaller than 2 000 105n m while it oscillates severely around 0 m s under rigidity of 4 000 108n m at the end of simulation in ocean current 45 v x increases before it drops below 0 m s in fig 15 c and d displacement x increases above 0 m and then fluctuates around 0 015 m which is also the value of the gap b d 2 t m between the capsule and vibration absorptive materials in each side at the end displacement x increases again in ocean current 135 expect that it oscillates around 0 m under rigidity 4 000 108n m while displacement x in ocean current 45 increases followed by a decrease and it also oscillates at the end of simulation when rigidity is 4 000 108n m as for displacement y it increases nonlinearly when rigidity is smaller than 2 000 105n m and it decreases at the end under rigidity 4 000 108n m the discussion of motion characteristics in housing fixed coordinate o x y helps judge the movements of the capsule inside its housing the oscillated displacement x indicates that the capsule bounces severely inside its housing the displacement y represents the sliding distance of the capsule along its housing if y is larger than 2 5 m it means that the capsule escapes from its housing successfully and the ejection process of the capsule is finished it can be seen from fig 15 c and d that several displacements y are smaller than 2 5 m their trajectories during whole ejection process are analyzed and two typical situations are presented in fig 16 fig 16 illustrates the trajectories of the capsule under vibration absorptive materials with two different rigidities 1 750 105n m and 4 000 108n m as well as the position of the capsule represented by the blue dashed outline in fig 16 a at the end of simulation at the end of simulation the surface of the capsule touches the inner surface of its housing in fig 16 a which indicates the failure of the vibration absorptive materials with rigidity of 1 750 105n m four color curves represent the trajectories of four corner points of the capsule in fig 16 b from which the contact behavior between the capsule and the vibration absorptive materials could be judged it can be seen that the capsule vibrates or bounces severely in its housing if rigid of the vibration absorptive materials is as big as 4 000 108n m and the ejection process of the capsule also fails the materials with rigidity of 4 000 108n m can be regarded as rigid body comparison with the trajectories of the capsule under smaller rigidities such as shown in fig 13 explains why the materials bond to the inner surface of housing are named as vibration absorptive materials through the analyses of hydrodynamic force motion characteristics and trajectories of the capsule during its whole ejection process a conclusion can be drawn that the increase of momentum along y axis and the decrease of momentum along x axis of the capsule help promote its ejection performance however contact force between the capsule and the vibration absorptive materials hinders the motion of the capsule along y axis and provide energy to increase the momentum of the capsule along x axis in the meantime small rigidity of the vibration absorptive materials reduces the effect of contact force on the movement of the capsule during its ejection process it is recommended to decrease rigidity of the vibration absorptive materials reasonably to avoid their failure and at the same time promote the ejection performance of the capsule 5 2 the effect of friction coefficient the tangential force between the capsule and the vibration absorptive materials affects the momentum of the capsule along y axis so the rigidity and thickness of the vibration absorptive materials keep k 2 000 105n m and t m 0 035 m and another three different friction coefficients 0 1 0 4 and 0 8 are applied fig 17 compares hydrodynamic force on the capsule under different friction coefficients hydrodynamic force curves present different patterns and smoother curves are obtained with increasing the friction coefficient four intact fluctuations are seen under friction coefficient of 0 8 which followed by three fluctuations with some oscillations under friction coefficient of 0 6 force curves under friction coefficients 0 1 and 0 4 oscillate randomly after the first intact fluctuation the time when the fluctuations of force curves occur is different under different friction coefficients as for the peak value of hydrodynamic force f h x shows little difference under different friction coefficients while f h y grows with increasing the friction coefficient fig 18 shows the motion characteristics of the reference point of the capsule during its ejection process as for velocity curves under friction coefficients 0 1 0 4 and 0 6 v x fluctuates around 0 m s and then it increases above 0 m s quickly at the end of simulation in ocean current 135 while it increases followed by a decrease to below 0 m s in ocean current 45 v y shows increasing trend during whole ejection process with some decreases it is noted that velocity curves during the whole ejection process are smooth expect for the velocity curves under friction coefficients 0 1 and 0 4 at some specific periods for example the velocity curves both v x and v y under friction coefficient 0 1 in ocean current 135 oscillates severely from about t 5 8s to t 9s when hydrodynamic force curves both f h x and f h y as shown in fig 17 also oscillate as for velocity curves under friction coefficient 0 8 they show different patterns they fluctuate and decrease to 0 m s gradually the huge force f h y under friction coefficient 0 8 hinders the motion of the capsule as for displacement curves in fig 18 c and d y increases nonlinearly above 2 5 m with time expect for y under friction coefficient 0 8 displacement x increases above 0 m and then fluctuates around 0 015 m before it increases quickly above 0 015 m at the end of simulation in ocean current 135 while it decreases to below 0 m at some periods in ocean current 45 displacement x under friction coefficient 0 8 stays at 0 015 m at the end of simulation it is concluded that the decrease of friction coefficient of the vibration absorptive materials improves the ejection performance of the capsule it efficiently reduces the time of ejection process and increases the ejected velocity v y but the capsule bounces inside its housing more severely with decreasing the friction coefficient of the vibration absorptive materials 5 3 the effect of thickness fig 16 a presents a failing situation of the vibration absorptive materials so the rigidity and friction coefficient of the vibration absorptive materials keep k 2 000 105n m and μ f 0 6 and another four different thicknesses 0 020 m 0 025 m 0 030 m and 0 045 m are applied fig 19 compares the motion characteristics of the reference point of the capsule under vibration absorptive materials with different thicknesses as for velocity curves v x fluctuates around 0 m s while v y shows increasing trend during whole ejection process with some decreases the decrease of v y happens later with decreasing thickness and the amplitudes of fluctuations of v x grow with decreasing thickness the large amplitude of v x means the large normal force generated between the capsule and the vibration absorptive materials which would easily lead to the failure of the materials so it can be seen from fig 19 c and d that displacements y are smaller than 2 5 m under thickness such as t m 0 020 m and the failure of vibration absorptive materials happens at the end of simulation it is concluded that the increase of the thickness could effectively protect the vibration absorptive material from failure but there is an exception case when t m 0 030 m in ocean current 135 this is because that the ejection process of the capsule is a process of countless collisions with the vibration absorptive materials contact force provides the energy to alter the velocity of the capsule and the momentum of the capsule accumulates during the ejection process it can be seen from fig 19 a that the accumulated maximum velocity v x at about t 10 5s under t m 0 030 m is much bigger than that at about t 9 2s under t m 0 025 m the vibration absorptive materials with t m 0 030 m fail at the end of simulation while the capsule escapes from its housing successfully under the materials with t m 0 025 m in ocean current 135 besides the increase of thickness makes the ejected velocity smaller and even the negative velocity v y of the capsule is seen in the case of t m 0 045 m in ocean current 45 this is a dangerous situation that should be paid more attention during the ejection process of the capsule 6 conclusions the main contribution of this paper is concerned with the proposed vibration absorptive design for the improvement of ejection performance of the independent escape capsule in which vibration absorptive materials adhere to the inner surface of the housing of the capsule the loosely coupled scheme zhang et al 2019b is developed with the complement of contact behavior between the rigid capsule and vibration absorptive materials and adopted to simulate the fsi problem of hydrodynamic motion of the capsule during ejection process firstly numerical verification of this loosely coupled scheme is introduced through grid and time step sensitive studies and then the hydrodynamic behavior of the capsule in ocean currents using vibration absorptive materials at a particular orientation 45 the maximum designed angle of the disabled submarine is simulated hydrodynamic force and motion parameters velocity displacement and trajectory are presented the capsule successfully escapes from its housing by using this vibration absorptive design finally the effects of three main different design parameters rigidity friction coefficient and thickness of the vibration absorptive materials on the ejection performance of the capsule are studied and the mechanism of vibration absorptive design is illustrated discussion of motion characteristics of the capsule indicates that the mechanism of the vibration absorptive design is to increase the capsule s momentum along y axis and decrease the momentum along x axis compared to the ejection process of the capsule under the rigid materials with rigidity of 4 000 108n m the capsule under materials with smaller rigidity vibrates slightly inside its housing the decrease of momentum of the capsule along x axis and its ejection performance is much better it is recommended that the decrease of friction coefficient of the vibration absorptive materials works best the increase of the momentum of the capsule along y axis in term of promoting the ejection performance of the capsule the decrease of rigidity effectively reduces the vibration of the capsule and the increase of thickness of the materials avoids the failure of the vibration absorptive materials during ejection process rigidity and thickness of the vibration absorptive materials should be considered synthetically to obtain a good ejection performance in the future model test of the ejected capsule is planned to validate the accuracy of the convergent solutions obtained by the loosely coupled scheme considering contact behavior between the capsule and its

21249,blades furnished at their leading edge with the whale s flipper inspired sinusoidal tubercles have been observed to offer beneficial flow responses in the post stall regime little is known however about their hydroelastic behaviors especially if positioned perpendicular to the flow direction therefore this work examines numerically the hydroelastic responses of bio inspired plates with tubercles in the presence of flow perpendicular to their planar surface geometrical perturbations in tubercles wavelengths λ 50 mm 100 mm 150 mm and amplitudes a 5 mm 10 mm 15 mm are considered compared to flat plates as the control case the bio inspired plates with tubercles exhibit higher stress and deformation in an increasing fashion with a while experiencing the least displacement the bio inspired plate with the shortest wavelength suffers the highest stress also restricting to the tubercles region the peaks of tubercles have been identified as the critical part that develops the greatest stress nonetheless stresses and displacements experienced by the bio inspired plates remain below the failure values for analysis and design conveniences a set of general equations have been parametrically produced to represent the inclusivity of the tubercles geometrical effects for the hydroelastic responses of the bio inspired plates keywords hydroelastic geometrical bio inspired tubercle wavelength plate 1 introduction for decades hydro turbines have been a realistic solution to unlimited clean energy especially for communities located near the mobile water resource unlike many conventional energy harvesting approaches the establishment of the hydro turbine systems is likely free from the hazard of a massive land altercation however such an advantage is offset by other limitations for instance the power production of the small turbine configuration is restricted by the efficient area interacted with the moving flow due to a confined water resource space especially where there exists the need to accommodate other purposes like human and goods transportation for the wave energy harvesting technology cost and environmental effects are the two major hurdles for its worldwide application although its efficiency remains open for further exploration to overcome these drawbacks the blade design for improved turbine efficiency has been an active research subject in the development of these technologies in the past several years bio inspired solutions have been widely explored for various scientific and engineering applications abo sabah et al 2017 2018 2019 to date many studies have been carried out on the enhancement of turbines performance by adopting tubercles on the turbine blade a design inspired by the humpback whale flippers implementation of tubercles has been associated with the increase in the lift coefficient of turbine blades and hence their overall performance improvement bolzon et al 2016 miklosovic et al 2004 zhang et al 2013 bearman and owen 1998 noticed a 30 reduction in drag by means of vortex shedding around the leading edge of a section furnished with a sinusoidal pattern zhang and wu 2012 as well as shi et al 2016 concluded that there was a significant improvement in terms of the torque and thrust of turbine blades with tubercles on their leading edge furthermore a study on the implementation of tubercles on the marine propeller by ibrahim and new 2015 showed a significant improvement of up to 10 in the thrust coefficient which enhanced the raw power output of the propeller from the above reviewed works it can be therefore deduced that adopting a series of sinusoidal tubercles present viable advantages to the fluid performance of turbine blades nevertheless it is worth emphasizing that the overall efficiency of the hydro turbine depends not only on its hydrodynamics rather the blade structural and material behaviors must also be taken into consideration structural responses such as the stress distribution on the section in the presence of the hydro loading are hence as greatly important as the flow performances in exploring and exploiting tubercles for energy harvesting nevertheless studies attributed to these effects especially when considering the influences of tubercles are somewhat limited if not entirely absent numerical findings have shown that the maximum stress experienced by the francis turbine runner is attributable to a combination of load cases contributed primarily by the static pressure with minimum influence from the centrifugal force generated from the rotational motion nava et al 2006 blasques et al 2010 witnessed by employing the hydrodynamic and hydroelastic analyses that trailing edge and hub regions of the composite marine propellers were the concerned regions exhibiting the highest value of tsai wu strength index with potential failures in terms of the matrix compression and in plane shear modes this finding concurs with saeed et al 2010 in which the maximum stresses were found on the leading and trailing edges of the francis turbine runner blades also fatigue cracks were observed at transition regions between the blades and the crown by comparing the performance of the straight and helical bladed vertical axis turbines marsh et al 2016 numerically found that the former exhibited approximately 13 higher maximum stress and deflection the lift peak generated concurrently along the full span of the blade was suggested to be the cause of higher maximum stress on the straight bladed turbine as compared to that with helical design which was generated at varying rotational angles nevertheless the straight bladed turbine was recommended for tidal power generation as it could generate 8 higher hydropower while not significantly affecting the durability of the turbine these works have highlighted the cruciality of examining the stress formation in the turbine blades in the face of incoming water load to the best of the authors knowledge the hydroelastic structural performance of blade with tubercles especially when the moving flow is subjected perpendicularly to its planar surface is absent in the literature it is worthwhile to notice that all stress analyses in the afore reviewed works were performed on turbine blades with conventional geometrical description in the spirit of constructing firstly the fundamentals while potentially improving the technology this paper presents the structural responses of plates with tubercles due to hydro induced load of specific concerns are the hydroelastic behaviors exhibited at the tubercles peak and trough along the plate in the cases of various tubercle amplitudes a and wavelengths λ a fundamental understanding of the mechanical behaviors of an alternative profiled section may offer an economical decision on either performing rehabilitation or simply a replacement of certain parts of structures in the event of local failure in applications in comparison a plate without tubercles has been used as the control case in the performance assessment it is of emphasis that to offer a basic insight into the effects due to the geometrical variation in tubercles a rectangular cross section has been selected for the current study instead of aero or hydro foil shape this is to eliminate the premature influence from the drag reduction effects by the foil shape since the current focus is on the responses inflicted solely by the tubercles also the foil shape is somewhat ill suited for the current scope of study considering that the considered angle of attack for the flow is 90 i e plate planar face is subjected perpendicularly to the hydro load nevertheless the foil shape consideration is readily lined up in the future work for a progressive understanding of the design as the analytical tool the commercially available finite element package ansys workbench 14 0 2011 is used this methodology has been selected since a detailed stress contour can only be produced by the numerical model due to the inherent complexity in the laboratory setting especially in observing the inquired behavior in the geometrically challenged region populated by the tubercles in the study the hydro induced load is firstly obtained from a preceding fluid flow model analysis for verification a flume study has been experimentally conducted to compare the flow responses obtained from the computational models departing from a good agreement of both methods the paper then proceeds by prescribing the computationally simulated pressure profile exerted by the flow onto the plate models to carry out the static structural analysis structural responses including stress and displacement on the plates due to tubercles geometry changes are particularly of interest to the current study 2 computational modeling and experimental methodologies 2 1 plate geometrical description fig 1 shows the general geometrical configurations of the currently explored flat and bio inspired with tubercles plates the plate height h length l and thickness t in this study were made to be equivalent to the chord length plate radius and maximum thickness of chord used in previous studies following the existing hydraulic channel experiment by bahaj et al 2007 the plate height to length ratio h l was set to 0 125 also the mean thickness ratio t h for the plate was 0 24 fish and battle 1995 a total of ten plates nine bio inspired ones of various amplitudes a and wavelengths λ and one flat plate as control were examined in this study the implementation of the tubercles geometries variation was in the forms of λ 50 mm 100 mm 150 mm and a 5 mm 10 mm 15 mm dimensions of all the investigated plates are summarized in table 1 here a and λ have been employed to abbreviate the specimen notation for the bio inspired plates for instance bio 150λ5a designates the section with tubercles of 150 mm wavelength and 5 mm amplitude 2 2 flow analysis for fluid flow analysis the ansys cfx module has been employed the aquatic environment cavity models for the plates as illustrated in fig 2 were created using the design modeler in ansys the cavity was 2500 mm wide 1075 mm high water level and 15000 mm long with the plate positioned at the central region of the computational domain the fluid type in the cavity was assigned as water all sides of the cavity except inlet outlet and the top were simulated with the boundary condition wall type the boundary condition at the top of the cavity was prescribed as an opening with an identical velocity as the inlet besides that inlet velocity was similarly assigned at the outlet of the cavity to simulate continuous water flow replicating also the condition employed in the flume examined in a laboratory setting described in a later section for verification purposes an inlet velocity of 0 418 m s for the fluid flow was simulated in the analysis which was determined in a similitude manner using the froude number fr the corresponding reynold number re was found to be 6 104 the similitude approach had been adopted by equalizing the froude numbers of both numerical and experimental inlet velocity 0 215 m s models the length of the plate was used as a reference in the similitude consideration for the simulation setup the length for the numerical model was designed as five times that of the experiment since the laboratory work was conducted at five times smaller scale fr was chosen as the similitude factor since it is the commonly practiced method for an open channel environment white 2003 2 3 drag force measurement to verify the numerical models the measurement of drag force had been carried out using experimental models geometrical dimensions of plates used in the experimental investigation were scaled down five times from the numerical model due to the limitation of the flume size the testing set up of which is shown in fig 3 scaled down plates used in the experimental investigation were 200 mm long and 25 mm high with tubercles of 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm wavelengths and 1 mm 2 mm 3 mm amplitudes in other words the specimens examined in the experimental investigation were flat plate bio 30λ1a bio 20λ2a and bio 10λ3a the plates for the experimental investigation had been fabricated from the 3 mm diameter polylatic acid pla black colored filament for better viewing contrast of the submerged specimens using the mingda glitar 3 three dimensional 3d printer by mingda technology co ltd china a detailed experimental set up is described next a digital scale with 1 g accuracy was clamped to a platform on top of the flume using the g clamp also steel wire was connected between the digital scale and a bar that held the plate the plate was gripped using bolt and nuts on the edge of the bar opposite to the hinged support in addition a steel rod was slotted through the bar to create hinged support on the platform it was assumed that there were no friction losses at all joints connecting the components the digital scale was only switched on and zeroed before the initiation of flow motion during which the set up was ready in order to obtain an accurate measurement to ensure consistency several readings were taken from the digital scale such that an average was used in the determination of the drag force in the flume a water flow of 0 215 m s was imposed at the inlet velocity was measured and monitored using the velocity meter while the experimental drag force was measured using the digital scale the bar itself invoked drag force therefore reading for the bar without holding the plate was first measured and then deducted in order to obtain the net force acted on the plate only the drag force on the plate was then determined from the sum of moments about the hinge at the equilibrium state 2 4 tensile test before the initialization of the numerical work a tensile test was first performed to determine the mechanical properties of the plates used in this study all specimens had been fabricated using the 3d printer by employing the pla filament material it is worth realizing that there was no visible geometrical change in the specimens before after submerging in the water note that the study intends to determine the distribution pattern of responses in terms of stresses and deformations experienced by the considered plates due to the hydro induced load therefore the type of material is not of particular concern in the current scope of the study the tensile test was conducted based on the testing standards for plastic samples as described in bs en iso 527 2012 british standard institution 2012a 2012b specimen type 1a from the standard specification had been chosen a total of three specimens were used in determining young s modulus and tensile strength of the material measurements were performed using the instron 5567 2 5t universal testing machine as shown in fig 4 the specimen was clamped at both edges in the machine and subjected to an extension rate of 1 mm min from which the resulting extension was measured using the extensometer placed in the middle of the specimen the force applied and elongation experienced by the specimen were recorded and transferred to the associated testing machine software instron bluehill installed on a computer 2 5 analytical stress and deformation in the structural analysis plates were modeled with a fixed condition at one end where no displacement and rotation were allowed in all directions hence the resultant force field exerted from the fluid flow on the plate can be treated as similar to that of a uniform load applied on a cantilever beam therefore the standard mechanics of materials analytical solution for the bending stress σ f l x 2 2lz was adopted where f is the uniform load l is the beam length x is the distance from support and z is the beam section modulus subsequently the corresponding maximum deflection δmax ωl 4 8ei where e is young s modulus i is the moment of inertia and ω is the line load along a cantilever beam was employed to validate the numerical structural model the validation on the structural model was executed only for the flat plate due to its constant cross section very much similar to a rectangular beam rather than the varying cross section of the bio inspired plate 2 6 numerical structural analysis to simulate the numerical structural performance of the plates the static structural module of ansys was adopted from the stress strain curves plotted using data generated from the tensile test an average young s modulus and tensile yield strength of 3050 133 mpa and 37 14 mpa respectively were determined these mechanical properties were defined in the engineering data system for the material description for all plates the same plate geometry from the fluid flow analysis section 2 2 was used for the structural analysis except that the fluid domain was not taken into consideration by suppressing the cavity geometry in the static structural system the resulting pressure produced from the fluid flow analysis was exported and applied on the plate while again a fixed support was assigned at the left edge of the plate viewing from the z axis as shown in fig 2 convergence study for the structural analysis had been conducted using the plate total displacement due to hydro induced load with respect to the number of elements by varying the element size of the plate for each model the element number for the plate with the minimal total displacement error was employed in this study in our simulation the percentage difference of 0 5 or less was considered as the benchmark for a converged model the converged numbers of elements of all numerical models for structural analysis ranged from 0 7 103 to 11 1 103 corresponding to element sizes of 18 5 mm 9 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation 3 1 1 fluid flow model the fluid flow numerical models were verified by checking the degree of similarity of computed drag forces against those measured from the scaled down experimental work the experimentally measured drag forces for all considered plates can be inspected in fig 5 in addition table 2 shows the corresponding outcomes obtained from both experimental and numerical approaches both experimental and numerical models show a decreasing trend in drag force from the flat to tubercled plates it is apparent that numerical models agree well with those of experimental with the percentages of difference varying from 0 99 to 6 57 3 1 2 structural model from the solution of fluid flow analysis of ansys cfx an induced force of 29 n had been exerted on the flat plate the maximum von mises stress and the maximum deflection of the flat plate as extracted from the structural model were validated using the equations offered in section 2 5 both analytically and numerically computed longitudinal stresses and maximum deflection of the flat plate are tabulated in table 3 the percentages of difference for stresses along the flat plate are in the range of 0 16 12 99 while it is 2 67 for the maximum deflection furthermore table 3 also shows a similar decreasing trend in stress along the flat plate for both analytical and numerical models thus it has been validated that the computed responses of the numerical model agree well with those of the analytical model 3 2 von mises stress having verified the numerical model the contour plots for the von mises stress distribution of flat and bio 50λ10a corresponding to the fluid flow loading are illustrated and compared in fig 6 bio 50λ10a has been elected for comparison owing to its high stress occurrence amongst all bio inspired models from the contour plots it can be noticed that the von mises stress along the plate increases gradually from the unsupported until the supported ends it can be observed that the maximum and minimum von mises stresses occur near the support and the unsupported ends of the plate respectively for both flat and bio 50λ10a the von mises stress around the neutral plane mid plane of the plate is contributed by the lowest range of the contour color this pattern of distribution agrees well with the bending stress diagram of a beam where there is a trend of vanishing stress at the neutral axis the maximum von mises stresses of the flat and bio inspired plates are plotted against the studied tubercles amplitudes for various tubercles wavelengths in fig 7 from fig 7 all the maximum von mises stress for tubercled plates are found to be higher compared to that of the flat plate with an increasing percentage ranging from 38 20 to 123 47 for an increase in a bio inspired plates with the shortest tubercles wavelength of 50 mm exhibit the highest von mises stress amongst all the plates the von mises stress increases when the wavelength decreases except for the plates with tubercles of 10 mm amplitude from which it is noticed that the von mises stress for bio 150λ10a is slightly higher than that of bio 100λ10a overall a pattern of increment in the von mises stress can be observed in fig 7 on bio inspired plates from tubercles amplitude of 5 mm followed by 10 mm and then 15 mm this suggests that the implementation of tubercles inflicts greater stress its location of which is commonly noticed near the supported side around the tubercles region the highest stress magnitude experienced by the tubercled plate is about twice as much vs that of the flat plate even so the highest maximum von mises stress of 1 71 mpa which occurs in bio 50λ15a is much lower than the plate material yield strength 37 mpa fig 8 shows the velocity plots at cross sections of the mid spans for the flat plate fig 8 a and the peak and trough of tubercle fig 8 b c as well as in between the tubercle peak and trough fig 8 d for the bio inspired plate in the fluid flow results recirculating flows at the wake of bio inspired plates can be seen as more intense than the flat plate besides a longer reattachment length and hence larger wake region area at the rear side of the plate with tubercles are observed as compared to the flat plate flow separation is seen initiated at the top and bottom of the plate then ended at the reattachment point also it can be witnessed that the velocity streamlines at the bottom of the bio inspired plate are separated earlier than the flat plate furthermore flow separation at the peak of tubercle occurs earliest followed by the area in between tubercle peak and trough and the latest at the trough region the separation at the trough of tubercle has been observed as similar to that of the flat plate since the streamlines are flowing over the same plate height as a result higher acceleration and torque could be potentially experienced by the hydro turbine if equipped with bio inspired plates due to a steeper pressure gradient from the front to the rear locations hence improved hydrodynamic performance by the bio inspired plate is favored through the intense flow recirculation and early occurrence of the flow separation phenomena ahmad et al 2020 the beneficial longer reattachment length and larger wake region provide a gradual reduction in flow induced pressure which can be linked to the gradual stalling phenomenon observed in existing literature miklosovic et al 2004 also due to the aforementioned flow characteristics the resulting maximum von mises stresses of all the plates with tubercles are higher than the flat plate nevertheless it is readily presented that the highest maximum von mises stress does not exceed the material yield strength thus they will not experience material failure under the condition investigated in this study in other words both the flat and bio inspired plates are within the structural safety limit in the presence of the currently examined loading state 3 3 maximum principal stress the maximum principal stress distribution of flat and bio 50λ10a can be observed from the contour plots shown in fig 9 from the contour plots it can be seen that there is an increase in the maximum principal stress from the unsupported end towards the supported direction a behavior similar to the aforementioned von mises stress distribution however both the highest and lowest maximum principal stresses are found near the support of the plate in addition the highest maximum principal stress for bio 50λ10a is noticeable around the tubercles near the support as shown in fig 9 b these responses follow closely the behavior of a cantilever beam the only difference is the highest stress is likely concentrated near the region populated by tubercles the lowest maximum principal stresses for both plates with and without tubercles are negative indicating a compression type of stress in other words the highest and lowest maximum principal stresses can also be defined as the tensile and compressive principal stresses respectively fig 10 displays the maximum tensile and compressive principal stresses against tubercles amplitudes for various wavelengths the maximum principal stresses in both tension and compression are 11 80 71 75 higher in the bio inspired plates as compared to those of the flat plate in general the maximum tensile principal stress increases with the amplitude of tubercles for a fixed wavelength in fig 10 a bio inspired plates of tubercles with 100 mm wavelength experience the highest maximum tensile principal stress followed by those with 150 mm and then 50 mm wavelength except for bio 50λ15a which demonstrates the highest maximum tensile principal stresses of all plates studied again the maximum tensile principal stress of the plates 1 67 mpa is way below the yield strength of the material 37 mpa fig 10 b shows some diversity in the relationship between the maximum compressive principal stress and tubercles geometries for plates with 5 mm and 15 mm tubercles amplitudes the lowest maximum compressive principal stresses are found for plates with 50 mm wavelength despite experiencing the highest magnitude when a 10 mm the maximum compressive principal stresses for plates with λ 150 mm and 100 mm decrease when the tubercles amplitude increases except for a noticeable increase for bio 100λ15a the maximum compressive principal stress of the plates is 0 43 mpa the wavy and protrude shapes of the tubercles offer a tendency for the stress to be more concentrated hence resulting in higher maximum principal stresses for the plates with tubercles the maximum tensile principal stress of bio inspired plates increases with the tubercles amplitude due to the extent of tubercles waviness the increment of tubercles amplitude makes the protruding shape of the plate more pronounced consequently creating a set of small cantilever beams tubercles with longer span these tubercles behave characteristically as a series of microcantilevers dehrouyeh semnani 2015 the abrupt change of varying shape along with the bio inspired plates especially tubercles of higher a and shorter λ would weaken the plate structural behavior in this study bio 50λ15a experiences the highest maximum tensile principal stress as presented in fig 10 a despite the fluctuated responses from the plates with tubercles wavelengths of 100 mm and 150 mm plates with λ 50 mm experience lower maximum principal stresses in compression thus this finding indicates that plates with the shortest wavelength of tubercles when subjected to a similar fluid flow condition perform better in terms of compressive stress in the current line of discussion the size of the cantilever microstructure has obviously influenced the stress formation and pattern at the tubercles occurrence site and hence also the local stability of the plate kueh 2013 rasin et al 2016 stress can be expressed as the applied force on a unit surface area therefore it can be explained mathematically that the relationship between stress and area is inversely proportional from figs 7 and 10 stresses for bio inspired plates are found higher than those of the flat plate with the same plate height the planar area of plate reduces slightly when tubercles are implemented corresponding generally to the tubercles of short wavelength and large amplitude hence higher stresses are expected on plates with tubercles than on the plates without tubercles nevertheless the stress concentration issue near the abrupt geometry change region at the lower part of the flat plate can be compensated by the rounded and blunt shape of tubercles besides the bio inspired plates are manufactured using a slightly lesser material than the flat plate when incorporating the concept of tubercles therefore lesser material for fabricating the bio inspired plates could minimize the weight and overall cost of a hydro turbine although their fabrication may pose a challenge to manufacturers due to geometrical complexity the yield strength of the material is also one of the significant criteria to be taken into consideration in the hydro turbine plate design the material used in this study is safe to be adopted for a hydro turbine plate restricted to the condition that the plate operates under a similar fluid flow system 3 4 displacement fig 11 shows the total displacement δ t contour plots for flat and bio 50λ10a plates the total displacements of the plates increase gradually from the supported until the unsupported ends of the plate the minimum total displacement of the plate is at the supported end while the maximum total displacement occurs at the unsupported end of the plate a closer observation informs that the maximum total displacements of all the bio inspired plates investigated appear at the lower part the trend of a larger displacement at the lower part of the plate with tubercles than its upper part is attributed to its weaker resistance due to the implementation of tubercles this is expected since at the edge lined with tubercles small voids created by the trough offer no resistance to the loading coming from the water flow in other words pressure coming from the flow is taken only by the small sections occupied by the peaks of the tubercles i e the small cantilevers portion the maximum total displacements and out of plane parallel to the fluid flow or out of plane displacement displacements δ z of the plates are extracted from analysis and then plotted against the variation of tubercles geometries i e amplitude and wavelength it is noticed that both the graphs for the maximum total and out of plane displacements exhibit almost identical magnitudes this shows that the total displacement of the plate is greatly dominated by the out of plane displacement fig 12 displays the out of plane displacement of the plates against the amplitude of tubercles for various wavelengths it can be observed that the out of plane displacements for plates with tubercles are higher than the plate without tubercles presenting the same trend as the von mises and principal stresses graphs figs 7 and 10 compared to the flat plate increases in displacement are in the range of 15 41 23 99 generally the bio inspired plates experience a larger displacement when the amplitude and or wavelength of tubercles increase the change in displacement for bio inspired plates with 150 mm wavelength is found to be relatively small with respect to the amplitudes as shown in fig 12 bio 150λ15a experiences the largest displacement of 5 10 mm while bio 50λ5a shows the least displacement of 4 75 mm amongst all bio inspired plates the flat plate displaces at a maximum of 4 11 mm when subjected to the load induced from the fluid flow as observed in the fluid flow results a larger drag force is induced on the flat plate as compared to the bio inspired plates nevertheless a lower out of plane displacement is experienced this contrast in result could be reasoned by observing the velocity streamlines contour presented in fig 8 a larger low pressure area in the bio inspired plates wake region due to the intense recirculating flow and longer reattachment point could cause a larger out of plane displacement ti et al 2020 under this circumstance plates with tubercles gain the potential to experience a greater acceleration and torque to rotate consequently the ease of bio inspired plates to move backward for rotation prompts a larger displacement than the flat plate a similar scenario is also exhibited for von mises and maximum principal stresses such that the plates with tubercles respond with higher stress than the flat plate this is attributed to the fixed end boundary condition at one end of the plate it is noted here that in a more realistic application the plate can move and rotate about the vertical axis an increase in stresses experienced by the plate is merely a result of the restriction of rotational movement due to such boundary conditions in this study the moments of inertia of bio inspired plates are smaller as compared to that of the flat plate due to the implementation of tubercles resulting in a smaller cross section area of the plates hence these observations on the displacement correlate well with the stresses and the fluid flow results as mentioned in the methodology the structural boundary conditions simulated on the plates is analogous to the fixed end cantilever beam hence the allowable deflection for a cantilever beam l 180 has been adopted in the serviceability limit of plates studied for a 1000 mm long plate as considered in this study the allowable displacement of the plates is 5 56 mm which is around 9 higher than the largest displacement 5 10 mm experienced by the plates in this study thus this comparison shows that it is safe to adopt the currently considered geometrical design in the hydro turbine plate for an improved hydro power generation when operating under similar boundary conditions it should be recalled that in the application of a real turbine system the plate is permitted to perform a rigid body rotation in such an event the tip deflection of each plate is expected to be much lower than

principal stresses in both tension and compression were 11 80 71 75 higher in the bio inspired plates as compared to those of the flat plate the total displacement of the plate was significantly dominated by the plate displacement in the out of plane direction the largest displacement of 5 10 mm was experienced by bio 150λ15a displacements of all the plates studied were found to be less than 5 56 mm the allowable deflection for a cantilever beam overall plates with the longest tubercles wavelength exhibited the lowest von mises stress while plates with the shortest tubercles wavelength and amplitude experienced the least maximum principal stress and total displacement for analysis and design conveniences a set of general equations were developed using the results computed from ansys these equations as tabulated in tables 4 7 serve analysts and designers the preliminary idea in terms of von mises stress and deflection at trough and peak of tubercles along the plate when designing the hydro turbine plates in terms of the advantages of the bio inspired plate design it had been observed in the literature that there exists a gradual stall in the post stall regime when the planform is subjected along the flow direction even though the experienced stress when aligning the bio inspired planform perpendicular to the flow is slightly higher than the control flat plate case the corresponding magnitudes are much lower than the examined strength of material additional to a small increase in displacement both these phenomena can be adapted to provide more torque and hence a greater rotational potential for the bio inspired plates in the design consideration of the turbine blades for hydroelectric generation purposes in closing these favorable findings on the structural behavior of bio inspired plates support further the application of tubercles on the hydro turbine plate for an improved hydro power generation future potential considerations include the dynamic

21249,blades furnished at their leading edge with the whale s flipper inspired sinusoidal tubercles have been observed to offer beneficial flow responses in the post stall regime little is known however about their hydroelastic behaviors especially if positioned perpendicular to the flow direction therefore this work examines numerically the hydroelastic responses of bio inspired plates with tubercles in the presence of flow perpendicular to their planar surface geometrical perturbations in tubercles wavelengths λ 50 mm 100 mm 150 mm and amplitudes a 5 mm 10 mm 15 mm are considered compared to flat plates as the control case the bio inspired plates with tubercles exhibit higher stress and deformation in an increasing fashion with a while experiencing the least displacement the bio inspired plate with the shortest wavelength suffers the highest stress also restricting to the tubercles region the peaks of tubercles have been identified as the critical part that develops the greatest stress nonetheless stresses and displacements experienced by the bio inspired plates remain below the failure values for analysis and design conveniences a set of general equations have been parametrically produced to represent the inclusivity of the tubercles geometrical effects for the hydroelastic responses of the bio inspired plates keywords hydroelastic geometrical bio inspired tubercle wavelength plate 1 introduction for decades hydro turbines have been a realistic solution to unlimited clean energy especially for communities located near the mobile water resource unlike many conventional energy harvesting approaches the establishment of the hydro turbine systems is likely free from the hazard of a massive land altercation however such an advantage is offset by other limitations for instance the power production of the small turbine configuration is restricted by the efficient area interacted with the moving flow due to a confined water resource space especially where there exists the need to accommodate other purposes like human and goods transportation for the wave energy harvesting technology cost and environmental effects are the two major hurdles for its worldwide application although its efficiency remains open for further exploration to overcome these drawbacks the blade design for improved turbine efficiency has been an active research subject in the development of these technologies in the past several years bio inspired solutions have been widely explored for various scientific and engineering applications abo sabah et al 2017 2018 2019 to date many studies have been carried out on the enhancement of turbines performance by adopting tubercles on the turbine blade a design inspired by the humpback whale flippers implementation of tubercles has been associated with the increase in the lift coefficient of turbine blades and hence their overall performance improvement bolzon et al 2016 miklosovic et al 2004 zhang et al 2013 bearman and owen 1998 noticed a 30 reduction in drag by means of vortex shedding around the leading edge of a section furnished with a sinusoidal pattern zhang and wu 2012 as well as shi et al 2016 concluded that there was a significant improvement in terms of the torque and thrust of turbine blades with tubercles on their leading edge furthermore a study on the implementation of tubercles on the marine propeller by ibrahim and new 2015 showed a significant improvement of up to 10 in the thrust coefficient which enhanced the raw power output of the propeller from the above reviewed works it can be therefore deduced that adopting a series of sinusoidal tubercles present viable advantages to the fluid performance of turbine blades nevertheless it is worth emphasizing that the overall efficiency of the hydro turbine depends not only on its hydrodynamics rather the blade structural and material behaviors must also be taken into consideration structural responses such as the stress distribution on the section in the presence of the hydro loading are hence as greatly important as the flow performances in exploring and exploiting tubercles for energy harvesting nevertheless studies attributed to these effects especially when considering the influences of tubercles are somewhat limited if not entirely absent numerical findings have shown that the maximum stress experienced by the francis turbine runner is attributable to a combination of load cases contributed primarily by the static pressure with minimum influence from the centrifugal force generated from the rotational motion nava et al 2006 blasques et al 2010 witnessed by employing the hydrodynamic and hydroelastic analyses that trailing edge and hub regions of the composite marine propellers were the concerned regions exhibiting the highest value of tsai wu strength index with potential failures in terms of the matrix compression and in plane shear modes this finding concurs with saeed et al 2010 in which the maximum stresses were found on the leading and trailing edges of the francis turbine runner blades also fatigue cracks were observed at transition regions between the blades and the crown by comparing the performance of the straight and helical bladed vertical axis turbines marsh et al 2016 numerically found that the former exhibited approximately 13 higher maximum stress and deflection the lift peak generated concurrently along the full span of the blade was suggested to be the cause of higher maximum stress on the straight bladed turbine as compared to that with helical design which was generated at varying rotational angles nevertheless the straight bladed turbine was recommended for tidal power generation as it could generate 8 higher hydropower while not significantly affecting the durability of the turbine these works have highlighted the cruciality of examining the stress formation in the turbine blades in the face of incoming water load to the best of the authors knowledge the hydroelastic structural performance of blade with tubercles especially when the moving flow is subjected perpendicularly to its planar surface is absent in the literature it is worthwhile to notice that all stress analyses in the afore reviewed works were performed on turbine blades with conventional geometrical description in the spirit of constructing firstly the fundamentals while potentially improving the technology this paper presents the structural responses of plates with tubercles due to hydro induced load of specific concerns are the hydroelastic behaviors exhibited at the tubercles peak and trough along the plate in the cases of various tubercle amplitudes a and wavelengths λ a fundamental understanding of the mechanical behaviors of an alternative profiled section may offer an economical decision on either performing rehabilitation or simply a replacement of certain parts of structures in the event of local failure in applications in comparison a plate without tubercles has been used as the control case in the performance assessment it is of emphasis that to offer a basic insight into the effects due to the geometrical variation in tubercles a rectangular cross section has been selected for the current study instead of aero or hydro foil shape this is to eliminate the premature influence from the drag reduction effects by the foil shape since the current focus is on the responses inflicted solely by the tubercles also the foil shape is somewhat ill suited for the current scope of study considering that the considered angle of attack for the flow is 90 i e plate planar face is subjected perpendicularly to the hydro load nevertheless the foil shape consideration is readily lined up in the future work for a progressive understanding of the design as the analytical tool the commercially available finite element package ansys workbench 14 0 2011 is used this methodology has been selected since a detailed stress contour can only be produced by the numerical model due to the inherent complexity in the laboratory setting especially in observing the inquired behavior in the geometrically challenged region populated by the tubercles in the study the hydro induced load is firstly obtained from a preceding fluid flow model analysis for verification a flume study has been experimentally conducted to compare the flow responses obtained from the computational models departing from a good agreement of both methods the paper then proceeds by prescribing the computationally simulated pressure profile exerted by the flow onto the plate models to carry out the static structural analysis structural responses including stress and displacement on the plates due to tubercles geometry changes are particularly of interest to the current study 2 computational modeling and experimental methodologies 2 1 plate geometrical description fig 1 shows the general geometrical configurations of the currently explored flat and bio inspired with tubercles plates the plate height h length l and thickness t in this study were made to be equivalent to the chord length plate radius and maximum thickness of chord used in previous studies following the existing hydraulic channel experiment by bahaj et al 2007 the plate height to length ratio h l was set to 0 125 also the mean thickness ratio t h for the plate was 0 24 fish and battle 1995 a total of ten plates nine bio inspired ones of various amplitudes a and wavelengths λ and one flat plate as control were examined in this study the implementation of the tubercles geometries variation was in the forms of λ 50 mm 100 mm 150 mm and a 5 mm 10 mm 15 mm dimensions of all the investigated plates are summarized in table 1 here a and λ have been employed to abbreviate the specimen notation for the bio inspired plates for instance bio 150λ5a designates the section with tubercles of 150 mm wavelength and 5 mm amplitude 2 2 flow analysis for fluid flow analysis the ansys cfx module has been employed the aquatic environment cavity models for the plates as illustrated in fig 2 were created using the design modeler in ansys the cavity was 2500 mm wide 1075 mm high water level and 15000 mm long with the plate positioned at the central region of the computational domain the fluid type in the cavity was assigned as water all sides of the cavity except inlet outlet and the top were simulated with the boundary condition wall type the boundary condition at the top of the cavity was prescribed as an opening with an identical velocity as the inlet besides that inlet velocity was similarly assigned at the outlet of the cavity to simulate continuous water flow replicating also the condition employed in the flume examined in a laboratory setting described in a later section for verification purposes an inlet velocity of 0 418 m s for the fluid flow was simulated in the analysis which was determined in a similitude manner using the froude number fr the corresponding reynold number re was found to be 6 104 the similitude approach had been adopted by equalizing the froude numbers of both numerical and experimental inlet velocity 0 215 m s models the length of the plate was used as a reference in the similitude consideration for the simulation setup the length for the numerical model was designed as five times that of the experiment since the laboratory work was conducted at five times smaller scale fr was chosen as the similitude factor since it is the commonly practiced method for an open channel environment white 2003 2 3 drag force measurement to verify the numerical models the measurement of drag force had been carried out using experimental models geometrical dimensions of plates used in the experimental investigation were scaled down five times from the numerical model due to the limitation of the flume size the testing set up of which is shown in fig 3 scaled down plates used in the experimental investigation were 200 mm long and 25 mm high with tubercles of 10 mm 20 mm 30 mm wavelengths and 1 mm 2 mm 3 mm amplitudes in other words the specimens examined in the experimental investigation were flat plate bio 30λ1a bio 20λ2a and bio 10λ3a the plates for the experimental investigation had been fabricated from the 3 mm diameter polylatic acid pla black colored filament for better viewing contrast of the submerged specimens using the mingda glitar 3 three dimensional 3d printer by mingda technology co ltd china a detailed experimental set up is described next a digital scale with 1 g accuracy was clamped to a platform on top of the flume using the g clamp also steel wire was connected between the digital scale and a bar that held the plate the plate was gripped using bolt and nuts on the edge of the bar opposite to the hinged support in addition a steel rod was slotted through the bar to create hinged support on the platform it was assumed that there were no friction losses at all joints connecting the components the digital scale was only switched on and zeroed before the initiation of flow motion during which the set up was ready in order to obtain an accurate measurement to ensure consistency several readings were taken from the digital scale such that an average was used in the determination of the drag force in the flume a water flow of 0 215 m s was imposed at the inlet velocity was measured and monitored using the velocity meter while the experimental drag force was measured using the digital scale the bar itself invoked drag force therefore reading for the bar without holding the plate was first measured and then deducted in order to obtain the net force acted on the plate only the drag force on the plate was then determined from the sum of moments about the hinge at the equilibrium state 2 4 tensile test before the initialization of the numerical work a tensile test was first performed to determine the mechanical properties of the plates used in this study all specimens had been fabricated using the 3d printer by employing the pla filament material it is worth realizing that there was no visible geometrical change in the specimens before after submerging in the water note that the study intends to determine the distribution pattern of responses in terms of stresses and deformations experienced by the considered plates due to the hydro induced load therefore the type of material is not of particular concern in the current scope of the study the tensile test was conducted based on the testing standards for plastic samples as described in bs en iso 527 2012 british standard institution 2012a 2012b specimen type 1a from the standard specification had been chosen a total of three specimens were used in determining young s modulus and tensile strength of the material measurements were performed using the instron 5567 2 5t universal testing machine as shown in fig 4 the specimen was clamped at both edges in the machine and subjected to an extension rate of 1 mm min from which the resulting extension was measured using the extensometer placed in the middle of the specimen the force applied and elongation experienced by the specimen were recorded and transferred to the associated testing machine software instron bluehill installed on a computer 2 5 analytical stress and deformation in the structural analysis plates were modeled with a fixed condition at one end where no displacement and rotation were allowed in all directions hence the resultant force field exerted from the fluid flow on the plate can be treated as similar to that of a uniform load applied on a cantilever beam therefore the standard mechanics of materials analytical solution for the bending stress σ f l x 2 2lz was adopted where f is the uniform load l is the beam length x is the distance from support and z is the beam section modulus subsequently the corresponding maximum deflection δmax ωl 4 8ei where e is young s modulus i is the moment of inertia and ω is the line load along a cantilever beam was employed to validate the numerical structural model the validation on the structural model was executed only for the flat plate due to its constant cross section very much similar to a rectangular beam rather than the varying cross section of the bio inspired plate 2 6 numerical structural analysis to simulate the numerical structural performance of the plates the static structural module of ansys was adopted from the stress strain curves plotted using data generated from the tensile test an average young s modulus and tensile yield strength of 3050 133 mpa and 37 14 mpa respectively were determined these mechanical properties were defined in the engineering data system for the material description for all plates the same plate geometry from the fluid flow analysis section 2 2 was used for the structural analysis except that the fluid domain was not taken into consideration by suppressing the cavity geometry in the static structural system the resulting pressure produced from the fluid flow analysis was exported and applied on the plate while again a fixed support was assigned at the left edge of the plate viewing from the z axis as shown in fig 2 convergence study for the structural analysis had been conducted using the plate total displacement due to hydro induced load with respect to the number of elements by varying the element size of the plate for each model the element number for the plate with the minimal total displacement error was employed in this study in our simulation the percentage difference of 0 5 or less was considered as the benchmark for a converged model the converged numbers of elements of all numerical models for structural analysis ranged from 0 7 103 to 11 1 103 corresponding to element sizes of 18 5 mm 9 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation 3 1 1 fluid flow model the fluid flow numerical models were verified by checking the degree of similarity of computed drag forces against those measured from the scaled down experimental work the experimentally measured drag forces for all considered plates can be inspected in fig 5 in addition table 2 shows the corresponding outcomes obtained from both experimental and numerical approaches both experimental and numerical models show a decreasing trend in drag force from the flat to tubercled plates it is apparent that numerical models agree well with those of experimental with the percentages of difference varying from 0 99 to 6 57 3 1 2 structural model from the solution of fluid flow analysis of ansys cfx an induced force of 29 n had been exerted on the flat plate the maximum von mises stress and the maximum deflection of the flat plate as extracted from the structural model were validated using the equations offered in section 2 5 both analytically and numerically computed longitudinal stresses and maximum deflection of the flat plate are tabulated in table 3 the percentages of difference for stresses along the flat plate are in the range of 0 16 12 99 while it is 2 67 for the maximum deflection furthermore table 3 also shows a similar decreasing trend in stress along the flat plate for both analytical and numerical models thus it has been validated that the computed responses of the numerical model agree well with those of the analytical model 3 2 von mises stress having verified the numerical model the contour plots for the von mises stress distribution of flat and bio 50λ10a corresponding to the fluid flow loading are illustrated and compared in fig 6 bio 50λ10a has been elected for comparison owing to its high stress occurrence amongst all bio inspired models from the contour plots it can be noticed that the von mises stress along the plate increases gradually from the unsupported until the supported ends it can be observed that the maximum and minimum von mises stresses occur near the support and the unsupported ends of the plate respectively for both flat and bio 50λ10a the von mises stress around the neutral plane mid plane of the plate is contributed by the lowest range of the contour color this pattern of distribution agrees well with the bending stress diagram of a beam where there is a trend of vanishing stress at the neutral axis the maximum von mises stresses of the flat and bio inspired plates are plotted against the studied tubercles amplitudes for various tubercles wavelengths in fig 7 from fig 7 all the maximum von mises stress for tubercled plates are found to be higher compared to that of the flat plate with an increasing percentage ranging from 38 20 to 123 47 for an increase in a bio inspired plates with the shortest tubercles wavelength of 50 mm exhibit the highest von mises stress amongst all the plates the von mises stress increases when the wavelength decreases except for the plates with tubercles of 10 mm amplitude from which it is noticed that the von mises stress for bio 150λ10a is slightly higher than that of bio 100λ10a overall a pattern of increment in the von mises stress can be observed in fig 7 on bio inspired plates from tubercles amplitude of 5 mm followed by 10 mm and then 15 mm this suggests that the implementation of tubercles inflicts greater stress its location of which is commonly noticed near the supported side around the tubercles region the highest stress magnitude experienced by the tubercled plate is about twice as much vs that of the flat plate even so the highest maximum von mises stress of 1 71 mpa which occurs in bio 50λ15a is much lower than the plate material yield strength 37 mpa fig 8 shows the velocity plots at cross sections of the mid spans for the flat plate fig 8 a and the peak and trough of tubercle fig 8 b c as well as in between the tubercle peak and trough fig 8 d for the bio inspired plate in the fluid flow results recirculating flows at the wake of bio inspired plates can be seen as more intense than the flat plate besides a longer reattachment length and hence larger wake region area at the rear side of the plate with tubercles are observed as compared to the flat plate flow separation is seen initiated at the top and bottom of the plate then ended at the reattachment point also it can be witnessed that the velocity streamlines at the bottom of the bio inspired plate are separated earlier than the flat plate furthermore flow separation at the peak of tubercle occurs earliest followed by the area in between tubercle peak and trough and the latest at the trough region the separation at the trough of tubercle has been observed as similar to that of the flat plate since the streamlines are flowing over the same plate height as a result higher acceleration and torque could be potentially experienced by the hydro turbine if equipped with bio inspired plates due to a steeper pressure gradient from the front to the rear locations hence improved hydrodynamic performance by the bio inspired plate is favored through the intense flow recirculation and early occurrence of the flow separation phenomena ahmad et al 2020 the beneficial longer reattachment length and larger wake region provide a gradual reduction in flow induced pressure which can be linked to the gradual stalling phenomenon observed in existing literature miklosovic et al 2004 also due to the aforementioned flow characteristics the resulting maximum von mises stresses of all the plates with tubercles are higher than the flat plate nevertheless it is readily presented that the highest maximum von mises stress does not exceed the material yield strength thus they will not experience material failure under the condition investigated in this study in other words both the flat and bio inspired plates are within the structural safety limit in the presence of the currently examined loading state 3 3 maximum principal stress the maximum principal stress distribution of flat and bio 50λ10a can be observed from the contour plots shown in fig 9 from the contour plots it can be seen that there is an increase in the maximum principal stress from the unsupported end towards the supported direction a behavior similar to the aforementioned von mises stress distribution however both the highest and lowest maximum principal stresses are found near the support of the plate in addition the highest maximum principal stress for bio 50λ10a is noticeable around the tubercles near the support as shown in fig 9 b these responses follow closely the behavior of a cantilever beam the only difference is the highest stress is likely concentrated near the region populated by tubercles the lowest maximum principal stresses for both plates with and without tubercles are negative indicating a compression type of stress in other words the highest and lowest maximum principal stresses can also be defined as the tensile and compressive principal stresses respectively fig 10 displays the maximum tensile and compressive principal stresses against tubercles amplitudes for various wavelengths the maximum principal stresses in both tension and compression are 11 80 71 75 higher in the bio inspired plates as compared to those of the flat plate in general the maximum tensile principal stress increases with the amplitude of tubercles for a fixed wavelength in fig 10 a bio inspired plates of tubercles with 100 mm wavelength experience the highest maximum tensile principal stress followed by those with 150 mm and then 50 mm wavelength except for bio 50λ15a which demonstrates the highest maximum tensile principal stresses of all plates studied again the maximum tensile principal stress of the plates 1 67 mpa is way below the yield strength of the material 37 mpa fig 10 b shows some diversity in the relationship between the maximum compressive principal stress and tubercles geometries for plates with 5 mm and 15 mm tubercles amplitudes the lowest maximum compressive principal stresses are found for plates with 50 mm wavelength despite experiencing the highest magnitude when a 10 mm the maximum compressive principal stresses for plates with λ 150 mm and 100 mm decrease when the tubercles amplitude increases except for a noticeable increase for bio 100λ15a the maximum compressive principal stress of the plates is 0 43 mpa the wavy and protrude shapes of the tubercles offer a tendency for the stress to be more concentrated hence resulting in higher maximum principal stresses for the plates with tubercles the maximum tensile principal stress of bio inspired plates increases with the tubercles amplitude due to the extent of tubercles waviness the increment of tubercles amplitude makes the protruding shape of the plate more pronounced consequently creating a set of small cantilever beams tubercles with longer span these tubercles behave characteristically as a series of microcantilevers dehrouyeh semnani 2015 the abrupt change of varying shape along with the bio inspired plates especially tubercles of higher a and shorter λ would weaken the plate structural behavior in this study bio 50λ15a experiences the highest maximum tensile principal stress as presented in fig 10 a despite the fluctuated responses from the plates with tubercles wavelengths of 100 mm and 150 mm plates with λ 50 mm experience lower maximum principal stresses in compression thus this finding indicates that plates with the shortest wavelength of tubercles when subjected to a similar fluid flow condition perform better in terms of compressive stress in the current line of discussion the size of the cantilever microstructure has obviously influenced the stress formation and pattern at the tubercles occurrence site and hence also the local stability of the plate kueh 2013 rasin et al 2016 stress can be expressed as the applied force on a unit surface area therefore it can be explained mathematically that the relationship between stress and area is inversely proportional from figs 7 and 10 stresses for bio inspired plates are found higher than those of the flat plate with the same plate height the planar area of plate reduces slightly when tubercles are implemented corresponding generally to the tubercles of short wavelength and large amplitude hence higher stresses are expected on plates with tubercles than on the plates without tubercles nevertheless the stress concentration issue near the abrupt geometry change region at the lower part of the flat plate can be compensated by the rounded and blunt shape of tubercles besides the bio inspired plates are manufactured using a slightly lesser material than the flat plate when incorporating the concept of tubercles therefore lesser material for fabricating the bio inspired plates could minimize the weight and overall cost of a hydro turbine although their fabrication may pose a challenge to manufacturers due to geometrical complexity the yield strength of the material is also one of the significant criteria to be taken into consideration in the hydro turbine plate design the material used in this study is safe to be adopted for a hydro turbine plate restricted to the condition that the plate operates under a similar fluid flow system 3 4 displacement fig 11 shows the total displacement δ t contour plots for flat and bio 50λ10a plates the total displacements of the plates increase gradually from the supported until the unsupported ends of the plate the minimum total displacement of the plate is at the supported end while the maximum total displacement occurs at the unsupported end of the plate a closer observation informs that the maximum total displacements of all the bio inspired plates investigated appear at the lower part the trend of a larger displacement at the lower part of the plate with tubercles than its upper part is attributed to its weaker resistance due to the implementation of tubercles this is expected since at the edge lined with tubercles small voids created by the trough offer no resistance to the loading coming from the water flow in other words pressure coming from the flow is taken only by the small sections occupied by the peaks of the tubercles i e the small cantilevers portion the maximum total displacements and out of plane parallel to the fluid flow or out of plane displacement displacements δ z of the plates are extracted from analysis and then plotted against the variation of tubercles geometries i e amplitude and wavelength it is noticed that both the graphs for the maximum total and out of plane displacements exhibit almost identical magnitudes this shows that the total displacement of the plate is greatly dominated by the out of plane displacement fig 12 displays the out of plane displacement of the plates against the amplitude of tubercles for various wavelengths it can be observed that the out of plane displacements for plates with tubercles are higher than the plate without tubercles presenting the same trend as the von mises and principal stresses graphs figs 7 and 10 compared to the flat plate increases in displacement are in the range of 15 41 23 99 generally the bio inspired plates experience a larger displacement when the amplitude and or wavelength of tubercles increase the change in displacement for bio inspired plates with 150 mm wavelength is found to be relatively small with respect to the amplitudes as shown in fig 12 bio 150λ15a experiences the largest displacement of 5 10 mm while bio 50λ5a shows the least displacement of 4 75 mm amongst all bio inspired plates the flat plate displaces at a maximum of 4 11 mm when subjected to the load induced from the fluid flow as observed in the fluid flow results a larger drag force is induced on the flat plate as compared to the bio inspired plates nevertheless a lower out of plane displacement is experienced this contrast in result could be reasoned by observing the velocity streamlines contour presented in fig 8 a larger low pressure area in the bio inspired plates wake region due to the intense recirculating flow and longer reattachment point could cause a larger out of plane displacement ti et al 2020 under this circumstance plates with tubercles gain the potential to experience a greater acceleration and torque to rotate consequently the ease of bio inspired plates to move backward for rotation prompts a larger displacement than the flat plate a similar scenario is also exhibited for von mises and maximum principal stresses such that the plates with tubercles respond with higher stress than the flat plate this is attributed to the fixed end boundary condition at one end of the plate it is noted here that in a more realistic application the plate can move and rotate about the vertical axis an increase in stresses experienced by the plate is merely a result of the restriction of rotational movement due to such boundary conditions in this study the moments of inertia of bio inspired plates are smaller as compared to that of the flat plate due to the implementation of tubercles resulting in a smaller cross section area of the plates hence these observations on the displacement correlate well with the stresses and the fluid flow results as mentioned in the methodology the structural boundary conditions simulated on the plates is analogous to the fixed end cantilever beam hence the allowable deflection for a cantilever beam l 180 has been adopted in the serviceability limit of plates studied for a 1000 mm long plate as considered in this study the allowable displacement of the plates is 5 56 mm which is around 9 higher than the largest displacement 5 10 mm experienced by the plates in this study thus this comparison shows that it is safe to adopt the currently considered geometrical design in the hydro turbine plate for an improved hydro power generation when operating under similar boundary conditions it should be recalled that in the application of a real turbine system the plate is permitted to perform a rigid body rotation in such an event the tip deflection of each plate is expected to be much lower than the currently computed magnitude dehrouyeh semnani 2015 3 5 mathematical expression of structural response gathering all behaviors observed previously it is interesting to next formulate a set of general while more practically useful equations to ease the analysis and design events such beneficial equations aim to provide engineers with the reference and convenience to determine and design the turbine plate with various desired tubercles geometries in the future parameters in terms of wavelength and amplitude of tubercles are conveniently included in the formulation for von mises stress and out of plane displacement for the trough and peak of tubercles along the plate as presented in tables 4 7 r squared values of the equations for all coefficients are in the range of 0 9065 1 indicating a good fitness of the derived equations in representing those numerically determined 4 conclusions a numerical study has been conducted by comparing the structural responses of plates with and without tubercles the validity of the numerical models has been first ensured in comparison to the measured outcomes from the fluid flow investigation from the findings of the structural analysis both the von

dominated by the plate displacement in the out of plane direction the largest displacement of 5 10 mm was experienced by bio 150λ15a displacements of all the plates studied were found to be less than 5 56 mm the allowable deflection for a cantilever beam overall plates with the longest tubercles wavelength exhibited the lowest von mises stress while plates with the shortest tubercles wavelength and amplitude experienced the least maximum principal stress and total displacement for analysis and design conveniences a set of general equations were developed using the results computed from ansys these equations as tabulated in tables 4 7 serve analysts and designers the preliminary idea in terms of von mises stress and deflection at trough and peak of tubercles along the plate when designing the hydro turbine plates in terms of the advantages of the bio inspired plate design it had been observed in the literature that there exists a gradual stall in the post stall regime when the planform is subjected along the flow direction even though the experienced stress when aligning the bio inspired planform perpendicular to the flow is slightly higher than the control flat plate case the corresponding magnitudes are much lower than the examined strength of material additional to a small increase in displacement both these phenomena can be adapted to provide more torque and hence a greater rotational potential for the bio inspired plates in the design consideration of the turbine blades for hydroelectric generation purposes in closing these favorable findings on the structural behavior of bio inspired plates support further the application of tubercles on the hydro turbine plate for an improved hydro power generation future potential considerations include the dynamic loading conditions more general blade shapes with composite materials deng et al 2019 and a full turbine configuration yan et al 2017 under rotatable capability credit authorship contribution
