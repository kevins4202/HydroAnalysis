1170,although wetlands are known to provide vital ecosystem services the current state of wetlands in ethiopia in terms of their ecosystem service components remains poorly understood wetlands located in the unesco lake tana biosphere reserve have been highly degraded but possess highly valuable resources therefore this study sought to assess the major ecological states and identify the main ecosystem services ess along with local people s perceptions of wetland management nine wetlands were selected from pristine reference agricultural and urban land uses of the lake tana area numerous ess were identified categorized into four main ecosystem services analyzed using a conceptual model adopted for this purpose and their ecological conditions were assessed using a range of methods the results revealed that the provisioning and cultural services were found to surpass the regulatory and supporting services of wetlands in agricultural and urban types as compared to wetlands located in pristine areas although most of the local residents positively viewed wetland regulation and supporting services weak policy and decision support such as wetland use planning investment interventions and communal land ownership and poor development of diversified livelihood were found to pose major challenges to sustainable utilization of wetland resources the range of plant species diversity among the impaired wetlands was observed to be related to the degree of disturbance with urban and agricultural wetlands being highly degraded as compared to pristine wetlands moreover these impaired wetlands were found to be invaded by upland and exotic weeds out competing the socioeconomically and ecologically important native species keywords lake tana wetland management tools ecosystem services human disturbance 1 introduction wetlands are among the most productive environments in the world and are critical for supporting human livelihoods in africa chapman et al 2001 rebelo et al 2010 the goods and services they provide to human populations include food agricultural production fisheries water quality maintenance and recreation seelig and dekeyser 2006 wetlands are also important sources of water and nutrients that support biological productivity schuyt 2005 and serve as habitats for diverse species cooper et al 2006 moreover wetlands can reduce the severity of droughts and floods by regulating stream flow kotze 1996 and can provide vital water resources to support agricultural production mccartney and houghton carr 2009 all these benefits or services that wetland ecosystems provide are essential for people s livelihoods particularly in developing countries like ethiopia despite their value wetland ess and the associated management issues remain poorly documented and under researched in african nations particularly as concerns ethiopia according to darwall et al 2005 the ess that wetlands provide remain under assessed although assessing them is the primary step toward promoting the protection of wetlands overall ethiopia has no adequate protocols for wetland assessment monitoring and inventory getachew et al 2012 has an insufficient formal institutional setup and legal framework hailu 2007 and even lacks experts specialized in wetland assessment and management wetland ess are also not fully considered in environmental planning and decision making owing to the difficulty of expressing them in terms of monetary values de groot 2006 although there are intergovernmental drivers to support the wise use of wetlands through the obligations under the ramsar convention the convention has not yet been ratified or implemented in ethiopia deribe 2007 there is also no national standing wetland policy therefore research providing scientific information on the ess of ethiopian wetlands is critically needed however the first information that should be formulated and addressed to the local communities is about the current status of wetlands due to major factors such as siltation pollution drainage and deforestation of wetland species wetlands are among the most vulnerable habitats niraula 2012 but in ethiopia there is little or no awareness of the current status of wetlands or even of the need for their conservation and sustainable utilization wondafrash 2003 therefore for effective wetland management the locals need to have a better understanding of the status of individual wetlands and their resource values additionally development projects rarely consider the value of the local people s perceptions even though this is a key element for successful wetland protection and management rahman et al 2005 accordingly this study also took into account the respondents perceptions toward wetland management 1 1 general objectives to assess the ecological conditions ecosystem services and level of human disturbance in selected wetlands of the lake tana environment 1 1 1 specific objectives 1 to assess the ecological status of wetlands in relation to human disturbance 2 to identify the common and most important ecosystem services ess derived from the three wetland types and 3 to assess the perception of the local people toward wetland management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area wetlands are situated in the lake tana catchment with an altitude range from 1785 to 2047ma s l fig 1 the lake tana catchment is known by its 4 major river sub basins namely the gelgel abbay ribb gumara and megech rivers among the total catchment area of lake tana 15 000km2 it covers over 40 000ha of wetlands around its floodplains all the studied wetland habitats are within the unesco lake tana biosphere boundary 2 2 wetland selection the nine wetlands selected for the study were as follows shesher megech river mouth chimba ras abbay avaji gudo bahir kurt bahir wonjeta and legdiya table 1 they were selected based on their impact accessibility and availability u s epa 2002 the altitudes and area sizes of the wetlands ranged from 1769 to 2047masl and from about 100 1816ha respectively table 1 the nine areas included three reference wetlands three agricultural wetlands and three urban impaired wetlands based on their land uses and their human disturbance score hds assessed using the protocol of gernes and helgen 2002 1 agricultural impaired wetlands the shesher megech and chimba wetlands were selected as agricultural influenced wetlands table 1 and all are situated in rural catchments where cultivation grazing and sand mining were common activities shesher is a semi permanently flooded dominated by open water and mudflats wetland surrounded by farmlands water is permanently drained for agricultural purposes during the dry season megech is a river delta wetland that receives waste effluents generated from gondar city via the megech river invasive weed infestation water hyacinth sand mining siltation cultivation and free grazing are common practices chimba is a riverine floodplain wetland dominated by free grazing and cultivation 2 urban impaired wetlands the ras abbay and avaji wetlands were selected from the bahir dar city area the impact of gondar city was assessed from the megech wetland ras abbay is a riverine wetland the blue nile river crossing bahir dar city receives untreated municipal and industrial wastewater and then drains into the mosaic of mixed wetland habitats forested marsh and open water of ras abbay avaji is a shoreline wetland from abbay minch to bata church that receives storm water and domestic wastewater generated by hotels and fish landing sites from surrounding communities these two wetlands are subjected to urbanization and reed harvesting despite wetland disturbance by anthropogenic activities these sites support a well developed plant community gudo bahir is a bog type of wetland located at the western vicinity of bahir dar city receiving runoff from the small degraded hill catchment and then draining partly to the abbay river and the lake along the city canal it is devoid of vegetation and has severely affected buffer zones water abstraction and peat soil production are common practices among urban inhabitants for several purposes particularly during the dry season 3 less impacted wetlands given that natural reference wetlands were too difficult to find due to anthropogenic activity the kurt bahir wonjeta and legdiya wetlands were selected as reference wetlands currently these wetlands are recognized as core zones of the lake tana biosphere reserve kurt bahir is a palustrine type of wetland with rich reed swamp and natural vegetation within and around the wetlands respectively minimal free grazing with no settlement and less agricultural activities are common practices the wetland harbors a large population of catfish and serves as a breeding site of the wattled crane a globally vulnerable bird species wonjeta is a fen type of wetland originating from springs it is known for its papyrus and tree natural forests it is surrounded by rural settlements and the spring water is pumped for domestic purposes and small scale irrigation legdiya is a palustrine wetland rich in reed swamp over 75 and surrounded by mountain forests the gelgel abbay river passes along the wetland and feeds sediment and water to the wetland fig 2 2 3 study design cross sectional interviews of households hhds were conducted in january 2015 using clustered random sampling in the community living within a 3 km radius of each wetland turyahabwe et al 2013 abebe et al 2014 this method was used due to the heterogeneity of the communities in terms of their levels of benefits from and impacts on the wetlands in relation to their location twenty two kebeles 8 from agriculture 7 from urban and 7 from least impacted wetland areas surrounding each wetland habitat were involved in the study from each kebele at least 10 households were randomly selected among the immediate nearby localities two hundred twenty households plus additionally 21 agricultural and land use development agents as key informants ki made up the total of 241 individuals participating in the study community representatives were also included for focal group discussions fgd the ecosystem services especially some of the regulating services like flood chemical pollution sediment and climate change control were described to and discussed with the interviewees households indirectly from their understanding on underground water recharge and discharge duration of flood and water clarity associated with the vegetation cover 2 4 data collection and analysis the degraded ess and the ecological and biological conditions of the wetlands were assessed using a range of methods interviews human disturbance score hds water quality parameters and flora composition and diversity assessments wetlands were also rated and classified into least middle and high impaired wetland categories using the protocol of hds plant species identification diversity and similarity analysis were carried out for all wetlands physicochemical water parameters were assessed and analyzed so as to evaluate the water quality and ecological conditions of the wetlands the degree of human disturbances to the wetlands was assessed using the hds protocol method of gernes and helgen 2002 ecosystem services ess or benefits derived from each wetland ecosystem were identified and analyzed using data from local community interviews hhds key informants kis and focal group discussions fgd mea 2005 in addition to field observation and the available literature human disturbance of wetlands in ethiopia is described mainly in terms of hydrologic alteration through excessive withdrawal of water for agricultural purposes habitat disturbance and biodiversity deterioration through unwise exploitation of wetland products and changes in water quality due to urban expansion all these impose limitations in the proper functioning of wetlands and cause the loss of their ecosystem services therefore hds provides meaningful results indicating the status of wetlands these anthropogenic impacts are also being further aggravated by climate change a field survey was conducted for assessing the degree of disturbance to wetlands from the landscape physical condition water quality and biological data fish bird were also used in the assessment study these data were grouped into a number of measuring factors in order to calculate hds factor 1 buffer landscape disturbances within 50m from the edge of the wetland where the extent of disturbance ranges from 0 to 18 points factor 2 landscape disturbance within 500m from the edge of the wetland where the extent of disturbance ranges from 0 to 18 points factor 3 habitat alteration whole wetland area where the extent of severity ranges from 0 to 18 points factor 4 hydrological alteration where the degree of alteration ranges from 0 to 21 points factor 5 chemical pollution especially tn and tp salinity turbidity do from water sample where the degree of pollution ranges from 0 to 21 points factor 6 additional concerns presence absence of fish yield and bird count where the severity ranges from 0 to 4 points a standard checklist was used to collect data on wetland type hydrological conditions land use patterns ecological state and habitat assessment finally each factor was evaluated and rated scored in one of four categories ranging from best to poor as mentioned above then all the scored values from each factor were summed for each study wetland to obtain their human disturbance gradient score hdss out of a total of 100 according to the protocol of gernes and helgen 2002 if the categorical range of hds of a given wetland value falls within the ranges of 0 33 33 67 and 67 100 it can be classified as least impacted mid impacted and most or highly impacted respectively the interview was focused on each household s demographic and socio economic characteristics their understanding of the importance of each wetland ess and their attitude toward the wetland s restoration and management focal group discussions fgds were conducted in each wetland to obtain information on the local wetland status and ess resource use plant and water and major human activities the interviewers tried to use an indirect approach to address the wetland ecosystem services with the interviewers especially the regulating and supportive services for example in agriculture impaired areas regulating services were addressed in terms of water recharging and discharging which is related to the water supply during the dry season and the control of flooding in the rainy season in urban impaired areas on the other hand the regulating services were associated with the presence of wastewater regulating wetlands the conceptual model of the millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 was adopted for assessing and analyzing the ess of the wetlands studied the various ess derived from wetlands were classed into a limited set of es categories including provisioning cultural regulatory and supporting services ess were estimated measured in terms of the benefits economic and socio cultural values they provide to the local people who are directly involved in the use and management of the wetlands the respondents were asked to rate the ess listed for each wetland using terms of relative importance unsure low medium or high importance the four classes of services provisioning regulating cultural and supporting were rated across wetlands based on the adopted matrix of mea 2005 the relative degree of ecosystem services provided by each wetland were developed using field observations and the reports of households hhds key informant kis and focal group discussions fgd to identify community similarities between wetlands the sorensen similarity index was used this index ranges from 0 no similarity to 1 complete similarity corresponding to 0 to 100 shannon and wiener 1949 and is calculated using the following index ss 2a 2a b c where ss sorensen similarity index a the number of taxa at wetland site 1 b the number of taxa at wetland site 2 and c the number of taxa common to both compared sites 3 result and discussion 3 1 human disturbance and ecological status of wetlands physically there were differences among the wetlands studied although all the three agriculture dominated wetlands are highly affected by cultivation and free grazing they are rich in both native and wintering bird fauna their buffer habitats were highly degraded by overgrazing and drained or recession agriculture particularly during the dry season shesher was totally devoid of buffer vegetation sometimes losing the entirety of its water for about 2 months and a part of it is occupied by rural and urban settlement the chimba wetland was relatively covered by reed plant species such as typha latifolia and cyperus papyrus the megech lakeshore wetland was predominantly covered by alien invasive weeds such as water hyacinth eichornia crassipes water abstraction from both the river and the lake for small scale irrigation sand mining and illegal fishing were also common practices in this wetland along the megech river channel which affects the breeding ground of the riverine fish species fishing was common practice in both the shesher and megech wetlands as was seasonal reed harvesting in chimba thus all were characterized by currently active and major disturbances to the natural hydrology its buffer and landscape alteration and by partly altered habitat during the dry season with high potential for change in plant compositions although all three urban impacted wetlands receive urban wastes the ras abbay and avaji wetlands are permanently flooded and rich in both t latifolia and c papyrus plant species currently there is a trend involving the vegetation composition shifting from native to pollutant tolerant species such as persicaria sp urban construction fishing and intensive reed harvesting by the negede community were also common practices in both wetlands on the other hand the gudo bahir wetland had extensively impaired buffer zones the ras abbay and avaji wetlands receive wastes from the nearby bahir dar city whereas the gudo bahir wetland receives sediments and chemicals from the nearby catchment hotels car washes garages bus stations industrial facilities a brewery textile plant tannery etc and upstream erosion are potential sources of the pollutants due to these anthropogenic activities the accumulations of nutrients and other organic matter agrochemicals domestic waste from urban industrial wastewater in urban and agricultural wetlands were very high leading them to eutrophication table 2 in the reference wetlands on the other hand for many reasons such as the communally protected church owned and inaccessible status of the areas the human practices were few major human disturbances e g overexploitation of the wetland products recession agriculture free grazing to the wetlands buffer landscape and natural hydrology alterations were maintained even during the dry season including the natural vegetation thus the agricultural and urban wetlands were more impaired than the reference wetlands all the hds results were within the potential range of 0 100 higher human disturbance scores were recorded in the shesher 70 gudo bahir 71 and megech 77 wetlands the ras abbay avaji and chimba wetlands were considered as mid impacted wetlands the highest record of hds in the megech rm when compared to shesher was associated with the pollution impact from gondar city though situated at farther distance all the three reference wetlands were least impacted and floristically intact table 3 the wetland biodiversity hydrological and habitat natures and soil and microclimatic conditions were substantially affected by human interferences based on the average hds both agricultural hds 64 and urban hds 52 wetlands received proportionally greater human disturbances compared to the least impacted reference sites hds 15 this implies that both urban and agricultural wetlands had been exploited more as compared to the reference wetlands therefore human activities in urban and agriculture dominated rural areas are now the cause of wetland degradation in africa that is abstraction of water for agricultural and domestic uses recession agriculture overgrazing and mining in and around agricultural impaired wetlands mereta et al 2013 gebresllasse 2014 moges et al 2016a b leads to their degradation similarly urbanization infrastructural development and waste disposal in around urban wetlands mekonnen and aticho 2011 soni and bhatt 2008 moges et al 2016a b causes considerable accumulations of both organic and inorganic pollutants resulting in changes in water quality structure and vegetation composition and loss of nursery and breeding grounds of fish and bird species 3 2 economic and livelihood conditions of the households of the total sample only 3 5 of the households were female headed the average family size in these wetland areas is about 6 12 members with about 60 of the households exceeding the regional average 4 6 members the main effect of high population growth is excessive pressure on the environmental resources intense competition for grazing and farmland and unhealthy agricultural practices the average land holding is 1 73ha per head although about 10 of the households were landless this is a far better condition i e 50 hold above 2 00ha as compared to the average landholdings in ethiopia as a whole where the land carrying capacity has already surpassed the threshold level of one ha per family among users in agriculture dominated wetland areas 50 of them were uncertified table 4 although all the wetlands are communal a large share approx up to 1ha hh were encroached upon by more than 50 of the neighboring communities surprisingly a majority were subjected to degradation by those who own their own licensed large land holdings households in the studied wetland areas have livelihood activities which are mainly natural resource based these include livestock rearing arable farming crops horticulture chat growing collection of wetland products such as reeds thatching grass wild fruits medicinal plants etc basket making sand mining fishing and community based tourism in addition daily labor rural trade and boat transport are common income sources most of the livelihoods of the local communities in the wetlands studied were dominated by farming 100 except in the urban wetlands 13 89 on average a significant share of households 24 44 in urban wetland areas depend on semi intensive animal husbandry whereas animal rearing in agriculture and referenced areas is usually traditional in urban wetlands fishing 36 67 and harvesting of wetland products 33 33 such as papyrus plants and its inflorescence were followed by chat plantation 30 and small trade 25 56 livestock rearing 66 67 and chat plantation 38 9 were the livelihoods following farming in the referenced study sites increasing water abstraction using a number of motor pumps and free grazing are future potential threats to the least impacted wetlands table 5 a small proportion of households were engaged in cultural medication av 5 harvesting wetland products av 20 and church employment av 20 harvesting and hand crafting of wetland products e g papyrus were common practices of negede weyito community on the periphery of bahir dar city a majority of church owned wetlands were least impacted wetlands and provides employment opportunities to the church people although landholding was fully sufficient to support the majority of residents who had lived around the study wetlands expansion is not creating diversified economic opportunities fishing harvesting wetland products seedlings animal forage production etc in this rather still traditional farming system this finding entails different opportunities to conserve the wetlands unlike other studies on small holding families in most ethiopia di falcon and veronesi 2011 moges 2016a 3 3 ecosystem services ess based on the conceptual model adopted ess were assessed and grouped into provisioning cultural regulating and supporting services ecosystem services were assessed using collective methods of field observation table 6 household interview data table 7 fgd and key informants information from woreda experts 3 4 provisioning services crops were dominant in agriculture and least impacted wetlands all except rice were produced from water abstraction and recession agriculture during the dry season cash crops such as chat catha edulis and vegetables were dominant 32 86 in the urban and least impacted wetlands the fish catch was higher in agriculture impacted wetlands 45 followed by urban wetland types degradation of breeding grounds of the nile tilapia in the megech river mouth and shorelines of the lake and declines in the fish stock have also been reported wondie 2010 wondie et al 2014 both cultivated mango gesho coffee sugar cane banana and uncultivated cordia africana carissa spinarum mimusops kummel syzgium guineense millettia ferruginea ficus vasta plants were commonly harvested in the periphery rocky areas of the least impacted wetlands 10 71 43 followed by urban impacted wetlands 8 57 14 28 respectively on average about 12 73 of households reported harvesting honey primarily from referenced wetlands 28 57 fig 3 water abstracted for human drinking was commonly used by a large proportion of households 75 71 and 43 75 in reference and agriculture impacted wetland types respectively the shesher and megech wetlands were highly affected by irrigation especially during the dry season however no water was used for human drinking in the urban impacted wetlands because of waste discharges from the surroundings including wastes from car washing municipal and industrial effluents in bahir dar city table 7 water from wetlands and peripheral springs guarantees the local communities year round access to drinking water for themselves and their livestock in ethiopia dixon and wood 2007 moreover wetlands provide rural communities with a vital source of drinking water because they can purify polluted water wondie 2010 daily 1997 reed plants of papyrus and typha grasses of animal fodder sand or peat soil and medicinal plants were analyzed as raw materials reed plants were collected for sale to make reed boats baskets thatching mattresses and the inflorescence for the purposes of continuous and periodic festivals for this about 3 75 21 43 and 64 28 were reported from agriculture urban and reference wetland types respectively information from kis and fgd revealed that the livelihood of a number of young people especially females depends on harvesting and selling cheffe inflorescence for coffee ceremony and making tourist baskets similarly 4 and 13 of households from the urban and agricultural wetland types were reported to depend on making wetland handcrafts like mats and raising of seedlings respectively moges 2016a almost all respondents reported using wetlands for cattle grazing and many of them for animal fodder additionally sand mining and peat soil were practiced in megech and gudo bahir wetlands table 7 in general wetlands have been drained for agricultural purposes including the growing of crops vegetables and fruits crops are produced primarily in agricultural wetlands by draining them partially without agrochemical application during the dry season wetlands with extensive agriculture but without fertilizer herbicide or pesticide application often provide additional services to food production such as flood regulation and maintenance of water quality or biodiversity wondie 2010 the iwmi 2006 also reported that more than 65 of residents in the bumbwisudi wetland in zanzibar used irrigation for agriculture to support their livelihoods the respondents reported that the local authorities were encouraging the cultivation of wetlands to create new job opportunities and increase crop productivity instead of working on diversification this indicates that decision making bodies in africa continue to devote little attention to the importance of wetland ess for example the rwandan gowa 2009 and kenyan gichuki et al 2001 governments have also supported the conversion of wetlands for crop production to mitigate food insecurity and improve the livelihoods of rural communities 3 5 regulating services the majority of households described increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation in all three types of wetlands and hydrological alteration other studies have reported similar findings yeshanew 2007 moges 2016a over 50 of households believed almost all wetland types played important roles in regulating floods purifying water and retaining sediments table 6 from the same table the lower perceptions of erosion protection 17 27 and higher perceptions of flood control 51 36 can be explained in that most of the studied wetlands are situated in the floodplain areas of lake tana particularly the agriculture and urban impaired wetlands moreover professionals opinions and field observations showed that urban impacted wetlands provide the highest pollution control regulating services though urban impacted wetlands are severely reduced in their function by the urban waste they still have a significant role in regulating pollutant chemicals as compared to others 3 6 cultural services almost all of the wetlands were used for cultural services reported by more than 75 reference wetlands are ideal places for spiritual educational and research services since the sections of each wetland were owned by churches thus the religious peoples in these areas protect the wetlands the kis and fgds reported that spiritual events including the orthodox christian festivals of the ethiopian epiphany had been celebrated annually in rural wetlands similar research in the jimma wetlands indicated that spiritual and educational research services were dominant in urban wetland types moges 2016a 3 7 supporting services wetland supporting services includes the provision of breeding nursery feeding and refugia of plants and animals biodiversity conservation services are recognized by more than 65 of households table 6 largely by those from the agricultural 75 and reference 71 47 wetland types especially for their bird diversity though agricultural impaired wetlands are poor in their vegetation cover they are rich in bird and fish diversity fgd and kis also acknowledged the importance of reference and urban wetlands 47 14 in providing habitats for several species of sedges and grass species as well as breeding grounds for various species of birds such as common crane wattled crane crowned crane mammals such as hippopotamuses and monkeys were also observed other researches also reported that wetlands provide for wildlife breeding and nursery habitats moges 2016a and support wetland vegetation species woldu and yeshitela 2003 3 8 relative importance of wetland ess the four classes of services provisioning regulating cultural and supporting were rated as unsure low medium or high importance across wetlands based on the adopted matrix of mea 2005 the relative degree of ecosystem services provided by each wetland was identified using field observations and the reports of hhds kis and fgd fig 4 the main food provisioning services were obtained mainly from agricultural impaired and reference wetlands the level of exploitation of the resources was of much lower impact in the reference wetlands than in agricultural impaired wetlands verhoeven and setter 2009 reported that wetlands influenced by extensive agriculture with suitable wetland conservation can provide sustainable ecosystem services however altering wetlands through improper uses and waste discharge can potentially degrade wetlands and undermine their capacity to provide services in the future jogo and hassan 2010 moges 2016a chat plantation and fruit were dominant in urban impaired sites ras abbay avaji and nearby areas of reference sites wonjeta kurt bahir harvesting raw materials such as the papyrus plant for various purposes and animal fodder grasses were common in reference sites followed by urban impaired wetlands value addition such as hand crafting of baskets and mats as income generation was common practice in the ras abbay and avaji wetlands freshwater resources were primarily used for domestic purposes and small scale irrigation in reference sites followed by agricultural impaired wetlands fig 4 similar studies in the jimma illubabur wetlands revealed that very few people use freshwater for drinking from urban wetlands due to municipal waste impacts ambelu et al 2013 moges et al 2016a a majority of respondents also positively understood the regulatory supporting and cultural services of wetlands table 7 however the policy and decision making supports especially in urban and agricultural impaired wetlands were not compatible with the interests of the local community the ras abbay wetland was highest in receiving municipal and industrial wastewater followed by the megech wetland since most of the wetlands are situated in the floodplains of the lake flood control and sediment retention were regulated usually by agricultural impaired and reference wetland types supporting services such as biodiversity conservation were high especially in agricultural and referenced wetlands for their bird fish and plant diversity respectively rural wetlands both agricultural and referenced ones were also used for ecotourism such as bird watching and game fishing in association with the already rich cultural heritages in the catchment most reference and some agricultural impaired wetlands provided spiritual services such as ethiopian epiphany ceremonial places in general all data sources revealed that these wetlands have important ecosystem services though urbanization misuse of resources poor waste management systems and conversion of wetlands to farmland weak policy and decision making support such as wetland use planning investment interventions and communal land ownership and poor development of diversified livelihood were major challenges to sustainable utilization of wetland resources for these reasons though the local community are willing and interested to conserve wetlands practical measures have not been taken toward restoring and protecting wetlands rather unwisely the papyrus and cattail plant resources are being exploited and wetlands are being converted mainly to agricultural land and grazing lands in urban by the poor negede weyito people and agricultural neighboring farmers wetlands respectively moreover the kis and fgd participants were asked about the management aspects conservation activities being performed within around and or in the catchments of the wetlands the majority of the kis and members of fgd replied that little effort had been made to date toward restoring and protecting areas in and or around the wetlands through participation of the local community however some management activities such as ras abbay being delineated as a park and some physical and biological conservation measures have been taken around wetlands and in some catchments of urban and agricultural wetland types by some civic societies and government bodies respectively lamsal et al 2015 in nepal and moges 2016a in jimma also reported that people s participation in conservation efforts was inadequate although they maintained a positive attitude toward wetland conservation the absence of a wetland policy and the delayed ratification of the ramsar convention by the ethiopian government have also contributed to the unrelieved conversion of wetland ecosystems 3 9 vegetation community similarity the dominant plant species were reported by ayalew et al 2016 the average plant community similarity index among wetlands was generally low 20 the least similarity 5 was observed between both gudo bahir and shesher with other wetlands followed by megech with the rest of the wetlands 10 except for the aforementioned two the highest similarity index 55 6 was recorded between legdiya and kurt bahir followed by legdiya and wonjeta 50 gudo bahir and shesher 47 and avaji and ras abbay 45 3 table 8 the reasons for the low average percentage similarity is due to low plant diversity in some urban and agriculture impacted wetlands similarly the low diversity in the gudo bahir and shesher wetlands was the cause for the low similarity index in the same wetland use type species richness is low because of high levels of stress or disturbance and or the dominance by a few strong competitors some studies indicate that annual grass dominated wetlands with the highest frequency of soil disturbance from farming practices has the lowest biodiversity richness density than perennial plant dominated ones enrichment especially in urban wetlands increases diversity but this increase is accounted for by invasive exotic species plant diversity tends to be higher in degraded habitats these human disturbance factors may also have resulted in a change in the composition of the wetland plant communities the plant community composition would be related to the environmental conditions of the surrounding land use activities associated with wetlands this was due to anthropogenic activities being conducted within the agricultural and urban wetlands and their catchments besides waste discharges via streams including ditches particularly crossing the towns mulatu et al 2014 ruto et al 2012 alvarez et al 2012 and mulatu et al 2014 also reported disturbed wetlands as having more diversity compared to the undisturbed natural wetlands in kenya and tanzania and in ethiopia respectively 4 conclusions in the ethiopian wetlands we studied farming was the main source of livelihood although most households had their own sufficient landholdings to meet their needs overexploitation and conversion of wetlands to farmlands was still found to be ongoing recession agriculture and abstraction of water for small scale irrigation during the dry season in the shesher and megech wetlands and invasive alien species such as the water hyacinth in megech are the main threats identified in this research all but the reference wetlands were gradually found to be degrading with extensive human activity our findings indicate that reference and agricultural impacted wetlands currently provide more provisioning and cultural services while regulatory and supporting services are predominantly provided by urban wetlands followed by reference wetlands though they are highly impacted many households were interested in participating in wetland conservation protection restoration and management despite the un preplanned and non knowledge based interventions made by decision makers such as the redistribution of wetlands to landless youth by changing the land use the absence of wetland registration as communal land owned by the local community maintaining the tragedy of the commons principle and the absence of wetland legal and institutional frameworks therefore development and implementation of integrated catchment based ecological protection restoration management and sustainable use of wetlands as well as ratification of the ramsar convention and the development of wetland policy will be possible management options to sustainably utilize wetland ecosystems moreover consideration should be given to planning conservation awareness programs among the people about the importance of wetlands and their conservation engaging the local stakeholders in any conservation plan of wetlands and optimizing food yield per unit area through creating diversified livelihoods and by conserving wetlands and protecting their functions regarding the status of the wetlands the megech gudo bahir and shesher wetlands were seriously impaired by human activities carried out within and their catchments and hence were classified as high impaired wetlands followed by the ras abbay chimba and avaji wetlands grouped as mid impaired wetland moges et al 2016a moreover as reported in many papers e g moges et al 2016a alvarez et al 2012 ruto et al 2012 human factors are the major contributors for wetland degradation and alteration of biological community composition the extent of urbanization and land use activities strongly influence the species composition of wetland plant communities ehrenfeld and schneider 1991 yet the ras abbay and avaji wetlands were mid impaired as they were parts of the urban wetland agricultural wetlands scored the least species richness diversity and evenness than reference and urban impaired wetland types due to anthropogenic activities these activities include drainage for agriculture overgrazing and siltation however agricultural wetlands were dominated by annual and invasive alien species hence extensive and more frequent human disturbances were the most determinant factors for altering wetland plant composition and diversity most wetlands in ethiopia especially agriculture and urban impacted ones can be sustainably managed using eco hydrology as a tool restored or enhanced wetlands ecotones at stream and river valleys traps nutrients fertilizers and pesticides transported from the agricultural landscapes into freshwater ecosystems man made and natural wetland macrophytes buffer zones in cities like bahir dar and gondar regulate excessive nutrients especially in the retention of phosphorus and organic matter through a sequential sedimentation biofiltration system in general this study confirms that that regulation of biota by altering hydrology and vice versa the eco hydrology principle of dual regulation of wetland ecosystems is a mandatory approach for the wetlands in the lake tana area of ethiopia as well as elsewhere conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements none funding body

1170,although wetlands are known to provide vital ecosystem services the current state of wetlands in ethiopia in terms of their ecosystem service components remains poorly understood wetlands located in the unesco lake tana biosphere reserve have been highly degraded but possess highly valuable resources therefore this study sought to assess the major ecological states and identify the main ecosystem services ess along with local people s perceptions of wetland management nine wetlands were selected from pristine reference agricultural and urban land uses of the lake tana area numerous ess were identified categorized into four main ecosystem services analyzed using a conceptual model adopted for this purpose and their ecological conditions were assessed using a range of methods the results revealed that the provisioning and cultural services were found to surpass the regulatory and supporting services of wetlands in agricultural and urban types as compared to wetlands located in pristine areas although most of the local residents positively viewed wetland regulation and supporting services weak policy and decision support such as wetland use planning investment interventions and communal land ownership and poor development of diversified livelihood were found to pose major challenges to sustainable utilization of wetland resources the range of plant species diversity among the impaired wetlands was observed to be related to the degree of disturbance with urban and agricultural wetlands being highly degraded as compared to pristine wetlands moreover these impaired wetlands were found to be invaded by upland and exotic weeds out competing the socioeconomically and ecologically important native species keywords lake tana wetland management tools ecosystem services human disturbance 1 introduction wetlands are among the most productive environments in the world and are critical for supporting human livelihoods in africa chapman et al 2001 rebelo et al 2010 the goods and services they provide to human populations include food agricultural production fisheries water quality maintenance and recreation seelig and dekeyser 2006 wetlands are also important sources of water and nutrients that support biological productivity schuyt 2005 and serve as habitats for diverse species cooper et al 2006 moreover wetlands can reduce the severity of droughts and floods by regulating stream flow kotze 1996 and can provide vital water resources to support agricultural production mccartney and houghton carr 2009 all these benefits or services that wetland ecosystems provide are essential for people s livelihoods particularly in developing countries like ethiopia despite their value wetland ess and the associated management issues remain poorly documented and under researched in african nations particularly as concerns ethiopia according to darwall et al 2005 the ess that wetlands provide remain under assessed although assessing them is the primary step toward promoting the protection of wetlands overall ethiopia has no adequate protocols for wetland assessment monitoring and inventory getachew et al 2012 has an insufficient formal institutional setup and legal framework hailu 2007 and even lacks experts specialized in wetland assessment and management wetland ess are also not fully considered in environmental planning and decision making owing to the difficulty of expressing them in terms of monetary values de groot 2006 although there are intergovernmental drivers to support the wise use of wetlands through the obligations under the ramsar convention the convention has not yet been ratified or implemented in ethiopia deribe 2007 there is also no national standing wetland policy therefore research providing scientific information on the ess of ethiopian wetlands is critically needed however the first information that should be formulated and addressed to the local communities is about the current status of wetlands due to major factors such as siltation pollution drainage and deforestation of wetland species wetlands are among the most vulnerable habitats niraula 2012 but in ethiopia there is little or no awareness of the current status of wetlands or even of the need for their conservation and sustainable utilization wondafrash 2003 therefore for effective wetland management the locals need to have a better understanding of the status of individual wetlands and their resource values additionally development projects rarely consider the value of the local people s perceptions even though this is a key element for successful wetland protection and management rahman et al 2005 accordingly this study also took into account the respondents perceptions toward wetland management 1 1 general objectives to assess the ecological conditions ecosystem services and level of human disturbance in selected wetlands of the lake tana environment 1 1 1 specific objectives 1 to assess the ecological status of wetlands in relation to human disturbance 2 to identify the common and most important ecosystem services ess derived from the three wetland types and 3 to assess the perception of the local people toward wetland management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area wetlands are situated in the lake tana catchment with an altitude range from 1785 to 2047ma s l fig 1 the lake tana catchment is known by its 4 major river sub basins namely the gelgel abbay ribb gumara and megech rivers among the total catchment area of lake tana 15 000km2 it covers over 40 000ha of wetlands around its floodplains all the studied wetland habitats are within the unesco lake tana biosphere boundary 2 2 wetland selection the nine wetlands selected for the study were as follows shesher megech river mouth chimba ras abbay avaji gudo bahir kurt bahir wonjeta and legdiya table 1 they were selected based on their impact accessibility and availability u s epa 2002 the altitudes and area sizes of the wetlands ranged from 1769 to 2047masl and from about 100 1816ha respectively table 1 the nine areas included three reference wetlands three agricultural wetlands and three urban impaired wetlands based on their land uses and their human disturbance score hds assessed using the protocol of gernes and helgen 2002 1 agricultural impaired wetlands the shesher megech and chimba wetlands were selected as agricultural influenced wetlands table 1 and all are situated in rural catchments where cultivation grazing and sand mining were common activities shesher is a semi permanently flooded dominated by open water and mudflats wetland surrounded by farmlands water is permanently drained for agricultural purposes during the dry season megech is a river delta wetland that receives waste effluents generated from gondar city via the megech river invasive weed infestation water hyacinth sand mining siltation cultivation and free grazing are common practices chimba is a riverine floodplain wetland dominated by free grazing and cultivation 2 urban impaired wetlands the ras abbay and avaji wetlands were selected from the bahir dar city area the impact of gondar city was assessed from the megech wetland ras abbay is a riverine wetland the blue nile river crossing bahir dar city receives untreated municipal and industrial wastewater and then drains into the mosaic of mixed wetland habitats forested marsh and open water of ras abbay avaji is a shoreline wetland from abbay minch to bata church that receives storm water and domestic wastewater generated by hotels and fish landing sites from surrounding communities these two wetlands are subjected to urbanization and reed harvesting despite wetland disturbance by anthropogenic activities these sites support a well developed plant community gudo bahir is a bog type of wetland located at the western vicinity of bahir dar city receiving runoff from the small degraded hill catchment and then draining partly to the abbay river and the lake along the city canal it is devoid of vegetation and has severely affected buffer zones water abstraction and peat soil production are common practices among urban inhabitants for several purposes particularly during the dry season 3 less impacted wetlands given that natural reference wetlands were too difficult to find due to anthropogenic activity the kurt bahir wonjeta and legdiya wetlands were selected as reference wetlands currently these wetlands are recognized as core zones of the lake tana biosphere reserve kurt bahir is a palustrine type of wetland with rich reed swamp and natural vegetation within and around the wetlands respectively minimal free grazing with no settlement and less agricultural activities are common practices the wetland harbors a large population of catfish and serves as a breeding site of the wattled crane a globally vulnerable bird species wonjeta is a fen type of wetland originating from springs it is known for its papyrus and tree natural forests it is surrounded by rural settlements and the spring water is pumped for domestic purposes and small scale irrigation legdiya is a palustrine wetland rich in reed swamp over 75 and surrounded by mountain forests the gelgel abbay river passes along the wetland and feeds sediment and water to the wetland fig 2 2 3 study design cross sectional interviews of households hhds were conducted in january 2015 using clustered random sampling in the community living within a 3 km radius of each wetland turyahabwe et al 2013 abebe et al 2014 this method was used due to the heterogeneity of the communities in terms of their levels of benefits from and impacts on the wetlands in relation to their location twenty two kebeles 8 from agriculture 7 from urban and 7 from least impacted wetland areas surrounding each wetland habitat were involved in the study from each kebele at least 10 households were randomly selected among the immediate nearby localities two hundred twenty households plus additionally 21 agricultural and land use development agents as key informants ki made up the total of 241 individuals participating in the study community representatives were also included for focal group discussions fgd the ecosystem services especially some of the regulating services like flood chemical pollution sediment and climate change control were described to and discussed with the interviewees households indirectly from their understanding on underground water recharge and discharge duration of flood and water clarity associated with the vegetation cover 2 4 data collection and analysis the degraded ess and the ecological and biological conditions of the wetlands were assessed using a range of methods interviews human disturbance score hds water quality parameters and flora composition and diversity assessments wetlands were also rated and classified into least middle and high impaired wetland categories using the protocol of hds plant species identification diversity and similarity analysis were carried out for all wetlands physicochemical water parameters were assessed and analyzed so as to evaluate the water quality and ecological conditions of the wetlands the degree of human disturbances to the wetlands was assessed using the hds protocol method of gernes and helgen 2002 ecosystem services ess or benefits derived from each wetland ecosystem were identified and analyzed using data from local community interviews hhds key informants kis and focal group discussions fgd mea 2005 in addition to field observation and the available literature human disturbance of wetlands in ethiopia is described mainly in terms of hydrologic alteration through excessive withdrawal of water for agricultural purposes habitat disturbance and biodiversity deterioration through unwise exploitation of wetland products and changes in water quality due to urban expansion all these impose limitations in the proper functioning of wetlands and cause the loss of their ecosystem services therefore hds provides meaningful results indicating the status of wetlands these anthropogenic impacts are also being further aggravated by climate change a field survey was conducted for assessing the degree of disturbance to wetlands from the landscape physical condition water quality and biological data fish bird were also used in the assessment study these data were grouped into a number of measuring factors in order to calculate hds factor 1 buffer landscape disturbances within 50m from the edge of the wetland where the extent of disturbance ranges from 0 to 18 points factor 2 landscape disturbance within 500m from the edge of the wetland where the extent of disturbance ranges from 0 to 18 points factor 3 habitat alteration whole wetland area where the extent of severity ranges from 0 to 18 points factor 4 hydrological alteration where the degree of alteration ranges from 0 to 21 points factor 5 chemical pollution especially tn and tp salinity turbidity do from water sample where the degree of pollution ranges from 0 to 21 points factor 6 additional concerns presence absence of fish yield and bird count where the severity ranges from 0 to 4 points a standard checklist was used to collect data on wetland type hydrological conditions land use patterns ecological state and habitat assessment finally each factor was evaluated and rated scored in one of four categories ranging from best to poor as mentioned above then all the scored values from each factor were summed for each study wetland to obtain their human disturbance gradient score hdss out of a total of 100 according to the protocol of gernes and helgen 2002 if the categorical range of hds of a given wetland value falls within the ranges of 0 33 33 67 and 67 100 it can be classified as least impacted mid impacted and most or highly impacted respectively the interview was focused on each household s demographic and socio economic characteristics their understanding of the importance of each wetland ess and their attitude toward the wetland s restoration and management focal group discussions fgds were conducted in each wetland to obtain information on the local wetland status and ess resource use plant and water and major human activities the interviewers tried to use an indirect approach to address the wetland ecosystem services with the interviewers especially the regulating and supportive services for example in agriculture impaired areas regulating services were addressed in terms of water recharging and discharging which is related to the water supply during the dry season and the control of flooding in the rainy season in urban impaired areas on the other hand the regulating services were associated with the presence of wastewater regulating wetlands the conceptual model of the millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 was adopted for assessing and analyzing the ess of the wetlands studied the various ess derived from wetlands were classed into a limited set of es categories including provisioning cultural regulatory and supporting services ess were estimated measured in terms of the benefits economic and socio cultural values they provide to the local people who are directly involved in the use and management of the wetlands the respondents were asked to rate the ess listed for each wetland using terms of relative importance unsure low medium or high importance the four classes of services provisioning regulating cultural and supporting were rated across wetlands based on the adopted matrix of mea 2005 the relative degree of ecosystem services provided by each wetland were developed using field observations and the reports of households hhds key informant kis and focal group discussions fgd to identify community similarities between wetlands the sorensen similarity index was used this index ranges from 0 no similarity to 1 complete similarity corresponding to 0 to 100 shannon and wiener 1949 and is calculated using the following index ss 2a 2a b c where ss sorensen similarity index a the number of taxa at wetland site 1 b the number of taxa at wetland site 2 and c the number of taxa common to both compared sites 3 result and discussion 3 1 human disturbance and ecological status of wetlands physically there were differences among the wetlands studied although all the three agriculture dominated wetlands are highly affected by cultivation and free grazing they are rich in both native and wintering bird fauna their buffer habitats were highly degraded by overgrazing and drained or recession agriculture particularly during the dry season shesher was totally devoid of buffer vegetation sometimes losing the entirety of its water for about 2 months and a part of it is occupied by rural and urban settlement the chimba wetland was relatively covered by reed plant species such as typha latifolia and cyperus papyrus the megech lakeshore wetland was predominantly covered by alien invasive weeds such as water hyacinth eichornia crassipes water abstraction from both the river and the lake for small scale irrigation sand mining and illegal fishing were also common practices in this wetland along the megech river channel which affects the breeding ground of the riverine fish species fishing was common practice in both the shesher and megech wetlands as was seasonal reed harvesting in chimba thus all were characterized by currently active and major disturbances to the natural hydrology its buffer and landscape alteration and by partly altered habitat during the dry season with high potential for change in plant compositions although all three urban impacted wetlands receive urban wastes the ras abbay and avaji wetlands are permanently flooded and rich in both t latifolia and c papyrus plant species currently there is a trend involving the vegetation composition shifting from native to pollutant tolerant species such as persicaria sp urban construction fishing and intensive reed harvesting by the negede community were also common practices in both wetlands on the other hand the gudo bahir wetland had extensively impaired buffer zones the ras abbay and avaji wetlands receive wastes from the nearby bahir dar city whereas the gudo bahir wetland receives sediments and chemicals from the nearby catchment hotels car washes garages bus stations industrial facilities a brewery textile plant tannery etc and upstream erosion are potential sources of the pollutants due to these anthropogenic activities the accumulations of nutrients and other organic matter agrochemicals domestic waste from urban industrial wastewater in urban and agricultural wetlands were very high leading them to eutrophication table 2 in the reference wetlands on the other hand for many reasons such as the communally protected church owned and inaccessible status of the areas the human practices were few major human disturbances e g overexploitation of the wetland products recession agriculture free grazing to the wetlands buffer landscape and natural hydrology alterations were maintained even during the dry season including the natural vegetation thus the agricultural and urban wetlands were more impaired than the reference wetlands all the hds results were within the potential range of 0 100 higher human disturbance scores were recorded in the shesher 70 gudo bahir 71 and megech 77 wetlands the ras abbay avaji and chimba wetlands were considered as mid impacted wetlands the highest record of hds in the megech rm when compared to shesher was associated with the pollution impact from gondar city though situated at farther distance all the three reference wetlands were least impacted and floristically intact table 3 the wetland biodiversity hydrological and habitat natures and soil and microclimatic conditions were substantially affected by human interferences based on the average hds both agricultural hds 64 and urban hds 52 wetlands received proportionally greater human disturbances compared to the least impacted reference sites hds 15 this implies that both urban and agricultural wetlands had been exploited more as compared to the reference wetlands therefore human activities in urban and agriculture dominated rural areas are now the cause of wetland degradation in africa that is abstraction of water for agricultural and domestic uses recession agriculture overgrazing and mining in and around agricultural impaired wetlands mereta et al 2013 gebresllasse 2014 moges et al 2016a b leads to their degradation similarly urbanization infrastructural development and waste disposal in around urban wetlands mekonnen and aticho 2011 soni and bhatt 2008 moges et al 2016a b causes considerable accumulations of both organic and inorganic pollutants resulting in changes in water quality structure and vegetation composition and loss of nursery and breeding grounds of fish and bird species 3 2 economic and livelihood conditions of the households of the total sample only 3 5 of the households were female headed the average family size in these wetland areas is about 6 12 members with about 60 of the households exceeding the regional average 4 6 members the main effect of high population growth is excessive pressure on the environmental resources intense competition for grazing and farmland and unhealthy agricultural practices the average land holding is 1 73ha per head although about 10 of the households were landless this is a far better condition i e 50 hold above 2 00ha as compared to the average landholdings in ethiopia as a whole where the land carrying capacity has already surpassed the threshold level of one ha per family among users in agriculture dominated wetland areas 50 of them were uncertified table 4 although all the wetlands are communal a large share approx up to 1ha hh were encroached upon by more than 50 of the neighboring communities surprisingly a majority were subjected to degradation by those who own their own licensed large land holdings households in the studied wetland areas have livelihood activities which are mainly natural resource based these include livestock rearing arable farming crops horticulture chat growing collection of wetland products such as reeds thatching grass wild fruits medicinal plants etc basket making sand mining fishing and community based tourism in addition daily labor rural trade and boat transport are common income sources most of the livelihoods of the local communities in the wetlands studied were dominated by farming 100 except in the urban wetlands 13 89 on average a significant share of households 24 44 in urban wetland areas depend on semi intensive animal husbandry whereas animal rearing in agriculture and referenced areas is usually traditional in urban wetlands fishing 36 67 and harvesting of wetland products 33 33 such as papyrus plants and its inflorescence were followed by chat plantation 30 and small trade 25 56 livestock rearing 66 67 and chat plantation 38 9 were the livelihoods following farming in the referenced study sites increasing water abstraction using a number of motor pumps and free grazing are future potential threats to the least impacted wetlands table 5 a small proportion of households were engaged in cultural medication av 5 harvesting wetland products av 20 and church employment av 20 harvesting and hand crafting of wetland products e g papyrus were common practices of negede weyito community on the periphery of bahir dar city a majority of church owned wetlands were least impacted wetlands and provides employment opportunities to the church people although landholding was fully sufficient to support the majority of residents who had lived around the study wetlands expansion is not creating diversified economic opportunities fishing harvesting wetland products seedlings animal forage production etc in this rather still traditional farming system this finding entails different opportunities to conserve the wetlands unlike other studies on small holding families in most ethiopia di falcon and veronesi 2011 moges 2016a 3 3 ecosystem services ess based on the conceptual model adopted ess were assessed and grouped into provisioning cultural regulating and supporting services ecosystem services were assessed using collective methods of field observation table 6 household interview data table 7 fgd and key informants information from woreda experts 3 4 provisioning services crops were dominant in agriculture and least impacted wetlands all except rice were produced from water abstraction and recession agriculture during the dry season cash crops such as chat catha edulis and vegetables were dominant 32 86 in the urban and least impacted wetlands the fish catch was higher in agriculture impacted wetlands 45 followed by urban wetland types degradation of breeding grounds of the nile tilapia in the megech river mouth and shorelines of the lake and declines in the fish stock have also been reported wondie 2010 wondie et al 2014 both cultivated mango gesho coffee sugar cane banana and uncultivated cordia africana carissa spinarum mimusops kummel syzgium guineense millettia ferruginea ficus vasta plants were commonly harvested in the periphery rocky areas of the least impacted wetlands 10 71 43 followed by urban impacted wetlands 8 57 14 28 respectively on average about 12 73 of households reported harvesting honey primarily from referenced wetlands 28 57 fig 3 water abstracted for human drinking was commonly used by a large proportion of households 75 71 and 43 75 in reference and agriculture impacted wetland types respectively the shesher and megech wetlands were highly affected by irrigation especially during the dry season however no water was used for human drinking in the urban impacted wetlands because of waste discharges from the surroundings including wastes from car washing municipal and industrial effluents in bahir dar city table 7 water from wetlands and peripheral springs guarantees the local communities year round access to drinking water for themselves and their livestock in ethiopia dixon and wood 2007 moreover wetlands provide rural communities with a vital source of drinking water because they can purify polluted water wondie 2010 daily 1997 reed plants of papyrus and typha grasses of animal fodder sand or peat soil and medicinal plants were analyzed as raw materials reed plants were collected for sale to make reed boats baskets thatching mattresses and the inflorescence for the purposes of continuous and periodic festivals for this about 3 75 21 43 and 64 28 were reported from agriculture urban and reference wetland types respectively information from kis and fgd revealed that the livelihood of a number of young people especially females depends on harvesting and selling cheffe inflorescence for coffee ceremony and making tourist baskets similarly 4 and 13 of households from the urban and agricultural wetland types were reported to depend on making wetland handcrafts like mats and raising of seedlings respectively moges 2016a almost all respondents reported using wetlands for cattle grazing and many of them for animal fodder additionally sand mining and peat soil were practiced in megech and gudo bahir wetlands table 7 in general wetlands have been drained for agricultural purposes including the growing of crops vegetables and fruits crops are produced primarily in agricultural wetlands by draining them partially without agrochemical application during the dry season wetlands with extensive agriculture but without fertilizer herbicide or pesticide application often provide additional services to food production such as flood regulation and maintenance of water quality or biodiversity wondie 2010 the iwmi 2006 also reported that more than 65 of residents in the bumbwisudi wetland in zanzibar used irrigation for agriculture to support their livelihoods the respondents reported that the local authorities were encouraging the cultivation of wetlands to create new job opportunities and increase crop productivity instead of working on diversification this indicates that decision making bodies in africa continue to devote little attention to the importance of wetland ess for example the rwandan gowa 2009 and kenyan gichuki et al 2001 governments have also supported the conversion of wetlands for crop production to mitigate food insecurity and improve the livelihoods of rural communities 3 5 regulating services the majority of households described increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation in all three types of wetlands and hydrological alteration other studies have reported similar findings yeshanew 2007 moges 2016a over 50 of households believed almost all wetland types played important roles in regulating floods purifying water and retaining sediments table 6 from the same table the lower perceptions of erosion protection 17 27 and higher perceptions of flood control 51 36 can be explained in that most of the studied wetlands are situated in the floodplain areas of lake tana particularly the agriculture and urban impaired wetlands moreover professionals opinions and field observations showed that urban impacted wetlands provide the highest pollution control regulating services though urban impacted wetlands are severely reduced in their function by the urban waste they still have a significant role in regulating pollutant chemicals as compared to others 3 6 cultural services almost all of the wetlands were used for cultural services reported by more than 75 reference wetlands are ideal places for spiritual educational and research services since the sections of each wetland were owned by churches thus the religious peoples in these areas protect the wetlands the kis and fgds reported that spiritual events including the orthodox christian festivals of the ethiopian epiphany had been celebrated annually in rural wetlands similar research in the jimma wetlands indicated that spiritual and educational research services were dominant in urban wetland types moges 2016a 3 7 supporting services wetland supporting services includes the provision of breeding nursery feeding and refugia of plants and animals biodiversity conservation services are recognized by more than 65 of households table 6 largely by those from the agricultural 75 and reference 71 47 wetland types especially for their bird diversity though agricultural impaired wetlands are poor in their vegetation cover they are rich in bird and fish diversity fgd and kis also acknowledged the importance of reference and urban wetlands 47 14 in providing habitats for several species of sedges and grass species as well as breeding grounds for various species of birds such as common crane wattled crane crowned crane mammals such as hippopotamuses and monkeys were also observed other researches also reported that wetlands provide for wildlife breeding and nursery habitats moges 2016a and support wetland vegetation species woldu and yeshitela 2003 3 8 relative importance of wetland ess the four classes of services provisioning regulating cultural and supporting were rated as unsure low medium or high importance across wetlands based on the adopted matrix of mea 2005 the relative degree of ecosystem services provided by each wetland was identified using field observations and the reports of hhds kis and fgd fig 4 the main food provisioning services were obtained mainly from agricultural impaired and reference wetlands the level of exploitation of the resources was of much lower impact in the reference wetlands than in agricultural impaired wetlands verhoeven and setter 2009 reported that wetlands influenced by extensive agriculture with suitable wetland conservation can provide sustainable ecosystem services however altering wetlands through improper uses and waste discharge can potentially degrade wetlands and undermine their capacity to provide services in the future jogo and hassan 2010 moges 2016a chat plantation and fruit were dominant in urban impaired sites ras abbay avaji and nearby areas of reference sites wonjeta kurt bahir harvesting raw materials such as the papyrus plant for various purposes and animal fodder grasses were common in reference sites followed by urban impaired wetlands value addition such as hand crafting of baskets and mats as income generation was common practice in the ras abbay and avaji wetlands freshwater resources were primarily used for domestic purposes and small scale irrigation in reference sites followed by agricultural impaired wetlands fig 4 similar studies in the jimma illubabur wetlands revealed that very few people use freshwater for drinking from urban wetlands due to municipal waste impacts ambelu et al 2013 moges et al 2016a a majority of respondents also positively understood the regulatory supporting and cultural services of wetlands table 7 however the policy and decision making supports especially in urban and agricultural impaired wetlands were not compatible with the interests of the local community the ras abbay wetland was highest in receiving municipal and industrial wastewater followed by the megech wetland since most of the wetlands are situated in the floodplains of the lake flood control and sediment retention were regulated usually by agricultural impaired and reference wetland types supporting services such as biodiversity conservation were high especially in agricultural and referenced wetlands for their bird fish and plant diversity respectively rural wetlands both agricultural and referenced ones were also used for ecotourism such as bird watching and game fishing in association with the already rich cultural heritages in the catchment most reference and some agricultural impaired wetlands provided spiritual services such as ethiopian epiphany ceremonial places in general all data sources revealed that these wetlands have important ecosystem services though urbanization misuse of resources poor waste management systems and conversion of wetlands to farmland weak policy and decision making support such as wetland use planning investment interventions and communal land ownership and poor development of diversified livelihood were major challenges to sustainable utilization of wetland resources for these reasons though the local community are willing and interested to conserve wetlands practical measures have not been taken toward restoring and protecting wetlands rather unwisely the papyrus and cattail plant resources are being exploited and wetlands are being converted mainly to agricultural land and grazing lands in urban by the poor negede weyito people and agricultural neighboring farmers wetlands respectively moreover the kis and fgd participants were asked about the management aspects conservation activities being performed within around and or in the catchments of the wetlands the majority of the kis and members of fgd replied that little effort had been made to date toward restoring and protecting areas in and or around the wetlands through participation of the local community however some management activities such as ras abbay being delineated as a park and some physical and biological conservation measures have been taken around wetlands and in some catchments of urban and agricultural wetland types by some civic societies and government bodies respectively lamsal et al 2015 in nepal and moges 2016a in jimma also reported that people s participation in conservation efforts was inadequate although they maintained a positive attitude toward wetland conservation the absence of a wetland policy and the delayed ratification of the ramsar convention by the ethiopian government have also contributed to the unrelieved conversion of wetland ecosystems 3 9 vegetation community similarity the dominant plant species were reported by ayalew et al 2016 the average plant community similarity index among wetlands was generally low 20 the least similarity 5 was observed between both gudo bahir and shesher with other wetlands followed by megech with the rest of the wetlands 10 except for the aforementioned two the highest similarity index 55 6 was recorded between legdiya and kurt bahir followed by legdiya and wonjeta 50 gudo bahir and shesher 47 and avaji and ras abbay 45 3 table 8 the reasons for the low average percentage similarity is due to low plant diversity in some urban and agriculture impacted wetlands similarly the low diversity in the gudo bahir and shesher wetlands was the cause for the low similarity index in the same wetland use type species richness is low because of high levels of stress or disturbance and or the dominance by a few strong competitors some studies indicate that annual grass dominated wetlands with the highest frequency of soil disturbance from farming practices has the lowest biodiversity richness density than perennial plant dominated ones enrichment especially in urban wetlands increases diversity but this increase is accounted for by invasive exotic species plant diversity tends to be higher in degraded habitats these human disturbance factors may also have resulted in a change in the composition of the wetland plant communities the plant community composition would be related to the environmental conditions of the surrounding land use activities associated with wetlands this was due to anthropogenic activities being conducted within the agricultural and urban wetlands and their catchments besides waste discharges via streams including ditches particularly crossing the towns mulatu et al 2014 ruto et al 2012 alvarez et al 2012 and mulatu et al 2014 also reported disturbed wetlands as having more diversity compared to the undisturbed natural wetlands in kenya and tanzania and in ethiopia respectively 4 conclusions in the ethiopian wetlands we studied farming was the main source of livelihood although most households had their own sufficient landholdings to meet their needs overexploitation and conversion of wetlands to farmlands was still found to be ongoing recession agriculture and abstraction of water for small scale irrigation during the dry season in the shesher and megech wetlands and invasive alien species such as the water hyacinth in megech are the main threats identified in this research all but the reference wetlands were gradually found to be degrading with extensive human activity our findings indicate that reference and agricultural impacted wetlands currently provide more provisioning and cultural services while regulatory and supporting services are predominantly provided by urban wetlands followed by reference wetlands though they are highly impacted many households were interested in participating in wetland conservation protection restoration and management despite the un preplanned and non knowledge based interventions made by decision makers such as the redistribution of wetlands to landless youth by changing the land use the absence of wetland registration as communal land owned by the local community maintaining the tragedy of the commons principle and the absence of wetland legal and institutional frameworks therefore development and implementation of integrated catchment based ecological protection restoration management and sustainable use of wetlands as well as ratification of the ramsar convention and the development of wetland policy will be possible management options to sustainably utilize wetland ecosystems moreover consideration should be given to planning conservation awareness programs among the people about the importance of wetlands and their conservation engaging the local stakeholders in any conservation plan of wetlands and optimizing food yield per unit area through creating diversified livelihoods and by conserving wetlands and protecting their functions regarding the status of the wetlands the megech gudo bahir and shesher wetlands were seriously impaired by human activities carried out within and their catchments and hence were classified as high impaired wetlands followed by the ras abbay chimba and avaji wetlands grouped as mid impaired wetland moges et al 2016a moreover as reported in many papers e g moges et al 2016a alvarez et al 2012 ruto et al 2012 human factors are the major contributors for wetland degradation and alteration of biological community composition the extent of urbanization and land use activities strongly influence the species composition of wetland plant communities ehrenfeld and schneider 1991 yet the ras abbay and avaji wetlands were mid impaired as they were parts of the urban wetland agricultural wetlands scored the least species richness diversity and evenness than reference and urban impaired wetland types due to anthropogenic activities these activities include drainage for agriculture overgrazing and siltation however agricultural wetlands were dominated by annual and invasive alien species hence extensive and more frequent human disturbances were the most determinant factors for altering wetland plant composition and diversity most wetlands in ethiopia especially agriculture and urban impacted ones can be sustainably managed using eco hydrology as a tool restored or enhanced wetlands ecotones at stream and river valleys traps nutrients fertilizers and pesticides transported from the agricultural landscapes into freshwater ecosystems man made and natural wetland macrophytes buffer zones in cities like bahir dar and gondar regulate excessive nutrients especially in the retention of phosphorus and organic matter through a sequential sedimentation biofiltration system in general this study confirms that that regulation of biota by altering hydrology and vice versa the eco hydrology principle of dual regulation of wetland ecosystems is a mandatory approach for the wetlands in the lake tana area

1171,although the functioning of river floodplains as sink or source of nutrients has been studied extensively for temperate regions similar studies in tropical regions are less abundant and studies integrating data about floodplain soil vegetation and water are scarce we examined and compared nutrient contents in soil water and vegetation tissue in two different vegetation zones on the monsoon songkhram river floodplain thailand significant differences were found between bamboo and grass zones the soil in the bamboo zone is more fertile than the soil in the grass zone as indicated by the lower c n ratio and has significantly higher organic matter and higher total n and k bamboo leaf tissue had significantly higher concentrations of nutrients than grass biomass the growth of the bamboo is p limited or p and n co limited but grass is n limited in both zones the soil available p and organic carbons after flooding were significantly lower than before flooding floodwater in both zones had low dissolved solid concentrations after the flood peak most concentrations tended to increase especially organic carbon and dissolved nitrogen but phosphorus decreased the results suggest a significant loss of organic carbon from the soil after flooding indicating that the floodplain acts as a source of carbon that is exported downstream nonetheless it is also evident that the floodwater brings in sediment and nutrients based on rough estimations of nutrient budgets we conclude that the highly productive bamboo zone adjacent to the river filters out the nutrients before they reach the grass zone keywords floodplain functioning vegetation zonation nutrient limitation ephemeral wetlands mekong river 1 introduction river floodplains have been studied by wetland scientists for decades since they represent ecosystems with valuable services to mankind understanding their hydrological and ecological functioning adds to insight into their key processes and how to preserve and protect them the relevance of preservation of floodplains goes beyond the actual floodplain itself since floodplains are typical connecting elements in the landscape between the hinterland and the river and also connect upstream areas with downstream areas due to this landscape connectivity river floodplains harbor longitudinal and lateral gradients humphries et al 2014 junk and wantzen 2004 vannote et al 1980 and both vegetation productivity in floodplains and nutrient processes are related to the size of the parent river and its water quality spink et al 1998 thorp and delong 1994 it is therefore important to study floodplain processes further to understand how these processes are linked to spatial zonation in the floodplain upstream areas and their distance from the river the hydrology and topography of floodplains largely determine their water flow the development of gradients and the existence of zones with different biological communities two other important factors that determine nutrient cycling in these communities are temperature and hydrochemistry floodplain hydrochemistry depends on the sources of inundation water the principal sources are river water groundwater and precipitation or mixtures of these river floodwater is generally a source of nutrients suspended and dissolved mertes 1997 venterink et al 2006 wassen et al 2003 gradients in flood stress e g depth current velocity and oxygen stress during long term inundations and different magnitudes of nutrient and sediment inputs bring about spatial differentiation in productivity which together with nutrient cycling processes result in distinct vegetation patterns in temperate floodplains keizer et al 2014 wassen et al 2003 wassen and joosten 1996 wu and blodau 2015 similar to the temperate floodplains clear vegetation zonation along flooding gradients are observed in large tropical floodplains around the world i e the amazon basin the okavango delta the mekong tonle sap and the tropical northern australia wet dry system parolin et al 2016 parolin and wittmann 2010 spatial patterns of vegetation in these tropical floodplains are the result of their adaptation and response to seasonally flooding characteristic especially depth and duration arias et al 2016 parolin et al 2016 although each individual floodplain can have additional factors that influence the development of zonation such as interactions between soil surface water and groundwater affecting the salinity in the okavango floodplain ellery et al 1993 ellery and tacheba 2003 the effect on soil moisture due to disturbances from humans and fire in the mekong tonle sap arias et al 2013 and changing stream velocities during flood in the northern australia wet dry tropics finlayson 2005 finlayson et al 1990 in addition nutrient availability in floodplains is an important factor as it determines the productivity of the floodplains spatial patterns of nutrient availability can directly cause vegetation zonation but can also influence seedling establishment strategies which result in spatial patterns of vegetation in floodplains parolin 2002 crucial factors that determine nutrient dynamics and floodplain productivity are the hydrological regime and geochemical characteristics of the catchment spink et al 1998 the hydrological regime may be characterized by three main river discharge stages 1 a base flow stage 2 a rising stage and 3 the falling stage as described in the river wave concept humphries et al 2014 and flood pulse concept junk and wantzen 2004 during the base flow stage the river and the floodplain are in a stage of low connectivity during intense rainfall the resulting terrestrial runoff not only causes water levels in the river channel to rise the rising stage but also transports dissolved and particulate nutrients when the river overtops its banks water from the river channel will inundate the floodplain importing nutrients at that moment an aquatic system establishes on the floodplain and the floodwater transports suspended matter dissolved solids and propagules the transport distance and the sedimentation rate are both a function of water velocity and floodplain topography and they lead to a spatial redistribution of matter and organisms ward et al 2002 wiens 2002 zuijdgeest et al 2015 floodplain productivity is determined by the biomass production of phytoplankton macro algae aquatic plants and helophytes the major source of nutrients for aquatic production during the inundation phase is thought to be floodwater with the floodplain soil playing a minor role and thus when water stops overtopping the river banks the supply of nutrients diminishes as do nutrient concentrations in the floodwater lewis et al 2000 in turn floodplains can be an important source for organic carbon exported downstream via the river after the floods retreat junk and wantzen 2004 zuijdgeest et al 2015 to date most of the studies on the nutrient cycling processes occurring in floodplains have been on temperate systems e g baldwin and mitchell 2000 venterink et al 2003 2002 wassen et al 2003 they have shown that river floodplains can function as a sink for nutrients such as n and p and for sediment since both biomass production and organic matter decomposition depend greatly on temperature baldwin and mitchell 2000 it can be expected that there will be a clear difference in these processes between temperate catchments and tropical catchments river floodplains in tropical regions may therefore be very different from temperate regions mcjannet et al 2012 showed that a tropical floodplain was a sink for phosphorus but found no evidence for a nitrogen sink most studies in tropical river floodplains have analyzed the relationship between soil characteristic hydrology and vegetation structure and composition e g arias et al 2013 finlayson 2005 murray hudson et al 2011 wittmann et al 2008 and to some extent the hydrochemistry e g ellery et al 1993 vegetation community patterns in tropical floodplains show clear correlations with flood characteristics such as flood duration and flood depth arias et al 2016 demonstrated in their recent hydrogeological concept for vegetation distribution in tropical floodplains that a lower species diversity was found with longer flood duration and larger flood depth beside the relationship between flooding and vegetation types flood characteristics also influence soil properties and nutrient contents e g arias et al 2013 however little is known about the rate of nutrient cycling in tropical floodplains and how this relates to seasonal dynamics tropical monsoon rivers in particular exhibit a strong seasonal dynamic hydrologic pattern the large amounts of rain characteristic in the monsoon period lead to low concentrations of dissolved matter and nutrients in river water during floodplain inundation walalite et al 2016 however similar to temperate floodplains monsoon floodplains may show a distinct zonation of more productive and less productive vegetation arias et al 2016 walalite et al 2016 zuijdgeest et al 2015 in the present study we contribute to the sparse knowledge on tropical monsoon floodplain ecological functioning by presenting data on the songkhram river in thailand our two aims are to explore spatial differences in nutrient distribution in water soil and vegetation for two distinct vegetation zones in the floodplain bamboo and grass and to understand the interaction between the flood characteristics and the vegetation with respect to nutrient fluxes and stores in a previous study walalite et al 2016 we identified two major vegetation communities that dominate in the floodplain a bamboo zone that is widespread throughout the floodplain in a belt close to the river and a grassland type behind the bamboo zone and thus further away from the river in our earlier paper we hypothesized that the high annual biomass production of the bamboo zone is driven by the floods importing nutrients and sediment and we urged for further research to analyze nutrient input and uptake in the grass and the bamboo zone the present paper aims to verify this hypothesis and test if the less productive grassland zone behind the bamboo does indeed receive less input of nutrients from the river 2 study area the songkhram river catchment is situated in the monsoon climate region of north eastern thailand fig 1 it is approximately 495km long drains an area of 13 000km2 and its average discharge is 226m3 s 1 during the monsoon season and 2 3m3 s 1 during the dry season annual precipitation averages 1960mm and ranges from 1090 to 2880mm the monsoon season lasts from may to september and is followed by a cool dry season from october to february that is succeeded by a hot dry season from march to april during the monsoon season the average precipitation is 1690mm range 906 2420mm this compares with an average precipitation of 270mm range 80 490mm during the dry season figures compiled from daily data from the department of water resources thailand mean annual daily temperature is 26 c and the warmest month is april monthly mean of 35 c from december to january the minimum night temperature is around 15 c the floodplain we studied lies in the lower catchment of the songkharam river fig 1 and is inundated yearly due to the high river discharges during the monsoon season the average flooded area of this floodplain is estimated to be 760 855km2 thiha et al 2012 walalite et al 2016 the land uses of the flood prone area in the non flood season are agriculture 52 grassland herbaceous vegetation and shrubs together 20 open water 9 marsh 8 deciduous forest 6 native riparian bamboo 4 and buildings 1 the native floodplain vegetation community which is known as pa bung pa taam fig 2 comprises a distinct strip of dense thorny bamboo bambusa flexuosa next to the river channel behind which is a zone of grassland communities dominated by miscanthus fuscus blake et al 2011 walalite et al 2016 fig 3 presents a conceptual cross section from the river across the floodplain to the higher non flooded land on the side of the river valley showing the zonation of bamboo and grass communities 3 methods 3 1 sampling locations and time line of fieldwork campaign we established four transects in the monsoon floodplain of the songkhram river fig 1 each transect started on the river bank and extended over the vegetation gradient of the bamboo thicket on the river bank and the grass communities behind both of which are inundated during the monsoon as far as the higher lying non flooded forest zone see figs 2 and 3 vegetation soil and floodwater were sampled during different periods in 2015 fig 4 depicts them in relation to rainfall and river water levels 3 2 vegetation sampling and analysis the bamboo fresh mature leaves were sampled in february 2015 in order to determine nutrient concentrations see below we took samples from 15 different locations distributed over the seasonally flooded bamboo zone aboveground standing crop was harvested as a proxy for annual plant production as the bamboo produces fresh shoots and leaves all year round we counted the newly formed shoots per m2 and ignored the shoots from previous years shoots were dried and weighed in order to estimate the aboveground annual production gdrywt m2 for the grass zone we harvested aboveground living biomass from 9 locations in august 2015 which was when grass growth had peaked following monsoon rain water input at each location three 50 50cm plots were harvested the bamboo leaves and the grass biomass were dried at 105 c for 4h and the standing crop was expressed as gdrywt m2 the three replicates were averaged the dry plant material was ground and analyzed for nitrogen n and carbon c using a c n analyzer part of the ground sample was digested by nitric acid 65 hno3 and analyzed for phosphorus p potassium k calcium ca magnesium mg zinc zn aluminum al silica si iron fe sulfur s and manganese mn using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 3 3 soil sampling and analysis soil samples were collected during two field campaigns before the flood june july 2015 and after the flood november 2015 at the same locations seven of the sites were in the bamboo zone and 6 were in the grassland zone the soil samples were taken using a stainless steel soil corer 5 2cm long 5cm diameter three cores were collected at each site in an area of ca 10m2 soil samples were air dried at room temperature for 2 weeks after drying the soil was ground and sieved through a 0 5mm sieve for further chemical analysis soil ph was measured from a solution of 10g soil sample with 10ml of demineralized water the available phosphorus p in the soil sample was determined from 5g of soil using bray 2 solution as extractant the concentration of the extractable phosphorus was determined by colorimetric and spectrophotometric methods ammonium exchangeable potassium k in the soil sample was also determined from 5g of soil using 1m ammonium acetate as extractant the k concentration in the extracted solution was determined using a flame photometer total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were determined by the walkley black and macro kjeldahl digestion methods respectively 3 4 floodwater sampling and analysis in total 33 samples of floodwater were collected at two stages of the flood the first 17 samples was obtained during the peak flood 10 15 august 2015 the second 16 samples was obtained while the flood was subsiding 27 28 august 2015 along each transect the sampling sites were in the main river channel in the bamboo zone and in the grass zone at each site 4l of water were collected from approximately 30cm below the level of the floodwater using a polyethylene pe bottle which was pre washed by the water to be sampling onsite to collect a sample the bottle was dipped into the floodwater as soon as a sample had been taken its ec temperature dissolved oxygen and ph were determined the sample was then stored in a cooler at approximately 4 c the depth of floodwater at each site was measured using a measuring tape weighted at one end the water samples were delivered to a laboratory for preparation and treatment within 24h of collection each sample was mixed thoroughly and then divided into three subsamples the first subsample was filtered through 0 45μm cellulose acetate membrane filter and divided into two aliquots of 50ml to the first 1ml of nitric acid 65 concentration was added for ion analysis by means of icp oes the second was not acidified and prepared to analyze dissolved organic carbon doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn the second subsample was prepared for unfiltered water analysis aliquots of 250 and 125ml from this unfiltered subsample were stored in wide mouth pe bottles the first 250ml was acidified by adding 2ml of 65 concentrated nitric acid for total phosphorus tp analysis the 125ml was not acidified prior to analyses for toc and total nitrogen tn prior to analysis all samples were kept in cool ca 4 c and dark conditions additionally within 24h of collection a 5ml aliquot was taken and its alkalinity was measured using a hi 3811 100 chemical test kit hanna instruments 2016 the third subsample was prepared to determine total suspended solid tss and organic matter om between 500 and 1000ml depending on filtration speed was filtered through 0 7μm whatman gf f glass fiber filter of known weight the filter with its residual suspended solid was then dried at 105 c for 24h cooled in a desiccator and weighed subsequently the filter was combusted at 400 c for 16h and the weight after combustion was used to determine the amount of om lost during combustion 3 5 determination of nutrient limitation in vegetation to determine the type of nutrient limitation we followed venterink et al 2003 who used a method based on critical values of n p n k and k p ratios in aboveground plant material n limited sites were those with n p ratio 14 5 and n k ratio 2 1 whereas p limited sites and sites limited in both p and n were those with a n p ratios 14 5 and k p ratios 3 4 sites limited in k or in k n were those with n k ratios 2 1 and k p ratios 3 4 3 6 estimation of nutrient storage in soil and vegetation and input from floodwater and atmosphere the total n and available p and k in the soil were determined by analyzing the top 5cm of each soil core concentrations of total n and available p and k in mg per gram soil were multiplied by the soil bulk density g soil per m3 volume and the volume of the top 5cm soil in 1m2 to obtain an indication of the annual aboveground nutrient storage g nutrient m2 in the bamboo zone we multiplied the dry weight m2 by the nutrient n p and k concentrations measured in the fresh leaves mgnutrient gdrywt assuming this to be a reasonable estimate for the whole shoot for the grass zone we used the sampled aboveground biomass of grass g m2 and multiplied it by the nutrient concentrations mg nutrient gdrywt in the grass biomass sample of each site to estimate the potential amount of nutrients imported by floodwater to a certain area we averaged the concentrations of nutrients and the depth of floodwater for the 2 flood stage from each site the volume of standing water l m2 was calculated from the average depth of each site then the average nutrient concentration was multiplied by the volume of the standing water l m2 by using the above method we assumed that the system works with a peak discharge in the floodplains after which no new water enters the floodplain anymore and only water outflow takes place after the peak if this is the case it is justified to use our calculation an alternative would be to consider every time step a new inflow and probably also outflow but we did not observe any indication for this in the field total n and k from atmospheric deposition in thailand was extracted from world data centre for precipitation chemistry vet et al 2014 4 results we found significant differences between the bamboo and grass zones table 1 both before and after the flood the soil in the bamboo zone had significantly higher om contents higher total n and k contents and lower bulk density before the flood the soil in the bamboo zone had higher organic carbon toc and available phosphorus p and lower c n ratio than the grass zone these results indicate that the bamboo soil is more fertile than the grass soil however the high c n ratios in both zones bamboo 52 grass 48 table 1 indicate that both soils have poor n fertility after the floods a significant decrease of organic carbon from the soil in both zones is found and further the drop in the c n ratio shows that the floods export organic carbon from the floodplain and fertilize both zones comparison of the water samples taken at the peak of the flood and during its recession reveals that after the peak sedimentation of suspended matter occurs and the concentration of dissolved solid increased possibly due to high evapotranspiration caused by the high tropical temperatures 30 c table 2 this is reflected in decreases in tss and increases in ec cl and other major ions during the subsidence of the flood dissolved oxygen do tp and po4 3 also decreased significantly in the floodwater and alkalinity increased table 2 probably because of the algal blooms we observed during the second sampling the productivity of the bamboo vegetation is high estimated to be ca 5tondrywt ha yr of aboveground biomass the grass zone is also productive though less so it averaged 3 5tondrywt ha yr table 3 analysis of aboveground plant tissue indicates that concentrations of all three major nutrients n p and k are significantly higher in the bamboo vegetation zone than in the grass zone nutrient ratios indicate that bamboo growth is limited by p or co limited by p and n whereas the vegetation of the grass zone is limited by n we did not find any indications of k co limitation table 3 5 discussion 5 1 similarities and differences in ecological functioning between temperate and tropical floodplains integration of our data on soil water and vegetation led to the emergence of a coherent pattern of flood related nutrient and carbon fluxes that are spatially and temporarily differentiated first the significant loss of organic carbon from the soil after the flood indicates that the floodplain is a source of carbon and this carbon is probably exported downstream this is also illustrated by the doc and toc in the floodwater which increase significantly after the floodplain becomes an aquatic system while inundated this implies that organic carbon produced in the floodplain is exported via the retreating floodwater this was also reported by zuijdgeest et al 2015 for the floodplain along the zambezi in southern africa where om that had been produced upstream was transported downstream and was exported this illustrates how large floodplain systems act as large biogeochemical reactors that behave distinctly different from the rest of the catchment zuijdgeest et al 2015 in our case the part of the floodplain we sampled seems to be a source of carbon for the river and downstream areas second we clearly observed a role of the vegetation zonation in floodplain functioning in the songkhram floodplain clear zonations of bamboo and grass are present it was found earlier that for tropical floodplains vegetation patterns in structure and community are determined by the duration and the depth of the flood arias et al 2016 parolin et al 2016 in addition to these main factors the hydrochemistry of inundated water and the soil and topography can cause stress in vegetation functioning and therefore cause patterns in vegetation in the tropics where vegetation production is optimal around the year adaptation to flood stress seems to be the key mechanism of spatial heterogeneity in species community parolin and wittmann 2010 further arias et al 2013 showed that the mean annual flood duration and soil properties determined canopy height canopy cover and above ground biomass of the tonle sap floodplain forest in cambodia in our songkhram river floodplain the zones of bamboo and grass experience different stresses 1 a higher flood stress higher nutrient input and higher productivity in the bamboo zone and 2 a lower flood stress lower nutrient input and lower productivity in the grassland the bamboo experiences higher flood depth and duration which force the bamboo to quickly take up available nutrients and having fast shoot growth to escape from the flooding the higher productivity is supported by additional nutrient uptake from the flood water as a result om production is much higher in the bamboo zone than in the grassland leading to higher om content in the soil of the bamboo zone this difference is attributable not only to the vigorous growth of the bamboo but also at least partly to the prominent algal blooms in this zone after the floods have receded these algae remain on the ground and start to decompose rapidly in the warm and still moist conditions comparison of the temperatures in our tropical catchment with the temperature ranges of seven large floodplains in north america and europe reported in spink et al 1998 shows that the temperatures in songkhram are very different they are consistently very high the grassland zone is usually found next to the bamboo zone although the flood depth and duration in this zone is lower than the bamboo zone due to its topography vegetation in this zone is fully submerged limited nutrients in this zone leads to a lower productivity therefore the combination of flood stress and nutrient limitation determines the vegetation in this zone interestingly we found the songkhram is very similar to the river shannon in ireland in terms of catchment size discharge and soil and vegetation nutrient contents data on the shannon reported by spink et al 1998 the shannon is a typical example of a predominantly rainwater fed river poor in solutes as is the case for the songkhram river and also for the siberian river ob which is fed mainly by snow melt schipper et al 2007 in the floodplains of these three rivers with very different climates vegetation production is driven more by sedimentation and mineralization of om than by dissolved nutrients brought in by floodwater although the songkhram floodwater exports om from the floodplain it is also evident that the floods import sediment and nutrients the water samples taken and flooding depths measured at the peak and at the end of the flood period illustrate this at the peak of the flood the floodwater is very deep on average 4m after the monsoon rains had ceased the concentration of tss in the sampled water was only half of the peak flood s tss concentration table 2 visual observations also revealed that the water at the second sampling was much more transparent 5 2 nutrient budgets we roughly estimated the nutrient budgets for the bamboo and the grass zone see section 3 6 and were able to further differentiate between n p and k fluxes and reserves fig 5 although it must be noted that our estimates are only rough approximating indicators nitrogen although atmospheric deposition of n in the songkhram catchment is significant 6 5kgn ha yr it is moderate compared to the deposition in other areas in s e asia vet et al 2014 and the floods bring in twice as much n into the grass zone and three times as much into the bamboo zone than is deposited from the atmosphere fig 5a most of the n stored annually in the aboveground biomass must thus be obtained from the soil this is especially evident for the bamboo zone since the n from atmospheric n deposition plus the estimated n input via the flood add up to far less than the n in biomass additional n input to the system can also relate to large particulate organic matter pom from flood water n from the floodwater is rather not only originating from dissolved organic matter but also relates to pom this pom in flood water would also be an important source for n input to the floodplains this is also demonstrated by our data showing that water om did not change but toc and doc increased in the second sampling this indicates that organic matter is also a source for nutrients during the flood n from the pom is then filtered by the bamboo deposited on the soil and becomes quickly part of the soil through bioturbation mermillod blondin 2011 our schematic cross section in fig 5 also reveals that the bamboo zone may function as a filter trapping most of the n from the floodwater before the water reaches the grass zone further away from the river phosphorus atmospheric deposition of p is probably negligible unless dust storms occur which to our knowledge has not been the case it appears that compared with the amount of p that could hypothetically be imported from the atmosphere and the floods the amount of p stored annually in aboveground biomass is four times higher in the bamboo zone and two to three times higher in the grass zone so as was the case for n the soil must also be an important source of p remarkably the soil in both zones contains only minor amounts of p which implies that most of the available p is taken up rapidly as is also observed in tropical forests where almost all nutrients are sequestered in standing vegetation vitousek and sanford 1986 the bamboo zone may as was the case for n also filter out p taking up p from the floodwater before it reaches the grass zone further away from the river potassium it is very clear that the flood is the major source compared to the amount of k available in the soil and the amount of k deposited from the atmosphere the potential input of k from the floods is important again we speculate that the bamboo zone may function as a filter taking up k from the floodwater before it reaches the grass zone more distant from the river as illustrated in fig 3 which shows i some depression within the bamboo zone and ii the bamboo zone to be wider than the grass zone in the higher flooding littoral it should not be surprising that the bamboo is the dominant filtering vegetation unit especially regarding the height above the mean and the bank full water levels comparison of our very roughly estimated nutrient flows with the flows reported by other studies in river floodplains reveals some general patterns our findings are similar to those of venterink et al 2002 for temperate european river systems these authors also found most of the n in aboveground vegetation was obtained from turnover in the soil but they also concluded that the input of p and k from the river must have been substantial in another study performed in the floodplain of the european river rhine venterink et al 2006 reported similar findings to ours sediment deposition was an important mechanism of retention of nutrients especially of p and nutrient retention was much greater in reed beds comparable to our bamboo zone than in grasslands the authors postulated that the high sediment deposition rate in their floodplain reed bed was the result of the roughness of the vegetation structure which reduced the water velocity facilitating sedimentation and trapping nutrients in contrast to this mcjannet et al 2012 argue that in tropical riverine wetlands where there is strong seasonality in flows and short residence time during the periods of maximum sediment and nutrient loads there is likely to be limited overall filtering potential this aspect certainly needs further study although our results support the hypothesis we put forward in our previous study walalite et al 2016 that the high annual biomass production of the bamboo zone is driven by the floods which import nutrients and sediments filtered out by this zone the less productive grassland zone located behind the bamboo receives less input of nutrients from the river if we focus on the type of nutrient limitation we notice that in contrast to what we found for songkhram venterink et al 2006 found low n p ratios in their reed vegetation along the river rhine indicating n limitation our bamboo zone is clearly p limited as can be inferred from the n p ratios we found comparison of our data with the data from the floodplain of the river biebrza in poland venterink et al 2009 reveals that in the biebrza floodplain vegetation both n and p are lower whereas k is slightly higher nevertheless there are also indications for the biebrza floodplain to be p limited as is our bamboo zone when spink et al 1998 experimentally tested nutrient limitation by conducting fertilization experiments in seven floodplains they found that only in one floodplain the irish river shannon plant growth was nutrient limited in their case n and p co limitation in the other six floodplains climatic factors temperature latitude seemed to be the dominant drivers of productivity thus it seems that most river floodplains do not face nutrient limitation in cases where nutrient limitation has been found both the monsoon river songkhram and the temperate rivers biebrza and shannon differ from the river rhine in that their vegetation is limited or co limited by p the absence of p limitation in the rhine floodplain is probably attributable to the large input of p by the river rhine the water of which contains wastewater discharge and runoff from farmland in the human dominated catchment of the rhine billen et al 2011 this has also been observed in other human impacted rivers in europe and north america caraco and cole 1999 sjodin et al 1997 perakis and hedin 2002 sampled rivers from 100 unpolluted primary forests in temperate south america and compared them to streams in polluted regions in temperate north america concluding that in unpolluted regions the stream water nitrate concentrations were low and dissolved organic nitrogen was responsible for most of the nitrogen losses from these forests it is however unclear if this also holds for tropical rivers in unpolluted areas putting the scarce information about n and p cycling and fluxes in tropical rivers and the role floodplains play into perspective it is clear that we are only beginning to understand how n and p cycling is driven by climate river characteristics and human interference and how important floodplain processes are in nutrient cycling and retention conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgments we thank somchai nimnuan and suravech

1171,although the functioning of river floodplains as sink or source of nutrients has been studied extensively for temperate regions similar studies in tropical regions are less abundant and studies integrating data about floodplain soil vegetation and water are scarce we examined and compared nutrient contents in soil water and vegetation tissue in two different vegetation zones on the monsoon songkhram river floodplain thailand significant differences were found between bamboo and grass zones the soil in the bamboo zone is more fertile than the soil in the grass zone as indicated by the lower c n ratio and has significantly higher organic matter and higher total n and k bamboo leaf tissue had significantly higher concentrations of nutrients than grass biomass the growth of the bamboo is p limited or p and n co limited but grass is n limited in both zones the soil available p and organic carbons after flooding were significantly lower than before flooding floodwater in both zones had low dissolved solid concentrations after the flood peak most concentrations tended to increase especially organic carbon and dissolved nitrogen but phosphorus decreased the results suggest a significant loss of organic carbon from the soil after flooding indicating that the floodplain acts as a source of carbon that is exported downstream nonetheless it is also evident that the floodwater brings in sediment and nutrients based on rough estimations of nutrient budgets we conclude that the highly productive bamboo zone adjacent to the river filters out the nutrients before they reach the grass zone keywords floodplain functioning vegetation zonation nutrient limitation ephemeral wetlands mekong river 1 introduction river floodplains have been studied by wetland scientists for decades since they represent ecosystems with valuable services to mankind understanding their hydrological and ecological functioning adds to insight into their key processes and how to preserve and protect them the relevance of preservation of floodplains goes beyond the actual floodplain itself since floodplains are typical connecting elements in the landscape between the hinterland and the river and also connect upstream areas with downstream areas due to this landscape connectivity river floodplains harbor longitudinal and lateral gradients humphries et al 2014 junk and wantzen 2004 vannote et al 1980 and both vegetation productivity in floodplains and nutrient processes are related to the size of the parent river and its water quality spink et al 1998 thorp and delong 1994 it is therefore important to study floodplain processes further to understand how these processes are linked to spatial zonation in the floodplain upstream areas and their distance from the river the hydrology and topography of floodplains largely determine their water flow the development of gradients and the existence of zones with different biological communities two other important factors that determine nutrient cycling in these communities are temperature and hydrochemistry floodplain hydrochemistry depends on the sources of inundation water the principal sources are river water groundwater and precipitation or mixtures of these river floodwater is generally a source of nutrients suspended and dissolved mertes 1997 venterink et al 2006 wassen et al 2003 gradients in flood stress e g depth current velocity and oxygen stress during long term inundations and different magnitudes of nutrient and sediment inputs bring about spatial differentiation in productivity which together with nutrient cycling processes result in distinct vegetation patterns in temperate floodplains keizer et al 2014 wassen et al 2003 wassen and joosten 1996 wu and blodau 2015 similar to the temperate floodplains clear vegetation zonation along flooding gradients are observed in large tropical floodplains around the world i e the amazon basin the okavango delta the mekong tonle sap and the tropical northern australia wet dry system parolin et al 2016 parolin and wittmann 2010 spatial patterns of vegetation in these tropical floodplains are the result of their adaptation and response to seasonally flooding characteristic especially depth and duration arias et al 2016 parolin et al 2016 although each individual floodplain can have additional factors that influence the development of zonation such as interactions between soil surface water and groundwater affecting the salinity in the okavango floodplain ellery et al 1993 ellery and tacheba 2003 the effect on soil moisture due to disturbances from humans and fire in the mekong tonle sap arias et al 2013 and changing stream velocities during flood in the northern australia wet dry tropics finlayson 2005 finlayson et al 1990 in addition nutrient availability in floodplains is an important factor as it determines the productivity of the floodplains spatial patterns of nutrient availability can directly cause vegetation zonation but can also influence seedling establishment strategies which result in spatial patterns of vegetation in floodplains parolin 2002 crucial factors that determine nutrient dynamics and floodplain productivity are the hydrological regime and geochemical characteristics of the catchment spink et al 1998 the hydrological regime may be characterized by three main river discharge stages 1 a base flow stage 2 a rising stage and 3 the falling stage as described in the river wave concept humphries et al 2014 and flood pulse concept junk and wantzen 2004 during the base flow stage the river and the floodplain are in a stage of low connectivity during intense rainfall the resulting terrestrial runoff not only causes water levels in the river channel to rise the rising stage but also transports dissolved and particulate nutrients when the river overtops its banks water from the river channel will inundate the floodplain importing nutrients at that moment an aquatic system establishes on the floodplain and the floodwater transports suspended matter dissolved solids and propagules the transport distance and the sedimentation rate are both a function of water velocity and floodplain topography and they lead to a spatial redistribution of matter and organisms ward et al 2002 wiens 2002 zuijdgeest et al 2015 floodplain productivity is determined by the biomass production of phytoplankton macro algae aquatic plants and helophytes the major source of nutrients for aquatic production during the inundation phase is thought to be floodwater with the floodplain soil playing a minor role and thus when water stops overtopping the river banks the supply of nutrients diminishes as do nutrient concentrations in the floodwater lewis et al 2000 in turn floodplains can be an important source for organic carbon exported downstream via the river after the floods retreat junk and wantzen 2004 zuijdgeest et al 2015 to date most of the studies on the nutrient cycling processes occurring in floodplains have been on temperate systems e g baldwin and mitchell 2000 venterink et al 2003 2002 wassen et al 2003 they have shown that river floodplains can function as a sink for nutrients such as n and p and for sediment since both biomass production and organic matter decomposition depend greatly on temperature baldwin and mitchell 2000 it can be expected that there will be a clear difference in these processes between temperate catchments and tropical catchments river floodplains in tropical regions may therefore be very different from temperate regions mcjannet et al 2012 showed that a tropical floodplain was a sink for phosphorus but found no evidence for a nitrogen sink most studies in tropical river floodplains have analyzed the relationship between soil characteristic hydrology and vegetation structure and composition e g arias et al 2013 finlayson 2005 murray hudson et al 2011 wittmann et al 2008 and to some extent the hydrochemistry e g ellery et al 1993 vegetation community patterns in tropical floodplains show clear correlations with flood characteristics such as flood duration and flood depth arias et al 2016 demonstrated in their recent hydrogeological concept for vegetation distribution in tropical floodplains that a lower species diversity was found with longer flood duration and larger flood depth beside the relationship between flooding and vegetation types flood characteristics also influence soil properties and nutrient contents e g arias et al 2013 however little is known about the rate of nutrient cycling in tropical floodplains and how this relates to seasonal dynamics tropical monsoon rivers in particular exhibit a strong seasonal dynamic hydrologic pattern the large amounts of rain characteristic in the monsoon period lead to low concentrations of dissolved matter and nutrients in river water during floodplain inundation walalite et al 2016 however similar to temperate floodplains monsoon floodplains may show a distinct zonation of more productive and less productive vegetation arias et al 2016 walalite et al 2016 zuijdgeest et al 2015 in the present study we contribute to the sparse knowledge on tropical monsoon floodplain ecological functioning by presenting data on the songkhram river in thailand our two aims are to explore spatial differences in nutrient distribution in water soil and vegetation for two distinct vegetation zones in the floodplain bamboo and grass and to understand the interaction between the flood characteristics and the vegetation with respect to nutrient fluxes and stores in a previous study walalite et al 2016 we identified two major vegetation communities that dominate in the floodplain a bamboo zone that is widespread throughout the floodplain in a belt close to the river and a grassland type behind the bamboo zone and thus further away from the river in our earlier paper we hypothesized that the high annual biomass production of the bamboo zone is driven by the floods importing nutrients and sediment and we urged for further research to analyze nutrient input and uptake in the grass and the bamboo zone the present paper aims to verify this hypothesis and test if the less productive grassland zone behind the bamboo does indeed receive less input of nutrients from the river 2 study area the songkhram river catchment is situated in the monsoon climate region of north eastern thailand fig 1 it is approximately 495km long drains an area of 13 000km2 and its average discharge is 226m3 s 1 during the monsoon season and 2 3m3 s 1 during the dry season annual precipitation averages 1960mm and ranges from 1090 to 2880mm the monsoon season lasts from may to september and is followed by a cool dry season from october to february that is succeeded by a hot dry season from march to april during the monsoon season the average precipitation is 1690mm range 906 2420mm this compares with an average precipitation of 270mm range 80 490mm during the dry season figures compiled from daily data from the department of water resources thailand mean annual daily temperature is 26 c and the warmest month is april monthly mean of 35 c from december to january the minimum night temperature is around 15 c the floodplain we studied lies in the lower catchment of the songkharam river fig 1 and is inundated yearly due to the high river discharges during the monsoon season the average flooded area of this floodplain is estimated to be 760 855km2 thiha et al 2012 walalite et al 2016 the land uses of the flood prone area in the non flood season are agriculture 52 grassland herbaceous vegetation and shrubs together 20 open water 9 marsh 8 deciduous forest 6 native riparian bamboo 4 and buildings 1 the native floodplain vegetation community which is known as pa bung pa taam fig 2 comprises a distinct strip of dense thorny bamboo bambusa flexuosa next to the river channel behind which is a zone of grassland communities dominated by miscanthus fuscus blake et al 2011 walalite et al 2016 fig 3 presents a conceptual cross section from the river across the floodplain to the higher non flooded land on the side of the river valley showing the zonation of bamboo and grass communities 3 methods 3 1 sampling locations and time line of fieldwork campaign we established four transects in the monsoon floodplain of the songkhram river fig 1 each transect started on the river bank and extended over the vegetation gradient of the bamboo thicket on the river bank and the grass communities behind both of which are inundated during the monsoon as far as the higher lying non flooded forest zone see figs 2 and 3 vegetation soil and floodwater were sampled during different periods in 2015 fig 4 depicts them in relation to rainfall and river water levels 3 2 vegetation sampling and analysis the bamboo fresh mature leaves were sampled in february 2015 in order to determine nutrient concentrations see below we took samples from 15 different locations distributed over the seasonally flooded bamboo zone aboveground standing crop was harvested as a proxy for annual plant production as the bamboo produces fresh shoots and leaves all year round we counted the newly formed shoots per m2 and ignored the shoots from previous years shoots were dried and weighed in order to estimate the aboveground annual production gdrywt m2 for the grass zone we harvested aboveground living biomass from 9 locations in august 2015 which was when grass growth had peaked following monsoon rain water input at each location three 50 50cm plots were harvested the bamboo leaves and the grass biomass were dried at 105 c for 4h and the standing crop was expressed as gdrywt m2 the three replicates were averaged the dry plant material was ground and analyzed for nitrogen n and carbon c using a c n analyzer part of the ground sample was digested by nitric acid 65 hno3 and analyzed for phosphorus p potassium k calcium ca magnesium mg zinc zn aluminum al silica si iron fe sulfur s and manganese mn using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 3 3 soil sampling and analysis soil samples were collected during two field campaigns before the flood june july 2015 and after the flood november 2015 at the same locations seven of the sites were in the bamboo zone and 6 were in the grassland zone the soil samples were taken using a stainless steel soil corer 5 2cm long 5cm diameter three cores were collected at each site in an area of ca 10m2 soil samples were air dried at room temperature for 2 weeks after drying the soil was ground and sieved through a 0 5mm sieve for further chemical analysis soil ph was measured from a solution of 10g soil sample with 10ml of demineralized water the available phosphorus p in the soil sample was determined from 5g of soil using bray 2 solution as extractant the concentration of the extractable phosphorus was determined by colorimetric and spectrophotometric methods ammonium exchangeable potassium k in the soil sample was also determined from 5g of soil using 1m ammonium acetate as extractant the k concentration in the extracted solution was determined using a flame photometer total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were determined by the walkley black and macro kjeldahl digestion methods respectively 3 4 floodwater sampling and analysis in total 33 samples of floodwater were collected at two stages of the flood the first 17 samples was obtained during the peak flood 10 15 august 2015 the second 16 samples was obtained while the flood was subsiding 27 28 august 2015 along each transect the sampling sites were in the main river channel in the bamboo zone and in the grass zone at each site 4l of water were collected from approximately 30cm below the level of the floodwater using a polyethylene pe bottle which was pre washed by the water to be sampling onsite to collect a sample the bottle was dipped into the floodwater as soon as a sample had been taken its ec temperature dissolved oxygen and ph were determined the sample was then stored in a cooler at approximately 4 c the depth of floodwater at each site was measured using a measuring tape weighted at one end the water samples were delivered to a laboratory for preparation and treatment within 24h of collection each sample was mixed thoroughly and then divided into three subsamples the first subsample was filtered through 0 45μm cellulose acetate membrane filter and divided into two aliquots of 50ml to the first 1ml of nitric acid 65 concentration was added for ion analysis by means of icp oes the second was not acidified and prepared to analyze dissolved organic carbon doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn the second subsample was prepared for unfiltered water analysis aliquots of 250 and 125ml from this unfiltered subsample were stored in wide mouth pe bottles the first 250ml was acidified by adding 2ml of 65 concentrated nitric acid for total phosphorus tp analysis the 125ml was not acidified prior to analyses for toc and total nitrogen tn prior to analysis all samples were kept in cool ca 4 c and dark conditions additionally within 24h of collection a 5ml aliquot was taken and its alkalinity was measured using a hi 3811 100 chemical test kit hanna instruments 2016 the third subsample was prepared to determine total suspended solid tss and organic matter om between 500 and 1000ml depending on filtration speed was filtered through 0 7μm whatman gf f glass fiber filter of known weight the filter with its residual suspended solid was then dried at 105 c for 24h cooled in a desiccator and weighed subsequently the filter was combusted at 400 c for 16h and the weight after combustion was used to determine the amount of om lost during combustion 3 5 determination of nutrient limitation in vegetation to determine the type of nutrient limitation we followed venterink et al 2003 who used a method based on critical values of n p n k and k p ratios in aboveground plant material n limited sites were those with n p ratio 14 5 and n k ratio 2 1 whereas p limited sites and sites limited in both p and n were those with a n p ratios 14 5 and k p ratios 3 4 sites limited in k or in k n were those with n k ratios 2 1 and k p ratios 3 4 3 6 estimation of nutrient storage in soil and vegetation and input from floodwater and atmosphere the total n and available p and k in the soil were determined by analyzing the top 5cm of each soil core concentrations of total n and available p and k in mg per gram soil were multiplied by the soil bulk density g soil per m3 volume and the volume of the top 5cm soil in 1m2 to obtain an indication of the annual aboveground nutrient storage g nutrient m2 in the bamboo zone we multiplied the dry weight m2 by the nutrient n p and k concentrations measured in the fresh leaves mgnutrient gdrywt assuming this to be a reasonable estimate for the whole shoot for the grass zone we used the sampled aboveground biomass of grass g m2 and multiplied it by the nutrient concentrations mg nutrient gdrywt in the grass biomass sample of each site to estimate the potential amount of nutrients imported by floodwater to a certain area we averaged the concentrations of nutrients and the depth of floodwater for the 2 flood stage from each site the volume of standing water l m2 was calculated from the average depth of each site then the average nutrient concentration was multiplied by the volume of the standing water l m2 by using the above method we assumed that the system works with a peak discharge in the floodplains after which no new water enters the floodplain anymore and only water outflow takes place after the peak if this is the case it is justified to use our calculation an alternative would be to consider every time step a new inflow and probably also outflow but we did not observe any indication for this in the field total n and k from atmospheric deposition in thailand was extracted from world data centre for precipitation chemistry vet et al 2014 4 results we found significant differences between the bamboo and grass zones table 1 both before and after the flood the soil in the bamboo zone had significantly higher om contents higher total n and k contents and lower bulk density before the flood the soil in the bamboo zone had higher organic carbon toc and available phosphorus p and lower c n ratio than the grass zone these results indicate that the bamboo soil is more fertile than the grass soil however the high c n ratios in both zones bamboo 52 grass 48 table 1 indicate that both soils have poor n fertility after the floods a significant decrease of organic carbon from the soil in both zones is found and further the drop in the c n ratio shows that the floods export organic carbon from the floodplain and fertilize both zones comparison of the water samples taken at the peak of the flood and during its recession reveals that after the peak sedimentation of suspended matter occurs and the concentration of dissolved solid increased possibly due to high evapotranspiration caused by the high tropical temperatures 30 c table 2 this is reflected in decreases in tss and increases in ec cl and other major ions during the subsidence of the flood dissolved oxygen do tp and po4 3 also decreased significantly in the floodwater and alkalinity increased table 2 probably because of the algal blooms we observed during the second sampling the productivity of the bamboo vegetation is high estimated to be ca 5tondrywt ha yr of aboveground biomass the grass zone is also productive though less so it averaged 3 5tondrywt ha yr table 3 analysis of aboveground plant tissue indicates that concentrations of all three major nutrients n p and k are significantly higher in the bamboo vegetation zone than in the grass zone nutrient ratios indicate that bamboo growth is limited by p or co limited by p and n whereas the vegetation of the grass zone is limited by n we did not find any indications of k co limitation table 3 5 discussion 5 1 similarities and differences in ecological functioning between temperate and tropical floodplains integration of our data on soil water and vegetation led to the emergence of a coherent pattern of flood related nutrient and carbon fluxes that are spatially and temporarily differentiated first the significant loss of organic carbon from the soil after the flood indicates that the floodplain is a source of carbon and this carbon is probably exported downstream this is also illustrated by the doc and toc in the floodwater which increase significantly after the floodplain becomes an aquatic system while inundated this implies that organic carbon produced in the floodplain is exported via the retreating floodwater this was also reported by zuijdgeest et al 2015 for the floodplain along the zambezi in southern africa where om that had been produced upstream was transported downstream and was exported this illustrates how large floodplain systems act as large biogeochemical reactors that behave distinctly different from the rest of the catchment zuijdgeest et al 2015 in our case the part of the floodplain we sampled seems to be a source of carbon for the river and downstream areas second we clearly observed a role of the vegetation zonation in floodplain functioning in the songkhram floodplain clear zonations of bamboo and grass are present it was found earlier that for tropical floodplains vegetation patterns in structure and community are determined by the duration and the depth of the flood arias et al 2016 parolin et al 2016 in addition to these main factors the hydrochemistry of inundated water and the soil and topography can cause stress in vegetation functioning and therefore cause patterns in vegetation in the tropics where vegetation production is optimal around the year adaptation to flood stress seems to be the key mechanism of spatial heterogeneity in species community parolin and wittmann 2010 further arias et al 2013 showed that the mean annual flood duration and soil properties determined canopy height canopy cover and above ground biomass of the tonle sap floodplain forest in cambodia in our songkhram river floodplain the zones of bamboo and grass experience different stresses 1 a higher flood stress higher nutrient input and higher productivity in the bamboo zone and 2 a lower flood stress lower nutrient input and lower productivity in the grassland the bamboo experiences higher flood depth and duration which force the bamboo to quickly take up available nutrients and having fast shoot growth to escape from the flooding the higher productivity is supported by additional nutrient uptake from the flood water as a result om production is much higher in the bamboo zone than in the grassland leading to higher om content in the soil of the bamboo zone this difference is attributable not only to the vigorous growth of the bamboo but also at least partly to the prominent algal blooms in this zone after the floods have receded these algae remain on the ground and start to decompose rapidly in the warm and still moist conditions comparison of the temperatures in our tropical catchment with the temperature ranges of seven large floodplains in north america and europe reported in spink et al 1998 shows that the temperatures in songkhram are very different they are consistently very high the grassland zone is usually found next to the bamboo zone although the flood depth and duration in this zone is lower than the bamboo zone due to its topography vegetation in this zone is fully submerged limited nutrients in this zone leads to a lower productivity therefore the combination of flood stress and nutrient limitation determines the vegetation in this zone interestingly we found the songkhram is very similar to the river shannon in ireland in terms of catchment size discharge and soil and vegetation nutrient contents data on the shannon reported by spink et al 1998 the shannon is a typical example of a predominantly rainwater fed river poor in solutes as is the case for the songkhram river and also for the siberian river ob which is fed mainly by snow melt schipper et al 2007 in the floodplains of these three rivers with very different climates vegetation production is driven more by sedimentation and mineralization of om than by dissolved nutrients brought in by floodwater although the songkhram floodwater exports om from the floodplain it is also evident that the floods import sediment and nutrients the water samples taken and flooding depths measured at the peak and at the end of the flood period illustrate this at the peak of the flood the floodwater is very deep on average 4m after the monsoon rains had ceased the concentration of tss in the sampled water was only half of the peak flood s tss concentration table 2 visual observations also revealed that the water at the second sampling was much more transparent 5 2 nutrient budgets we roughly estimated the nutrient budgets for the bamboo and the grass zone see section 3 6 and were able to further differentiate between n p and k fluxes and reserves fig 5 although it must be noted that our estimates are only rough approximating indicators nitrogen although atmospheric deposition of n in the songkhram catchment is significant 6 5kgn ha yr it is moderate compared to the deposition in other areas in s e asia vet et al 2014 and the floods bring in twice as much n into the grass zone and three times as much into the bamboo zone than is deposited from the atmosphere fig 5a most of the n stored annually in the aboveground biomass must thus be obtained from the soil this is especially evident for the bamboo zone since the n from atmospheric n deposition plus the estimated n input via the flood add up to far less than the n in biomass additional n input to the system can also relate to large particulate organic matter pom from flood water n from the floodwater is rather not only originating from dissolved organic matter but also relates to pom this pom in flood water would also be an important source for n input to the floodplains this is also demonstrated by our data showing that water om did not change but toc and doc increased in the second sampling this indicates that organic matter is also a source for nutrients during the flood n from the pom is then filtered by the bamboo deposited on the soil and becomes quickly part of the soil through bioturbation mermillod blondin 2011 our schematic cross section in fig 5 also reveals that the bamboo zone may function as a filter trapping most of the n from the floodwater before the water reaches the grass zone further away from the river phosphorus atmospheric deposition of p is probably negligible unless dust storms occur which to our knowledge has not been the case it appears that compared with the amount of p that could hypothetically be imported from the atmosphere and the floods the amount of p stored annually in aboveground biomass is four times higher in the bamboo zone and two to three times higher in the grass zone so as was the case for n the soil must also be an important source of p remarkably the soil in both zones contains only minor amounts of p which implies that most of the available p is taken up rapidly as is also observed in tropical forests where almost all nutrients are sequestered in standing vegetation vitousek and sanford 1986 the bamboo zone may as was the case for n also filter out p taking up p from the floodwater before it reaches the grass zone further away from the river potassium it is very clear that the flood is the major source compared to the amount of k available in the soil and the amount of k deposited from the atmosphere the potential input of k from the floods is important again we speculate that the bamboo zone may function as a filter taking up k from the floodwater before it reaches the grass zone more distant from the river as illustrated in fig 3 which shows i some depression within the bamboo zone and ii the bamboo zone to be wider than the grass zone in the higher flooding littoral it should not be surprising that the bamboo is the dominant filtering vegetation unit especially regarding the height above the mean and the bank full water levels comparison of our very roughly estimated nutrient flows with the flows reported by other studies in river floodplains reveals some general patterns our findings are similar to those of venterink et al 2002 for temperate european river systems these authors also found most of the n in aboveground vegetation was obtained from turnover in the soil but they also concluded that the input of p and k from the river must have been substantial in another study performed in the floodplain of the european river rhine venterink et al 2006 reported similar findings to ours sediment deposition was an important mechanism of retention of nutrients especially of p and nutrient retention was much greater in reed beds comparable to our bamboo zone than in grasslands the authors postulated that the high sediment deposition rate in their floodplain reed bed was the result of the roughness of the vegetation structure which reduced the water velocity facilitating sedimentation and trapping nutrients in contrast to this mcjannet et al 2012 argue that in tropical riverine wetlands where there is strong seasonality in flows and short residence time during the periods of maximum sediment and nutrient loads there is likely to be limited overall filtering potential this aspect certainly needs further study although our results support the hypothesis we put forward in our previous study walalite et al 2016 that the high annual biomass production of the bamboo zone is driven by the floods which import nutrients and sediments filtered out by this zone the less productive grassland zone located behind the bamboo receives less input of nutrients from the river if we focus on the type of nutrient limitation we notice that in contrast to what we found for songkhram venterink et al 2006 found low n p ratios in their reed vegetation along the river rhine indicating n limitation our bamboo zone is clearly p limited as can be inferred from the n p ratios we found comparison of our data with the data from the floodplain of the river biebrza in poland venterink et al 2009 reveals that in the biebrza floodplain vegetation both n and p are lower whereas k is slightly higher nevertheless there are also indications for the biebrza floodplain to be p limited as is our bamboo zone when spink et al 1998 experimentally tested nutrient limitation by conducting fertilization experiments in seven floodplains they found that only in one floodplain the irish river shannon plant growth was nutrient limited in their case n and p co limitation in the other six floodplains climatic factors temperature latitude seemed to be the dominant drivers of productivity thus it seems that most river floodplains do not face nutrient limitation in cases where nutrient limitation has been found both the monsoon river songkhram and the temperate rivers biebrza and shannon differ from the river rhine in that their vegetation is limited or co limited by p the absence of p limitation in the rhine floodplain is probably attributable to the large input of p by the river rhine the water of which contains wastewater discharge and runoff from farmland in the human dominated catchment of the rhine billen et al 2011 this has also been observed in other human impacted rivers in europe and north america caraco and cole 1999 sjodin et al 1997 perakis and hedin 2002 sampled rivers from 100 unpolluted primary forests in temperate south america and compared them to streams in polluted regions in temperate north america concluding that in unpolluted regions the stream water nitrate concentrations were low and dissolved organic nitrogen was responsible for most of the nitrogen losses from these forests it is however unclear if this also holds for tropical rivers in unpolluted areas putting the scarce information about n and p cycling and fluxes in tropical rivers and the role floodplains play into perspective it is clear that we are only beginning to understand how n and p cycling is driven by climate river characteristics and human interference and how important floodplain processes are in nutrient cycling and

1172,urbanisation within global economic and socio political settings has created rural urban interfaces or peri urban areas where ecosystem interactions are complex it is now recognised that the rural urban interface dichotomy in the current planning and management approaches does not adequately account for the rural urban interface linkages particularly for potential emerging conflicts in land and water demands and uses using the cirebon metropolitan region cmr west java indonesia as a case study part i of this two part article aims to develop a suitable methodology for peri urban delineation we used a total of 11 social economic and spatial variables directly or indirectly related to ecohydrology multivariate univariate and multiple univariate data analysis techniques were used for defining regional rural urban interfaces based on these analyses eight regional classifications of rural urban interfaces were proposed and evaluated based on different spatial classification methods and clustering techniques the results of classification were mapped by integrating both geographic information system gis and statistical methods the study indicates that with the variable included the multiple univariate clusters using jenks natural breaks and scoring provides more accurate rural urban definitions for peri urban delineation the proposed methodology provides a suitable framework for delineation of peri urban areas needed for quantifying ecohydrological state in urbanising landscapes keywords rural urban water peri urban delineation spatial classification methods spatial clustering techniques spatial planning 1 introduction rural and urban developments increasingly overlap creating irregular forms of environment that cannot be defined within the current rural urban interface dichotomy urbanisation has created mixed rural urban interface landscapes identified as peri urban with distinctive features of the loss of rural characteristics and a lack of urban characteristics allen 2003 in the context of metropolitan regions emerging zones of intense economic activities in the intersection between rural areas and cities are known as desakota zones drawing on the bahasa indonesia words for town and village mcgee and shaharudin 2016 currently peri urban areas are not recognised as integral part of the functional activities of urban growth suggesting the need of formulation peri urban policies to make cities liveable and sustainable while they are secure in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem services maheshwari et al 2016 however many issues still remain concerning the indicators and thresholds for distinguishing urban peri urban and rural areas iaquinta and drescher 2000 in the metropolitan context understanding rural urban interface linkages is even more complicated as a rural area on the metropolitan inner or outer boundary or the land in the space between rural and metropolitan boundary may be deemed peri urban buxton and choy 2007 to date the dynamics of the rural urban interface combined with no clear boundary definition of peri urban area has become a challenge for developing effective consistent and integrated regional planning and management for liveability and sustainability several new classification systems have been proposed in the global context to describe human settlement structures beyond the rural urban interface dichotomy coombes and raybould 2001 dünckmann 2009 hugo et al 2001 öğdül 2010 camaioni et al 2013 wandl et al 2014 but the definitions are diverse it is impractical to propose a universal standard as different processes of peri urban development exist for instance peri urbanisation in developing countries is linked with rural urbanisation rural urban migration and a mixture of agricultural and non agricultural activities while peri urbanisation in developed countries is related to urban well being and welfare woltjer 2014 the increasing movement of population to urban centres brings a number of critical challenges affecting peri urban areas such as poor sanitation facilities and public health issues singh and maheshwari 2014 furthermore in developing countries population increase in the growing urban and peri urban areas has resulted in serious water pressures poor water management and severe non point source pollution akissa 2001 however current rural urban interface classifications still focus on spatial planning purposes with little recognition of ecohydrological aspects ecohydrological consideration in planning of new urban areas provides an opportunity to cope with the global changes of urbanisation and climate and to create systemic solutions of problems that are integrative and interdisciplinary in nature around water people and the environment wagner and zalewski 2009 zalewski and wagner 2008 zalewski et al 2008 sohel 2015 in particular ecohydrological considerations can allow transdisciplinary framework for understanding the problem and implementing the solutions that will enhance environmental sustainability zalewski 2011 including near and within urban areas janauer 2005 three methodological principles are proposed from ecohydrology point of view for sustainable water ecosystem and societies covering information for understanding structure states and relationships knowledge for understanding patterns and processes and wisdom for using information and knowledge for problem solving zalewski et al 2009 2010 wagner and zalewski 2012 zalewski 2002 2011 the principles are as follows 1 hydrology quantification of hydrological cycle analysis from the perspective of socio economic spatial and temporal dynamics with respect to the various forms of human impact 2 ecology analysis the distribution of various types of interacting organisms living together in a habitat biocenoses and their potential to enhance the resilience and carrying capacity of ecosystem services for society 3 ecotechnology using dual regulation biota to control hydrological processes and vice versa integration of various types of biological and hydrological regulations to improve water quality biodiversity and freshwater resources and harmonisation of ecohydrological measures with necessary hydrotechnical solutions such as irrigation systems reservoir dam and sewage treatment plant various physical and social landscapes in metropolitan regions can influence water availability water and energy consumption rates and stormwater generation in fact there is progressing degradation of water and urban peri urban ecosystem resources on a global scale that is affecting rural urban liveability and sustainability planning and managing rural urban interface environment for sustainable water use and liveability will need the efforts in quantifying and qualifying the processes identification of threats and development of solutions considering the perspective of socio economic and spatial temporal dynamics with respect to various forms of human impact the approach for defining rural urban interface in this study is related to the first principle as it implies the quantification of the processess related to hydrology biota interplay the main aim of part i of the two part article is to develop methodology to delineate peri urban areas through multivariate univariate and multiple univariate clusters analysis part ii of this article is focussed on evaluating the delineation methodology for rural urban interfaces in the context of ecohydrology and quantifying the ecohydrological state of a given area 2 the study area the study area is located in the development zone of cirebon metropolitan region cmr in indonesia this is a new metropolitan region proposed by the west java province located in the north eastern part of west java specifically the cmr is situated between latitude 6 30 and 7 44 s and longitude 108 03 and 108 48 e five local governments at district level are involved in cmr cirebon municipality cirebon regency kuningan regency majalengka regency and indramayu regency fig 1 the centre of the metropolitan region is cirebon municipality a medium size city with a total population around 300 000 inhabitants the boundary area of the study covers 45 sub districts and 483 villages with a population of around 1 6 million people more than 50 of the population of cmr live in the lowland areas concentrated in the cirebon city and cirebon district in particular three out of five political boundaries cirebon city cirebon and indramayu districts are situated in the coastal area north coast of java while the rest kuningan and majalengka districts are situated in inland area to fulfil urban water needs the cirebon district and city are largely dependent on water supply from kuningan district flooding and drought disasters are major challenges of water management in the cmr the rapid change of land use and climate predicted to occur in the future may further exacerbate the water problems and sustainable water use if holistic environmental planning and management are not considered 3 development of criteria and analysis 3 1 criteria for peri urban delineation eleven variables reflecting rural urban characteristics were used in this study to define a regional rural urban interface classification in the cmr these variables were selected as also providing directly and indirectly some indications of ecohydrology five variables viz population size ps population density pd the percentage of the population working in agriculture pa literacy rate lr and poverty level pl were readily available census data in the government statistical reports of the five districts the other two variables distance d and travel time t to the city centre were derived from google maps the percentage of built up area ba forest water bodies and semi natural fws and agricultural areas aa in the 45 sub districts was calculated from the available maps of land use and land cover lulc using geographic information system gis software the spatial and statistical data were obtained from the west java province and associated local government agencies in the five districts that were close representing rural urban environment of the census data the last variable total villages defined as urban within sub districts and counted as the percentage of urban villages in the respective sub district uv was obtained from the census data badan pusat statistik 2010 the census results were considered as one of the variables in this study because they provide additional characteristics of smaller human settlement village scale at a particular sub district during the census one human settlement at the village scale was defined as being a category of urban or rural village based on the population density the percentage of the population engaged in agriculture and the availability and accessibility to the urban facilities the 2010 indonesian census determined a rural urban interface dichotomy classification for all villages across indonesia from 483 villages within cmr 325 villages 67 were defined as urban and the rest 158 villages 33 were defined as rural 3 2 classification method for peri urban delineation initially all eleven variables within the datasets for the 45 sub districts were assessed in terms of variability and inter correlation among variables the hierarchical cluster analysis was used to determine the optimal number of clusters for the classification using the elbow method and dendrogram the elbow criterion is a common rule of thumb to determine what number of clusters should be chosen for example for the k mean clustering madhulatha 2012 or jenks natural breaks in gis cromley 1995 all observed variables were assessed through a hierarchical cluster analysis using ward s method and squared euclidean distance to see the natural clusters of the data factor analysis was used to discover the simplest method of interpreting the variables datasets and to identify spatial distribution patterns of sub districts with distinctive urban distinctive rural and intermediate characteristics based on shared variances in this study the principal component was used as an extraction factor to extract maximum variance from the datasets within each component eigenvalues 1 was used as the extraction method factor loading for each component was obtained by performing a rotation method using a common orthogonal technique varimax rotation with kaiser normalization to minimise the number of variables that had high loadings on each factor the cut off for a statistically meaningful or significant rotated factor loading in this study was applied at 0 59 quick cluster or k means cluster multivariate clustering was applied for the regional rural urban interface classification based on the factor values k means clustering was chosen for this study because it is one of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms to explore structure in the variable datasets jain 2010 for further analysis in the discussion section k means clustering from the original datasets and hierarchical clustering from the original datasets were applied to see the effectiveness of factor analysis with principal components in capturing cluster structures as a comparison another regional rural urban interface classification was formulated based on land use and land cover data in the 45 sub districts using jenks natural breaks univariate clustering this method is one of the most highly regarded approaches in gis to explore the spatial pattern of attribute distributions across a region based on statistically optimal classification jenk s optimisation that was adapted from fisher s method wei et al 2017 cromley 1995 further comparison was applied using a combination of score based on the threshold cut off values identified from the natural breaks jenks the new regional classifications were determined through multivariate univariate and multiple univariate analysis approaches using ibm statistical package for the social science spss version 24 and gis version 10 3 developed by the environmental systems research institute esri the results were mapped by integrating both geographic information system gis and statistical methods a framework method to delineate peri urban area is shown in fig 2 4 results and discussions 4 1 variability and correlation of rural urban variables the coefficient of variation was used to find the most suitable variables for defining rural urban interface classifications in the context of cmr table 1 the results show five variables with the coefficient of variation more than 0 5 population density pd the percentage of built up area ba the percentage of forest water bodies and semi natural area fws the percentage of the population working in agriculture pa and distance to city centre d population density per km2 had the highest variability across cmr sub districts presenting this as a very good indicator for classifying rural urban interface typology correlation among the selected variables within cmr is shown in table 2 ba had a very strong positive correlation with pd but a strong negative correlation with pa d and travel time t pa had a very strong negative correlation with percentage of urban villages in the sub district uv and a strong negative correlation with pd ba and literacy rate lr but a strong positive correlation with d and t in addition a strong negative correlation was shown between lr and poverty level pl the agglomeration coefficient shows a numerical value at which various cases merge to form a cluster the agglomeration schedule coefficient was plotted into the line graph showing the coefficient on the y axis and the number of clusters on the x axis the elbow method helped to plot the number of clusters against the average variance in this study the stage where distance coefficient made the biggest jump step of the elbow was at 41 this verified the ideal number of the clusters of 45 41 4 clusters which was consistent with the interpretation of the dendrogram fig 3 4 2 multivariate data analysis comparison was applied to the original datasets through the k means clustering and hierarchical clustering fig 4 and synthetic datasets through the k means clustering fig 5 this study found that the classification based on the factor values synthetic data in the k means clustering instead of the original nine datasets through the hierarchical clustering did not necessarily improve the cluster quality or structures of the rural urban interface classifications in this study the regional rural urban interface classification s results based on factor values of the principal component and hierarchical clustering support similar interpretation this finding supports the conclusion of the previous study regarding the effectiveness of pcs in capturing the cluster structure investigated by yeung and ruzzo 2000 however the classification based on the k means clustering using factor values from the principal component analysis instead of the original datasets gave much improvement in the cluster structures this finding is comparable with the experimental results studied by venkatesan and parthiban 2011 that the combination of k means with pca improves the performance of basic k means in terms of accuracy regional rural urban classifications in fig 5 were developed based on the factor values factor analysis with a principal component was applied to the seven without spatial data aa fws ba and census data uv nine without spatial data aa and fws and 11 variables the kaiser meyer olkin model that measures sampling adequacy was found to be greater than 0 5 0 61 for seven variables 0 70 for nine variables and 0 65 for 11 variables verifying that the datasets were appropriate for the factor analysis the bartlett s test was also found to be significant p 0 05 two principal components using seven and nine variables and three principal components using 11 variables provided the total variance explained of 77 75 and 79 respectively with alpha values 0 65 the results of factor analysis from the seven and nine variables are shown in tables 3 and 4 the results from the 11 variables can be seen in part ii of this article factor loading of seven and nine variables shows that factor i is a principle component that has high correlation to the human activities in the study area implying the need for water supply water quality risks open space distribution and climate change pressures factor ii is a principle component that has high correlation to the water management capacity or social dimension implying vulnerable groups regarding water related problems and resilience that were also related to open space distribution additional two spatial variables percentage of agricultural area and percentage of forests water bodies and semi natural areas to the nine variables provided one more factor factor iii it is a principal component that has high correlation to the available natural resources biodiversity water and food production additional a built up data to the seven variables increased variance explained of the factor i however additional agricultural lands and forests water bodies and semi natural areas to the nine variables decreased variance explained of the factor i spatial distributions of factor values based on the 7 and 9 variables at 45 sub districts are shown in the map in figs 6 and 7 respectively the darkest colour on the maps indicates the highest factor values of the areas factor i from the seven variables loaded strongly on the increase of travel time distance to the city centre and population working in agriculture and on the decrease of population density and size hence the darkest colour in fig 6 a shows the sub districts with more rural characteristics on the other hand factor i from the nine variables loaded strongly on the increase of highest percentage of urban villages within sub district population density and built up areas and on the decrease of travel time and distance to the city centre and population working in agriculture hence the darkest colour in fig 6 b shows the sub districts with more urban characteristics from the map in fig 6 five sub districts in cirebon municipality kejaksan pekalipan kesambi lemahwungkuk and harjamukti and three sub districts in the cirebon regency weru kedawung and gunungjati have dominantly urban characteristics on the other hand sukagumiwang and mandirancang were among the sub districts with distinctive rural characteristics a different pattern of rural urban interface characteristics was obtained by applying factor values in the 45 sub districts based on the factor ii analysis factor ii from the seven variables loaded strongly on the increase of poverty level and the decrease of literacy rate hence the darkest colour in fig 7 a shows sub districts with more rural characteristics on the other hand factor ii from the nine variables loaded strongly on the increase of literacy rate and the decrease of poverty level hence the darkest colour in fig 7 b shows the areas with more urban characteristics the classification made by the factor ii analysis shows that five sub districts in kuningan regency mandirancang pasawahan pancalang cilimus and cigandamekar and sub districts in cirebon municipality have distinctive urban characteristics while kapetakan and gebang sub districts were among sub districts with distinctive rural characteristics anova test and post hoc analysis were applied to assess significant mean difference among four rural urban clusters from the k mean clustering from the synthetic values table 5 this table shows that additional two variables aa and fws increase the similarity of intermediate clusters or reduced significant differences between peri urban and urban peri urban transition characteristics higher values of factor i in the classification of seven variables show sub districts with more rural characteristics while higher values of factor i in the classification of nine and 11 variables show sub districts with more urban characteristics factor i shows systematically urbanisation level that mainly characterised by human activities in the study area is significantly higher in urban followed by urban peri urban transition peri urban and rural areas factor ii shows water management capacity in the cmr is higher in urban followed by rural urban peri urban transition upt and peri urban areas factor iii shows that food production s activities in the peri urban are significantly higher than other rural urban categories however the highest shared variances of the first factor provided the regional classification through the k means clustering that emphasised to the human activities in the study area 4 3 univariate data analysis the land use map in fig 8 shows that human settlement areas are concentrated in the centre of cmr or cirebon municipality the pattern of the impermeable area extended along the road directly to the north west part of cmr that is currently farmland this farmland is situated largely in the administrative area of cirebon regency scattered human settlements can be seen in the south east of cmr these settlements form a mixed area of orchards farmland and built up environments in the south and west part of cmr forest areas still dominate land use particularly in the kuningan regency and in majalengka regency the map shows the south part of cirebon municipality harjamukti sub district is not fully urbanised as there are some spaces with orchards and farmlands urbanisation seems to extend outside the boundary of the city crossing over into traditionally rural areas and creating rural urban environment or peri urban area the changes of built up areas within cmr boundary can be seen further from the land cover map between 2005 and 2014 the land cover map in fig 9 shows the built up areas in 2014 are comparatively similar to those in 2011 however compared to the land cover in 2005 it is obvious that land use has changed from once arable land to built up land in the cirebon region and that urbanisation has occurred mainly in the cirebon municipality and cirebon district along the arterial collector road direct to majalengka kuningan and indramayu the open space in the city of cirebon has decreased extremely in the 10 year period between 2005 and 2014 indicating the expectation and risk of the city further expanding to its peripheral areas to identify the level of urbanisation of 45 sub districts within cmr this study overlaid the land use maps in 2011 with the sub district administrative boundary the land use map in 2011 was used for the analysis because that data was considered to most closely reflect the 2010 indonesian population census data this study defined rural urban interface thresholds based on the jenks natural breaks with the number of classes being determined from a hierarchical cluster analysis the regional rural urban interface classification within cmr was re identified into the following categories i urban 55 8 93 7 built up area most areas consist of residential commercial industrial landscapes implying few or no open space distribution ii urban peri urban transition 34 7 55 7 built up area greater areas of residential commercial industrial landscape implying fewer open space distributions iii peri urban 15 9 34 7 built up area few residential commercial industrial landscapes implying larger open space distribution iv rural 5 2 15 8 built up area scarcely or no residential commercial industrial landscapes implying largest area of open space distribution fig 10 depicts these results with four sub districts defined as urban four as urban peri urban transition 19 as peri urban and 18 as rural land use and land cover lulc can be used to delineate rural urban interface as demonstrated by huang et al 2016 this study shows that recognises built up areas from the lulc analysis can distinguish rural urban interface gradient from the unsettled land at one end to the compact urban core at the other end benza et al 2016 in the context of ecohydrology the proportion of built up area can be used as a proxy to open space distribution sub districts with more urban characteristics have lower open space distribution implying higher risks in the impact of human activities on natural processes water cycle and local climate however relying regional rural urban classifications based on the built up area is not sufficiently described the complexity of relationship between people water and environment particularly in the socio economic dimension as also argued by zhu 2004 a more refined classification of settlement areas beyond built up area based dichotomy is required as also suggested by pizzoli and gong 2007 and camaioni et al 2013 the multidimensional approach in classifying rural urban interface should be considered 4 4 multiple univariate data with scoring analysis this classification was applied to the 11 variables nine variables five best variables from the 11 variables and four best variables from the nine variables the rural urban interface variable s thresholds were identified from the datasets considering the results from factor analysis in identifying sub districts with distinctive urban rural and intermediate characteristics scoring was applied by giving a score of 1 to the rural variable s thresholds a score of 2 to the variable s threshold close to rural a score of 3 to the variable s threshold close to urban and a score of 4 to the urban s variable threshold the regional rural urban interface classification was then mapped at the metropolitan scale table 6 shows rural urban interface threshold values defined by jenks natural breaks and scoring given to the 11 variable datasets scoring given to the multiple rural urban interface thresholds in the respective sub districts is considerably important in this study to compare the regional classifications between multivariate and multiple univariate clustering methods jenks natural breaks method was useful in determining rural urban interface thresholds of each variable in the total 11 variable datasets different sub districts had different values in the rural urban interface variables showing different rural urban interface characteristics overlapping classes in the rural urban interface category was evident in the sub districts between the centre of the metropolitan and outer boundary of the metropolitan region total scoring was calculated to recapitulate the variation of the rural urban interface indicator s values in the respective sub districts for the better classifications and displays in the choropleth maps the regional rural urban classification with this method is shown in fig 11 4 5 comparing methodology for peri urban delineation comparative analyses to define pattern and peri urban delineation using multivariate univariate and multiple univariate clusters have been considered in this study by integrating statistical attributes and space characteristics in choropleth maps univariate analysis was commonly used in the past as general absence of large scale spatial datasets multivariate analysis was commonly applied for spatial typology considering social economic and geographic aspects bogdanov et al 2008 alasia 2004 öğdül 2010 the choice of classification method or clustering technique as applied in this study influences the visual interpretation of the underlying pattern of the spatial distribution as remarked by cromley 1996 and murray and shyy 2000 the results in this study also supported previous findings that choropleth maps using the jenks natural breaks approach are more clearly understood and concluded than either unclassed maps or more traditional clustering approach cromley 1996 the example of unclassed maps in this study is shown in figs 6 9 while the example of more traditional clustering is shown in figs 4 and 5 the use of univariate cluster with one variable dataset and multiple univariate clusters with four five nine and 11 variable datasets shows clear patterns in the impacts of giving more variables into the cluster structures of the rural urban interfaces this study has shown the usefulness of combining statistical methods and gis for clustering and displaying the pattern and rural urban interface classifications in the choropleth maps gis provides facilities for exploratory analysis through the visual delineation of attribute variation across a region as already reviewed by murray and shyy 2000 both k means clustering and jenks natural breaks are non hierarchical clusters however jenks natural breaks method takes advantage for the univariate data sets while k means clustering method takes advantage for the multivariate datasets a drawback of both approaches is that the number of clusters desired in the result must be provided to the given dataset north 2009 jain 2010 as shown in this study the comparison of the regional rural urban interface maps was set in the same number of classes that were identified before determining regional rural urban interface classification through the k means multivariate clustering and univariate clustering jenks natural breaks method basically both k mean clustering and jenks natural breaks clustering methods aim to minimise the sum of the variance within each of the clusters cromley 1996 the original variable datasets have some outliers there were several sub districts within cmr having distinctive values in the rural urban interface variables using the k means clustering from the original datasets provided the unequal shape of clusters showing obvious outliers in the variable datasets of the rural urban interface variables k means clustering is more sensitive to outliers and does not work well with high dimensional data venkatesan and parthiban 2011 moreover some variables showed strong inter correlations with other variables this finding supports the previous reviews that the application of the clustering method directly from the original datasets continuous variable does not give efficiently cluster structures in case the data are vectors of correlated measurements james and mcculloch 1990 the k means clustering is more suitable for ordinal or categorical datasets such as synthetic values from the factor analysis using the principal components that are reflecting meaning categories from the measured variables yong and pearce 2013 james and mcculloch 1990 further the use of factor analysis with principal components provides easier interpretation of the 11 socio economic and spatial data in the context of ecohydrology however the regional classification datasets using multivariate cluster analysis factor analysis and k means clustering as applied in this study showed less accurate and meaningful results in capturing the variation of the rural urban interface characteristics compared to the classification from the multiple univariate cluster analysis jenks natural breaks with scoring 4 6 delineation of peri urban areas and ecohydrology factor analysis in this study shows that human activities in the study area primarily influenced the characteristics of rural urban environments as highlighted by zalewski and wagner 2008 urban environment is characterised by highly condensed anthropogenic system that should be managed for the efficient flow of water matter energy and information urban area is characterised with significant higher population density fewer open space distribution and lower agricultural activities compared to peripheral areas it has also a function as the centre of social and economic activities in the metropolitan region implying interaction and mobility of people from rural to urban areas for accessing urban services the high concentration of people and activities in the urban areas implying high demand for ecosystem services that could not be sufficient by only relying on the urban ecosystem and need peri urban ecosystem urban expansion to peri urban area challenges sustainable water resources and environment in the region affecting urban and peri urban liveability particularly on health akissa 2001 this interrelated and interdependent part between cities and rural hinterlands need to be considered as a system in the environmental management and planning for longer term liveability or sustainability as shown in this study peri urban area is one of the spatial categories in the metropolitan development this area has particular characteristics that need particular attention in the planning and management well defined peri urban zones will be useful in the quantification of socio economic and spatial features for managing and developing peri urban strategies for sustainable regional development human activities bring impacts to the changes in land uses water cycles and climate that need transdisciplinary science for problem solutions related to people water and environment for sustainability the knowledge of ecohydrological principles provides the scientific background for regulating the processes and interactions for enhancing water resources maintaining and restoring biodiversity providing ecosystem services for societies building resilience to climatic and anthropogenic impacts and incorporating cultural heritage perspectives wbsrc towards sustainable river basins zalewski et al 2016 zalewski 2013 in particular the first principle of ecohydrology provides framework for quantification of hydrological cycle analysis from the perspective of socio economic and spatial temporal dynamic with respect to various forms of human impact zalewski 2013 this principle can be used as a starting point for the formulation of a systemic approach zalewski and wagner 2008 human activities in the urban and peri urban that are inseparably and spatially linked should be translated into problem solving approaches shaping healthy and friendly city with its outskirts would need understanding of peri urban ecosystem for integrated planning and management in the metropolitan region further the implementation of the ecohydrological approach has to consider the context of generally accepted goals like sustainable development zalewski and wagner 2008 the sustainable development goals sdgs as advocated by the united nations in 2015 come into effect in a world that is increasingly urbanising the urban population is projected to grow to two thirds of the global population by 2050 united nations 2014 the goal 11 of the sdgs aims to ensure cities and human settlements are inclusive safe resilient and sustainable cities towns and villages or human settlements in the rural urban categories need to be planned and managed to fulfil their role as drivers of sustainable development and liveable environments that contribute to quality of life and enhance wellbeing according to zalewski and wagner 2008 urban technical infrastructures have to be complemented with constructed or managed ecological systems with a high potential for pollutant and water retention as city need its surrounding areas for sustainability ecological system in the metropolitan region could not be effectively managed by only considering urban ecosystem but also peri urban ecosystem quantification of ecohydrological processes and potential in the rural urban interfaces including peri urban zones would be required as a starting point based on the first ecohydrological principle as shown in this study socio economic and spatial data implying some indications of ecohydrology can be used not only for defining rural urban interface classifications including peri urban zones but also for better understanding of the rural urban interface ecohydrology 5 conclusions the methodology proposed for delineation of peri urban areas in this study provides a suitable framework for quantification of ecohydrological state of an urbanising area the study demonstrates that socio economic and spatial data can be used to define rural urban interface characteristics that also indirectly relate to ecohydrological aspects of the area the results show that the application of multivariate and univariate clusters analysis can assist in objectively delineating rural urban interfaces in a rapidly urbanising landscape the study also indicates that by including a range of variables in the analysis we were able to capture more meaningful cluster structures for defining rural urban interfaces the use of univariate cluster and multiple univariate clusters with scoring shows clear patterns in the impacts of having more variables into the cluster structures for rural urban interfaces the results of regional rural urban interface classification based on factor values of the principal components through the k means clustering and based on original datasets through the hierarchical clustering support a similar interpretation furthermore the classification based on the k means clustering using factor values from the principal components instead of the original datasets resulted in improved cluster structures in general the study indicates that the multiple univariate clusters using jenks natural breaks and scoring provide more accurate rural urban definitions for peri urban delineation further a well defined peri urban zone through the methodology proposed in this study will assist in the quantification of socio economic and spatial features and evidence based policy formulation and planning in the rural urban interfaces and thus

1172,urbanisation within global economic and socio political settings has created rural urban interfaces or peri urban areas where ecosystem interactions are complex it is now recognised that the rural urban interface dichotomy in the current planning and management approaches does not adequately account for the rural urban interface linkages particularly for potential emerging conflicts in land and water demands and uses using the cirebon metropolitan region cmr west java indonesia as a case study part i of this two part article aims to develop a suitable methodology for peri urban delineation we used a total of 11 social economic and spatial variables directly or indirectly related to ecohydrology multivariate univariate and multiple univariate data analysis techniques were used for defining regional rural urban interfaces based on these analyses eight regional classifications of rural urban interfaces were proposed and evaluated based on different spatial classification methods and clustering techniques the results of classification were mapped by integrating both geographic information system gis and statistical methods the study indicates that with the variable included the multiple univariate clusters using jenks natural breaks and scoring provides more accurate rural urban definitions for peri urban delineation the proposed methodology provides a suitable framework for delineation of peri urban areas needed for quantifying ecohydrological state in urbanising landscapes keywords rural urban water peri urban delineation spatial classification methods spatial clustering techniques spatial planning 1 introduction rural and urban developments increasingly overlap creating irregular forms of environment that cannot be defined within the current rural urban interface dichotomy urbanisation has created mixed rural urban interface landscapes identified as peri urban with distinctive features of the loss of rural characteristics and a lack of urban characteristics allen 2003 in the context of metropolitan regions emerging zones of intense economic activities in the intersection between rural areas and cities are known as desakota zones drawing on the bahasa indonesia words for town and village mcgee and shaharudin 2016 currently peri urban areas are not recognised as integral part of the functional activities of urban growth suggesting the need of formulation peri urban policies to make cities liveable and sustainable while they are secure in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem services maheshwari et al 2016 however many issues still remain concerning the indicators and thresholds for distinguishing urban peri urban and rural areas iaquinta and drescher 2000 in the metropolitan context understanding rural urban interface linkages is even more complicated as a rural area on the metropolitan inner or outer boundary or the land in the space between rural and metropolitan boundary may be deemed peri urban buxton and choy 2007 to date the dynamics of the rural urban interface combined with no clear boundary definition of peri urban area has become a challenge for developing effective consistent and integrated regional planning and management for liveability and sustainability several new classification systems have been proposed in the global context to describe human settlement structures beyond the rural urban interface dichotomy coombes and raybould 2001 dünckmann 2009 hugo et al 2001 öğdül 2010 camaioni et al 2013 wandl et al 2014 but the definitions are diverse it is impractical to propose a universal standard as different processes of peri urban development exist for instance peri urbanisation in developing countries is linked with rural urbanisation rural urban migration and a mixture of agricultural and non agricultural activities while peri urbanisation in developed countries is related to urban well being and welfare woltjer 2014 the increasing movement of population to urban centres brings a number of critical challenges affecting peri urban areas such as poor sanitation facilities and public health issues singh and maheshwari 2014 furthermore in developing countries population increase in the growing urban and peri urban areas has resulted in serious water pressures poor water management and severe non point source pollution akissa 2001 however current rural urban interface classifications still focus on spatial planning purposes with little recognition of ecohydrological aspects ecohydrological consideration in planning of new urban areas provides an opportunity to cope with the global changes of urbanisation and climate and to create systemic solutions of problems that are integrative and interdisciplinary in nature around water people and the environment wagner and zalewski 2009 zalewski and wagner 2008 zalewski et al 2008 sohel 2015 in particular ecohydrological considerations can allow transdisciplinary framework for understanding the problem and implementing the solutions that will enhance environmental sustainability zalewski 2011 including near and within urban areas janauer 2005 three methodological principles are proposed from ecohydrology point of view for sustainable water ecosystem and societies covering information for understanding structure states and relationships knowledge for understanding patterns and processes and wisdom for using information and knowledge for problem solving zalewski et al 2009 2010 wagner and zalewski 2012 zalewski 2002 2011 the principles are as follows 1 hydrology quantification of hydrological cycle analysis from the perspective of socio economic spatial and temporal dynamics with respect to the various forms of human impact 2 ecology analysis the distribution of various types of interacting organisms living together in a habitat biocenoses and their potential to enhance the resilience and carrying capacity of ecosystem services for society 3 ecotechnology using dual regulation biota to control hydrological processes and vice versa integration of various types of biological and hydrological regulations to improve water quality biodiversity and freshwater resources and harmonisation of ecohydrological measures with necessary hydrotechnical solutions such as irrigation systems reservoir dam and sewage treatment plant various physical and social landscapes in metropolitan regions can influence water availability water and energy consumption rates and stormwater generation in fact there is progressing degradation of water and urban peri urban ecosystem resources on a global scale that is affecting rural urban liveability and sustainability planning and managing rural urban interface environment for sustainable water use and liveability will need the efforts in quantifying and qualifying the processes identification of threats and development of solutions considering the perspective of socio economic and spatial temporal dynamics with respect to various forms of human impact the approach for defining rural urban interface in this study is related to the first principle as it implies the quantification of the processess related to hydrology biota interplay the main aim of part i of the two part article is to develop methodology to delineate peri urban areas through multivariate univariate and multiple univariate clusters analysis part ii of this article is focussed on evaluating the delineation methodology for rural urban interfaces in the context of ecohydrology and quantifying the ecohydrological state of a given area 2 the study area the study area is located in the development zone of cirebon metropolitan region cmr in indonesia this is a new metropolitan region proposed by the west java province located in the north eastern part of west java specifically the cmr is situated between latitude 6 30 and 7 44 s and longitude 108 03 and 108 48 e five local governments at district level are involved in cmr cirebon municipality cirebon regency kuningan regency majalengka regency and indramayu regency fig 1 the centre of the metropolitan region is cirebon municipality a medium size city with a total population around 300 000 inhabitants the boundary area of the study covers 45 sub districts and 483 villages with a population of around 1 6 million people more than 50 of the population of cmr live in the lowland areas concentrated in the cirebon city and cirebon district in particular three out of five political boundaries cirebon city cirebon and indramayu districts are situated in the coastal area north coast of java while the rest kuningan and majalengka districts are situated in inland area to fulfil urban water needs the cirebon district and city are largely dependent on water supply from kuningan district flooding and drought disasters are major challenges of water management in the cmr the rapid change of land use and climate predicted to occur in the future may further exacerbate the water problems and sustainable water use if holistic environmental planning and management are not considered 3 development of criteria and analysis 3 1 criteria for peri urban delineation eleven variables reflecting rural urban characteristics were used in this study to define a regional rural urban interface classification in the cmr these variables were selected as also providing directly and indirectly some indications of ecohydrology five variables viz population size ps population density pd the percentage of the population working in agriculture pa literacy rate lr and poverty level pl were readily available census data in the government statistical reports of the five districts the other two variables distance d and travel time t to the city centre were derived from google maps the percentage of built up area ba forest water bodies and semi natural fws and agricultural areas aa in the 45 sub districts was calculated from the available maps of land use and land cover lulc using geographic information system gis software the spatial and statistical data were obtained from the west java province and associated local government agencies in the five districts that were close representing rural urban environment of the census data the last variable total villages defined as urban within sub districts and counted as the percentage of urban villages in the respective sub district uv was obtained from the census data badan pusat statistik 2010 the census results were considered as one of the variables in this study because they provide additional characteristics of smaller human settlement village scale at a particular sub district during the census one human settlement at the village scale was defined as being a category of urban or rural village based on the population density the percentage of the population engaged in agriculture and the availability and accessibility to the urban facilities the 2010 indonesian census determined a rural urban interface dichotomy classification for all villages across indonesia from 483 villages within cmr 325 villages 67 were defined as urban and the rest 158 villages 33 were defined as rural 3 2 classification method for peri urban delineation initially all eleven variables within the datasets for the 45 sub districts were assessed in terms of variability and inter correlation among variables the hierarchical cluster analysis was used to determine the optimal number of clusters for the classification using the elbow method and dendrogram the elbow criterion is a common rule of thumb to determine what number of clusters should be chosen for example for the k mean clustering madhulatha 2012 or jenks natural breaks in gis cromley 1995 all observed variables were assessed through a hierarchical cluster analysis using ward s method and squared euclidean distance to see the natural clusters of the data factor analysis was used to discover the simplest method of interpreting the variables datasets and to identify spatial distribution patterns of sub districts with distinctive urban distinctive rural and intermediate characteristics based on shared variances in this study the principal component was used as an extraction factor to extract maximum variance from the datasets within each component eigenvalues 1 was used as the extraction method factor loading for each component was obtained by performing a rotation method using a common orthogonal technique varimax rotation with kaiser normalization to minimise the number of variables that had high loadings on each factor the cut off for a statistically meaningful or significant rotated factor loading in this study was applied at 0 59 quick cluster or k means cluster multivariate clustering was applied for the regional rural urban interface classification based on the factor values k means clustering was chosen for this study because it is one of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms to explore structure in the variable datasets jain 2010 for further analysis in the discussion section k means clustering from the original datasets and hierarchical clustering from the original datasets were applied to see the effectiveness of factor analysis with principal components in capturing cluster structures as a comparison another regional rural urban interface classification was formulated based on land use and land cover data in the 45 sub districts using jenks natural breaks univariate clustering this method is one of the most highly regarded approaches in gis to explore the spatial pattern of attribute distributions across a region based on statistically optimal classification jenk s optimisation that was adapted from fisher s method wei et al 2017 cromley 1995 further comparison was applied using a combination of score based on the threshold cut off values identified from the natural breaks jenks the new regional classifications were determined through multivariate univariate and multiple univariate analysis approaches using ibm statistical package for the social science spss version 24 and gis version 10 3 developed by the environmental systems research institute esri the results were mapped by integrating both geographic information system gis and statistical methods a framework method to delineate peri urban area is shown in fig 2 4 results and discussions 4 1 variability and correlation of rural urban variables the coefficient of variation was used to find the most suitable variables for defining rural urban interface classifications in the context of cmr table 1 the results show five variables with the coefficient of variation more than 0 5 population density pd the percentage of built up area ba the percentage of forest water bodies and semi natural area fws the percentage of the population working in agriculture pa and distance to city centre d population density per km2 had the highest variability across cmr sub districts presenting this as a very good indicator for classifying rural urban interface typology correlation among the selected variables within cmr is shown in table 2 ba had a very strong positive correlation with pd but a strong negative correlation with pa d and travel time t pa had a very strong negative correlation with percentage of urban villages in the sub district uv and a strong negative correlation with pd ba and literacy rate lr but a strong positive correlation with d and t in addition a strong negative correlation was shown between lr and poverty level pl the agglomeration coefficient shows a numerical value at which various cases merge to form a cluster the agglomeration schedule coefficient was plotted into the line graph showing the coefficient on the y axis and the number of clusters on the x axis the elbow method helped to plot the number of clusters against the average variance in this study the stage where distance coefficient made the biggest jump step of the elbow was at 41 this verified the ideal number of the clusters of 45 41 4 clusters which was consistent with the interpretation of the dendrogram fig 3 4 2 multivariate data analysis comparison was applied to the original datasets through the k means clustering and hierarchical clustering fig 4 and synthetic datasets through the k means clustering fig 5 this study found that the classification based on the factor values synthetic data in the k means clustering instead of the original nine datasets through the hierarchical clustering did not necessarily improve the cluster quality or structures of the rural urban interface classifications in this study the regional rural urban interface classification s results based on factor values of the principal component and hierarchical clustering support similar interpretation this finding supports the conclusion of the previous study regarding the effectiveness of pcs in capturing the cluster structure investigated by yeung and ruzzo 2000 however the classification based on the k means clustering using factor values from the principal component analysis instead of the original datasets gave much improvement in the cluster structures this finding is comparable with the experimental results studied by venkatesan and parthiban 2011 that the combination of k means with pca improves the performance of basic k means in terms of accuracy regional rural urban classifications in fig 5 were developed based on the factor values factor analysis with a principal component was applied to the seven without spatial data aa fws ba and census data uv nine without spatial data aa and fws and 11 variables the kaiser meyer olkin model that measures sampling adequacy was found to be greater than 0 5 0 61 for seven variables 0 70 for nine variables and 0 65 for 11 variables verifying that the datasets were appropriate for the factor analysis the bartlett s test was also found to be significant p 0 05 two principal components using seven and nine variables and three principal components using 11 variables provided the total variance explained of 77 75 and 79 respectively with alpha values 0 65 the results of factor analysis from the seven and nine variables are shown in tables 3 and 4 the results from the 11 variables can be seen in part ii of this article factor loading of seven and nine variables shows that factor i is a principle component that has high correlation to the human activities in the study area implying the need for water supply water quality risks open space distribution and climate change pressures factor ii is a principle component that has high correlation to the water management capacity or social dimension implying vulnerable groups regarding water related problems and resilience that were also related to open space distribution additional two spatial variables percentage of agricultural area and percentage of forests water bodies and semi natural areas to the nine variables provided one more factor factor iii it is a principal component that has high correlation to the available natural resources biodiversity water and food production additional a built up data to the seven variables increased variance explained of the factor i however additional agricultural lands and forests water bodies and semi natural areas to the nine variables decreased variance explained of the factor i spatial distributions of factor values based on the 7 and 9 variables at 45 sub districts are shown in the map in figs 6 and 7 respectively the darkest colour on the maps indicates the highest factor values of the areas factor i from the seven variables loaded strongly on the increase of travel time distance to the city centre and population working in agriculture and on the decrease of population density and size hence the darkest colour in fig 6 a shows the sub districts with more rural characteristics on the other hand factor i from the nine variables loaded strongly on the increase of highest percentage of urban villages within sub district population density and built up areas and on the decrease of travel time and distance to the city centre and population working in agriculture hence the darkest colour in fig 6 b shows the sub districts with more urban characteristics from the map in fig 6 five sub districts in cirebon municipality kejaksan pekalipan kesambi lemahwungkuk and harjamukti and three sub districts in the cirebon regency weru kedawung and gunungjati have dominantly urban characteristics on the other hand sukagumiwang and mandirancang were among the sub districts with distinctive rural characteristics a different pattern of rural urban interface characteristics was obtained by applying factor values in the 45 sub districts based on the factor ii analysis factor ii from the seven variables loaded strongly on the increase of poverty level and the decrease of literacy rate hence the darkest colour in fig 7 a shows sub districts with more rural characteristics on the other hand factor ii from the nine variables loaded strongly on the increase of literacy rate and the decrease of poverty level hence the darkest colour in fig 7 b shows the areas with more urban characteristics the classification made by the factor ii analysis shows that five sub districts in kuningan regency mandirancang pasawahan pancalang cilimus and cigandamekar and sub districts in cirebon municipality have distinctive urban characteristics while kapetakan and gebang sub districts were among sub districts with distinctive rural characteristics anova test and post hoc analysis were applied to assess significant mean difference among four rural urban clusters from the k mean clustering from the synthetic values table 5 this table shows that additional two variables aa and fws increase the similarity of intermediate clusters or reduced significant differences between peri urban and urban peri urban transition characteristics higher values of factor i in the classification of seven variables show sub districts with more rural characteristics while higher values of factor i in the classification of nine and 11 variables show sub districts with more urban characteristics factor i shows systematically urbanisation level that mainly characterised by human activities in the study area is significantly higher in urban followed by urban peri urban transition peri urban and rural areas factor ii shows water management capacity in the cmr is higher in urban followed by rural urban peri urban transition upt and peri urban areas factor iii shows that food production s activities in the peri urban are significantly higher than other rural urban categories however the highest shared variances of the first factor provided the regional classification through the k means clustering that emphasised to the human activities in the study area 4 3 univariate data analysis the land use map in fig 8 shows that human settlement areas are concentrated in the centre of cmr or cirebon municipality the pattern of the impermeable area extended along the road directly to the north west part of cmr that is currently farmland this farmland is situated largely in the administrative area of cirebon regency scattered human settlements can be seen in the south east of cmr these settlements form a mixed area of orchards farmland and built up environments in the south and west part of cmr forest areas still dominate land use particularly in the kuningan regency and in majalengka regency the map shows the south part of cirebon municipality harjamukti sub district is not fully urbanised as there are some spaces with orchards and farmlands urbanisation seems to extend outside the boundary of the city crossing over into traditionally rural areas and creating rural urban environment or peri urban area the changes of built up areas within cmr boundary can be seen further from the land cover map between 2005 and 2014 the land cover map in fig 9 shows the built up areas in 2014 are comparatively similar to those in 2011 however compared to the land cover in 2005 it is obvious that land use has changed from once arable land to built up land in the cirebon region and that urbanisation has occurred mainly in the cirebon municipality and cirebon district along the arterial collector road direct to majalengka kuningan and indramayu the open space in the city of cirebon has decreased extremely in the 10 year period between 2005 and 2014 indicating the expectation and risk of the city further expanding to its peripheral areas to identify the level of urbanisation of 45 sub districts within cmr this study overlaid the land use maps in 2011 with the sub district administrative boundary the land use map in 2011 was used for the analysis because that data was considered to most closely reflect the 2010 indonesian population census data this study defined rural urban interface thresholds based on the jenks natural breaks with the number of classes being determined from a hierarchical cluster analysis the regional rural urban interface classification within cmr was re identified into the following categories i urban 55 8 93 7 built up area most areas consist of residential commercial industrial landscapes implying few or no open space distribution ii urban peri urban transition 34 7 55 7 built up area greater areas of residential commercial industrial landscape implying fewer open space distributions iii peri urban 15 9 34 7 built up area few residential commercial industrial landscapes implying larger open space distribution iv rural 5 2 15 8 built up area scarcely or no residential commercial industrial landscapes implying largest area of open space distribution fig 10 depicts these results with four sub districts defined as urban four as urban peri urban transition 19 as peri urban and 18 as rural land use and land cover lulc can be used to delineate rural urban interface as demonstrated by huang et al 2016 this study shows that recognises built up areas from the lulc analysis can distinguish rural urban interface gradient from the unsettled land at one end to the compact urban core at the other end benza et al 2016 in the context of ecohydrology the proportion of built up area can be used as a proxy to open space distribution sub districts with more urban characteristics have lower open space distribution implying higher risks in the impact of human activities on natural processes water cycle and local climate however relying regional rural urban classifications based on the built up area is not sufficiently described the complexity of relationship between people water and environment particularly in the socio economic dimension as also argued by zhu 2004 a more refined classification of settlement areas beyond built up area based dichotomy is required as also suggested by pizzoli and gong 2007 and camaioni et al 2013 the multidimensional approach in classifying rural urban interface should be considered 4 4 multiple univariate data with scoring analysis this classification was applied to the 11 variables nine variables five best variables from the 11 variables and four best variables from the nine variables the rural urban interface variable s thresholds were identified from the datasets considering the results from factor analysis in identifying sub districts with distinctive urban rural and intermediate characteristics scoring was applied by giving a score of 1 to the rural variable s thresholds a score of 2 to the variable s threshold close to rural a score of 3 to the variable s threshold close to urban and a score of 4 to the urban s variable threshold the regional rural urban interface classification was then mapped at the metropolitan scale table 6 shows rural urban interface threshold values defined by jenks natural breaks and scoring given to the 11 variable datasets scoring given to the multiple rural urban interface thresholds in the respective sub districts is considerably important in this study to compare the regional classifications between multivariate and multiple univariate clustering methods jenks natural breaks method was useful in determining rural urban interface thresholds of each variable in the total 11 variable datasets different sub districts had different values in the rural urban interface variables showing different rural urban interface characteristics overlapping classes in the rural urban interface category was evident in the sub districts between the centre of the metropolitan and outer boundary of the metropolitan region total scoring was calculated to recapitulate the variation of the rural urban interface indicator s values in the respective sub districts for the better classifications and displays in the choropleth maps the regional rural urban classification with this method is shown in fig 11 4 5 comparing methodology for peri urban delineation comparative analyses to define pattern and peri urban delineation using multivariate univariate and multiple univariate clusters have been considered in this study by integrating statistical attributes and space characteristics in choropleth maps univariate analysis was commonly used in the past as general absence of large scale spatial datasets multivariate analysis was commonly applied for spatial typology considering social economic and geographic aspects bogdanov et al 2008 alasia 2004 öğdül 2010 the choice of classification method or clustering technique as applied in this study influences the visual interpretation of the underlying pattern of the spatial distribution as remarked by cromley 1996 and murray and shyy 2000 the results in this study also supported previous findings that choropleth maps using the jenks natural breaks approach are more clearly understood and concluded than either unclassed maps or more traditional clustering approach cromley 1996 the example of unclassed maps in this study is shown in figs 6 9 while the example of more traditional clustering is shown in figs 4 and 5 the use of univariate cluster with one variable dataset and multiple univariate clusters with four five nine and 11 variable datasets shows clear patterns in the impacts of giving more variables into the cluster structures of the rural urban interfaces this study has shown the usefulness of combining statistical methods and gis for clustering and displaying the pattern and rural urban interface classifications in the choropleth maps gis provides facilities for exploratory analysis through the visual delineation of attribute variation across a region as already reviewed by murray and shyy 2000 both k means clustering and jenks natural breaks are non hierarchical clusters however jenks natural breaks method takes advantage for the univariate data sets while k means clustering method takes advantage for the multivariate datasets a drawback of both approaches is that the number of clusters desired in the result must be provided to the given dataset north 2009 jain 2010 as shown in this study the comparison of the regional rural urban interface maps was set in the same number of classes that were identified before determining regional rural urban interface classification through the k means multivariate clustering and univariate clustering jenks natural breaks method basically both k mean clustering and jenks natural breaks clustering methods aim to minimise the sum of the variance within each of the clusters cromley 1996 the original variable datasets have some outliers there were several sub districts within cmr having distinctive values in the rural urban interface variables using the k means clustering from the original datasets provided the unequal shape of clusters showing obvious outliers in the variable datasets of the rural urban interface variables k means clustering is more sensitive to outliers and does not work well with high dimensional data venkatesan and parthiban 2011 moreover some variables showed strong inter correlations with other variables this finding supports the previous reviews that the application of the clustering method directly from the original datasets continuous variable does not give efficiently cluster structures in case the data are vectors of correlated measurements james and mcculloch 1990 the k means clustering is more suitable for ordinal or categorical datasets such as synthetic values from the factor analysis using the principal components that are reflecting meaning categories from the measured variables yong and pearce 2013 james and mcculloch 1990 further the use of factor analysis with principal components provides easier interpretation of the 11 socio economic and spatial data in the context of ecohydrology however the regional classification datasets using multivariate cluster analysis factor analysis and k means clustering as applied in this study showed less accurate and meaningful results in capturing the variation of the rural urban interface characteristics compared to the classification from the multiple univariate cluster analysis jenks natural breaks with scoring 4 6 delineation of peri urban areas and ecohydrology factor analysis in this study shows that human activities in the study area primarily influenced the characteristics of rural urban environments as highlighted by zalewski and wagner 2008 urban environment is characterised by highly condensed anthropogenic system that should be managed for the efficient flow of water matter energy and information urban area is characterised with significant higher population density fewer open space distribution and lower agricultural activities compared to peripheral areas it has also a function as the centre of social and economic activities in the metropolitan region implying interaction and mobility of people from rural to urban areas for accessing urban services the high concentration of people and activities in the urban areas implying high demand for ecosystem services that could not be sufficient by only relying on the urban ecosystem and need peri urban ecosystem urban expansion to peri urban area challenges sustainable water resources and environment in the region affecting urban and peri urban liveability particularly on health akissa 2001 this interrelated and interdependent part between cities and rural hinterlands need to be considered as a system in the environmental management and planning for longer term liveability or sustainability as shown in this study peri urban area is one of the spatial categories in the metropolitan development this area has particular characteristics that need particular attention in the planning and management well defined peri urban zones will be useful in the quantification of socio economic and spatial features for managing and developing peri urban strategies for sustainable regional development human activities bring impacts to the changes in land uses water cycles and climate that need transdisciplinary science for problem solutions related to people water and environment for sustainability the knowledge of ecohydrological principles provides the scientific background for regulating the processes and interactions for enhancing water resources maintaining and restoring biodiversity providing ecosystem services for societies building resilience to climatic and anthropogenic impacts and incorporating cultural heritage perspectives wbsrc towards sustainable river basins zalewski et al 2016 zalewski 2013 in particular the first principle of ecohydrology provides framework for quantification of hydrological cycle analysis from the perspective of socio economic and spatial temporal dynamic with respect to various forms of human impact zalewski 2013 this principle can be used as a starting point for the formulation of a systemic approach zalewski and wagner 2008 human activities in the urban and peri urban that are inseparably and spatially linked should be translated into problem solving approaches shaping healthy and friendly city with its outskirts would need understanding of peri urban ecosystem for integrated planning and management in the metropolitan region further the implementation of the ecohydrological approach has to consider the context of generally accepted goals like sustainable development zalewski and wagner 2008 the sustainable development goals sdgs as advocated by the united nations in 2015 come into effect in a world that is increasingly urbanising the urban population is projected to grow to two thirds of the global population by 2050 united nations 2014 the goal 11 of the sdgs aims to ensure cities and human settlements are inclusive safe resilient and sustainable cities towns and villages or human settlements in the rural urban categories need to be planned and managed to fulfil their role as drivers of sustainable development and liveable environments that contribute to quality of life and enhance wellbeing according to zalewski and wagner 2008 urban technical infrastructures have to be complemented with constructed or managed ecological systems with a high potential for pollutant and water retention as city need its surrounding areas for sustainability ecological system in the metropolitan region could not be effectively managed by only considering urban ecosystem but also peri urban ecosystem quantification of ecohydrological processes and potential in the rural urban interfaces including peri urban zones would be required as a starting point based on the first ecohydrological principle as shown in this study socio economic and spatial data implying some indications of ecohydrology can be used not only for defining rural urban interface classifications including peri urban zones but also for better understanding of the rural urban interface ecohydrology 5 conclusions the methodology proposed for delineation of peri urban areas in this study provides a suitable framework for quantification of ecohydrological state of an urbanising area the study demonstrates that socio economic and spatial data can be used to define rural urban interface characteristics that also indirectly relate to ecohydrological aspects of the area the results show that the application of multivariate and univariate clusters analysis can assist in objectively delineating rural urban interfaces in a rapidly urbanising landscape the study also indicates that by including a range of variables in the analysis we were able to capture more meaningful cluster structures for defining rural urban interfaces the use of univariate cluster and multiple univariate clusters with scoring shows clear patterns in the impacts of having more variables into the cluster structures for rural urban interfaces the results of regional rural urban interface classification based on factor values of the principal components through the k means clustering and based on original datasets through the hierarchical clustering support a similar interpretation furthermore the classification based on the k means clustering using factor values from the principal components instead of the original datasets resulted in improved cluster structures in general the study indicates that the multiple univariate clusters using jenks natural breaks and scoring provide more accurate rural urban definitions for peri urban delineation further a well defined peri urban zone through the methodology proposed in this study will assist in the quantification of socio economic and spatial features and evidence based policy formulation and planning in the rural urban interfaces and thus

1173,part ii of this two part article aims to quantify the state of rural urban interface ecohydrology using the cirebon metropolitan region cmr in west java indonesia as a case study the methodology proposed in this study used 11 socio economic and spatial variables related to open spaces distribution biodiversity and ecosystem services water supply requirement water quality risks water management capacity and climate change pressures regional rural urban classifications from the eight spatial classification methods part i of this article and 2010 national census were validated using three rural urban water indicators from random sampling of the rural urban household survey in the cmr six proxy ecohydrological indicators were identified and a composite index using these indicators to quantify the state of ecohydrology at rural urban interface was developed and applied to 45 sub districts of cmr the index indicates that all urban sub districts have very low capacity in providing ecosystem services and will need peri urban ecosystem services for enhancing urban sustainability and liveability in general urban and urban peri urban transition sub districts in the cmr have significant higher values of composite index related to socio economic aspects compared to those in the peri urban and rural sub districts this indicates lower significantly open spaces distribution higher water supply requirement greater water quality risks and higher climate change pressures the six proxy indicators identified in this study and methodology developed for calculating the composite index is potentially useful for an objective assessment of ecohydrology of an urbanising landscape and thus for developing effective urban planning of future cities and their outskirts keywords spatial classification methods peri urban urban peri urban transition ecohydrological proxy indicators quantification of ecohydrology spatial planning 1 introduction population and urbanisation processes will continue to grow in the coming decades it is predicted that the world s urban population will increase by additional 2 5 billion people by 2050 with nearly 90 concentrated in asia and africa united nations 2014 increasing urbanisation of rural areas surrounding cities is an inevitable consequence of the urbanisation process cities all over the world will face the challenges caused by urban sprawl at the global level peri urban areas will play an important role for enhancing urban sustainability however without holistic planning peri urban areas could experience significant losses of productive agricultural land increased runoff and water quality degradation malano et al 2014 furthermore the increasing population living in the urban areas implies the emergence and exacerbation of regional sustainability issues because in the extensive urban development cities are no longer independent and their inhabitants dependent on the peri urban ecosystem services for sustaining their inhabitants well being and quality of life grimm et al 2008 cities are considered as ecological systems where water cycles material and energy flows are extremely intense the quality of life and health in cities becomes more critical as increasing urban population and natural resources degradation urbanisation can bring positive impacts to the socio economic but it can also bring environmental challenges and social conflicts that are mostly related to sustainable water uses in particular increasing water demand for urbanisation and agriculture combined with pollution eutrophication and climate variability raises water restrictions for ecosystems and societies zalewski 2010 furthermore urbanisation brings an obvious impact on land use where higher levels of impervious surfaces increase flood risk reduce water infiltration into soils diminishe base flow and groundwater recharge and increase storm runoff if there are no mitigation measures in place miller et al 2014 pataki et al 2011 wheater and evans 2009 eliminating water related risks through traditional engineering approaches is no longer sufficient to resolve water issues zalewski and wagner 2008 zalewski 2002 ecohydrological approaches along with the needs and priorities of people or societal expectations are required to promote a more sustainable future and to achieve an ultimate goal for the sustainable management of river basins zalewski 2013 zalewski et al 2008 the term ecohydrology has been used since 1990s to describe a new scientific way of managing the water cycle for sustainable water use by societies zalewski et al 2008 yet the clear separation between urban and rural environment that has become an essential feature of census systems as well as planning and management approaches has failed to quantify and qualify the impacts of urbanisation on natural processes and wellbeing of people or liveability in the peri urban areas peri urban areas are characterised by rapid transitional change sprawling urbanisation that have resulted in considerable loss of biodiversity and natural resources that have important ecohydrological functions and require protection simon and adam bradford 2016 elmqvist et al 2013 it is therefore not surprising that managing natural resource is more challenging where agricultural and urban areas are highly modified zalewski 2014 moreover attention to the peri urban strategy for sustainable regional metropolitan development is currently lacking this study proposes new proxy indicators and a composite index for assessing the ecohydrological state of rural urban interfaces an important element of this study is a new approach for the quantification of the ecohydrological state of the area based on some basic socio economic and spatial variables differentiating rural urban interfaces within metropolitan region methodology for peri urban delineation in the context of ecohydrology was described in danielaini et al 2017 part i of this article while quantifying the ecohydrological state of the rural urban interface is the focus of this article therefore the main aim of this article is to develop methodology to quantify ecohydrological state of the rural urban interface using a number of proxy ecohydrological indicators rural urban classification and composite index related to the state of ecohydrology of an urbanising area 2 the study area the study area is located in the development zone of cirebon metropolitan region cmr in west java indonesia a detailed description of the area is given in danielaini et al 2017 part i of this article mega cities will no longer be acceptable for future urban living and people are more likely to live in medium and smaller cities fahmi et al 2014 the world bank 2011 as also highlighted by cohen 2006 majority of urban dwellers will still live in towns and cities with fewer than 500 000 inhabitants peripheral cities are expected to urbanise further and experience a more rapid population growth compared to the core cities firman 2004 asian development bank 2006 in this context the study of cmr provides a good laboratory to evaluate ecohydrological aspects to assist in future policies and strategies for urban development this is particularly important for managing water cycle in peri urban areas due to urbanisation and climate change 3 development of criteria and analysis to understand rural urban interface ecohydrology in cmr a survey was conducted from across five districts a total of 430 farmers and non farmers were randomly drawn from the rural urban interface households fig 1 after a questionnaire pre test participants were individually interviewed the questionnaire consisted of open ended and closed ended questions in the indonesian language that covered a large range of topics these included household characteristics water sources for basic household requirements and food production access to water related services experiences of water problems assessment of water quality importance and performance of water related services for liveability experiences in the ecohydrological changes in the past 20 years and impacts their concerns about future urbanisation and any strategies to improve sustainable water use in this article we used three rural urban interface indicators from the random rural urban household survey the number of households with access to the drinking water services access to the wastewater treatment services and the number of farmers in the surveyed location to validate the classification results that best captured the true variations of the rural urban interface ecohydrology 3 1 proposed indicators and composite index managing sustainable water resources is affected by complex interconnections between socio cultural and biophysical aspects hiwasaki and arico 2007 further to reach sustainability in water use and rural urban development there is a need to consider multifaceted goals involving water resources biodiversity ecosystem services resilience and cultural heritage wbsrc aspects zalewski et al 2016 considering the wbsrc aspects six proxy indicators were proposed for evaluating ecohydrological condition of a given rural urban interface these six indicators were then used to develop a composite index called ecohydrological state index for rural urban interface esi ru at sub district level six proxy indicators of ecohydrological condition of rural urban interface are defined as follows i proxy indicator of open space distribution pi os this indicator is estimated as the percentage of built up area x ba a proxy to open space distribution in urbanising area indicates the impact of human activities on natural processes water cycle and local climate singh 1998 pamukcu et al 2016 jenerette et al 2011 ii proxy indicator of biodiversity and ecosystem services pi be this indicator is taken as the percentage area of forests water bodies and semi natural area x fws and proportion of agricultural lands x aa determines available natural resources implying rural urban biodiversity water resources ecosystem services including cultural heritage and food production elmqvist et al 2013 janauer 2016 millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 iii proxy indicator of water supply requirement pi ws this indicator is related to population size x

census within each sub district x uv that can affect water quality and thus impacts on liveability including health of human and settlement at rural urban interface howard et al 2003 vlahov et al 2007

travel time x t to city centre determines the commuting needs and accessibility to urban services and indirectly influences climate change and eventually the ecosystem of the area grimm et al 2008 dawson et al 2009 the functional relationship between esi ru and proxy ecohydrological indicators can be expressed by the following equation 1 e s i r u f p i o s p i b e p i w s p i w q p i w m p i c c a framework for the development of esi ru is shown in fig 2 3 2 methodology for calculating esi ru the new regional classifications methodology developed in danielaini et al 2017 part i of this article was employed here for calculating esi ru as mentioned the classification methodology used multivariate univariate and multiple univariate analysis approaches using ibm statistical package for the social science spss version 24 and gis version 10 3 developed by the environmental systems research institute esri the results were mapped by integrating both geographic information system gis and statistical methods to determine optimal classification strategy for rural urban interface ecohydrology a function of the data distribution was assessed using chi square analysis to reveal the underlying characteristics of the statistical distribution from the surveyed rural urban household factor analysis was used to discover the simplest method of interpreting the 11 socio economic and spatial variables related to the six proxy indicators of ecohydrological conditions in this study the principal component analysis was used as an extraction factor to extract maximum variance from the datasets within each component eigenvalues 1 and fixed number of one factor was used as the extraction method factor loading for each component was obtained by performing a rotation method using a common orthogonal technique varimax rotation with kaiser normalisation to minimise the number of variables that had high loadings on each factor the cut off for a statistically meaningful or significant rotated factor loading in this study was applied at 0 60 rural urban ecohydrological conditions in the 45 sub districts within rural urban cmr were analysed using principal component analysis pca given k variables x i x 2 x k each principal component pc is a linear combination of original variables measured x s obtained as 2 p c j i 1 k a i j x i j 1 2 3 k where pc j principal component j a ij represent the weights for the ith variable for the jth principal component based on the eigenvalues 1 the 11 variables provided three principal components in this study analysis of 11 socio economic and spatial variables with three and one principal components provided high cronbach s alpha 0 80 hence composite index scores in 45 sub districts were calculated from the pca with three and one dimension solutions pca with three dimension solutions eigenvalues 1 provided three ecohydrological state indexes for rural urban interface 3 e s i r u 1 f p i o s p i w s p i w q p i c

three indicators from random rural urban household survey in cmr were used for validation of the regional classification results the first indicator used for this study was farmer participants in the surveyed urban rural areas f this was expected to be highest in the rural areas the second indicator was households with access to public drinking water services d and the third indicator was households with access to public wastewater treatment services w these were expected to be highest in the urban areas the assessments considered the distribution of rural urban households in the rural urban categories h this test was applied to find whether the indicators of rural urban interface ecohydrology were consistent with the surveyed household distributions in the rural urban interface category the result shows that all the p values were found to be less than the significance level 0 05 hence the null hypothesis cannot be accepted table 1 the classification produced by multivariate analysis incorporated a greater proportion of the surveyed households in the urban peri urban transition 34 than other methods however the multivariate analyses did not provide meaningful results as the regional classification through the k means clustering failed to capture the distinctive urban and rural sub districts from the all factors the highest shared variances of the first factor provided the regional classification through the k means clustering that emphasised human activities for a given socio economic conditions hence formulating a regional rural urban interface classification by segmenting variables measured into two or three principal components did not provide an accurate definition of the urban and rural sub districts as a consequence the classification also could not provide accurately the sub districts with intermediate category urban peri urban transition upt and peri urban the 2010 national census identified the greatest proportion 70 of surveyed households being in urban while the rest 30 were rural based on the census classification three indicators of urban and rural ecohydrology were found to be highest in the urban areas these were the proportion of farmers and households with access to public drinking and wastewater treatment services these results show that the classification of rural urban interface used in the census failed to identify not only peri urban characteristics but also rural characteristics critically this demonstrates that the scoring system applied on the 2010 census did not provide methods to define peri urban areas compared to the multivariate analysis the formulation of regional rural urban interface classifications using univariate cluster and multiple univariate cluster analysis with scoring provided more meaningful results the classification of the rural urban interface ecohydrology through jenks natural breaks from spatial built up data and multiple univariate analysis with scoring from 11 variables provided a greater proportion of the surveyed households in the peri urban 50 than other methods the classification of the rural urban interface ecohydrology based on the four best and five best variables provided for a greater proportion of the surveyed households in rural areas than other methods 34 however using the four and five best criteria did not consider the other important factors of distinctive urban and rural sub districts the regional rural urban interface classification based on multiple univariate clusters and scoring to the four best five best and 11 variables yielded higher chi squared values compared to the classifications based on the spatial data and scoring to the nine rural urban interface thresholds higher chi squared values mean higher inconsistency between rural urban interface ecohydrology and distribution of the rural urban interface households based on these results the multiple univariate clusters with scoring to the nine rural urban interface thresholds was proven giving more representative of the distribution of the rural urban interface ecohydrology this classification method provided the best understanding of the evolution of urbanisation and rural urban water related characteristics at the metropolitan level in addition more accurate definitions of urban urban peri urban transition peri urban and rural were obtained through this category hence rural urban classification from the multiple univariate with scoring analysis to nine variables was used for further analysis to define rural urban interface ecohydrology within cmr 4 2 quantifying the state of rural urban interface ecohydrology a total of 11 socio economic and spatial variables were used in the analysis for quantifying rural urban interface ecohydrology in the urban urban peri urban transition upt peri urban and rural sub districts within cmr the kaiser meyer olkin model that measures sampling adequacy was found to be greater than 0 5 0 65 for 11 variables verifying that the datasets were appropriate for the factor analysis with principal components the bartlett s test was also found to be significant p 0 05 three principal components using 11 indicators provided high alpha values 0 80 with a total variance explained of 79 table 2 5 principal component analysis pc i loaded strongly on the increase of proportion of urban villages within a sub district population density built up area and on the decrease of travel time distance to the city centre and population working in agriculture pc ii loaded strongly on the increased poverty level and the decreased literacy rate and built up area pc iii loaded strongly on the increase of forests water bodies and semi natural areas and the decrease of agricultural areas spatial distribution of factor values based on the 11 indicators at 45 sub districts is shown in the map in fig 3 pc i was defined as a principle component that has high correlation with socio economic aspects related to water supply requirement pi ws water quality risks pi wq open space distribution pi os and climate change pressures pi cc pc ii was defined as a principle component that has high correlation with water management capacity or social dimension pi wm implying vulnerable groups regarding water related problems and resilience that are also related to open space distribution pc iii was defined as a principal component that has high correlation with available natural resources biodiversity water and food production pi be spatial distribution pattern of pc i shows that the darkest colour on the maps indicates the highest factor values of the areas the darkest colour as shown in fig 3 a shows the sub districts with the lowest distance travel time and population engaged in agriculture highest percentage of urban villages within sub district population density and built up areas can be defined as more urban in the context of ecohydrology those sub districts with more urban characteristics have higher built up areas implying lower pi os higher population density implying higher pi wq higher urban villages implying higher level of human activities in the village settlements within a sub district and implying higher pi ws and pi wq from urban activities lower travel time and distance to the city centre implying the areas as the centre of social economic activities implying higher pi cc and lower population engage in agriculture implying higher urban activities in non agriculture or higher pi ws for non agricultural activities according to pc i five sub districts in cirebon municipality kejaksan pekalipan kesambi lemahwungkuk and harjamukti and three sub districts in the cirebon regency weru kedawung and gunungjati have dominantly human activities in socio economic aspects implying lower pi os and higher pi ws pi wq and pi cc on the other hand sindangwangi and mandirancang were among the sub districts with distinctive minor human activities in socio economic aspects implying higher pi os and lower pi ws pi wq and pi cc spatial distribution pattern of pc ii shows that the darkest colour on the maps indicates the sub districts with the highest poverty level and the lowest literacy rate hence the sub districts with the darker colour as shown in fig 3 b can be defined as more rural this pc ii has lower variance in explaining rural urban characteristics in the cmr compared to the pc i however it can explain more in the context of ecohydrology those sub districts with more urban characteristics have lower poverty level and higher literacy rate implying higher pi wm or lower vulnerability and higher resilience regarding water related problems according to pc ii five sub districts in kuningan regency mandirancang pasawahan pancalang cilimus and cigandamekar and four sub districts in cirebon municipality kejaksan pekalipan kesambi and lemahwungkuk have more urban characteristics while kapetakan and gebang were among sub districts with more rural characteristics critical area with lower pi wm implying higher vulnerability or lower resilience regarding water related problems within cmr was found in the cirebon regency particularly in the coastal sub districts rural urban pattern from pc iii are considerably different than pcs i and ii the darkest colour shows the highest proportion of forests water bodies and semi natural areas and the lowest proportion of agricultural areas this pc iii has the lowest variance in explaining rural urban characteristic in the cmr but it can explain more in the context of ecohydrology those sub districts with darker colour show higher availability of natural resources biodiversity and water but lower food production s activities while those sub districts with lighter colour show lower availability of natural resources biodiversity and water but higher food production s activities according to pc iii sukagumiwang indramayu regency and most sub districts in the north part of the cmr such as klangenan susukan plered suranenggala and kapetakan were among sub districts with lower natural resources and water availability but higher food production s activities on the other hand those in the south part of the cmr such as harjamukti cirebon municipality cilimus and pasawahan kuningan regency karangsembung and dukupuntang cirebon regency and sindangwangi majalengka regency were among sub districts with higher pi be 6 the state of ecohydrology based on esi ru the results of quantifying the state of rural urban interface ecohydrology using the three principal components are shown in table 3 three of the eight urban sub districts have very high value of esi ru1 in socio economic aspects 0 91 namely harjamukti kejaksan and kesambi while the rest urban sub districts have high esi ru1 0 76 0 90 harjamukti is the only urban sub district within cmr that still has a moderate availability of natural resources and food production pi be with a esi ru3 value of 0 72 while the rest urban sub districts have very low pi be with esi ru3 values 0 50 in fact harjamukti is the place for urban newcomers for finding residential areas close to the city centre a high dynamic change in land use from farmlands to housing settlement areas in the past decade can be seen in harjamukti among sub districts in the city harjamukti has the largest size in population and total area furthest distance from the city centre but lowest size in density and built up areas implying highest pi ws highest pi cc lowest pi wq and highest pi os however among urban sub districts harjamukti also has the lowest capacity in water management pi wm with a esi ru2 value 0 64 while other urban sub districts in the cirebon city have higher pi wm with esi ru2 values 0 5 currently most urban dwellers in the cirebon city 80 have access to the gravity flow water systems of pdam a formal local drinking water company at the district level that was transmitted from kuningan district pasawahan sub district peri urban category within cmr however harjamukti s residents have problems in accessing the public water system services because the topography of harjamukti is comparably higher than other sub districts in the cirebon city the higher topography has made the pdam facing problem in distribution of water supply using gravity system to that area further higher potential decrease of open space distribution in the harjamukti as the higher potential increase of housing and human settlement will give more challenges to the future fulfilment of water supply requirement sub districts that are located in the cirebon district adjacent to the city and linked with the arterial roads or toll roads such as kedawung weru and plumbon have shown similar characteristics with urban sub districts in the city sub districts in the peripheral city in the category of urban peri urban transition upt areas also have a high value of esi ru1 in socio economic aspects such as gunungjati 0 92 sumber 0 81 astanajapura 0 80 and mundu 0 78 but lower capacity in water management esi ru2 than those in the urban category 0 64 sub districts located further from the city showed different characteristics arjawinangun is the only sub districts in the peri urban category with a moderate value of esi ru1 in socio economic aspects while the rest peri urban districts and all rural districts have low values of esi ru1 0 6 further sub districts located in the foothill of mount ciremai such as sindangwangi rural sub district majalengka pasawahan and cilimus peri urban sub districts kuningan have high values of esi ru2 in water management capacity and esi ru3 in natural resource availability mean values of esi ru in the rural urban categories within cmr are shown in table 4 in general urban and upt sub districts in the cmr have significant higher value of esi ru1 in socio economic aspects compared to the peri urban and rural sub districts implying significant higher non open space areas or lower pi os higher pi ws higher pi wq and higher pi cc urban dwellers in the cmr also had significant lower value of esi ru2 related to water management capacity compared to the dwellers that lived in the non urban sub districts implying higher pi wm or significant lower vulnerable groups regarding water related problems and resilience however rural urban sub districts in the cmr commonly have very low value of esi ru3 for natural resources availability except sub districts in kuningan in particular urban sub districts mostly have insignificant lower pi be compared to the upt peri urban and rural sub districts spatial distributions of the three ecohydrological state indexes for rural urban interface esi ru1 esi ru2 and esi ru3 in the rural urban interface sub districts within cmr are presented in figs 4 6 table 5 shows the ranks of esi ru values for ecohydrological state in the cmr the rank of esi ru depicts rural urban interface ecohydrology and provides a systematic pattern of ecohydrological changes that is considerably fit with the rural urban interface classification based on nine variables additional two variables availability of agricultural areas and natural resources provided higher scores of esi ru in plumbon and cigandamekar that was respectively positioned in the rank of scores for urban peri urban transition and rural sub districts the construction of esi ru weighed highly on the proportion of built up areas population density proportion of population working in agriculture and distance to city centre higher scores of esi ru represent higher open space distribution pi os or smaller extent of impervious areas lower water quality risks pi wq higher water supply reqirement pi ws for agricultural activities and lower climate change pressures pi cc as situated further from city while lower scores of esi ru represent the opposite based on the values of esi ru all urban sub districts have very low values showing low capacity in providing ecosystem services for urban liveability and regional sustainability because population density in those sub districts is high but they have very low pi os the lowest esi ru 0 25 were obtained for pekalipan 0 00 kejaksan 0 12 kesambi 0 19 and lemahwungkuk 0 21 implying lowest pi os highest pi wq lowest pi ws for agricultural activities and highest pi cc the scores that were weighted highly on built up areas or pi os also show that those urban sub districts have lowest capacity in providing protection of ecohydrological processes and potential conservation of biodiversity maintaining air and water quality or improving the local microclimate in fact the city is currently dependent on peri urban ecosystem for providing natural resources including water and food the highest value of esi ru 0 91 were obtained from losari 0 93 gebang 0 94 and sukagumiwang 1 00 implying highest pi os lowest pi wq highest pi ws for agricultural activities and lowest pi cc the development of esi ru from pca with one dimension solution however provided low weight from indicators implying water management capacity and ecosystem services in natural resource availability and food production activities hence more accurate ecohydrological state at the rural urban interface within cmr can be obtained from the pca with three dimension solutions 7 discussions 7 1 quantifying rural urban interface ecohydrology for planning this study was conducted at a metropolitan region in a developing country with a population of the core city less than 500 000 residents according to cohen 2006 smaller cities and towns under half a million should be put more attention in the development agenda of urban future because compared to large cities they have very significant total population faster growth considerably underserved basic services higher poverty and weaker local government capacity moreover in developing countries water distribution systems and public sanitation services in cities are typically inadequate for instance in the cmr as a focus area of this study the coverage of sewerage system services is still less than 5 while the service coverage of public water services in the districts surrounding city is still less than 25 of the political boundary wjp mdm 2013 this will lead to more challenges to improve basic services in the areas that directly affected by urban expansion also without sufficient wastewater treatment facilities urban residents will face severe environmental health as cities will discharge increasing amount of waste into freshwater bodies threatening water quality and aquatic ecosystem before the service gap and environmental degradation level become too overwhelming as it is going on in larger cities small cities have a time to address the need of urban residents for basic infrastructures and ecosystem services for shaping healthy and friendly city and its outskirts in this study socio economic and spatial data were used as new indices for assessing ecohydrological potential or defining rural urban interfaces ecohydrology a systematic pattern can be found from esi ru values implying ecohydrological processes and potential in the rural urban interfaces including in the peri urban zones urbanisation transforms rural land uses of agriculture or forestry into urban land uses that are characterised by a large extent of built up area high population density and less proportion of residents engaged in agriculture land use practices in the urban zones showed that sub districts in the city boundary such as pekalipan kejaksan and kesambi have limited open space distributions or a large extense of impervious areas very high population density implying high water quality risks high water supply requirement for non agricultural activities and high climate change pressures in addition this study showed that peri urban sub districts closed to the city have been directely affected by the urban expansion more human activities in socio economic aspects in the urban peri urban transition upt zone indicate more basic services for healthy housing and human settlement will be required besides more efforts for maintaining peri urban ecosystem services water demands related with land use practices and urbanisation alters rural urban landscape structures causing stresses to ecosystems and impacts on water quantity and quality foley et al 2005 sun and lockaby 2012 currently peri urban areas are not recognised as integral part of the functional activities of urban growth in the context of urban water management peri urbanisation brings particular challenges in quantifying and qualifying the impacts of urban spaces on natural processes for managing water quality dynamics mcgrane 2016 this issue is closely related to the boundary between urban and rural areas that is moving outwards the main city as the population grows in the urban and regional planning context peri urban zone is a part of spatial categories in the metropolitan development this area deserves specific planning and management as highlighted also by wandl and magoni 2017 peri urban areas ask for particular attention and distinctive policy approaches as they are not simply the extension of the urban in the rural areas defining rural urban interface ecohydrology including peri urban zone would be beneficial in the planning for developing rural urban strategy related to water people and environment for better liveability and sustainability 7 2 integrating ecohydrology in urban planning urbanisation drives environmental changes at multiple scales from the local land use and cover regional hydrosystems to the global biogeochemical cycles and climate grimm et al 2008 sun and lockaby 2012 foley et al 2005 converting rural lands into urban uses will bring impacts on watershed ecosystem health and sustainability issues sun and lockaby 2012 landscape processes in the rural urban catchments are being transformed in different ways by human activities in the study area high built up environment in the cities accounts for less open spaces such as parks and gardens farmlands forest and nature reserves open spaces are dominated by a natural environment less open spaces in the city means limited continuity and functionality of the ecosystems and survival of natural and landscape values maruani and amit cohen 2007 in particular the development of peri urban areas that involves the conversion of rural areas into a changing mix of urban and rural activities and functions can affect ecohydrological functioning influencing water and land management and food production in the peri urban areas maheshwari et al 2016 thus planning for balanced urban development and an integrated approach that can address in the provision of ecosystem services and the maintenance of quality of life within a river basin such as ecohydrology are required in the context of balanced urban development place people and planning in the peri urban zone need to be considered as well maheshwari et al 2016 in the context of ecohydrology sustainable water management improves future s cities health and functional integration of peri urban ecosystems into urban development enhances absorbing capacities of urban ecosystems zalewski and wagner 2008 in this case regional planning will provide a comprehensive visualisation of the possible flow of waters services and population within a defined rural urban area for optimum liveability sustainability as concluded by mackaye 1940 regional planning is applied human ecology hence the scale of planning activities is a region that commonly contains one major city and has a single macroclimate providing a region wide control over the soils ecosystems and natural processes forman 2014 in the context of regional planning designing a land that effectively complement ecological reliability with basic human needs will only be accomplished with a healthy landscape and regional ecosystem forman 2014 the harmony between environment and society in the rural urban interfaces can be supported by applying ecohydrological system approach to the regulation of the interplay between water and ecosystem zalewski and wagner 2008 a systematic method for identifying and evaluation of land that is most suitable for open space distributions is required for combining metropolitan growth with a network of open spaces that would not only protect natural processes but also could be used for amenity and recretion mcharg 2014 maruani and amit cohen 2007 ecohydrology eh provides a transdisciplinary approach and systemic framework to regulate hydrology ecosystem and society interplay to reduce the impacts of floods and droughts improve human well being and harmonise ecosystem potential with societal needs zalewski 2010 furthermore as mentioned by zalewski 2007 ecohydrology is a problem solving science that emphasises in regulation of processes through effective management of the water and nutrient dynamics from the landscape to aquatic ecosystems ecohydrological considerations can also help to promote integration of ecology with hydrology to solve issues surrounding water environment and people to achieve its ultimate goal for the sustainable management of river basins zalewski et al 2008 the three principles of eh not only provide a framework for its implementation but also for harmonisation of eh measures with hydro technical infrastructures zalewski 2000 ecohydrological principles can be implemented at various scales through the development of integrative scientific methods in this study the first principle of eh was applied for quantifying ecohydrological processes by using 11 socio economic and spatial data as ecohydrological proxy indicators at a landscape scale to understand rural urban interface structures relationships and patterns in a developing coastal metropolitan region in indonesia yet to achieve the goals of ecohydrological sustainability further study to quantify water quality and water quantity at the river basin and the use of this understanding in the planning and environmental management is required for sustainable water use in the rural urban interfaces there is also a need for more studies to understand the impacts of urban sprawl to the wellbeing of people in the peri urban areas or liveability and balanced urban development the question still remains about how to overcome the separation of urban and rural function in the current development approach and to combine planning approach at five districts within cmr in the context of metropolitan region efforts are needed to harmonise policies and institutions during spatial planning and for their integration at basin level in indonesia the spatial planning law 26 2007 provides guidance how spatial planning need to be implemented to support the water sector and the need for national and provincial plans to follow planning requirements at the district level such as 30 space requirement for forest in districts and 30 open space requirement in cities however currently the short and long term spatial planning both at the regional and national levels pay little attention to water resource management asian development bank 2016 therefore the inadequate support within regional and national governments for water sector in the allocation of required budget hampers the goal of integrated water resource management thus affecting future water security and sustainability of urbanising areas in indonesia 8 conclusions this study demonstrated that a total of 11 socio economic and spatial variables can be used for quantifying ecohydrological state of the urban urban peri urban transition upt peri urban and rural sub districts within cmr out of these variables six proxy ecohydrological indicators open space distribution pios biodiversity and ecosystem services pibe water supply requirement piws water quality risk piwq water management capacity piwm climate change pressure picc were identified and a composite index called ecohydrological state index for rural urban interface esi ru was developed based on these indicators and esi ru the first pattern emerged showed a distinctive elements of rural urban interface ecohydrology related to open spaces distribution water supply requirement water quality risks and climate change pressures the second pattern for the rural urban interface ecohydrology emerged was related to the water management capacity of the residents and third pattern was about the availability of natural resources food production activities biodiversity and ecosystem services the results of quantifying ecohydrological state in the cmr show that the esi ru values from pca with three dimensional solutions provide more accurate results than the one dimensional solution while the typology classifications in this study are unique to the cirebon metropolitan region the methodology relies on publicly available data from the government and google maps and therefore the methodology developed in this study could be replicated in other metropolitan areas in indonesia and elsewhere overall the index esi ru developed in this study can assist in the planning for balanced urban development at a regional scale with an integrated approach that can include the provision of ecosystem services and the maintenance of quality of life in urbanising areas within river basins conflict of interest none declared ethical

1173,part ii of this two part article aims to quantify the state of rural urban interface ecohydrology using the cirebon metropolitan region cmr in west java indonesia as a case study the methodology proposed in this study used 11 socio economic and spatial variables related to open spaces distribution biodiversity and ecosystem services water supply requirement water quality risks water management capacity and climate change pressures regional rural urban classifications from the eight spatial classification methods part i of this article and 2010 national census were validated using three rural urban water indicators from random sampling of the rural urban household survey in the cmr six proxy ecohydrological indicators were identified and a composite index using these indicators to quantify the state of ecohydrology at rural urban interface was developed and applied to 45 sub districts of cmr the index indicates that all urban sub districts have very low capacity in providing ecosystem services and will need peri urban ecosystem services for enhancing urban sustainability and liveability in general urban and urban peri urban transition sub districts in the cmr have significant higher values of composite index related to socio economic aspects compared to those in the peri urban and rural sub districts this indicates lower significantly open spaces distribution higher water supply requirement greater water quality risks and higher climate change pressures the six proxy indicators identified in this study and methodology developed for calculating the composite index is potentially useful for an objective assessment of ecohydrology of an urbanising landscape and thus for developing effective urban planning of future cities and their outskirts keywords spatial classification methods peri urban urban peri urban transition ecohydrological proxy indicators quantification of ecohydrology spatial planning 1 introduction population and urbanisation processes will continue to grow in the coming decades it is predicted that the world s urban population will increase by additional 2 5 billion people by 2050 with nearly 90 concentrated in asia and africa united nations 2014 increasing urbanisation of rural areas surrounding cities is an inevitable consequence of the urbanisation process cities all over the world will face the challenges caused by urban sprawl at the global level peri urban areas will play an important role for enhancing urban sustainability however without holistic planning peri urban areas could experience significant losses of productive agricultural land increased runoff and water quality degradation malano et al 2014 furthermore the increasing population living in the urban areas implies the emergence and exacerbation of regional sustainability issues because in the extensive urban development cities are no longer independent and their inhabitants dependent on the peri urban ecosystem services for sustaining their inhabitants well being and quality of life grimm et al 2008 cities are considered as ecological systems where water cycles material and energy flows are extremely intense the quality of life and health in cities becomes more critical as increasing urban population and natural resources degradation urbanisation can bring positive impacts to the socio economic but it can also bring environmental challenges and social conflicts that are mostly related to sustainable water uses in particular increasing water demand for urbanisation and agriculture combined with pollution eutrophication and climate variability raises water restrictions for ecosystems and societies zalewski 2010 furthermore urbanisation brings an obvious impact on land use where higher levels of impervious surfaces increase flood risk reduce water infiltration into soils diminishe base flow and groundwater recharge and increase storm runoff if there are no mitigation measures in place miller et al 2014 pataki et al 2011 wheater and evans 2009 eliminating water related risks through traditional engineering approaches is no longer sufficient to resolve water issues zalewski and wagner 2008 zalewski 2002 ecohydrological approaches along with the needs and priorities of people or societal expectations are required to promote a more sustainable future and to achieve an ultimate goal for the sustainable management of river basins zalewski 2013 zalewski et al 2008 the term ecohydrology has been used since 1990s to describe a new scientific way of managing the water cycle for sustainable water use by societies zalewski et al 2008 yet the clear separation between urban and rural environment that has become an essential feature of census systems as well as planning and management approaches has failed to quantify and qualify the impacts of urbanisation on natural processes and wellbeing of people or liveability in the peri urban areas peri urban areas are characterised by rapid transitional change sprawling urbanisation that have resulted in considerable loss of biodiversity and natural resources that have important ecohydrological functions and require protection simon and adam bradford 2016 elmqvist et al 2013 it is therefore not surprising that managing natural resource is more challenging where agricultural and urban areas are highly modified zalewski 2014 moreover attention to the peri urban strategy for sustainable regional metropolitan development is currently lacking this study proposes new proxy indicators and a composite index for assessing the ecohydrological state of rural urban interfaces an important element of this study is a new approach for the quantification of the ecohydrological state of the area based on some basic socio economic and spatial variables differentiating rural urban interfaces within metropolitan region methodology for peri urban delineation in the context of ecohydrology was described in danielaini et al 2017 part i of this article while quantifying the ecohydrological state of the rural urban interface is the focus of this article therefore the main aim of this article is to develop methodology to quantify ecohydrological state of the rural urban interface using a number of proxy ecohydrological indicators rural urban classification and composite index related to the state of ecohydrology of an urbanising area 2 the study area the study area is located in the development zone of cirebon metropolitan region cmr in west java indonesia a detailed description of the area is given in danielaini et al 2017 part i of this article mega cities will no longer be acceptable for future urban living and people are more likely to live in medium and smaller cities fahmi et al 2014 the world bank 2011 as also highlighted by cohen 2006 majority of urban dwellers will still live in towns and cities with fewer than 500 000 inhabitants peripheral cities are expected to urbanise further and experience a more rapid population growth compared to the core cities firman 2004 asian development bank 2006 in this context the study of cmr provides a good laboratory to evaluate ecohydrological aspects to assist in future policies and strategies for urban development this is particularly important for managing water cycle in peri urban areas due to urbanisation and climate change 3 development of criteria and analysis to understand rural urban interface ecohydrology in cmr a survey was conducted from across five districts a total of 430 farmers and non farmers were randomly drawn from the rural urban interface households fig 1 after a questionnaire pre test participants were individually interviewed the questionnaire consisted of open ended and closed ended questions in the indonesian language that covered a large range of topics these included household characteristics water sources for basic household requirements and food production access to water related services experiences of water problems assessment of water quality importance and performance of water related services for liveability experiences in the ecohydrological changes in the past 20 years and impacts their concerns about future urbanisation and any strategies to improve sustainable water use in this article we used three rural urban interface indicators from the random rural urban household survey the number of households with access to the drinking water services access to the wastewater treatment services and the number of farmers in the surveyed location to validate the classification results that best captured the true variations of the rural urban interface ecohydrology 3 1 proposed indicators and composite index managing sustainable water resources is affected by complex interconnections between socio cultural and biophysical aspects hiwasaki and arico 2007 further to reach sustainability in water use and rural urban development there is a need to consider multifaceted goals involving water resources biodiversity ecosystem services resilience and cultural heritage wbsrc aspects zalewski et al 2016 considering the wbsrc aspects six proxy indicators were proposed for evaluating ecohydrological condition of a given rural urban interface these six indicators were then used to develop a composite index called ecohydrological state index for rural urban interface esi ru at sub district level six proxy indicators of ecohydrological condition of rural urban interface are defined as follows i proxy indicator of open space distribution pi os this indicator is estimated as the percentage of built up area x ba a proxy to open space distribution in urbanising area indicates the impact of human activities on natural processes water cycle and local climate singh 1998 pamukcu et al 2016 jenerette et al 2011 ii proxy indicator of biodiversity and ecosystem services pi be this indicator is taken as the percentage area of forests water bodies and semi natural area x fws and proportion of agricultural lands x aa determines available natural resources implying rural urban biodiversity water resources ecosystem services including cultural heritage and food production elmqvist et al 2013 janauer 2016 millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 iii proxy indicator of water supply requirement pi ws this indicator is related to population size x ps percentage of population working in agriculture x pa and proportion of villages defined as urban in the 2010 national census within each sub district x uv indicates the need for rural urban water supply moss 2014 simonovic 2009 iv proxy indicator of water quality risk pi wq this indicator is related to population density x pd and proportion of villages defined as urban in the 2010 national census within each sub district x uv that can affect water quality and thus impacts on liveability including health of human and settlement at rural urban interface howard et al 2003 vlahov et al 2007 v proxy indicator of water management capacity pi wm this indicator is related to literacy rate x lr and poverty level x pl influences the capacity of resident for water management vulnerability in dealing with water related extreme events and their resilience janauer 2016 pataki et al 2011 vi proxy indicator of climate change pressure pi cc this indicator is related to the distance x d and travel time x t to city centre determines the commuting needs and accessibility to urban services and indirectly influences climate change and eventually the ecosystem of the area grimm et al 2008 dawson et al 2009 the functional relationship between esi ru and proxy ecohydrological indicators can be expressed by the following equation 1 e s i r u f p i o s p i b e p i w s p i w q p i w m p i c c a framework for the development of esi ru is shown in fig 2 3 2 methodology for calculating esi ru the new regional classifications methodology developed in danielaini et al 2017 part i of this article was employed here for calculating esi ru as mentioned the classification methodology used multivariate univariate and multiple univariate analysis approaches using ibm statistical package for the social science spss version 24 and gis version 10 3 developed by the environmental systems research institute esri the results were mapped by integrating both geographic information system gis and statistical methods to determine optimal classification strategy for rural urban interface ecohydrology a function of the data distribution was assessed using chi square analysis to reveal the underlying characteristics of the statistical distribution from the surveyed rural urban household factor analysis was used to discover the simplest method of interpreting the 11 socio economic and spatial variables related to the six proxy indicators of ecohydrological conditions in this study the principal component analysis was used as an extraction factor to extract maximum variance from the datasets within each component eigenvalues 1 and fixed number of one factor was used as the extraction method factor loading for each component was obtained by performing a rotation method using a common orthogonal technique varimax rotation with kaiser normalisation to minimise the number of variables that had high loadings on each factor the cut off for a statistically meaningful or significant rotated factor loading in this study was applied at 0 60 rural urban ecohydrological conditions in the 45 sub districts within rural urban cmr were analysed using principal component analysis pca given k variables x i x 2 x k each principal component pc is a linear combination of original variables measured x s obtained as 2 p c j i 1 k a i j x i j 1 2 3 k where pc j principal

socio economic and spatial variables with three and one principal components provided high cronbach s alpha 0 80 hence composite index scores in 45 sub districts were calculated from the pca with

three indicators from random rural urban household survey in cmr were used for validation of the regional classification results the first indicator used for this study was farmer participants in the surveyed urban rural areas f this was expected to be highest in the rural areas the second indicator was households with access to public drinking water services d and the third indicator was households with access to public wastewater treatment services w these were expected to be highest in the urban areas the assessments considered the distribution of rural urban households in the rural urban categories h this test was applied to find whether the indicators of rural urban interface ecohydrology were consistent with the surveyed household distributions in the rural urban interface category the result shows that all the p values were found to be less than the significance level 0 05 hence the null hypothesis cannot be accepted table 1 the classification produced by multivariate analysis incorporated a greater proportion of the surveyed households in the urban peri urban transition 34 than other methods however the multivariate analyses did not provide meaningful results as the regional classification through the k means clustering failed to capture the distinctive urban and rural sub districts from the all factors the highest shared variances of the first factor provided the regional classification through the k means clustering that emphasised human activities for a given socio economic conditions hence formulating a regional rural urban interface classification by segmenting variables measured into two or three principal components did not provide an accurate definition of the urban and rural sub districts as a consequence the classification also could not provide accurately the sub districts with intermediate category urban peri urban transition upt and peri urban the 2010 national census identified the greatest proportion 70 of surveyed households being in urban while the rest 30 were rural based on the census classification three indicators of urban and rural ecohydrology were found to be highest in the urban areas these were the proportion of farmers and households with access to public drinking and wastewater treatment services these results show that the classification of rural urban interface used in the census failed to identify not only peri urban characteristics but also rural characteristics critically this demonstrates that the scoring system applied on the 2010 census did not provide methods to define peri urban areas compared to the multivariate analysis the formulation of regional rural urban interface classifications using univariate cluster and multiple univariate cluster analysis with scoring provided more meaningful results the classification of the rural urban interface ecohydrology through jenks natural breaks from spatial built up data and multiple univariate analysis with scoring from 11 variables provided a greater proportion of the surveyed households in the peri urban 50 than other methods the classification of the rural urban interface ecohydrology based on the four best and five best variables provided for a greater proportion of the surveyed households in rural areas than other methods 34 however using the four and five best criteria did not consider the other important factors of distinctive urban and rural sub districts the regional rural urban interface classification based on multiple univariate clusters and scoring to the four best five best and 11 variables yielded higher chi squared values compared to the classifications based on the spatial data and scoring to the nine rural urban interface thresholds higher chi squared values mean higher inconsistency between rural urban interface ecohydrology and distribution of the rural urban interface households based on these results the multiple univariate clusters with scoring to the nine rural urban interface thresholds was proven giving more representative of the distribution of the rural urban interface ecohydrology this classification method provided the best understanding of the evolution of urbanisation and rural urban water related characteristics at the metropolitan level in addition more accurate definitions of urban urban peri urban transition peri urban and rural were obtained through this category hence rural urban classification from the multiple univariate with scoring analysis to nine variables was used for further analysis to define rural urban interface ecohydrology within cmr 4 2 quantifying the state of rural urban interface ecohydrology a total of 11 socio economic and spatial variables were used in the analysis for quantifying rural urban interface ecohydrology in the urban urban peri urban transition upt peri urban and rural sub districts within cmr the kaiser meyer olkin model that measures sampling adequacy was found to be greater than 0 5 0 65 for 11 variables verifying that the datasets were appropriate for the factor analysis with principal components the bartlett s test was also found to be significant p 0 05 three principal components using 11 indicators provided high alpha values 0 80 with a total variance explained of 79 table 2 5 principal component analysis pc i loaded strongly on the increase of proportion of urban villages within a sub district population density built up area and on the decrease of travel time distance to the city centre and population working in agriculture pc ii loaded strongly on the increased poverty level and the decreased literacy rate and built up area pc iii loaded strongly on the increase of forests water bodies and semi natural areas and the decrease of agricultural areas spatial distribution of factor values based on the 11 indicators at 45 sub districts is shown in the map in fig 3 pc i was defined as a principle component that has high correlation with socio economic aspects related to water supply requirement pi ws water quality risks pi wq open space distribution pi os and climate change pressures pi cc pc ii was defined as a principle component that has high correlation with water management capacity or social dimension pi wm implying vulnerable groups regarding water related problems and resilience that are also related to open space distribution pc iii was defined as a principal component that has high correlation with available natural resources biodiversity water and food production pi be spatial distribution pattern of pc i shows that the darkest colour on the maps indicates the highest factor values of the areas the darkest colour as shown in fig 3 a shows the sub districts with the lowest distance travel time and population engaged in agriculture highest percentage of urban villages within sub district population density and built up areas can be defined as more urban in the context of ecohydrology those sub districts with more urban characteristics have higher built up areas implying lower pi os higher population density implying higher pi wq higher urban villages implying higher level of human activities in the village settlements within a sub district and implying higher pi ws and pi wq from urban activities lower travel time and distance to the city centre implying the areas as the centre of social economic activities implying higher pi cc and lower population engage in agriculture implying higher urban activities in non agriculture or higher pi ws for non agricultural activities according to pc i five sub districts in cirebon municipality kejaksan pekalipan kesambi lemahwungkuk and harjamukti and three sub districts in the cirebon regency weru kedawung and gunungjati have dominantly human activities in socio economic aspects implying lower pi os and higher pi ws pi wq and pi cc on the other hand sindangwangi and mandirancang were among the sub districts with distinctive minor human activities in socio economic aspects implying higher pi os and lower pi ws pi wq and pi cc spatial distribution pattern of pc ii shows that the darkest colour on the maps indicates the sub districts with the highest poverty level and the lowest literacy rate hence the sub districts with the darker colour as shown in fig 3 b can be defined as more rural this pc ii has lower variance in explaining rural urban characteristics in the cmr compared to the pc i however it can explain more in the context of ecohydrology those sub districts with more urban characteristics have lower poverty level and higher literacy rate implying higher pi wm or lower vulnerability and higher resilience regarding water related problems according to pc ii five sub districts in kuningan regency mandirancang pasawahan pancalang cilimus and cigandamekar and four sub districts in cirebon municipality kejaksan pekalipan kesambi and lemahwungkuk have more urban characteristics while kapetakan and gebang were among sub districts with more rural characteristics critical area with lower pi wm implying higher vulnerability or lower resilience regarding water related problems within cmr was found in the cirebon regency particularly in the coastal sub districts rural urban pattern from pc iii are considerably different than pcs i and ii the darkest colour shows the highest proportion of forests water bodies and semi natural areas and the lowest proportion of agricultural areas this pc iii has the lowest variance in explaining rural urban characteristic in the cmr but it can explain more in the context of ecohydrology those sub districts with darker colour show higher availability of natural resources biodiversity and water but lower food production s activities while those sub districts with lighter colour show lower availability of natural resources biodiversity and water but higher food production s activities according to pc iii sukagumiwang indramayu regency and most sub districts in the north part of the cmr such as klangenan susukan plered suranenggala and kapetakan were among sub districts with lower natural resources and water availability but higher food production s activities on the other hand those in the south part of the cmr such as harjamukti cirebon municipality cilimus and pasawahan kuningan regency karangsembung and dukupuntang cirebon regency and sindangwangi majalengka regency were among sub districts with higher pi be 6 the state of ecohydrology based on esi ru the results of quantifying the state of rural urban interface ecohydrology using the three principal components are shown in table 3 three of the eight urban sub districts have very high value of esi ru1 in socio economic aspects 0 91 namely harjamukti kejaksan and kesambi while the rest urban sub districts have high esi ru1 0 76 0 90 harjamukti is the only urban sub district within cmr that still has a moderate availability of natural resources and food production pi be with a esi ru3 value of 0 72 while the rest urban sub districts have very low pi be with esi ru3 values 0 50 in fact harjamukti is the place for urban newcomers for finding residential areas close to the city centre a high dynamic change in land use from farmlands to housing settlement areas in the past decade can be seen in harjamukti among sub districts in the city harjamukti has the largest size in population and total area furthest distance from the city centre but lowest size in density and built up areas implying highest pi ws highest pi cc lowest pi wq and highest pi os however among urban sub districts harjamukti also has the lowest capacity in water management pi wm with a esi ru2 value 0 64 while other urban sub districts in the cirebon city have higher pi wm with esi ru2 values 0 5 currently most urban dwellers in the cirebon city 80 have access to the gravity flow water systems of pdam a formal local drinking water company at the district level that was transmitted from kuningan district pasawahan sub district peri urban category within cmr however harjamukti s residents have problems in accessing the public water system services because the topography of harjamukti is comparably higher than other sub districts in the cirebon city the higher topography has made the pdam facing problem in distribution of water supply using gravity system to that area further higher potential decrease of open space distribution in the harjamukti as the higher potential increase of housing and human settlement will give more challenges to the future fulfilment of water supply requirement sub districts that are located in the cirebon district adjacent to the city and linked with the arterial roads or toll roads such as kedawung weru and plumbon have shown similar characteristics with urban sub districts in the city sub districts in the peripheral city in the category of urban peri urban transition upt areas also have a high value of esi ru1 in socio economic aspects such as gunungjati 0 92 sumber 0 81 astanajapura 0 80 and mundu 0 78 but lower capacity in water management esi ru2 than those in the urban category 0 64 sub districts located further from the city showed different characteristics arjawinangun is the only sub districts in the peri urban category with a moderate value of esi ru1 in socio economic aspects while the rest peri urban districts and all rural districts have low values of esi ru1 0 6 further sub districts located in the foothill of mount ciremai such as sindangwangi rural sub district majalengka pasawahan and cilimus peri urban sub districts kuningan have high values of esi ru2 in water management capacity and esi ru3 in natural resource availability mean values of esi ru in the rural urban categories within cmr are shown in table 4 in general urban and upt sub districts in the cmr have significant higher value of esi ru1 in socio economic aspects compared to the peri urban and rural sub districts implying significant higher non open space areas or lower pi os higher pi ws higher pi wq and higher pi cc urban dwellers in the cmr also had significant lower value of esi ru2 related to water management capacity compared to the dwellers that lived in the non urban sub districts implying higher pi wm or significant lower vulnerable groups regarding water related problems and resilience however rural urban sub districts in the cmr commonly have very low value of esi ru3 for natural resources availability except sub districts in kuningan in particular urban sub districts mostly have insignificant lower pi be compared to the upt peri urban and rural sub districts spatial distributions of the three ecohydrological state indexes for rural urban interface esi ru1 esi ru2 and esi ru3 in the rural urban interface sub districts within cmr are presented in figs 4 6 table 5 shows the ranks of esi ru values for ecohydrological state in the cmr the rank of esi ru depicts rural urban interface ecohydrology and provides a systematic pattern of ecohydrological changes that is considerably fit with the rural urban interface classification based on nine variables additional two variables availability of agricultural areas and natural resources provided higher scores of esi ru in plumbon and cigandamekar that was respectively positioned in the rank of scores for urban peri urban transition and rural sub districts the construction of esi ru weighed highly on the proportion of built up areas population density proportion of population working in agriculture and distance to city centre higher scores of esi ru represent higher open space distribution pi os or smaller extent of impervious areas lower water quality risks pi wq higher water supply reqirement pi ws for agricultural activities and lower climate change pressures pi cc as situated further from city while lower scores of esi ru represent the opposite based on the values of esi ru all urban sub districts have very low values showing low capacity in providing ecosystem services for urban liveability and regional sustainability because population density in those sub districts is high but they have very low pi os the lowest esi ru 0 25 were obtained for pekalipan 0 00 kejaksan 0 12 kesambi 0 19 and lemahwungkuk 0 21 implying lowest pi os highest pi wq lowest pi ws for agricultural activities and highest pi cc the scores that were weighted highly on built up areas or pi os also show that those urban sub districts have lowest capacity in providing protection of ecohydrological processes and potential conservation of biodiversity maintaining air and water quality or improving the local microclimate in fact the city is currently dependent on peri urban ecosystem for providing natural resources including water and food the highest value of esi ru 0 91 were obtained from losari 0 93 gebang 0 94 and sukagumiwang 1 00 implying highest pi os lowest pi wq highest pi ws for agricultural activities and lowest pi cc the development of esi ru from pca with one dimension solution however provided low weight from indicators implying water management capacity and ecosystem services in natural resource availability and food production activities hence more accurate ecohydrological state at the rural urban interface within cmr can be obtained from the pca with three dimension solutions 7 discussions 7 1 quantifying rural urban interface ecohydrology for planning this study was conducted at a metropolitan region in a developing country with a population of the core city less than 500 000 residents according to cohen 2006 smaller cities and towns under half a million should be put more attention in the development agenda of urban future because compared to large cities they have very significant total population faster growth considerably underserved basic services higher poverty and weaker local government capacity moreover in developing countries water distribution systems and public sanitation services in cities are typically inadequate for instance in the cmr as a focus area of this study the coverage of sewerage system services is still less than 5 while the service coverage of public water services in the districts surrounding city is still less than 25 of the political boundary wjp mdm 2013 this will lead to more challenges to improve basic services in the areas that directly affected by urban expansion also without sufficient wastewater treatment facilities urban residents will face severe environmental health as cities will discharge increasing amount of waste into freshwater bodies threatening water quality and aquatic ecosystem before the service gap and environmental degradation level become too overwhelming as it is going on in larger cities small cities have a time to address the need of urban residents for basic infrastructures and ecosystem services for shaping healthy and friendly city and its outskirts in this study socio economic and spatial data were used as new indices for assessing ecohydrological potential or defining rural urban interfaces ecohydrology a systematic pattern can be found from esi ru values implying ecohydrological processes and potential in the rural urban interfaces including in the peri urban zones urbanisation transforms rural land uses of agriculture or forestry into urban land uses that are characterised by a large extent of built up area high population density and less proportion of residents engaged in agriculture land use practices in the urban zones showed that sub districts in the city boundary such as pekalipan kejaksan and kesambi have limited open space distributions or a large extense of impervious areas very high population density implying high water quality risks high water supply requirement for non agricultural activities and high climate change pressures in addition this study showed that peri urban sub districts closed to the city have been directely affected by the urban expansion more human activities in socio economic aspects in the urban peri urban transition upt zone indicate more basic services for healthy housing and human settlement will be required besides more efforts for maintaining peri urban ecosystem services water demands related with land use practices and urbanisation alters rural urban landscape structures causing stresses to ecosystems and impacts on water quantity and quality foley et al 2005 sun and lockaby 2012 currently peri urban areas are not recognised as integral part of the functional activities of urban growth in the context of urban water management peri urbanisation brings particular challenges in quantifying and qualifying the impacts of urban spaces on natural processes for managing water quality dynamics mcgrane 2016 this issue is closely related to the boundary between urban and rural areas that is moving outwards the main city as the population grows in the urban and regional planning context peri urban zone is a part of spatial categories in the metropolitan development this area deserves specific planning and management as highlighted also by wandl and magoni 2017 peri urban areas ask for particular attention and distinctive policy approaches as they are not simply the extension of the urban in the rural areas defining rural urban interface ecohydrology including peri urban zone would be beneficial in the planning for developing rural urban strategy related to water people and environment for better liveability and sustainability 7 2 integrating ecohydrology in urban planning urbanisation drives environmental changes at multiple scales from the local land use and cover regional hydrosystems to the global biogeochemical cycles and climate grimm et al 2008 sun and lockaby 2012 foley et al 2005 converting rural lands into urban uses will bring impacts on watershed ecosystem health and sustainability issues sun and lockaby 2012 landscape processes in the rural urban catchments are being transformed in different ways by human activities in the study area high built up environment in the cities accounts for less open spaces such as parks and gardens farmlands forest and nature reserves open spaces are dominated by a natural environment less open spaces in the city means limited continuity and functionality of the ecosystems and survival of natural and landscape values maruani and amit cohen 2007 in particular the development of peri urban areas that involves the conversion of rural areas into a changing mix of urban and rural activities and functions can affect ecohydrological functioning influencing water and land management and food production in the peri urban areas maheshwari et al 2016 thus planning for balanced urban development and an integrated approach that can address in the provision of ecosystem services and the maintenance of quality of life within a river basin such as ecohydrology are required in the context of balanced urban development place people and planning in the peri urban zone need to be considered as well maheshwari et al 2016 in the context of ecohydrology sustainable water management improves future s cities health and functional integration of peri urban ecosystems into urban development enhances absorbing capacities of urban ecosystems zalewski and wagner 2008 in this case regional planning will provide a comprehensive visualisation of the possible flow of waters services and population within a defined rural urban area for optimum liveability sustainability as concluded by mackaye 1940 regional planning is applied human ecology hence the scale of planning activities is a region that commonly contains one major city and has a single macroclimate providing a region wide control over the soils ecosystems and natural processes forman 2014 in the context of regional planning designing a land that effectively complement ecological reliability with basic human needs will only be accomplished with a healthy landscape and regional ecosystem forman 2014 the harmony between environment and society in the rural urban interfaces can be supported by applying ecohydrological system approach to the regulation of the interplay between water and ecosystem zalewski and wagner 2008 a systematic method for identifying and evaluation of land that is most suitable for open space distributions is required for combining metropolitan growth with a network of open spaces that would not only protect natural processes but also could be used for amenity and recretion mcharg 2014 maruani and amit cohen 2007 ecohydrology eh provides a transdisciplinary approach and systemic framework to regulate hydrology ecosystem and society interplay to reduce the impacts of floods and droughts improve human well being and harmonise ecosystem potential with societal needs zalewski 2010 furthermore as mentioned by zalewski 2007 ecohydrology is a problem solving science that emphasises in regulation of processes through effective management of the water and nutrient dynamics from the landscape to aquatic ecosystems ecohydrological considerations can also help to promote integration of ecology with hydrology to solve issues surrounding water environment and people to achieve its ultimate goal for the sustainable management of river basins zalewski et al 2008 the three principles of eh not only provide a framework for its implementation but also for harmonisation of eh measures with hydro technical infrastructures zalewski 2000 ecohydrological principles can be implemented at various scales through the development of integrative scientific methods in this study the first principle of eh was applied for quantifying ecohydrological processes by using 11 socio economic and spatial data as ecohydrological proxy indicators at a landscape scale to understand rural urban interface structures relationships and patterns in a developing coastal metropolitan region in indonesia yet to achieve the goals of ecohydrological sustainability further study to quantify water quality and water quantity at the river basin and the use of this understanding in the planning and environmental management is required for sustainable water use in the rural urban interfaces there is also a need for more studies to understand the impacts of urban sprawl to the wellbeing of people in the peri urban areas or liveability and balanced urban development the question still remains about how to overcome the separation of urban and rural function in the current development approach and to combine planning approach at five districts within cmr in the context of metropolitan region efforts are needed to harmonise policies and institutions during spatial planning and for their integration at basin level in indonesia the spatial planning law 26 2007 provides guidance how spatial planning need to be implemented to support the water sector and the need for national and provincial plans to follow planning requirements at the district level such as 30 space requirement for forest in districts and 30 open space requirement in cities however currently the short and long term spatial planning both at the regional and national levels pay little attention to water resource management asian development bank 2016 therefore the inadequate support within regional and national governments for water sector in the allocation of required budget hampers the goal of integrated water resource management thus affecting future water security and sustainability of urbanising areas in indonesia 8 conclusions this study demonstrated that a total of 11 socio economic and spatial variables can be used for quantifying ecohydrological state of the urban urban peri urban transition upt peri urban and rural sub districts within cmr out of these variables six proxy ecohydrological indicators open space distribution pios biodiversity and ecosystem services pibe water supply requirement piws water quality risk piwq water management capacity piwm climate change pressure picc were identified and a composite index called ecohydrological state index for rural urban interface esi ru was developed based on these indicators and esi ru the first pattern emerged showed a distinctive elements of rural urban interface ecohydrology related to open spaces distribution water supply requirement water quality risks and climate change pressures the second pattern for the rural urban interface ecohydrology emerged was related to the water management capacity of the residents and third pattern was about the availability of natural resources food production activities biodiversity and ecosystem services the results of quantifying ecohydrological state in the cmr show that the esi ru values from pca with three dimensional solutions provide more accurate results than the one dimensional solution while the typology classifications in this study are unique to the cirebon metropolitan region the methodology relies on publicly available data from the government and google maps and therefore the methodology developed in this study could be replicated in other metropolitan areas in indonesia and elsewhere overall the index esi ru developed in this study can assist in the planning for balanced urban development at a regional scale with an integrated approach that can include the provision of ecosystem services and the maintenance of quality of life in urbanising areas within river basins conflict of interest none declared ethical

in shardara reservoir southern kazakhstan was investigated in summer 2015 the development of macrophytes in the water area significantly affected the species diversity of zooplankton copepoda avoided places with high concentrations of polyphosphates from detergents but gained a competitive advantage on water areas polluted by β hcch the most favorable conditions for cladocera represented mostly by daphnia galeata were formed on parts of the reservoir with high content of phosphates nitrites zinc and accumulation of green algae cladocera avoided waters with a high content of lead copper and cadmium statistical maps of distribution of δ shannon clarke s w statistics and average individual mass did not reveal any certain relations with environmental variables which we attribute to the complex nature of the shardara reservoir s pollution a strong relationship between the δ shannon and clarke s w statistics parameters was found it was found that δ shannon is easily calculated and can be used for the zooplankton community structure description keywords zooplankton biological indicators environmental factors statistics distribution maps 1 introduction aquatic invertebrates are good indicators of the ecological status of the water bodies the diversity composition and number of dominant species the proportion of rotifera cladocera calanoida and cyclopoida in the total quantitative parameters of zooplankton are indicative andronikova 1996 jeppesen et al 2011 ochocka and pasztaleniec 2016 rotifera are the most diverse in the eutrophic water bodies crustaceans in the mesotrophic ponds of poland kuczyńska kippen and joniak 2016 with an increase of trophic status of water bodies the number of dominant species in zooplankton communities decreases whereas the abundance of rotifera and cladocera grows as does the ratio of cyclopoida s biomass to calanoida s andronikova 1996 xue et al 2014 in contrast with these results the rotifera abundance declined during the eutrophication of lakes in poland leaving more space for cladocera and copepoda adamczuk et al 2015 the authors of this paper found that daphnia longispina o f mueller and monospilus dispar g o sars prefer waters with elevated n nh4 cyclops kolensis lilljeborg and cyclops strenuus fischer correlate with a rising gradient in p po4 adamczuk et al 2015 kuchko et al 2015 among other things eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems leads to decrease of the average mass of individual specie andronikova 1996 as the trophicity of a reservoir increases large species such as cladocera and calanoida are eliminated from zooplankton communities comprised of small eurybiont species adamczuk et al 2015 kuchko et al 2015 toxic pollution as well as eutrophication lead to a decrease of stenobiont species which in turn is reflected in the reduction of zooplankton diversity vandysh 2004 rotifers are the most tolerant to heavy metal contamination gagneten and paggi 2009 specimens with morphological abnormalities are present in populations of copepods in conditions of chronic toxic pollution of water bodies krupa 2005 2008 2012 comparison of biomass curves and abundance curves abc method may have an indicative value in assessing the ecological state of water bodies warwick 1986 biological parameters such as clarke s w statistics are based on the mutual arrangement of biomass and abundance curves clarke 1990 positive values of clarke s w statistics indicate that the biomass curve is above the abundance curve according to warwick 1986 this arrangement of curves is typical for natural habitats when stress increases the abundance and biomass curves change the location and clarke s w statistics becomes negative the presence of macrophytes is proved as one of the essential factors that determine the composition and quantitative parameters of zooplankton communities kuczyńska kippen and nagengast 2016 kuczyńska kippen and joniak 2016 du et al 2014 it has been shown that the prevailing species of macrophytes in shallow macrophyte lakes affect horizontal distribution the abundance of bacteria flagellates ciliates and crustaceans and the predator prey ratio mieczan et al 2016 thus the presence and abundance of macrophytes must be taken into account when analyzing the horizontal distribution of biological parameters across the water area the structure of zooplankton communities can be used to assess the ecological status of both the water body as a whole and its individual parts vandysh 2004 this is especially true for large water bodies polluted from point and scattered sources to assess the ecological status of different parts of large water bodies it seems advisable to construct maps of the spatial distribution of the analyzed parameters barinova et al 2016 data visualization also makes it possible to identify potential sources of pollution of the reservoir and its individual parts the shardara reservoir was formed in 1965 and represents one of the largest fisheries and irrigation water bodies of kazakhstan the surface area of the reservoir at full filling is 780sq km irrigation water withdrawal causes a reduction of water surface area from spring to autumn for approximately three times the anthropogenic impact on the water body is due to its location in an area of intensive farming and industrial activities primarily the shardara reservoir is polluted by nutrients pesticides and heavy metals amirgaliev 2007 the highest concentrations of these substances in the reservoir water had been recorded until the mid 90s of the last century the quantity of fertilizers in agricultural use decreased in the following years of economic recession in kazakhstan this led to an improvement of the ecological situation in the region lopareva and amirgaliev 1973 amirgaliev et al 1995 amirgaliev 2007 for the present the area of irrigated land is being expanded and the industry within the catchment area of the shardara reservoir grows this necessitates monitoring the ecological state of the shardara reservoir unstable hydrological regime the influx of contaminants from the collector drainage surface runoff and river water transit together with the hydrophysical parameters in the arid climate conditions cause significant differences in the spatial conditions for the existence of aquatic fauna of the shardara reservoir information on the structure of zooplankton in shardara reservoir is given in the previously published works malinovskaya and ten 1983 kiseleva 1997 krupa et al 2009 balymbetov 2013 the diversity of summer time zooplankton reached 38 77 species the abundance of zooplankton varied within the range of 100 0 139 2thous spec m 3 on account of the above mentioned papers the biomass of zooplankton was 0 6 2 4gm 3 rotifera was dominant by abundance sometimes in conjunction with copepoda cladocera was dominant by biomass the zooplankton structure changed with a decrease of the water level in the reservoir from summer to autumn krupa et al 2009 the calanoida species had disappeared from the zooplankton composition by autumn the smaller species of cyclopoida dominated the water body the average individual mass of a specimen decreased from 0 0224mg in the spring summer period to 0 0089mg in the autumn so according to the above mentioned research changes in the structure of zooplankton communities indicated an intensifying eutrophication of the reservoir from summer to autumn during 2003 2005 information on the spatial distribution of the zooplankton in the shardara reservoir due to external factors is absent in the published works the present work fills the gap the purpose of this study is to analyze the spatial distribution of zooplankton in connection with macrophyte nutrient content in water organic polyphosphates organochlorine pesticides and heavy metals as indicative biological parameters the following were selected species richness abundance biomass of taxonomic groups rotifera cladocera copepoda facultative inhabitants of the water column and total zooplankton values of shannon index clarke s w statistics here we also observe the relationship between the values of clarke s w statistics and the parameter introduced by us earlier δ shannon krupa and barinova 2016 krupa et al 2016 the analysis of all data is based on statistically generated maps this method makes it possible to compare the distribution of zooplankton and abiotic indicators across the water area of the reservoir mapping of data shows the confinement of the abiotic indicators to the potential sources of pollution of the reservoir besides widely accepted comparative statistical methods do not always give comprehensive results whereas statistically constructed maps have not only integrated but also prognostic properties 2 study site description the shardara water reservoir is located in one of the most densely populated areas of kazakhstan with have developed agriculture and industry its length is up to 80km at maximum filling with a maximum width of 25km the reservoir is elongated from north west to south east fig 1 the right bank is leveled composed of loose sandy clay and clay loam with steep underwater ledges the left bank is flat dissected with bays and coves the reservoir is fed by the waters of the syrdarya and keles rivers the grounds are dominated by gray silt with sand and clay close to syrdarya river additionally there is fine detritus the arid climate and irrigation purpose of the reservoir conditions significant interannual and seasonal fluctuations in water level during the period of the study in 2015 the eastern shallow part of the reservoir has been drained and the water area was about a quarter less than the maximum fig 1 the black line 3 materials and methods the research of zooplankton the content of biogenic elements heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides in the water was carried out by means of a grid of 13 stations in june 2015 fig 1 the measures of the temperature and ph values of the surface water layers were taken during field trip by using hanna hi 98129 instruments water transparency was measured with secchi disk coordinate referencing of the stations was done by garmin etrex gps navigator a total of 42 water samples were taken 13 samples for each type of analysis in order to determine the content of nutrients nitrites nitrates ammonium phosphates as well as organic polyphosphates heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides the samples for heavy metals were fixed in the site by adding nitric acid samples for nutrients were fixed with chloroform all collected samples were transported to the laboratory in an icebox 13 samples of zooplankton were selected using a juday net with a diameter of 12cm by pulling it from the bottom to the surface the degree of overgrowth of the water area by soft macrophytes was estimated through visual observations in percentage to analyze the distribution of macrophytes the program statistica 12 0 was used conventional methods of chemical analysis of water were used semenova 1977 fomin 1995 water samples were analyzed in three to four repetitions the error of estimate for major ions in the water was 0 5 5 depending on the analyte heavy metal measuring was performed by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma by using agilent 7500 a manufactured by agilent technologies usa national standard rk iso 17294 2 2006 the device allows for the detection of the various chemical elements in complex matrices including those in the sea and gray water and in the biological objects in micro trace quantities abundance sensitivity of agilent 7500 a low mass 5 10 7 high mass 1 10 7 organochlorine pesticides were measured by gas liquid and high performance liquid chromatography klisenko et al 1992 dolzhenko 2008 bankina et al 2002 test sensitivity is 10 5 mcg the detection threshold is 0 002mgdm 3 of the sample zooplankton samples were processed by standard methods winberg and lavrenteva 1984 in the laboratory each sample was diluted to a volume of 50 150ml and 3 subsamples each of 1ml were analyzed in these subsamples all individuals of the species were counted with the use of microscope mbs 10 and мсх 300 in order to take into account rare and large species each sample was thoroughly observed when calculating the individual mass of zooplankters the equations of linear mass dependence were applied the abundance and biomass of taxonomic groups and total zooplankton was calculated per 1m3 of water balushkina and winberg 1979 the species of planktonic invertebrates were carried out according to guides to the identification rilov 1948 kutikova 1970 tsalolihin 1995 krupa et al 2016a in order to characterize the zooplankton structure we found the total number of species abundance biomass of taxonomic groups and that of community the value of the average individual mass of specimen the composition and number of dominant species according to abundance and biomass the diversity index of shannon bi bitmg 1 and shannon ab bitindividuals 1 magurran 1998 as well as arithmetic difference between the two versions of the index δ shannon were calculated the calculation of the index values of shannon and w statistic clarke clarke 1990 was performed using the program primer 5 cluster analysis and dendrites of similarity were calculated with graphs program novakovsky 2004 nonparametric correlation analysis and spatial mapping in wafer plots was done on statistica 12 0 4 results 4 1 environmental variables the depth of reservoir during sampling period was varied from 2 8 to 15 0m as a result of reduction of the reservoir s level at beginning of june 2015 the maximum water transparency was recorded in the northwest area near the dam table 1 the water temperature ranged from 25 6 to 30 7 c reaching maximum in the shallows water ph varied only slightly the grounds are dominated by gray silt with sand and clay there is fine detritus close to syrdarya river additionally macrophytes are sporadically developed in the reservoir fig 2 the composition and abundance of macrophytes is insufficiently investigated but it is known that there are clumps of potamogeton natans l in the coastal zone and along the northeastern shore strips of potamogeton malajanus l total dissolved solids tds of water averaged 1055mgdm 3 with a predominance of sulfate and sodium ions the content of biogenic compounds was low table 1 among organochlorine pesticides the β hcch were present throughout the water area the content of heavy metals and organic polyphosphates in the water varied across the lake area by one or two orders of its magnitude 4 2 spatial distribution of nutrients and toxicants the lower third of the water area as well as the narrow area along the coasts of the right bank were characterized by elevated concentrations of nitrates and phosphates fig 3 a and b indicating the relation with the incoming river flow the highest concentration of ammonia was detected in the central part fig 3d fig 3c shows the relationship of nitrates with collector drainage water inflow that comes to the arnasay bay fig 1 from irrigated fields along the southwestern shore of the reservoir two peaks of hcch isomers content in the water have been revealed in the eastern part and near the south western shore of the reservoir fig 4a the content of polyphosphates in the water varied within a small range decreasing in the direction from the east to the shallow northwestern deep part of the reservoir fig 4b the recorded peaks in their concentrations suggest that the main source of polyphosphates is the river runoff whereas of hcch isomers can be river and drainage runoff the map of zinc distribution also pointed at the relation with river inflow fig 5a while the maximum concentrations of copper fig 5b were associated with the areas affected by the drainage runoff the highest concentrations of lead and cadmium were found in the central part of the waters fig 5c and d 4 3 general characteristics of zooplankton zooplankton was represented by 60 species among them rotifera being presented by 37 species cladocera by 11 copepoda by 6 the facultative inhabitants of the water column by 6 widespread in the water area were rotifers synchaeta stylata wierzejski s vorax rousselet polyarthra sp keratella cochlearis gosse pompholyx sulcata gosse cladocerans daphnia galeata sars leptodora kindtii focke diaphanosoma mongolianum ueno copepods thermocyclops taihokuensis harada and acanthocyclops trajani mirabdullayev defaye zooplankton abundance averaged 92 9 34 0thous ind m 3 their biomass reaching 966 0 468 0mgm 3 the copepods and rotifers were formed in equal proportion of 48 2 50 1 of zooplankton abundance quantitative parameters of cladocerans were low 1 0thous ind m 3 and 0 07mgm 3 on average biomass was predominantly formed by copepods mostly cyclops a trajani the distribution of planktonic invertebrates according to their abundance was more even 2 24 0 13bitindividual 1 than according to the biomass 1 23 0 14bitmg 1 which was reflected in the negative δ shannon 1 00 0 15 the dominance of rotifers and young stages of copepods resulted in low values of the average individual mass of specimen 0 0082 0 0016mg negative values of clarce s w statistic 0 134 0 013 evidenced the abundance curve being above the biomass curve 4 4 the spatial distribution of zooplankton nonparametric correlation analysis revealed that rotifera has made the main contribution to the total species richness of the community r 0 983 p 0 05 analysis of the spatial distribution showed that against the backdrop of the total species richness increasing near the south western coast fig 6a the highest species number of rotifera and cladocera fig 6b and c was identified in the south western and north eastern parts of the waters where macrophytes well developed as demonstrated in fig 2 the increase in the species richness of zooplankton was due to rotifers brachionus angularis gosse b budapestinensis daday k cochlearis gosse keratella tropica reducta fadeev testudinella patina hermann s stylata wierz polyarthra sp cladocerans d galeata sars d mongolianum uéno simocephalus mixtus sars ilyocryptus sp on the water areas overgrown with macrophytes spatial distribution of copepoda s species richness was somewhat different fig 6d this group was presented by the most species number in the wide area along the southern and southwestern coasts as well as in the eastern shallow areas where macrophytes developed and that is affected by syrdarya river runoff the number of copepoda species decreased in the central part of the reservoir in which were reported highest concentrations of cadmium and lead fig 5c and d comparative analysis of zooplankton species composition identified three clusters within the water area at the level of 50 similarity fig 7a cluster 1 represents communities on stations 2 and 4 where the water depths were about 10 15m zooplankton on these areas was comprised of 18 and 10 species respectively most of the water area with similar species composition of planktonic invertebrates formed cluster 2 with two sub clusters first sub cluster 2a included the communities of deep non overgrown or slightly overgrown areas of the reservoir with 9 15 species adjacent to the station 5 where macrophytes developed and where the diversity of community was the highest 31 species the diversity of zooplankton communities in sub cluster 2a was determined by macrophytes that serve as an edificators and provide shelter for aquatic invertebrates as well as by other factors so wastewater discharged into the arnasay bay affect the entire southwestern part of the reservoir and especially stations 2 5 fig 1 the second sub cluster 2b combined the stations of eastern shallow part of the reservoir with macrophytes coverage about 50 90 and the number of planktonic invertebrates ranging from 16 to 22 species dendrite of zooplankton species composition overlapping was built by ward s method based on euclidean distance fig 7b shows that two communities stations 3 and 10 include the largest number of species from communities of other parts of the area and can be marked as faunal cores for the reservoir zooplankton so the deepest non overgrown station 3 was most characteristic of zooplankton from exposed parts of the reservoir whereas the shallow station 10 had the maximum number of planktonic invertebrates from habitats overgrown by macrophytes remarkably station 3 also served as floristic core for phytoplankton in the shardara reservoir barinova and krupa 2017 the spatial distribution of zooplankton quantitative parameters has been uneven the highest abundance and biomass of zooplankton fig 8 including rotifers and facultative inhabitants of the water column fig 9 are recorded near the southwestern coast arnasay bay fig 1 while their values show significantly lower abundance in largest part of the water area three unequal peaks of the copepod abundance fig 9 were revealed the first was in the most pronounced being in the southwestern part with low concentrations of polyphosphates and β hcch content up to 0 005mcgdm 3 fig 4 two smaller peaks were in the eastern and central parts of the reservoir where as shown in fig 4 were elevated concentrations of hcch isomers and low content of polyphosphates the spatial distribution of abundance and biomass of cladocera is most important because this group is most sensitive to the toxic contamination fig 10 the highest biomass of crustaceans was registered in the eastern part of the reservoir which is affected by the runoff from syrdarya and keles rivers and is characterized by the highest content of phosphates nitrites fig 3 and zinc fig 5a cladocerans formed the high abundance in the widest part of the reservoir at the eastern part with elevated concentrations of the above mentioned substances and the adjacent southern part comparison of the distribution maps additionally revealed that cladocerans fig 10 avoided waters with elevated concentrations of copper lead and cadmium fig 5c and d but we do not revealed statistically significant relationships between the parameters the values of the shannon index varied across the water surface from 1 00 to 2 69bitindividuals 1 shannon ab and from 0 34 to 2 26bitmg 1 shannon bi fig 11 illustrates how the values of shannon bi index bitmg 1 varied out of phase with the value of average individual mass clarke s w statistic and δ shannon showed similar spatial distribution with both shannon indices reaching maximum values in the central part of the reservoir and in the area along the northeastern coast fig 12 5 discussion 5 1 distribution of abiotic parameters in june 2015 the averaged total dissolved solids tds corresponds the brackish water guseva 2002 the content of nutrients table 1 did not exceed maximum permissible standards mpc for fisheries kimstach 1993 bespamyatnov and krotov 1985 the β hcch were present throughout the water area which is considered unacceptable for fishery water bodies the content of heavy metals in the water exceeded the mpc for fisheries kimstach 1993 bespamyatnov and krotov 1985 polyphosphates have wide application in the food industry and are dissolved components of the detergents that get into the reservoir in particular with water of keles river whose shores accommodate many settlements and one of the largest resorts in kazakhstan saryagash their content in the reservoir water did not exceed mpc for fisheries guseva 2002 during our investigations based on the statistically constructed distribution maps we can conclude that the nitrites phosphates polyphosphates and zinc enters the reservoir water predominantly with river waters copper and nitrates with a collector drainage discharge β hcch isomers from both sources the maximum concentrations of ammonia lead cadmium and copper were recorded in central and northwestern parts of the reservoir indicating the dispersed nature of their entry into the water 5 2 species richness of zooplankton species richness of zooplankton of the shardara reservoir in summer 2015 60 species was at the level corresponding to that of summer 2004 2005 61 64 species but lower than in 2003 77 species krupa 2007 dendrite of zooplankton similarity fig 7b evidenced that in 2015 the waters of the reservoir was divided into two large parts the deepest non overgrown part and shallow one where macrophytes developed to a varying degree maps of spatial distribution of the species richness for planktonic invertebrates brought us to similar conclusions the greatest number of species mainly represented by rotifers and copepods belonged to zooplankton on shallow overgrown areas of the shardara reservoir located in the eastern south western and northern parts figs 2 and 6 our earlier work revealed the same trend in the distribution of species richness of planktonic invertebrates peaking in the eastern shallow part krupa 2007 the connection between zooplankton species richness mainly represented by rotifers and the macrophytes that provides safe place for planktonic invertebrates kuczyńska kippen and nagengast 2016 has been recorded in the lakes of middle reaches of yangtze river china du et al 2014 and the ponds of western poland kuczyńska kippen and joniak 2016 5 3 the abundance and biomass of zooplankton the abundance and biomass of zooplankton in 2015 was 1 2 1 5 times lower in comparison to data from 2004 to 2005 but higher than in summer 2003 0 64gm 3 krupa et al 2009 zooplankton reached the highest abundance and biomass in the 1981 1996 about 255 7thous ind m 3 and 4 2gm 3 on average kiseleva 1997 krupa et al 2009 against the background of heavy pollution of the reservoir and unfavorable hydrological regime the influence of the hydrological regime on zooplankton communities can be associated with two main factors reducing the water level leads to an increase in the overall level of contamination of the reservoir as a result high biomass of zooplankton is formed due to several dominant species krupa et al 2009 the second factor is the reduction of the area of shallow water overgrown with macrophytes as shown in the example of the shallow ponds in poland fluctuations in the water level affect the species diversity and biomass of macrophytes kuczyńska kippen et al

joniak 2016 5 4 zooplankton species richness quantitative and environmental parameters relationship although copepoda is adapted to polluted environment gagneten and paggi 2009 braginsky et al 1987 when affected by cadmium and lead fig 5c and d their species richness fig 6 decreased due to the absence of calanoida cyclops t taihokuensis and a trajani only being more resistant to external factors than calanoida remained in contaminated areas comparison of distribution maps of zooplankton s quantitative and environmental parameters figs 4 and 9 showed that copepods avoided places with high concentrations of polyphosphates but gained a competitive advantage in water areas polluted with β hcch the dominant role here was belonged to cyclops a trajani as the typical component of zooplankton in polluted water bodies of kazakhstan krupa 2008 the better conditions for cladocera fig 10 represented mostly by d galeata were formed on parts of the reservoir with high content of phosphates nitrites fig 3 and zinc fig 5a zinc maximizing at 0 56mgdm 3 table 1 did not have a negative impact on cladocerans as ions of this metal rapidly leave the body of crustaceans through molting muyssen and janssen 2002 however serves the association of green algae accumulations to the same areas of the water fig 13 can be one of the major regulating factors green algae are the preferred food items for daphnia gasiunaite and olenina 1998 and also have mechanisms of detoxification from heavy metals macfie and welbourn 2000 the decrease in the shannon ab values bitindividual 1 took place against the backdrop of reduction in species richness of copepods as reflected in figs 6 and 12 it is consistent with the findings regarding the relation of shannon ab values and the number of species in the community krupa 2012 kuchko et al 2015 mutually opposed spatial dynamics between shannon bi values bitmg 1 and the average individual mass of specimen fig 12 demonstrated the negative relationship between these parameters whose statistical significance has been previously shown for phytoplankton barinova and chekryzheva 2014 and zooplankton krupa 2012 of various water bodies this implies that with the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and reduction in size of community organisms the values of shannon bi index bitmg 1 will increase as opposed to previously assumed andronikova 1996 it can be dependent with the pollution level and correct for the low pollutant impacts we presented the nonlinearity of changes in shannon bi index bit mg 1 in a gradient of anthropogenic load on the lakes and reservoirs of kazakhstan krupa 2010 2011 increase in the shannon ab index values bit individual 1 along with rising trophic status of lakes from ultra oligotrophic to oligotrophic kuchko et al 2015 is an indirect confirmation of this phenomenon zooplankton structure has an integral feature such as dimensional parameters as they reflect not only the supply of food associated with reservoir s trophic level but also point to the degree of consumption of planktonic invertebrates by fish mills and schiavone 1982 mills et al 1987 synchronous dynamics of δ shannon and clarke s w statistic values for most part of the water area fig 12 demonstrated a close internal relations existing between these parameters that is conditioned by similar nature of their calculation krupa and barinova 2016 it is concluded that δ shannon is easily calculated and can be used for the zooplankton community structure description lack of connection between dimensional parameters of zooplankton and abiotic factors is associated with the complexity of the shardara reservoir s contamination and mutually opposed effects on living organisms by substances entering the reservoir it is known that organic contamination leads to the increased dominance of r strategists odum 1981 andronikova 1996 i e small sized species while toxicants depending on their chemical nature and contributing factors encourage the selection of the larger vesela and vijverberg 2007 or conversely the smaller species rabsch and elbrachter 1980 basińska et al 2010 of zooplankton 6 conclusion the mapping of the data showed potential relationship between the spatial distribution of nutrients and toxic substances with the sources of contamination of the shardara reservoir statistical comparison of species composition and zooplankton distribution mapping revealed close relation of zooplankton diversity and macrophytes distribution maps of biotic indicators and environmental variables illustrated that copepods avoided places with high concentrations of polyphosphates but gained a competitive advantage in water areas polluted with β hcch our study reaffirmed the importance of cyclopoda as indicator species and among the latter a trajani as the most resistant to toxic contamination of the water when the content of heavy metals increased calanoida species disappeared from the community which can likewise be used for bioindication purposes the most favorable conditions for cladocera represented mostly by d galeata were formed on waters with high content of phosphates nitrites zinc and accumulation of green algae cladocera avoided water areas with high concentration of lead copper and cadmium statistical maps of distribution of dimensional parameters δ shannon clarke s w statistics average individual mass did not reveal any certain relations with environmental variables which we attribute to the complex nature of the shardara reservoir s pollution it was shown that δ shannon is easily calculated and can be used for the zooplankton community structure description the cartographic data visualization makes possible to describe the main trends in the spatial distribution of biological and environmental parameters to identify places of concentration for species from different taxonomic groups and the places they avoid depending on the distribution of chemical variables

in shardara reservoir southern kazakhstan was investigated in summer 2015 the development of macrophytes in the water area significantly affected the species diversity of zooplankton copepoda avoided places with high concentrations of polyphosphates from detergents but gained a competitive advantage on water areas polluted by β hcch the most favorable conditions for cladocera represented mostly by daphnia galeata were formed on parts of the reservoir with high content of phosphates nitrites zinc and accumulation of green algae cladocera avoided waters with a high content of lead copper and cadmium statistical maps of distribution of δ shannon clarke s w statistics and average individual mass did not reveal any certain relations with environmental variables which we attribute to the complex nature of the shardara reservoir s pollution a strong relationship between the δ shannon and clarke s w statistics parameters was found it was found that δ shannon is easily calculated and can be used for the zooplankton community structure description keywords zooplankton biological indicators environmental factors statistics distribution maps 1 introduction aquatic invertebrates are good indicators of the ecological status of the water bodies the diversity composition and number of dominant species the proportion of rotifera cladocera calanoida and cyclopoida in the total quantitative parameters of zooplankton are indicative andronikova 1996 jeppesen et al 2011 ochocka and pasztaleniec 2016 rotifera are the most diverse in the eutrophic water bodies crustaceans in the mesotrophic ponds of poland kuczyńska kippen and joniak 2016 with an increase of trophic status of water bodies the number of dominant species in zooplankton communities decreases whereas the abundance of rotifera and cladocera grows as does the ratio of cyclopoida s biomass to calanoida s andronikova 1996 xue et al 2014 in contrast with these results the rotifera abundance declined during the eutrophication of lakes in poland leaving more space for cladocera and copepoda adamczuk et al 2015 the authors of this paper found that daphnia longispina o f mueller and monospilus dispar g o sars prefer waters with elevated n nh4 cyclops kolensis lilljeborg and cyclops strenuus fischer correlate with a rising gradient in p po4 adamczuk et al 2015 kuchko et al 2015 among other things eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems leads to decrease of the average mass of individual specie andronikova 1996 as the trophicity of a reservoir increases large species such as cladocera and calanoida are eliminated from zooplankton communities comprised of small eurybiont species adamczuk et al 2015 kuchko et al 2015 toxic pollution as well as eutrophication lead to a decrease of stenobiont species which in turn is reflected in the reduction of zooplankton diversity vandysh 2004 rotifers are the most tolerant to heavy metal contamination gagneten and paggi 2009 specimens with morphological abnormalities are present in populations of copepods in conditions of chronic toxic pollution of water bodies krupa 2005 2008 2012 comparison of biomass curves and abundance curves abc method may have an indicative value in assessing the ecological state of water bodies warwick 1986 biological parameters such as clarke s w statistics are based on the mutual arrangement of biomass and abundance curves clarke 1990 positive values of clarke s w statistics indicate that the biomass curve is above the abundance curve according to warwick 1986 this arrangement of curves is typical for natural habitats when stress increases the abundance and biomass curves change the location and clarke s w statistics becomes negative the presence of macrophytes is proved as one of the essential factors that determine the composition and quantitative parameters of zooplankton communities kuczyńska kippen and nagengast 2016 kuczyńska kippen and joniak 2016 du et al 2014 it has been shown that the prevailing species of macrophytes in shallow macrophyte lakes affect horizontal distribution the abundance of bacteria flagellates ciliates and crustaceans and the predator prey ratio mieczan et al 2016 thus the presence and abundance of macrophytes must be taken into account when analyzing the horizontal distribution of biological parameters across the water area the structure of zooplankton communities can be used to assess the ecological status of both the water body as a whole and its individual parts vandysh 2004 this is especially true for large water bodies polluted from point and scattered sources to assess the ecological status of different parts of large water bodies it seems advisable to construct maps of the spatial distribution of the analyzed parameters barinova et al 2016 data visualization also makes it possible to identify potential sources of pollution of the reservoir and its individual parts the shardara reservoir was formed in 1965 and represents one of the largest fisheries and irrigation water bodies of kazakhstan the surface area of the reservoir at full filling is 780sq km irrigation water withdrawal causes a reduction of water surface area from spring to autumn for approximately three times the anthropogenic impact on the water body is due to its location in an area of intensive farming and industrial activities primarily the shardara reservoir is polluted by nutrients pesticides and heavy metals amirgaliev 2007 the highest concentrations of these substances in the reservoir water had been recorded until the mid 90s of the last century the quantity of fertilizers in agricultural use decreased in the following years of economic recession in kazakhstan this led to an improvement of the ecological situation in the region lopareva and amirgaliev 1973 amirgaliev et al 1995 amirgaliev 2007 for the present the area of irrigated land is being expanded and the industry within the catchment area of the shardara reservoir grows this necessitates monitoring the ecological state of the shardara reservoir unstable hydrological regime the influx of contaminants from the collector drainage surface runoff and river water transit together with the hydrophysical parameters in the arid climate conditions cause significant differences in the spatial conditions for the existence of aquatic fauna of the shardara reservoir information on the structure of zooplankton in shardara reservoir is given in the previously published works malinovskaya and ten 1983 kiseleva 1997 krupa et al 2009 balymbetov 2013 the diversity of summer time zooplankton reached 38 77 species the abundance of zooplankton varied within the range of 100 0 139 2thous spec m 3 on account of the above mentioned papers the biomass of zooplankton was 0 6 2 4gm 3 rotifera was dominant by abundance sometimes in conjunction with copepoda cladocera was dominant by biomass the zooplankton structure changed with a decrease of the water level in the reservoir from summer to autumn krupa et al 2009 the calanoida species had disappeared from the zooplankton composition by autumn the smaller species of cyclopoida dominated the water body the average individual mass of a specimen decreased from 0 0224mg in the spring summer period to 0 0089mg in the autumn so according to the above mentioned research changes in the structure of zooplankton communities indicated an intensifying eutrophication of the reservoir from summer to autumn during 2003 2005 information on the spatial distribution of the zooplankton in the shardara reservoir due to external factors is absent in the published works the present work fills the gap the purpose of this study is to analyze the spatial distribution of zooplankton in connection with macrophyte nutrient content in water organic polyphosphates organochlorine pesticides and heavy metals as indicative biological parameters the following were selected species richness abundance biomass of taxonomic groups rotifera cladocera copepoda facultative inhabitants of the water column and total zooplankton values of shannon index clarke s w statistics here we also observe the relationship between the values of clarke s w statistics and the parameter introduced by us earlier δ shannon krupa and barinova 2016 krupa et al 2016 the analysis of all data is based on statistically generated maps this method makes it possible to compare the distribution of zooplankton and abiotic indicators across the water area of the reservoir mapping of data shows the confinement of the abiotic indicators to the potential sources of pollution of the reservoir besides widely accepted comparative statistical methods do not always give comprehensive results whereas statistically constructed maps have not only integrated but also prognostic properties 2 study site description the shardara water reservoir is located in one of the most densely populated areas of kazakhstan with have developed agriculture and industry its length is up to 80km at maximum filling with a maximum width of 25km the reservoir is elongated from north west to south east fig 1 the right bank is leveled composed of loose sandy clay and clay loam with steep underwater ledges the left bank is flat dissected with bays and coves the reservoir is fed by the waters of the syrdarya and keles rivers the grounds are dominated by gray silt with sand and clay close to syrdarya river additionally there is fine detritus the arid climate and irrigation purpose of the reservoir conditions significant interannual and seasonal fluctuations in water level during the period of the study in 2015 the eastern shallow part of the reservoir has been drained and the water area was about a quarter less than the maximum fig 1 the black line 3 materials and methods the research of zooplankton the content of biogenic elements heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides in the water was carried out by means of a grid of 13 stations in june 2015 fig 1 the measures of the temperature and ph values of the surface water layers were taken during field trip by using hanna hi 98129 instruments water transparency was measured with secchi disk coordinate referencing of the stations was done by garmin etrex gps navigator a total of 42 water samples were taken 13 samples for each type of analysis in order to determine the content of nutrients nitrites nitrates ammonium phosphates as well as organic polyphosphates heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides the samples for heavy metals were fixed in the site by adding nitric acid samples for nutrients were fixed with chloroform all collected samples were transported to the laboratory in an icebox 13 samples of zooplankton were selected using a juday net with a diameter of 12cm by pulling it from the bottom to the surface the degree of overgrowth of the water area by soft macrophytes was estimated through visual observations in percentage to analyze the distribution of macrophytes the program statistica 12 0 was used conventional methods of chemical analysis of water were used semenova 1977 fomin 1995 water samples were analyzed in three to four repetitions the error of estimate for major ions in the water was 0 5 5 depending on the analyte heavy metal measuring was performed by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma by using agilent 7500 a manufactured by agilent technologies usa national standard rk iso 17294 2 2006 the device allows for the detection of the various chemical elements in complex matrices including those

zooplankton samples were processed by standard methods winberg and lavrenteva 1984 in the laboratory each sample was diluted to a volume of 50 150ml and 3 subsamples each of 1ml were analyzed in these subsamples all individuals of the species were counted with the use of microscope mbs 10 and мсх 300 in order to take into account rare and large species each sample was thoroughly observed when calculating the individual mass of zooplankters the equations of linear mass dependence were applied the abundance and biomass of taxonomic groups and total zooplankton was calculated per 1m3 of water balushkina and winberg 1979 the species of planktonic invertebrates were carried out according to guides to the identification rilov 1948 kutikova 1970 tsalolihin 1995 krupa et al 2016a in order to characterize the zooplankton structure we found the total number of species abundance biomass of taxonomic groups and that of community the value of the average individual mass of specimen the composition and number of dominant species according to abundance and biomass the diversity index of shannon bi bitmg 1 and shannon ab bitindividuals 1 magurran 1998 as well as arithmetic difference between the two versions of the index δ shannon were calculated the calculation of the index values of shannon and w statistic clarke clarke 1990 was performed using the program primer 5 cluster analysis and dendrites of similarity were calculated with graphs program novakovsky 2004 nonparametric correlation analysis and spatial mapping in wafer plots was done on statistica 12 0 4 results 4 1 environmental variables the depth of reservoir during sampling period was varied from 2 8 to 15 0m as a result of reduction of the reservoir s level at beginning of june 2015 the maximum water transparency was recorded in the northwest area near the dam table 1 the water temperature ranged from 25 6 to 30 7 c reaching maximum in the shallows water ph varied only slightly the grounds are dominated by gray silt with sand and clay there is fine detritus close to syrdarya river additionally macrophytes are sporadically developed in the reservoir fig 2 the composition and abundance of macrophytes is insufficiently investigated but it is known that there are clumps of potamogeton natans l in the coastal zone and along the northeastern shore strips of potamogeton malajanus l total dissolved solids tds of water averaged 1055mgdm 3 with a predominance of sulfate and sodium ions the content of biogenic compounds was low table 1 among organochlorine pesticides the β hcch were present throughout the water area the content of heavy metals and organic polyphosphates in the water varied across the lake area by one or two orders of its magnitude 4 2 spatial distribution of nutrients and toxicants the lower third of the water area as well as the narrow area along the coasts of the right bank were characterized by elevated concentrations of nitrates and phosphates fig 3 a and b indicating the relation with the incoming river flow the highest concentration of ammonia was detected in the central part fig 3d fig 3c shows the relationship of nitrates with collector drainage water inflow that comes to the arnasay bay fig 1 from irrigated fields along the southwestern shore of the reservoir two peaks of hcch isomers content in the water have been revealed in the eastern part and near the south western shore of the reservoir fig 4a the content of polyphosphates in the water varied within a small range decreasing in the direction from the east to the shallow northwestern deep part of the reservoir fig 4b the recorded peaks in their concentrations suggest that the main source of polyphosphates is the river runoff whereas of hcch isomers can be river and drainage runoff the map of zinc distribution also pointed at the relation with river inflow fig 5a while the maximum concentrations of copper fig 5b were associated with the areas affected by the drainage runoff the highest concentrations of lead and cadmium were found in the central part of the waters fig 5c and d 4 3 general characteristics of zooplankton zooplankton was represented by 60 species among them rotifera being presented by 37 species cladocera by 11 copepoda by 6 the facultative inhabitants of the water column by 6 widespread in the water area were rotifers synchaeta stylata wierzejski s vorax rousselet polyarthra sp keratella cochlearis gosse pompholyx sulcata gosse cladocerans daphnia galeata sars leptodora kindtii focke diaphanosoma mongolianum ueno copepods thermocyclops taihokuensis harada and acanthocyclops trajani mirabdullayev defaye zooplankton abundance averaged 92 9 34 0thous ind m 3 their biomass reaching 966 0 468 0mgm 3 the copepods and rotifers were formed in equal proportion of 48 2 50 1 of zooplankton abundance quantitative parameters of cladocerans were low 1 0thous ind m 3 and 0 07mgm 3 on average biomass was predominantly formed by copepods mostly cyclops a trajani the distribution of planktonic invertebrates according to their abundance was more even 2 24 0 13bitindividual 1 than according to the biomass 1 23 0 14bitmg 1 which was reflected in the negative δ shannon 1 00 0 15 the dominance of rotifers and young stages of copepods resulted in low values of the average individual mass of specimen 0 0082 0 0016mg negative values of clarce s w statistic 0 134 0 013 evidenced the abundance curve being above the biomass curve 4 4 the spatial distribution of zooplankton nonparametric correlation analysis revealed that rotifera has made the main contribution to the total species richness of the community r 0 983 p 0 05 analysis of the spatial distribution showed that against the backdrop of the total species richness increasing near the south western coast fig 6a the highest species number of rotifera and cladocera fig 6b and c was identified in the south western and north eastern parts of the waters where macrophytes well developed as demonstrated in fig 2 the increase in the species richness of zooplankton was due to rotifers brachionus angularis gosse b budapestinensis daday k cochlearis gosse keratella tropica reducta fadeev testudinella patina hermann s stylata wierz polyarthra sp cladocerans d galeata sars d mongolianum uéno simocephalus mixtus sars ilyocryptus sp on the water areas overgrown with macrophytes spatial distribution of copepoda s species richness was somewhat different fig 6d this group was presented by the most species number in the wide area along the southern and southwestern coasts as well as in the eastern shallow areas where macrophytes developed and that is affected by syrdarya river runoff the number of copepoda species decreased in the central part of the reservoir in which were reported highest concentrations of cadmium and lead fig 5c and d comparative analysis of zooplankton species composition identified three clusters within the water area at the level of 50 similarity fig 7a cluster 1 represents communities on stations 2 and 4 where the water depths were about 10 15m zooplankton on these areas was comprised of 18 and 10 species respectively most of the water area with similar species composition of planktonic invertebrates formed cluster 2 with two sub clusters first sub cluster 2a included the communities of deep non overgrown or slightly overgrown areas of the reservoir with 9 15 species adjacent to the station 5 where macrophytes developed and where the diversity of community was the highest 31 species the diversity of zooplankton communities in sub cluster 2a was determined by macrophytes that serve as an edificators and provide shelter for aquatic invertebrates as well as by other factors so wastewater discharged into the arnasay bay affect the entire southwestern part of the reservoir and especially stations 2 5 fig 1 the second sub cluster 2b combined the stations of eastern shallow part of the reservoir with macrophytes coverage about 50 90 and the number of planktonic invertebrates ranging from 16 to 22 species dendrite of zooplankton species composition overlapping was built by ward s method based on euclidean distance fig 7b shows that two communities stations 3 and 10 include the largest number of species from communities of other parts of the area and can be marked as faunal cores for the reservoir zooplankton so the deepest non overgrown station 3 was most characteristic of zooplankton from exposed parts of the reservoir whereas the shallow station 10 had the maximum number of planktonic invertebrates from habitats overgrown by macrophytes remarkably station 3 also served as floristic core for phytoplankton in the shardara reservoir barinova and krupa 2017 the spatial distribution of zooplankton quantitative parameters has been uneven the highest abundance and biomass of zooplankton fig 8 including rotifers and facultative inhabitants of the water column fig 9 are recorded near the southwestern coast arnasay bay fig 1 while their values show significantly lower abundance in largest part of the water area three unequal peaks of the copepod abundance fig 9 were revealed the first was in the most pronounced being in the southwestern part with low concentrations of polyphosphates and β hcch content up to 0 005mcgdm 3 fig 4 two smaller peaks were in the eastern and central parts of the reservoir where as shown in fig 4 were elevated concentrations of hcch isomers and low content of polyphosphates the spatial distribution of abundance and biomass of cladocera is most important because this group is most sensitive to the toxic contamination fig 10 the highest biomass of crustaceans was registered in the eastern part of the reservoir which is affected by the runoff from syrdarya and keles rivers and is characterized by the highest content of phosphates nitrites fig 3 and zinc fig 5a cladocerans formed the high abundance in the widest part of the reservoir at the eastern part with elevated concentrations of the above mentioned substances and the adjacent southern part comparison of the distribution maps additionally revealed that cladocerans fig 10 avoided waters with elevated concentrations of copper lead and cadmium fig 5c and d but we do not revealed statistically significant relationships between the parameters the values of the shannon index varied across the water surface from 1 00 to 2 69bitindividuals 1 shannon ab and from 0 34 to 2 26bitmg 1 shannon bi fig 11 illustrates how the values of shannon bi index bitmg 1 varied out of phase with the value of average individual mass clarke s w statistic and δ shannon showed similar spatial distribution with both shannon indices reaching maximum values in the central part of the reservoir and in the area along the northeastern coast fig 12 5 discussion 5 1 distribution of abiotic parameters in june 2015 the averaged total dissolved solids tds corresponds the brackish water guseva 2002 the content of nutrients table 1 did not exceed maximum permissible standards mpc for fisheries kimstach 1993 bespamyatnov and krotov 1985 the β hcch were present throughout the water area which is considered unacceptable for fishery water bodies the content of heavy metals in the water exceeded the mpc for fisheries kimstach 1993 bespamyatnov and krotov 1985 polyphosphates have wide application in the food industry and are dissolved components of the detergents that get into the reservoir in particular with water of keles river whose shores accommodate many settlements and one of the largest resorts in kazakhstan saryagash their content in the reservoir water did not exceed mpc for fisheries guseva 2002 during our investigations based on the statistically constructed distribution maps we can conclude that the nitrites phosphates polyphosphates and zinc enters the reservoir water predominantly with river waters copper and nitrates with a collector drainage discharge β hcch isomers from both sources the maximum concentrations of ammonia lead cadmium and copper were recorded in central and northwestern parts of the reservoir indicating the dispersed nature of their entry into the water 5 2 species richness of zooplankton species richness of zooplankton of the shardara reservoir in summer 2015 60 species was at the level corresponding to that of summer 2004 2005 61 64 species but lower than in 2003 77 species krupa 2007 dendrite of zooplankton similarity fig 7b evidenced that in 2015 the waters of the reservoir was divided into two large parts the deepest non overgrown part and shallow one where macrophytes developed to a varying degree maps of spatial distribution of the species richness for planktonic invertebrates brought us to similar conclusions the greatest number of species mainly represented by rotifers and copepods belonged to zooplankton on shallow overgrown areas of the shardara reservoir located in the eastern south western and northern parts figs 2 and 6 our earlier work revealed the same trend in the distribution of species richness of planktonic invertebrates peaking in the eastern shallow part krupa 2007 the connection between zooplankton species richness mainly represented by rotifers and the macrophytes that provides safe place for planktonic invertebrates kuczyńska kippen and nagengast 2016 has been recorded in the lakes of middle reaches of yangtze river china du et al 2014 and the ponds of western poland kuczyńska kippen and joniak 2016 5 3 the abundance and biomass of zooplankton the abundance and biomass of zooplankton in 2015 was 1 2 1 5 times lower in comparison to data from 2004 to 2005 but higher than in summer 2003 0 64gm 3 krupa et al 2009 zooplankton reached the highest abundance and biomass in the 1981 1996 about 255 7thous ind m 3 and 4 2gm 3 on average kiseleva 1997 krupa et al 2009 against the background of heavy pollution of the reservoir and unfavorable hydrological regime the influence of the hydrological regime on zooplankton communities can be associated with two main factors reducing the water level leads to an increase in the overall level of contamination of the reservoir as a result high biomass of zooplankton is formed due to several dominant species krupa et al 2009 the second factor is the reduction of the area of shallow water overgrown with macrophytes as shown in the example of the shallow ponds in poland fluctuations in the water level affect the species diversity and biomass of macrophytes kuczyńska kippen et al 2009 macrophytes in turn are predictors of the diversity and abundance of zooplankton communities kuczyńska kippen and nagengast 2016 du et al 2014 kuczyńska kippen et al 2009 kuczyńska kippen and joniak 2016 5 4 zooplankton species richness quantitative and environmental parameters relationship although copepoda is adapted to polluted environment gagneten and paggi 2009 braginsky et al 1987 when affected by cadmium and lead fig 5c and d their species richness fig 6 decreased due to the absence of calanoida cyclops t taihokuensis and a trajani only being more resistant to external factors than calanoida remained in contaminated areas comparison of distribution maps of zooplankton s quantitative and environmental parameters figs 4 and 9 showed that copepods avoided places with high concentrations of polyphosphates but gained a competitive advantage in water areas polluted with β hcch the dominant role here was belonged to cyclops a trajani as the typical component of zooplankton in polluted water bodies of kazakhstan krupa 2008 the better conditions for cladocera fig 10 represented mostly by d galeata were formed on parts of the reservoir with high content of phosphates nitrites fig 3 and zinc fig 5a zinc maximizing at 0 56mgdm 3 table 1 did not have a negative impact on cladocerans as ions of this metal rapidly leave the body of crustaceans through molting muyssen and janssen 2002 however serves the association of green algae accumulations to the same areas of the water fig 13 can be one of the major regulating factors green algae are the preferred food items for daphnia gasiunaite and olenina 1998 and also have mechanisms of detoxification from heavy metals macfie and welbourn 2000 the decrease in the shannon ab values bitindividual 1 took place against the backdrop of reduction in species richness of copepods as reflected in figs 6 and 12 it is consistent with the findings regarding the relation of shannon ab values and the number of species in the community krupa 2012 kuchko et al 2015 mutually opposed spatial dynamics between shannon bi values bitmg 1 and the average individual mass of specimen fig 12 demonstrated the negative relationship between these parameters whose statistical significance has been previously shown for phytoplankton barinova and chekryzheva 2014 and zooplankton krupa 2012 of various water bodies this implies that with the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and reduction in size of community organisms the values of shannon bi index bitmg 1 will increase as opposed to previously assumed andronikova 1996 it can be dependent with the pollution level and correct for the low pollutant impacts we presented the nonlinearity of changes in shannon bi index bit mg 1 in a gradient of anthropogenic load on the lakes and reservoirs of kazakhstan krupa 2010 2011 increase in the shannon ab index values bit individual 1 along with rising trophic status of lakes from ultra oligotrophic to oligotrophic kuchko et al 2015 is an indirect confirmation of this phenomenon zooplankton structure has an integral feature such as dimensional parameters as they reflect not only the supply of food associated with reservoir s trophic level but also point to the degree of consumption of planktonic invertebrates by fish mills and schiavone 1982 mills et al 1987 synchronous dynamics of δ shannon and clarke s w statistic values for most part of the water area fig 12 demonstrated a close internal relations existing between these parameters that is conditioned by similar nature of their calculation krupa and barinova 2016 it is concluded that δ shannon is easily calculated and can be used for the zooplankton community structure description lack of connection between dimensional parameters of zooplankton and abiotic factors is associated with the complexity of the shardara reservoir s contamination and mutually opposed effects on living organisms by substances entering the reservoir it is known that organic contamination leads to the increased dominance of r strategists odum 1981 andronikova 1996 i e small sized species while toxicants depending on their chemical nature and contributing factors encourage the selection of the larger vesela and vijverberg 2007 or conversely the smaller species rabsch and elbrachter 1980 basińska et al 2010 of zooplankton 6 conclusion the mapping of the data showed potential relationship between the spatial distribution of nutrients and toxic substances with the sources of contamination of the shardara reservoir statistical comparison of species composition and zooplankton distribution mapping revealed close relation of zooplankton diversity and macrophytes distribution maps of biotic indicators and environmental variables illustrated that copepods avoided places with high concentrations of polyphosphates but gained a competitive advantage in water areas polluted with β hcch our study reaffirmed the importance of cyclopoda as indicator species and among the latter a trajani as the most resistant to toxic contamination of the water when the content of heavy metals increased calanoida species disappeared from the community which can likewise be used for bioindication purposes the most favorable conditions for cladocera represented mostly by d galeata were formed on waters with high content of phosphates nitrites zinc and accumulation of green algae cladocera avoided water areas with high concentration of lead copper and cadmium statistical maps of distribution of dimensional parameters δ shannon clarke s w statistics average individual mass did not reveal any certain relations with environmental variables which we attribute to the complex nature of the shardara reservoir s pollution it was shown that δ shannon is easily calculated and can be used for the zooplankton community structure description the cartographic data visualization makes possible to describe the main trends in the spatial distribution of biological and environmental parameters to identify places of concentration for species from different taxonomic groups and the places they avoid depending on the distribution of chemical variables and potential sources of water pollution conflict of interest none declared ethical statement the research was done according to ethical standards funding body the work was carried out under the
