18770,the combination of peroxymonosulfate pms and electrolysis with an activated carbon fiber acf as cathode e acf pms was systematically investigated a synergistic effect was observed in the e acf pms process compared with the e acf pds process the e acf pms process spent one third as much energy for elimination of carbamazepine cbz increased pms concentration current density and ph value significantly enhanced cbz elimination it was also noted that the presence of phosphate p o 4 3 bicarbonate h c o 3 and humic acid ha inhibited cbz removal while the presence of chloride ion c l accelerated it according to radical scavenging experiments and the estimation of relative contribution reactive oxygen species oxidation including oh s o 4 and 1o2 played an important role in cbz degradation accounting for 75 67 we systematically explored the production mechanism for 1o2 and the results demonstrated that 1o2 was mainly generated on the cathode rather than generated by o 2 or o2 reported by other researchers possible degradation pathways for cbz in e acf pms process were also proposed finally the potential for practical applications was explored and compared with e acf pds the results of sem images bet and nitrogen adsorption isotherm before and after acf reuse for 50 times suggested that acf could maintain its adsorption capacity and catalytic ability in the e acf pms process testing also suggested that the protection of acf in electrochemical oxidation was based on its relatively high current intensity and removal efficiency the removal efficiencies of other organic pollutants including nitrobenzene nb sulfamethoxazole smx diclofenac dc and tetracycline tc were also evaluated in addition experiments were conducted to study the effects of different water matrices and toxicology implications and results demonstrated that substituting pms for pds in an e acf system could create a more efficient sustainable and with less secondary toxicity process for

introduction carbamazepine cbz c15h12n2o as one of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps has been widely used for psychotherapy alcohol withdrawal and the treatment of epilepsy mohapatra et al 2014 as documented cbz is frequently detected in municipal wastewater wastewater sludge surface water drinking water and other water sources ternes 1998 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 and this creates concerns since even when present at concentration of less than 1 μg l cbz represents a threat to human health braeutigam et al 2012 due to the presence of benzene rings and π bonds cbz is persistent and difficult to be eliminated from sewage systems by biodegradation chlorination or photodegradation soufan et al 2013 yang et al 2016 in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops based on persulfate ps both peroxymonosulfate and peroxydisulfate have attracted increasing interest due to their effectiveness in the degradation and in many cases the potential for mineralization of refractory contaminants normally persulfates can be activated using transition metals ions ultraviolet light ultrasound heat electrolysis carbon materials or gamma radiation in water eq 1 chen et al 2018 li et al 2018 moreira et al 2017 nie et al 2019 wang and wang 2018b wang et al 2015 yan et al 2017a yin et al 2018 1 s 2 o 8 2 h s o 5 a c t i v a t o r e g u v a c e c s o 4 a n d o r o h compared with other activation methods such as transition metals uv and electrolysis acs can catalyze persulfate to degrade ppcps with relatively low secondary contamination and energy consumption duan et al 2015 feng et al 2015 however it has been proved that acs exhibit relatively poor reusability in the activation of persulfate due to chemical oxidation by free radicals and the persulfate itself lee et al 2013a in addition compared with others oxidation methods such as electrochemical or fenton oxidation acs has a quite low degradation rate for refractory contaminants thus acs activated persulfate technology needs to be improved to overcome the above shortcomings for extensive application in electrochemical process inert metal cathodes such as titanium platinum were explored as a medium for electron transfer to activate oxidants like ps or h2o2 meanwhile acs is commonly used in electrochemical activated process as cathode with good conductivity acs itself could catalyze persulfate to degrade refractory contaminants due to the large number of functional groups acs has high adsorption capacity which can enhance the enrichment of pollutants and oxidants at the cathode thereby accelerating the reaction rate in a previous study electrochemically activation peroxydisulfate pds with activated carbon fibers acfs cathode could effectively increase the catalytic efficiency and reduce the damage of acfs liu et al 2018a however the system can only achieve high sustainability of acfs and pollutant removal efficiency at relatively high current densities and pds concentrations these constraints can cause a large amount of energy consumption and limit its application in water treatment theoretically pms can exhibit better degradation efficiency in electro catalytic systems than pds for example e pms and e pds system equipped with sacrificial iron plates as electrodes were used for pentachlorophenol removal and it was found that the degradation in e pms was more effective than that in e pds process govindan et al 2014 however no information is available on the comparison for the degradation of organic contaminants by electrochemical activation of pms and pds process with acf cathode as well as their kinetics mechanism and application as well known ps can be activated by electrochemical methods and generate hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals s o 4 meanwhile the role of singlet oxygen 1o2 generation in pms activated process is attracting increasing interest 1o2 has been widely used for the degradation of refractory contaminants due to its electrophilic nature cheng et al 2017 as previously reported 1o2 in pms activated process was mainly generated by pms self decomposition zhou et al 2015a by o 2 produced from h2o2 reacting with oh reshetnyak et al 2003 yan et al 2017b and by o2 which trapped activation energy from pms huang et al 2018 it is also reported that 1o2 could also be generated by carbon materials containing ketonic groups activated pms process li et al 2017 liang et al 2017 however 1o2 generation mechanism in electro catalytic system deserves further study in e pms process with acf cathode in this work an electrochemical process was combined with acf using acf as the cathode to activate pms e acf pms process the objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the performance of the e acf pms process in terms of cbz removal both by itself and in comparison with e acf pds 2 investigate the effects of anions natural organic matter nom and other factors on cbz removal 3 determine reactive species indentify 1o2 generation mechanisms and elucidate cbz degradation pathways in e acf pms 4 estimate the relative contribution of acf adsorption direct electron transfer det pms oxidation alone reactive

listed in text s1 for water matrix experiments surface water was collected from a pond at chongqing university and the tap water was collected from laboratory chongqing university 2 2 experimental procedures all the experiments were conducted in a 500 ml glass column 10 cm diameter and 12 cm height using a dc power with 298 k and 800 rpm the distance between the anode pt plated titanium 50 mm 35 mm and the cathode acf pt plated titanium 50 mm 35 mm 3 mm was 2 cm all experiments except those designed to study the role of different water matrices were performed in 0 042 mm cbz solution with a fixed amount of oxidant pms or pds addition and without addition of a buffer the ph was controlled to the desired value with 0 5 m h2so4 and 1 m naoh in the experiments designed to study the role of ph and anions pms concentration was reduced to 10 mm in all the experiments the solutions were unbuffered except in the experiments focused on the ph effect buffered with 100 mm phosphate the cbz concentration in different water matrix experiments was 2 1 10 3 μm all samples obtained from the reaction solutions were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and 0 2 ml meoh was added before analysis to quench the oxidation reactions algae growth experiments using microcystis aeruginosa were conducted following oecd guideline oecd 2011 and test conditions were as follows light intensity 8000 lux temperature 20 2 c initial algae concentration 105 cells ml the algae cells were exposed to cbz solutions treated by e acf pms process the treated cbz solutions were pretreated using the method shown in text s2 all experiments were performed in duplicates 2 3 analytical methods all organic contaminants used in this study were evaluated using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc waters usa

adsorption 77 k the morphologies of acf samples were observed by a scanning electron microscope sem tescan inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal efficiency of cbz in various processes results of removal efficiency of cbz 0 042 mm by the activation of pms in various processes are compared in fig s1 the process optimization included pms dosage current density and ph and it is described in text s6 cbz removal studies in aqueous solution by pms alone for 60 min illustrated a low removal efficiency 8 12 with a small amount 5 36 of pms consumed which demonstrated that the removal of cbz by pms was slow moreover after reacting for 60 min the removal efficiency of cbz was 54 22 for acf adsorption while the efficiency for acf pms was 61 07 with only 11 41 of the pms consumed these results illustrated that pms could be activated by acf but that the activation efficiency was not significant in addition the removal efficiency by e pt was 21 72 the results showed that cbz was removed slightly by electrolysis the removal efficiency improved to 71 58 by adding pms to the e pt process demonstrating that pms could easily be activated at the presence of electric field most importantly the removal efficiency in the e acf pms process reached 100 within 40 min no cbz was detected in solution which demonstrated that the electro acf activated process had better oxidation capacity than the other activated processes from the result of fig 1 all cbz removal processes satisfied first order kinetics r2 0 97 for the initial 40 min and the rate constants have been summarized in table s1 compared with electro activated and acf activated processes electro acf synergistic activated process was apparently effective for cbz removal and pms decomposition as shown in fig 1 and fig s1 for example the kapp and pms decomposition by the e acf pms process were 8 10 10 2 min 1 and 45 44 whereas the equivalent figures for the e pt pms process were only 2 09 10 2 min 1 and 37 87 respectively and those for acf pms process were 1 64 10 2 min 1 and 11 41 respectively these results indicated the presence of a synergistic effect between the acf activated pms and electro activated pms processes fig s1 b shows that pms was decomposed in electro acf processes more rapidly than in either electro activated processes or acf activated process as reported pms could be activated by both acf and electrolysis to generate s o 4 and oh eqs 2 4 wang and wang 2018a therefore the electro acf process enhanced decomposition of pms which may accelerate generation of s o 4 and oh 2 a c h s o 5 a c o h s o 4 3 a c h s o 5 a c o h s o 4 4 h s o 5 e o h s o 4 o r o h s o 4 2 3 2 comparison with pds kinetics and energy consumption pds is also a common oxidant in electrochemical oxidation processes to find the better oxidant between pds and pms in e acf process a series of comparison experiments was conducted as shown in fig s2 a e acf pds removed approximately 81 33 cbz after 60 min while the removal efficiency of cbz in e acf pms reached almost 100 within 40 min it should be noted that the e acf pms process had a k app approximately 2 5 times higher than that of the e acf pds process with about 10 higher oxide decomposition efficiency shown in fig s2 b and c in addition the results of toc analysis from fig s2 d showed that e acf pms process had a relatively higher mineralization efficiency of cbz all the results demonstrated that the e acf pms process tended to have better oxidation capacity than the e acf pds process in the e acf pms process only electric energy was consumed in cbz removal therefore electric energy per order ee o is an effective parameter to estimate energy consumption by this process ee o can be calculated from eq 5 the illustration of the eq 5 is shown in text s7 the calculating parameters and ee o values for the different processes are illustrated in table s2 5 e e o p t 1000 v 60 l g c 0 c t as shown in table s2 compared with electrolysis and the e pms process the ee o value for the e acf pms process was minimal addition of pms to the electrolysis process decreased the ee o value from 45 00 kwh m 3 to 7 53 kwh m 3 moreover having acf as the cathode in e pms process reduced the ee o value to 1 89 kwh m 3 which showed that the e acf pms could effectively reduce energy consumption in addition compared with the e acf pds system adding pms instead of pds into e acf system could reduce energy consumption by almost 2 times 5 57 kwh m 3 to 1 89 kwh m 3 suggesting that the e acf pms process was more energy efficient than the e acf pds process 3 3 effects of different water matrices anions e g p o 4 3 h c o 3 cl etc and nom are ubiquitous in natural water matrices and their presence will influence the aops reactions the effects of anions and nom on cbz removal using e acf pms process was deserved to explore the results of effects of phosphate p o 4 3 on the cbz removal efficiency in system are given in fig 2 a cbz removal efficiency decreased from 78 02 to 61 61 with increasing p o 4 3 concentration from 0 to 40 mm thus demonstrating an inhibiting effect of the presence of p o 4 3 although p o 4 3 could activate pms to generate oh and s o 4 lou et al 2014 it inhibited the pms reaction in e acf pms process this result could be attributed to the competing adsorption between po4 3 and pms and side reactions between po4 3 and free radicals as seen in fig 2 b addition of bicarbonate h c o 3 at concentrations ranging from 0 mm to 20 mm inhibited removal of cbz in behavior which could be attributed to the h c o 3 scavenging free radicals to produce low reactivity c o 3 as shown in eq 6 meanwhile h c o 3 could react with pms to form peroxymonocarbonate h c o 4 ahmadi and ghanbari 2019 richardson et al 2000 moreover excess bicarbonate ions in solution shared the space on the electrode surface with pms which resulted in the pms decomposition efficiency clearly declining under the same current density as illustrated in fig s9 b nevertheless increasing the bicarbonate concentration to 40 mm showed negligible effect on cbz removal this phenomenon appeared due to the change of ph brought about by the addition of excess h c o 3 adding 40 mm bicarbonate increased solution ph from 2 41 to 7 14 which benefitted the pms activated by e acf pms process it was also seen that pms decomposition results showed similar trend to that for cbz removal fig s9 b 6 x o h s o 4 x s o 4 2 h o chloride ion cl can react with free radicals to affect removal efficiency in aops as shown in fig 2 c adding cl to e acf pms process in low doses 1 4 mm showed different trends compared to the cbz removal in the presence of p o 4 3 or c o 3 2 the removal efficiency increased significantly from 26 58 without cl to 93 61 with 4 mm cl added this result can be explained through reference to three mechanisms firstly pms could directly react with cl compared with pms alone process cbz removal efficiency in the presence of 1 mm cl was enhanced significantly showed in fig s10 secondly cl could be oxidized by electrolysis to produce cl2 then cl2 could react with water to generate cl and clo which could contribute to cbz removal chung et al 2016 song et al 2017 as shown in fig s11 chloride ions could enhance the removal efficiency of cbz significantly in electrolysis process finally cl could react with oh and s o 4 to produce cloh and cl yu et al 2004 yu 2004 and then the cl could react with cl to generate c l 2 yu and barker 2003 it has been demonstrated that cl and c l 2 contributed more radicals to some ppcps like ba compared with s o 4 and this phenomenon may also be applicable to cbz guan et al 2018 nom is well known as scavenger of radicals and other oxidizing species which causes decrease in removal efficiency of ppcps in aops as can be seen fig 2 d increasing nom concentration enhanced the inhibition of cbz removal and the inhibition effect became quite apparent as the nom concentration increased to 20 mg l this result can be explained by the application of four different mechanisms 1 ha and cbz compete for adsorption at both acf cathode and pt anode 2 ha and cbz compete for det at the pt anode and scavenge free radicals in the system 3 ha and pms compete for adsorption on the pt anode and 4 ha and cbz compete for oxidation nonradical oxidation on the pt anode the decomposition of pms was also inhibited with nom addition as shown in fig s9 d 3 4 mechanism study 3 4 1 determining the reactive species in general oh and s o 4 are potential oxidizing species in pms activated process to determine the contribution of oh and s o 4 to cbz degradation in e acf pms process the effects of meoh and tba were investigated the rate constants for free radicals with meoh and tba have been listed in table s3 from the results shown in fig 3 a it can be seen that cbz removal efficiency in the presence of tba decreased from 96 39 to 69 42 after reaction for 40 min which indicated that oh plays an important role in cbz removal in addition cbz removal efficiency in the presence of meoh decreased remarkably from 96 39 to 63 89 after reaction for 40 min which suggested that s o 4 also played an important role for cbz removal in e acf pms process as can be seen in fig 4 cbz removal efficiency in the presence of 100 mm tba decreased from 98 50 to 35 71 after reaction for 40 min in the anodic chambers while it decreased to 31 53 in the presence of 100 mm meoh the significant difference demonstrated that pms could be activated at the anode to generate oh and s o 4 the similar result in the cathodic chambers demonstrated that pms could be also activated at cathode numerous research studies have shown the generation of 1o2 in pms activated process and that pms can slowly generate 1o2 by self decomposition however the possibility of 1o2 being produced in e acf pms process was unclear and required investigation as shown in table s3 the rate constants of 1o2 with meoh and tba were only 3 0 103 m 1 s 1 and 1 8 103 m 1 s 1 respectively while the rate constant of 1o2 with ffa was high up to 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 which was about 5 orders of magnitude higher than those of meoh and tba ffa also has relatively high rate constant with oh 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 thus we chose 100 mm meoh and 6 mm ffa for the tests so that the scavenging capacities for oh were in the same order of magnitude 9 7 107 s 1 and 9 0 107 s 1 respectively meanwhile the scavenging capacities of meoh and ffa for 1o2 could differ by 3 orders of magnitude 3 0 102 s 1 and 7 2 105 s 1 respectively finally the test results presented in fig 3 a showed that degradation of cbz was more strongly inhibited by adding 6 mm ffa than by adding 100 mm meoh a result which confirmed that 1o2 was likely to be an important oxidizing species in e acf pms process in addition a typical three line epr spectrum with equal intensities was obtained indicating that 1o2 was produced in the e acf pms process fig 3 b as reported 1o2 in pms activated process was mainly generated by pms self decomposition eq 7 zhou et al 2015a by o 2 produced from h 2 o 2 reacting with oh eqs 8 11 reshetnyak et al 2003 yan et al 2017b by o2 which trapped activation energy from pms eq 12 huang et al 2018 and by oh reacting with pms eq 13 zhou et al 2015b to verify the 1o2 generation path in e acf pms process excess tba 100 mm was added to scavenge oh and nitrogen gas was continually introduced into the system to exclude oxygen gas which dissolved in water and was produced by electrolysis however the results in fig s12 showed that the present of oxygen did not cause obvious inhibition on cbz removal it demonstrated that eq 12 did not play an important role in 1o2 generation in addition as shown in fig s13 there was no obvious h 2 o 2 only about 2 mg l after reaction for 60 min detected in e acf pms process moreover adding excess h 2 o 2 5 times higher than that produced in fig s14 to e pt pms process led to slight effect on cbz removal and so taken together these results showed that eqs 8 11 did not play important roles in 1o2 generation either to explore the mechanism of 1o2 generation in electrochemically activated pms process experiments on the effects of radical scavengers were conducted individually at the anode and cathode the anodic and cathodic chambers were divided by a cation exchange membrane in the anodic chambers cbz removal efficiencies in the present of 6 mm ffa or 100 mm meoh were 31 38 and 44 24 with the difference value of 12 86 respectively however the efficiencies in the cathodic chambers under the same conditions were 5 94 and 37 26 with the difference value of 31 32 respectively fig 4 the difference values demonstrated that 1o2 may be generated at both the anode and cathode but mainly produced at the cathode in electrochemical process oh could be generated by the electrolysis of h2o at cathode as a result eq 13 may play an important role in 1o2 generation the effect of oh in the generation of 1o2 was tested 1 m meoh was added to scavenge oh and s o 4 buffered with 100 mm phosphate as shown in fig s7 the removal efficiency of cbz under alkaline conditions ph 9 is higher than that under acid condition ph 5 it indicated that eq 13 is a path of 1o2 generation in this system however it can not be ignored that the ph value decreased to 1 63 rapidly as 50 mm pms added into e acf process therefore even if oh could be produced by electrolysis process at the cathode it could be quickly neutralized in the acidic solution as a result the pathway of 1o2 generation through eq 13 could only occur on cathode but it was not the main pathway it demonstrated that there was another way of 1o2 generation in the e acf pms process oh could be considered as the production of oh lose electrons in conclusion we inferred that 1o2 was mostly produced at the cathode as reaction 14 meanwhile the effects of meoh 100 mm and 1m were studied in the cathode chamber both oh and s o 4 could be completely captured by excessive meoh in the e acf pms process therefore the difference in cbz removal efficiency was mainly caused by 1o2 as can be seen in fig s17 changing the concentration of meoh had little effect on cbz removal in the cathode the result also demonstrated that oh played an important role in the generation of 1o2 eq 14 7 h s o 5 s o 5 2 h s o 4 s o 4 o 1 2 8 h s o 5 h 2 o h s o 4 h 2 o 2 9 h 2 o 2 o h h o 2 h 2 o 10 h o 2 h o 2 11 o 2 o h o h o 1 2 12 o 2 e n e r g y o 1 2 13 h s o 5 s o 5 2 o h 2 s o 4 2 h 2 o o 1 2 14 h s o 5 s o 5 2 o h e 2 s o 4 2 h 2 o o 1 2 3 4 2 estimation of the relative contribution in e acf pms process the removal of cbz can occur through five routes acf adsorption det pms oxidation alone ros oxidation oh s o 4 and 1o2 and nonradical oxidation in this study we assumed that adding 10 m methyl alcohol into pms activated process could scavenge all available oh s o 4 and 1o2 completely as shown in table 1 the proportions of det pms oxidation alone and nonradical oxidation were only 3 46 2 10 and 1 36 in e acf pms process respectively meanwhile the proportion is 78 02 ros oxidation and 15 06 for acf adsorption in e acf pms process apparently ros oxidation played the dominant role in cbz removal in e acf pms process there are two kinds of ros oxidation including free radicals generated by electrolysis alone at the anode oh and s o 4 as per reactions 15 and 16 and electrolysis acf pt catalyzing pms in both the electrode and solution oh s o 4 and 1o2 ros produced by electrolysis alone accounted for just 2 35 in e acf pms process whereas those from electrolysis acf pt catalyzed pms accounted for 75 67 the relative contributions of oh s o 4 and 1o2 were estimated by the method in text s8 and the results were summarized in table s4 as shown in table s4 the proportions of oh s o 4 and 1o2 in contribution of cbz degradation were 58 86 29 27 and 11 87 in ros process respectively 15 h 2 o o h h e 16 s o 4 2 s o 4 e 3 4 3 proposed pathway of cbz degradation fifteen main degradation byproducts were observed in e acf pms process by uplc ims qtof ms fig s15 table s5 intermediates were identified by their mass to charge ratio m z and specific molecular ions the products at m z 193 and m z 210 have been reported in an electrochemically activated chlorine process daniel garcia espinoza et al 2018 while the m z 258 product has been identified in a δ mno2 oxidation process zhai et al 2018 other products were also identified in electrolysis and electrochemically activated pds processes song et al 2018 based on the general rules of cbz electrochemical oxidation and the by products observed with the uplc ims qtof ms five pathways for carbamazepine degradation by e acf pms process have been proposed in fig 5 in comparison with e acf pms process only pathways і ii and iii took place in e acf pds process in fig s16 the production of 1o2 in e acf pms process is likely to be the main reason for this distinction fig s18 3 5 acf recycling experiment 3 5 1 effect of acf recycling on cbz removal some previous studies have reported that activated carbon was destroyed after prolonged service under ozone or persulfate oxidation lee et al 2013b zhang et al 2016 to explore acf reuse efficiency it was recycled in acf pms system for 30 times and in e acf pms system for 50 times as shown in fig 6 acf in acf pms system showed strong deactivation after 30 cycles with the cbz removal efficiency decreasing from 61 07 to 13 99 however acf in e acf pms system showed sustainable activity after 50 cycles with the cbz removal efficiency only decreasing from 100 to 92 19 3 5 2 sem and bet of acf before and after recycling to explore the influence of acf over prolonged periods of pms activation in present or absence of an electric field sem and bet analyses were employed to characterize acf to examine possible damage to acf after recycling in acf pms and e acf pms processes sem images of acf taken before and after recycling are provided in fig 7 the sem images provide strong evidence for acf deactivation as can be seen the surfaces of acfvirgin and acfe acf pms50 were smooth and less adsorbed on the surface of acfe acf pms50 whereas the surface of acfacf pms50 was damaged and had adsorbed much substance in addition the surface of acfe acf pds50 was not damaged but had adsorbed more adsorbate than acfe acf pms50 this could be the reason why the acf in e acf pds process was decreased activity after prolonged use to verify the structural changes of the acfs after reuse bet surface area and micropore volumes of acf samples were measured and have been listed in table 2 the data of bet smicropore and vmicropore showed that electro activated process performed well in maintaining the properties of acf in addition the n2 adsorption isotherm for the acf samples displayed in fig s19 confirmed that the adsorption capacity of acf in the e pds process decreased markedly when compared with that in the e pms process the sustainable acf activity in e acf pms process can be attributed to two reasons on one hand acf could have its activity reduced after providing electrons for activate pms to produce s o 4 for a prolonged period however the electric field could maintain acf activity by supplying electrons that were lost in the pms activation process by acf on the other hand the continual adsorption of incompletely degraded cbz and its byproducts may have inhibited further adsorption and reaction between pms and acf the high removal efficiency of cbz in e acf pms process could reduce the adsorption of cbz and its byproducts consequently sustained the activity of acf as shown in fig 6 c it was worth noting that the removal efficiency of cbz in e acf pds system declined from 81 33 to 34 76 after acf reuse for 50 times in our previous study acf in e acf pds process was able to remain active under higher current and higher pds concentration liu et al 2018b compared with e acf pds process e acf pms system was more effective and sustainable for water treatment 3 6 removal efficiency of other persistent organic pollutants the organics smx tc dc and nb were individually removed by e acf pms process and the results are shown in fig 8 all the reactions were under the initial ph of 3 and the reaction rates of the target organics showed remarkable variation smx and tc removed within 10 min and dc almost completely removed within 60 min on the other hand nb required a longer time to be eliminated 83 91 of nb was removed after reaction for 60 min all these results confirmed that e acf pms process was an effective technology for various persistent organic pollutants removal 3 7 performance in actual surface water and tap water the surface water and tap water belonging to actual water matrices were conducted on e acf pms process to evaluate cbz removal the parameters for the different water matrices are shown in table s6 it can be seen that surface water had higher concentrations of dissolved organic content doc bicarbonate and phosphate which were found to inhibit the removal of cbz in e acf pms process in addition surface water had a high concentration of cl which was found to promote the removal of cbz in e acf pms process from the results in section 3 4 the result presented in fig 9 showed that cbz removal efficiency in surface water was 83 84 after reaction for 60 min while cbz was not detected in tap water after reaction for 25 min the relatively low removal efficiency in surface water could be caused by the combined effects of the all inhibitory concentrations 176 69 mg l of doc bicarbonate and phosphate which were significantly higher than the promotional concentration 12 7 mg l of chlorine ion the removal of cbz by e acf pms process in surface water also reached to 83 and these results indicated that e acf pms process has potential in purifying natural water with a complex composition the comparison between using pms and pds in electro acf activated process is presented in fig 9 compared with pms the pds based process showed a lower cbz removal efficiency in both surface water and tap water overall the results of this study demonstrated the use of pms results in better contaminant removal efficiencies than the use of pds in the respective electro acf activated process for treating ppcps in actual water matrices 3 8 toxicological implications of transformation products to estimate the toxicity of byproducts generated from by e acf activated processes algae growth experiments were conducted in solutions of cbz and mixtures of resulting degradation products formed in e acf pms and e acf pds processes operated for 1 h as shown in fig 10 all algae growth data showed inhibition in solutions treated by e acf pds and e acf pms similar as other aops byproducts produced in e acf activated process were toxic to organisms park et al 2016 yang et al 2017 the algae cells density in e acf pds treated solution increased from 1 41 105 to 82 17 105 cells ml in 10 days whereas it increased from 1 40 105 to 95 47 105 cells ml in e acf pms treated solution the difference can be attributed to higher cbz degradation efficiency in e acf pms process the results implied that e acf pms process was probably less toxic than e acf pds process 4 conclusions in this study the combination of peroxymonosulfate pms and electrolysis with acf as the cathode e acf pms was systematically investigated and the process was found to exhibit high cbz removal efficiency energy calculations showed that e acf pms process could reduce energy consumption more effectively in the removal of cbz than other processes the removal efficiencies were promoted with the increasing of pms concentration current density as well as ph however the presence of p o 4 3 h c o 3 and nom inhibited cbz removal except for c l experiments focused to examine the role of reactive species and to estimate the relative contributions of involved reactions demonstrated that oxidation reactions involving ros such as oh s o 4 and 1o2 played a major role in cbz degradation it is worth noting that 1o2 was mainly generated on the cathode rather than generated from o 2 or o2 additionally cbz degradation pathways have also been proposed surprisingly acf remained practically undamaged i e it avoided oxidation by pms and maintained its adsorption capacity and catalytic activity after prolonged service e acf pms process also showed high efficiency on cbz removal in natural water matrices as well as effectiveness in the removal of other contaminants of concern such as smx tc dc and nb in addition the toxicological experiments revealed that degradation of cbz by e acf pms process exhibited low toxicity all results confirmed that e acf pms process could be suitable for application in the oxidation of persistent organic pollutants in water declaration of interest statement the authors

18770,the combination of peroxymonosulfate pms and electrolysis with an activated carbon fiber acf as cathode e acf pms was systematically investigated a synergistic effect was observed in the e acf pms process compared with the e acf pds process the e acf pms process spent one third as much energy for elimination of carbamazepine cbz increased pms concentration current density and ph value significantly enhanced cbz elimination it was also noted that the presence of phosphate p o 4 3 bicarbonate h c o 3 and humic acid ha inhibited cbz removal while the presence of chloride ion c l accelerated it according to radical scavenging experiments and the estimation of relative contribution reactive oxygen species oxidation including oh s o 4 and 1o2 played an important role in cbz degradation accounting for 75 67 we systematically explored the production mechanism for 1o2 and the results demonstrated that 1o2 was mainly generated on the cathode rather than generated by o 2 or o2 reported by other researchers possible degradation pathways for cbz in e acf pms process were also proposed finally the potential for practical applications was explored and compared with e acf pds the results of sem images bet and nitrogen adsorption isotherm before and after acf reuse for 50 times suggested that acf could maintain its adsorption capacity and catalytic ability in the e acf pms process testing also suggested that the protection of acf in electrochemical oxidation was based on its relatively high current intensity and removal efficiency the removal efficiencies of other organic pollutants including nitrobenzene nb sulfamethoxazole smx diclofenac dc and tetracycline tc were also evaluated in addition experiments were conducted to study the effects of different water matrices and toxicology implications and results demonstrated that substituting pms for pds in an e acf system could create a more efficient sustainable and with less secondary toxicity process for

introduction carbamazepine cbz c15h12n2o as one of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps has been widely used for psychotherapy alcohol withdrawal and the treatment of epilepsy mohapatra et al 2014 as documented cbz is frequently detected in municipal wastewater wastewater sludge surface water drinking water and other water sources ternes 1998 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 and this creates concerns since even when present at concentration of less than 1 μg l cbz represents a threat to human health braeutigam et al 2012 due to the presence of benzene rings and π bonds cbz is persistent and difficult to be eliminated from sewage systems by biodegradation chlorination or photodegradation soufan et al 2013 yang et al 2016 in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops based on persulfate ps both peroxymonosulfate and peroxydisulfate have attracted increasing interest due to their effectiveness in the degradation and in many cases the potential for mineralization of refractory contaminants normally persulfates can be activated using transition metals ions ultraviolet light ultrasound heat electrolysis carbon materials or gamma radiation in water eq 1 chen et al 2018 li et al 2018 moreira et al 2017 nie et al 2019 wang and wang 2018b wang et al 2015 yan et al 2017a yin et al 2018 1 s 2 o 8 2 h s o 5 a c t i v a t o r e g u v a c e c s o 4 a n d o r o h compared with other activation methods such as transition metals uv and electrolysis acs can catalyze persulfate to degrade ppcps with relatively low secondary contamination and energy consumption duan et al 2015 feng et al 2015 however it has been proved that acs exhibit relatively poor reusability in the activation of persulfate due to chemical oxidation by free radicals and the persulfate itself lee et al 2013a in addition compared with others oxidation methods such as electrochemical or fenton oxidation acs has a quite low degradation rate for refractory contaminants thus acs activated persulfate technology needs to be improved to overcome the above shortcomings for extensive application in electrochemical process inert metal cathodes such as titanium platinum were explored as a medium for electron transfer to activate oxidants like ps or h2o2 meanwhile acs is commonly used in electrochemical activated process as cathode with good conductivity acs itself could catalyze persulfate to degrade refractory contaminants due to the large number of functional groups acs has high adsorption capacity which can enhance the enrichment of pollutants and oxidants at the cathode thereby accelerating the reaction rate in a previous study electrochemically activation peroxydisulfate pds with activated carbon fibers acfs cathode could effectively increase the catalytic efficiency and reduce the damage of acfs liu et al 2018a however the system can only achieve high sustainability of acfs and pollutant removal efficiency at relatively high current densities and pds concentrations these constraints can cause a large amount of energy consumption and limit its application in water treatment theoretically pms can exhibit better degradation efficiency in electro catalytic systems than pds for example e pms and e pds system equipped with sacrificial iron plates as electrodes were used for pentachlorophenol removal and it was found that the degradation in e pms was more effective than that in e pds process govindan et al 2014 however no information is available on the comparison for the degradation of organic contaminants by electrochemical activation of pms and pds process with acf cathode as well as their kinetics mechanism and application as well known ps can be activated by electrochemical methods and generate hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals s o 4 meanwhile the role of singlet oxygen 1o2 generation in pms activated process is attracting increasing interest 1o2 has been widely used for the degradation of refractory contaminants due to its electrophilic nature cheng et al 2017 as previously reported 1o2 in pms activated process was mainly generated by pms self decomposition zhou et al 2015a by o 2 produced from h2o2 reacting with oh reshetnyak et al 2003 yan et al 2017b and by o2 which trapped activation energy from pms huang et al 2018 it is also reported that 1o2 could also be generated by carbon materials containing ketonic groups activated pms process li et al 2017 liang et al 2017 however 1o2 generation mechanism in electro catalytic system deserves further study in e pms process with acf cathode in this work an electrochemical process was combined with acf using acf as the cathode to activate pms e acf pms process the objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the performance of the e acf pms process in terms of cbz removal both by itself and in comparison with e acf pds 2 investigate the effects of anions natural organic matter nom and other factors on cbz removal 3 determine reactive species indentify 1o2 generation mechanisms and elucidate cbz degradation pathways in e acf pms 4 estimate the relative contribution of acf adsorption direct electron transfer det pms oxidation alone reactive

procedures all the experiments were conducted in a 500 ml glass column 10 cm diameter and 12 cm height using a dc power with 298 k and 800 rpm the distance between the anode pt plated titanium 50 mm 35 mm and the cathode acf pt plated titanium 50 mm 35 mm 3 mm was 2 cm all experiments except those designed to study the role of different water matrices were performed in 0 042 mm cbz solution with a fixed amount of oxidant pms or pds addition and without addition of a buffer the ph was controlled to the desired value with 0 5 m h2so4 and 1 m naoh in the experiments designed to study the role of ph and anions pms concentration was reduced to 10 mm in all the experiments the solutions were unbuffered except in the experiments focused on the ph effect buffered with 100 mm phosphate the cbz concentration in different water matrix experiments was 2 1 10 3 μm all samples obtained from the reaction solutions were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and 0 2 ml meoh was added before analysis

temperature 20 2 c initial algae concentration 105 cells ml the algae cells were exposed to cbz solutions treated by e acf pms process the treated cbz solutions were pretreated using the method shown

of removal efficiency of cbz 0 042 mm by the activation of pms in various processes are compared in fig s1 the process optimization included pms dosage current density and ph and it is described in text s6 cbz removal studies in aqueous solution by pms alone for 60 min illustrated a low removal efficiency 8 12 with a small amount 5 36 of pms consumed which demonstrated that the removal of cbz by pms was slow moreover after reacting for 60 min the removal efficiency of cbz was 54 22 for acf adsorption while the efficiency for acf pms was 61 07 with only 11 41 of the pms consumed these results illustrated that pms could be activated by acf but that the activation efficiency was not significant in addition the removal efficiency by e pt was 21 72 the results showed that cbz was removed slightly by electrolysis the removal efficiency improved to 71 58 by adding pms to the e pt process demonstrating that pms could easily be activated at the presence of electric field most importantly the removal efficiency in the e acf pms process reached 100 within 40 min no cbz was detected in solution which demonstrated that the electro acf activated process had better oxidation capacity than the other activated processes from the result of fig 1 all cbz removal processes satisfied first order kinetics r2 0 97 for the initial 40 min and the rate constants have been summarized in table s1 compared with electro activated and acf activated processes electro acf synergistic activated process was apparently effective for cbz removal and pms decomposition as shown in fig 1 and fig s1 for example the kapp and pms decomposition by the e acf pms process were 8 10 10 2 min 1 and 45 44 whereas the equivalent figures for the e pt pms process were only 2 09 10 2 min 1 and 37 87 respectively and those for acf pms process were 1 64 10 2 min 1 and 11 41 respectively these results indicated the presence of a synergistic effect between the acf activated pms and electro activated pms processes fig s1 b shows that pms was decomposed in electro acf processes more rapidly than in either electro activated processes or acf activated process as reported pms could be activated by both acf and electrolysis to generate s o 4 and oh eqs 2 4 wang and wang 2018a therefore the electro acf process enhanced decomposition of pms which may accelerate generation of s o 4 and oh 2 a c h s o 5 a c o h s o 4 3 a c h s o 5 a c o h s o 4 4 h s o 5 e o h s o 4 o r o h s o 4 2 3 2 comparison with pds kinetics and energy consumption pds is also a common oxidant in electrochemical oxidation processes to find the better oxidant between pds and pms in e acf process a series of comparison experiments was conducted as shown in fig s2 a e acf pds removed approximately 81 33 cbz after 60 min while the removal efficiency of cbz in e acf pms reached almost 100 within 40 min it should be noted that the e acf pms process had a k app approximately 2 5 times higher than that of the e acf pds process with about 10 higher oxide decomposition efficiency shown in fig s2 b and c in addition the results of toc analysis from fig s2 d showed that e acf pms process had a relatively higher mineralization efficiency of cbz all the results demonstrated that the e acf pms process tended to have better oxidation capacity than the e acf pds process in the e acf pms process only electric energy was consumed in cbz removal therefore electric energy per order ee o is an effective parameter to estimate energy consumption by this process ee o can be calculated from eq 5 the illustration of the eq 5 is shown in text s7 the calculating parameters and ee o values for the different processes are illustrated in table s2 5 e e o p t 1000 v 60 l g c 0 c t as shown in table s2 compared with electrolysis and the e pms process the ee o value for the e acf pms process was minimal addition of pms to the electrolysis process decreased the ee o value from 45 00 kwh m 3 to 7 53 kwh m 3 moreover having acf as the cathode in e pms process reduced the ee o value to 1 89 kwh m 3 which showed that the e acf pms could effectively reduce energy consumption in addition compared with the e acf pds system adding pms instead of pds into e acf system could reduce energy consumption by almost 2 times 5 57 kwh m 3 to 1 89 kwh m 3 suggesting that the e acf pms process was more energy efficient than the e acf pds process 3 3 effects of different water matrices anions e g p o 4 3 h c o 3 cl etc and nom are ubiquitous in natural water matrices and their presence will influence the aops reactions the effects of anions and nom on cbz removal using e acf pms process was deserved to explore the results of effects of phosphate p o 4 3 on the cbz removal efficiency in system are given in fig 2 a cbz removal efficiency decreased from 78 02 to 61 61 with increasing p o 4 3 concentration from 0 to 40 mm thus demonstrating an inhibiting effect of the presence of p o 4 3 although p o 4 3 could activate pms to generate oh and s o 4 lou et al 2014 it inhibited the pms reaction in e acf pms process this result could be attributed to the competing adsorption between po4 3 and pms and side reactions between po4 3 and free radicals as seen in fig 2 b addition of bicarbonate h c o 3 at concentrations ranging from 0 mm to 20 mm inhibited removal of cbz in behavior which could be attributed to the h c o 3 scavenging free radicals to produce low reactivity c o 3 as shown in eq 6 meanwhile h c o 3 could react with pms to form peroxymonocarbonate h c o 4 ahmadi and ghanbari 2019 richardson et al 2000 moreover excess bicarbonate ions in solution shared the space on the electrode surface with pms which resulted in the pms decomposition efficiency clearly declining under the same current density as illustrated in fig s9 b nevertheless increasing the bicarbonate concentration to 40 mm showed negligible effect on cbz removal this phenomenon appeared due to the change of ph brought about by the addition of excess h c o 3 adding 40 mm bicarbonate increased solution ph from 2 41 to 7 14 which benefitted the pms activated by e acf pms process it was also seen that pms decomposition results showed similar trend to that for cbz removal fig s9 b 6 x o h s o 4 x s o 4 2 h o chloride ion cl can react with free radicals to affect removal efficiency in aops as shown in fig 2 c adding cl to e acf pms process in low doses 1 4 mm showed different trends compared to the cbz removal in the presence of p o 4 3 or c o 3 2 the removal efficiency increased significantly from 26 58 without cl to 93 61 with 4 mm cl added this result can be explained through reference to three mechanisms firstly pms could directly react with cl compared with pms alone process cbz removal efficiency in the presence of 1 mm cl was enhanced significantly showed in fig s10 secondly cl could be oxidized by electrolysis to produce cl2 then cl2 could react with water to generate cl and clo which could contribute to cbz removal chung et al 2016 song et al 2017 as shown in fig s11 chloride ions could enhance the removal efficiency of cbz significantly in electrolysis process finally cl could react with oh and s o 4 to produce cloh and cl yu et al 2004 yu 2004 and then the cl could react with cl to generate c l 2 yu and barker 2003 it has been demonstrated that cl and c l 2 contributed more radicals to some ppcps like ba compared with s o 4 and this phenomenon may also be applicable to cbz guan et al 2018 nom is well known as scavenger of radicals and other oxidizing species which causes decrease in removal efficiency of ppcps in aops as can be seen fig 2 d increasing nom concentration enhanced the inhibition of cbz removal and the inhibition effect became quite apparent as the nom concentration increased to 20 mg l this result can be explained by the application of four different mechanisms 1 ha and cbz compete for adsorption at both acf cathode and pt anode 2 ha and cbz compete for det at the pt anode and scavenge free radicals in the system 3 ha and pms compete for adsorption on the pt anode and 4 ha and cbz compete for oxidation nonradical oxidation on the pt anode the decomposition of pms was also inhibited with nom addition as shown in fig s9 d 3 4 mechanism study 3 4 1 determining the reactive species in general oh and s o 4 are potential oxidizing species in pms activated process to determine the contribution of oh and s o 4 to cbz degradation in e acf pms process the effects of meoh and tba were investigated the rate constants for free radicals with meoh and tba have been listed in table s3 from the results shown in fig 3 a it can be seen that cbz removal efficiency in the presence of tba decreased from 96 39 to 69 42 after reaction for 40 min which indicated that oh plays an important role in cbz removal in addition cbz removal efficiency in the presence of meoh decreased remarkably from 96 39 to 63 89 after reaction for 40 min which suggested that s o 4 also played an important role for cbz removal in e acf pms process as can be seen in fig 4 cbz removal efficiency in the presence of 100 mm tba decreased from 98 50 to 35 71 after reaction for 40 min in the anodic chambers while it decreased to 31 53 in the presence of 100 mm meoh the significant difference demonstrated that pms could be activated at the anode to generate oh and s o 4 the similar result in the cathodic chambers demonstrated that pms could be also activated at cathode numerous research studies have shown the generation of 1o2 in pms activated process and that pms can slowly generate 1o2 by self decomposition however the possibility of 1o2 being produced in e acf pms process was unclear and required investigation as shown in table s3 the rate constants of 1o2 with meoh and tba were only 3 0 103 m 1 s 1 and 1 8 103 m 1 s 1 respectively while the rate constant of 1o2 with ffa was high up to 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 which was about 5 orders of magnitude higher than those of meoh and tba ffa also has relatively high rate constant with oh 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 thus we chose 100 mm meoh and 6 mm ffa for the tests so that the scavenging capacities for oh were in the same order of magnitude 9 7 107 s 1 and 9 0 107 s 1 respectively meanwhile the scavenging capacities of meoh and ffa for 1o2 could differ by 3 orders of magnitude 3 0 102 s 1 and 7 2 105 s 1 respectively finally the test results presented in fig 3 a showed that degradation of cbz was more strongly inhibited by adding 6 mm ffa than by adding 100 mm meoh a result which confirmed that 1o2 was likely to be an important oxidizing species in e acf pms process in addition a typical three line epr spectrum with equal intensities was obtained indicating that 1o2 was produced in the e acf pms process fig 3 b as reported 1o2 in pms activated process was mainly generated by pms self decomposition eq 7 zhou et al 2015a by o 2 produced from h 2 o 2 reacting with oh eqs 8 11 reshetnyak et al 2003 yan et al 2017b by o2 which trapped activation energy from pms eq 12 huang et al 2018 and by oh reacting with pms eq 13 zhou et al 2015b to verify the 1o2 generation path in e acf pms process excess tba 100 mm was added to scavenge oh and nitrogen gas was continually introduced into the system to exclude oxygen gas which dissolved in water and was produced by electrolysis however the results in fig s12 showed that the present of oxygen did not cause obvious inhibition on cbz removal it demonstrated that eq 12 did not play an important role in 1o2 generation in addition as shown in fig s13 there was no obvious h 2 o 2 only about 2 mg l after reaction for 60 min detected in e acf pms process moreover adding excess h 2 o 2 5 times higher than that produced in fig s14 to e pt pms process led to slight effect on cbz removal and so taken together these results showed that eqs 8 11 did not play important roles in 1o2 generation either to explore the mechanism of 1o2 generation in electrochemically activated pms process experiments on the effects of radical scavengers were conducted individually at the anode and cathode the anodic and cathodic chambers were divided by a cation exchange membrane in the anodic chambers cbz removal efficiencies in the present of 6 mm ffa or 100 mm meoh were 31 38 and 44 24 with the difference value of 12 86 respectively however the efficiencies in the cathodic chambers under the same conditions were 5 94 and 37 26 with the difference value of 31 32 respectively fig 4 the difference values demonstrated that 1o2 may be generated at both the anode and cathode but mainly produced at the cathode in electrochemical process oh could be generated by the electrolysis of h2o at cathode as a result eq 13 may play an important role in 1o2 generation the effect of oh in the generation of 1o2 was tested 1 m meoh was added to scavenge oh and s o 4 buffered with 100 mm phosphate as shown in fig s7 the removal efficiency of cbz under alkaline conditions ph 9 is higher than that under acid condition ph 5 it indicated that eq 13 is a path of 1o2 generation in this system however it can not be ignored that the ph value decreased to 1 63 rapidly as 50 mm pms added into e acf process therefore even if oh could be produced by electrolysis process at the cathode it could be quickly neutralized in the acidic solution as a result the pathway of 1o2 generation through eq 13 could only occur on cathode but it was not the main pathway it demonstrated that there was another way of 1o2 generation in the e acf pms process oh could be considered as the production of oh lose electrons in conclusion we inferred that 1o2 was mostly produced at the cathode as reaction 14 meanwhile the effects of meoh 100 mm and 1m were studied in the cathode chamber both oh and s o 4 could be completely captured by excessive meoh in the e acf pms process therefore the difference in cbz removal efficiency was mainly caused by 1o2 as can be seen in fig s17 changing the concentration of meoh had little effect on cbz removal in the cathode the result also demonstrated that oh played an important role in the generation of 1o2 eq 14 7 h s o 5 s o 5 2 h s o 4 s o 4 o 1 2 8 h s o 5 h 2 o h s o 4 h 2 o 2 9 h 2 o 2 o h h o 2 h 2 o 10 h o 2 h o 2 11 o 2 o h o h o 1 2 12 o 2 e n e r g y o 1 2 13 h s o 5 s o 5 2 o h 2 s o 4 2 h 2 o o 1 2 14 h s o 5 s o 5 2 o h e 2 s o 4 2 h 2 o o 1 2 3 4 2 estimation of the relative contribution in e acf pms process the removal of cbz can occur through five routes acf adsorption det pms oxidation alone ros oxidation oh s o 4 and 1o2 and nonradical oxidation in this study we assumed that adding 10 m methyl alcohol into pms activated process could scavenge all available oh s o 4 and 1o2 completely as shown in table 1 the proportions of det pms oxidation alone and nonradical oxidation were only 3 46 2 10 and 1 36 in e acf pms process respectively meanwhile the proportion is 78 02 ros oxidation and 15 06 for acf adsorption in e acf pms process apparently ros oxidation played the dominant role in cbz removal in e acf pms process there are two kinds of ros oxidation including free radicals generated by electrolysis alone at the anode oh and s o 4 as per reactions 15 and 16 and electrolysis acf pt catalyzing pms in both the electrode and solution oh s o 4 and 1o2 ros produced by electrolysis alone accounted for just 2 35 in e acf pms process whereas those from electrolysis acf pt catalyzed pms accounted for 75 67 the relative contributions of oh s o 4 and 1o2 were estimated by the method in text s8 and the results were summarized in table s4 as shown in table s4 the proportions of oh s o 4 and 1o2 in contribution of cbz degradation were 58 86 29 27 and 11 87 in ros process respectively 15 h 2 o o h h e 16 s o 4 2 s o 4 e 3 4 3 proposed pathway of cbz degradation fifteen main degradation byproducts were observed in e acf pms process by uplc ims qtof ms fig s15 table s5 intermediates were identified by their mass to charge ratio m z and specific molecular ions the products at m z 193 and m z 210 have been reported in an electrochemically activated chlorine process daniel garcia espinoza et al 2018 while the m z 258 product has been identified in a δ mno2 oxidation process zhai et al 2018 other products were also identified in electrolysis and electrochemically activated pds processes song et al 2018 based on the general rules of cbz electrochemical oxidation and the by products observed with the uplc ims qtof ms five pathways for carbamazepine degradation by e acf pms process have been proposed in fig 5 in comparison with e acf pms process only pathways і ii and iii took place in e acf pds process in fig s16 the production of 1o2 in e acf pms process is likely to be the main reason for this distinction fig s18 3 5 acf recycling experiment 3 5 1 effect of acf recycling on cbz removal some previous studies have reported that activated carbon was destroyed after prolonged service under ozone or persulfate oxidation lee et al 2013b zhang et al 2016 to explore acf reuse efficiency it was recycled in acf pms system for 30 times and in e acf pms system for 50 times as shown in fig 6 acf in acf pms system showed strong deactivation after 30 cycles with the cbz removal efficiency decreasing from 61 07 to 13 99 however acf in e acf pms system showed sustainable activity after 50 cycles with the cbz removal efficiency only decreasing from 100 to 92 19 3 5 2 sem and bet of acf before and after recycling to explore the influence of acf over prolonged periods of pms activation in present or absence of an electric field sem and bet analyses were employed to characterize acf to examine possible damage to acf after recycling in acf pms and e acf pms processes sem images of acf taken before and after recycling are provided in fig 7 the sem images provide strong evidence for acf deactivation as can be seen the surfaces of acfvirgin and acfe acf pms50 were smooth and less adsorbed on the surface of acfe acf pms50 whereas the surface of acfacf pms50 was damaged and had adsorbed much substance in addition the surface of acfe acf pds50 was not damaged but had adsorbed more adsorbate than acfe acf pms50 this could be the reason why the acf in e acf pds process was decreased activity after prolonged use to verify the structural changes of the acfs after reuse bet surface area and micropore volumes of acf samples were measured and have been listed in table 2 the data of bet smicropore and vmicropore showed that electro activated process performed well in maintaining the properties of acf in addition the n2 adsorption isotherm for the acf samples displayed in fig s19 confirmed that the adsorption capacity of acf in the e pds process decreased markedly when compared with that in the e pms process the sustainable acf activity in e acf pms process can be attributed to two reasons on one hand acf could have its activity reduced after providing electrons for activate pms to produce s o 4 for a prolonged period however the electric field could maintain acf activity by supplying electrons that were lost in the pms activation process by acf on the other hand the continual adsorption of incompletely degraded cbz and its byproducts may have inhibited further adsorption and reaction between pms and acf the high removal efficiency of cbz in e acf pms process could reduce the adsorption of cbz and its byproducts consequently sustained the activity of acf as shown in fig 6 c it was worth noting that the removal efficiency of cbz in e acf pds system declined from 81 33 to 34 76 after acf reuse for 50 times in our previous study acf in e acf pds process was able to remain active under higher current and higher pds concentration liu et al 2018b compared with e acf pds process e acf pms system was more effective and sustainable for water treatment 3 6 removal efficiency of other persistent organic pollutants the organics smx tc dc and nb were individually removed by e acf pms process and the results are shown in fig 8 all the reactions were under the initial ph of 3 and the reaction rates of the target organics showed remarkable variation smx and tc removed within 10 min and dc almost completely removed within 60 min on the other hand nb required a longer time to be eliminated 83 91 of nb was removed after reaction for 60 min all these results confirmed that e acf pms process was an effective technology for various persistent organic pollutants removal 3 7 performance in actual surface water and tap water the surface water and tap water belonging to actual water matrices were conducted on e acf pms process to evaluate cbz removal the parameters for the different water matrices are shown in table s6 it can be seen that surface water had higher concentrations of dissolved organic content doc bicarbonate and phosphate which were found to inhibit the removal of cbz in e acf pms process in addition surface water had a high concentration of cl which was found to promote the removal of cbz in e acf pms process from the results in section 3 4 the result presented in fig 9 showed that cbz removal efficiency in surface water was 83 84 after reaction for 60 min while cbz was not detected in tap water after reaction for 25 min the relatively low removal efficiency in surface water could be caused by the combined effects of the all inhibitory concentrations 176 69 mg l of doc bicarbonate and phosphate which were significantly higher than the promotional concentration 12 7 mg l of chlorine ion the removal of cbz by e acf pms process in surface water also reached to 83 and these results indicated that e acf pms process has potential in purifying natural water with a complex composition the comparison between using pms and pds in electro acf activated process is presented in fig 9 compared with pms the pds based process showed a lower cbz removal efficiency in both surface water and tap water overall the results of this study demonstrated the use of pms results in better contaminant removal efficiencies than the use of pds in the respective electro acf activated process for treating ppcps in actual water matrices 3 8 toxicological implications of transformation products to estimate the toxicity of byproducts generated from by e acf activated processes algae growth experiments were conducted in solutions of cbz and mixtures of resulting degradation products formed in e acf pms and e acf pds processes operated for 1 h as shown in fig 10 all algae growth data showed inhibition in solutions treated by e acf pds and e acf pms similar as other aops byproducts produced in e acf activated process were toxic to organisms park et al 2016 yang et al 2017 the algae cells density in e acf pds treated solution increased from 1 41 105 to 82 17 105 cells ml in 10 days whereas it increased from 1 40 105 to 95 47 105 cells ml in e acf pms treated solution the difference can be attributed to higher cbz degradation efficiency in e acf pms process the results implied that e acf pms process was probably less toxic than e acf pds process 4 conclusions in this study the combination of peroxymonosulfate pms and electrolysis with acf as the cathode e acf pms was systematically investigated and the process was found to exhibit high cbz removal efficiency energy calculations showed that e acf pms process could reduce energy consumption more effectively in the removal of cbz than other processes the removal efficiencies were promoted with the increasing of pms concentration current density as well as ph however the presence of p o 4 3 h c o 3 and nom inhibited cbz removal except for c l experiments focused to examine the role of reactive species and to estimate the relative contributions of involved reactions demonstrated that oxidation reactions involving ros such as oh s o 4 and 1o2 played a major role in cbz degradation it is worth noting that 1o2 was mainly generated on the cathode rather than generated from o 2 or o2 additionally cbz degradation pathways have also been proposed surprisingly acf remained practically undamaged i e it avoided oxidation by pms and maintained its adsorption capacity and catalytic activity after prolonged service e acf pms process also showed high efficiency on cbz removal in natural water matrices as well as effectiveness in the removal of other contaminants of concern such as smx tc dc and nb in addition the toxicological experiments revealed that degradation of cbz by e acf pms process exhibited low toxicity all results confirmed that e acf pms process could be suitable for application in the oxidation of persistent organic pollutants in water declaration of interest statement the authors

18771,this study aims at testing the effectiveness of positive matrix factorization in characterizing groundwater and surface water quality in terms of identifying main hydrochemical features and processes natural and anthropogenic that govern them this method is applied in a hydro system featured by a strong interrelation between groundwater and surface water and highly impacted by agricultural activities therefore a holistic approach considering groundwater together with the surface water bodies consisting in lake several rivers and springs was used multivariate statistical analysis in particular factor analysis has been proved to be effective in elaborating and interpreting water quality data highlighting the information carried within them but it presents some limitations it does not consider data uncertainty and it groups variables which are correlated positively and negatively moreover in some cases the resulting factors are not clearly interpretable describing each one various overlapping features processes here positive matrix factorization is applied to groundwater and surface water quality data and the results are compared to those obtained through a factor analysis in terms of both factor profiles and their spatial distribution through a gis approach results of isotopes analysis are used to validate pmf output and support interpretation positive matrix factorization allows to consider data uncertainty and the solution respects two positivity constraints based on the concept of chemical mass balance which leads to a more environmentally interpretable solution results show that positive matrix factorization identifies five different factors reflecting main features and natural and anthropogenic processes affecting the study area 1 surface water used for irrigation 2 groundwater subjected to reducing processes at advanced stages 3 groundwater subjected to reducing processes at early stages 4 groundwater residence time and 5 the effects of the agricultural land use on both groundwater and surface water positive matrix factorization leads to a more detailed understanding of the studied system as compared to factor analysis which identifies only three factors with overlapping information based on the results of this study positive matrix factorization could be a useful technique to perform groundwater and surface water quality characterization and to reach a deeper understanding of the phenomena that govern water chemistry graphical abstract image 1 keywords multivariate statistical analysis water quality positive matrix factorization factor analysis oglio river 1 introduction groundwater and surface water are the main sources of freshwater and drinking water in many regions worldwide their quality should be preserved in order to guarantee the fulfilment of the different water needs by humans and ecosystems groundwater and surface water quality could be affected by several factors and processes such as anthropogenic impacts and natural phenomena as well as groundwater surface water interrelationships the understanding of the different water and pollution sources and the processes that affect them is fundamental to obtain an exhaustive characterization of water resources quality to this end the implementation of a proper water quality monitoring network is fundamental but it is also crucial to properly manage elaborate and interpret the collected data in order to gather all the information contained within them in the last decades attention toward multivariate statistical analysis increased dramatically as a tool to analyse water chemical data several authors performed principal component analysis pca factor analysis fa or cluster analysis ca to investigate groundwater and surface water chemical data and identify natural phenomena blake et al 2016 koh et al 2016 shrestha et al 2016 as well as anthropogenic impacts affecting water quality alberti et al 2016 devic et al 2014 gu et al 2018 phung et al 2015 stefania et al 2018 positive matrix factorization pmf paatero and tapper 1994 is a multivariate analysis aimed at source identification and apportionment specifically designed to cope with environmental data and manage their uncertainty and distributions pmf is specifically appropriate for environmental data because 1 it takes into account the analytical uncertainties often associated with measurements of environmental samples and 2 forces all of the values in the solution profiles and contributions to be positive which can lead to a more realistic representation of the system than solutions from other multivariate methods like pca reff et al 2007 in the last two decades pmf has been widely used in studies concerning air pollution since it was specifically designed to cope with application where mass balance is a key aspect and a known source is present particularly pmf has been widely applied to perform source apportionment of particulate matter and aerosol in several countries e g belis et al 2011 bozzetti et al 2017 daellenbach et al 2017 fortner et al 2018 kuang et al 2015 mohr et al 2012 2015 sowlat et al 2016 visser et al 2015 yan et al 2016 only in the last years a few authors applied pmf on datasets concerning different environmental compartments to reach a more realistic representation of the sources affecting different systems comero et al 2011 applied pmf on a geochemical dataset on sediments from 11 alpine lakes located in italy identifying four interpretable factors related to the mineralogical chemical features of lake sediments in the catchment area comero et al 2012 used pmf on soil sample on an abandoned mine dump in italy and supported the interpretation of the sources with a gis approach zheng et al 2014 performed a comprehensive study investigating with pmf the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in soils samples shao et al 2014 used pmf model to better understand the pahs sources in a karst water system soonthornnonda et al 2008 used chemical mass balance and pmf modelling in order to find origins of flows and pollutants in combined sewer wastewater pekey et al 2013 investigated through pmf analysis sources affecting surface sediment samples in a bay in turkey haji gholizadeh et al 2016 identified and quantified the potential pollution sources affecting the water quality of three major rivers of south florida by means of pmf the low uptake of pmf in water research compared to air pollution field is due to the lower suitability of water quality data to fit the requirements of the technique some limitations that could limit a successful pmf analysis are for instance 1 pmf requires only data expressed as concentration while some typical measurement of water samples have different units e g ph electrical conductivity oxidation reduction potential isotopes analysis age tracers thus they cannot be directly fed into a pmf model 2 a proper monitoring network specifically designed to capture the variability of the system and its contamination sources is crucial to obtain a complete representation of the system with a pmf analysis and 3 in cases where a single source is present a multivariate statistical analysis such as pmf might not be appropriate despite these limitations the potential advantages of pmf i e the inclusion of analytical uncertainties and the positivity constraints could be useful when investigating groundwater and surface water quality dataset to perform water quality characterization the aim of this work is to test the effectiveness of pmf as a tool to support water quality characterization intended to define the main hydrochemical features pollution phenomena and processes governing them such as groundwater surface water interactions here pmf is applied to a dataset concerning groundwater spring river and lake water collected within the oglio river basin located in the po plain n italy this area was subjected to previous studies rotiroti et al 2019a 2019b which identified main hydrochemical features and processes governing them so the information obtained through the pmf analysis can be tested with a known conceptual model of the study area the results of the pmf are then compared with those of a traditional multivariate statistical analysis such a fa in order to make a comparison with a more widely used multivariate technique to the best of the authors knowledge pmf has never been applied to characterize the water quality of a whole hydro system using a dataset consisting in groundwater and surface water samples moreover additional innovative aspects of this work are 1 both factor contributions to the samples and the residuals of the model are spatially analysed through gis approach and their interpretation is supported by considering the land use and hydrogeological features 2 results of the pmf model are validated through a comparison with water isotope data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the part of the oglio river basin po plain n italy that covers 2000 km2 around the oglio river between the outflow from lake iseo and the confluence with mella river fig 1 in this part of its course the oglio river receives water from 5 tributaries which are the cherio river the scolmatore di genivolta channel the saverona stream the strone river and the mella river fig 1 as regards the geomorphology fig 2 a and hydrogeology the study area can be divided into two parts with different characteristics rotiroti et al 2019a 2019b 1 the higher plain in the northern part that hosts a mono layer unconfined aquifer mainly composed of sands and gravels and 2 the lower plain in the southern part of the study area that hosts a multi layer aquifer where several layers of sands and silty clays alternate vertically this hydrogeological setting features the entire alpine sector of the po plain giuliano 1995 perego et al 2014 the transition zone between the higher and the lower plain is known as the springs belt as natural groundwater outflows are largely present all over the width of the area groundwater flows mainly from north to south rotiroti et al 2019a as regards the relationship between oglio river and groundwater the first stretch of oglio river i e from the outflow from lake iseo to approximately 20 30 km downstream is losing then it becomes gaining up to the confluence with mella river rotiroti et al 2019a lake iseo site lter eu it 008 southern alpine lakes www lter europe net is the fourth largest italian lake it has been classified as warm monomictic water temperatures do not drop below 4 c and water mixing occurring during or close to winter however due to their morphological characteristics and climatic conditions the lake does not reach a full thermal and chemical homogenisation every year and the complete water overturn over the last 40 years has happened only occasionally in 2005 and 2006 leoni et al 2014a pareeth et al 2017 so the lake can presently be regarded as holo oligomictic in the last five years the depth of mixing range between 30 and 75 m below the surface strongly influencing the physical and chemical features of epilimnion and of outlet waters lake iseo has been affected by an increase in mean total phosphorus concentrations since the 1970s phosphorus concentrations gradually increased in water column after 2005 from about 60 to 90 100 μg l and in epilimnion lightly decrease from 38 to 18 μg l during the last five years leoni et al 2014b marti et al 2016 rogora et al 2018 the land use of the area is mainly agricultural fig 2b the most frequent crop is corn mainly cultivated for the purpose of animal husbandry feeding cattle and pig within the area two different irrigation techniques are used respectively in the higher and the lower plain in the former irrigation water mainly comes from the oglio river through a complex network of irrigation channels in the latter the main source of water for irrigation is groundwater abstracted through hundreds of irrigation wells fig 2c in the higher plain that is formed by coarse sediments and thus has higher permeability irrigation water sourced by the oglio river constitutes a main source of aquifer recharge rotiroti et al 2019a as regards groundwater quality two main problems affect the study area rotiroti et al 2019a a a diffuse nitrate contamination in the higher plain such as in most of the higher part of the whole po plain cinnirella et al 2005 lasagna et al 2016 martinelli et al 2018 and b the natural contamination by mn fe as and nh4 in the lower plain such as in most of the lower part of the whole po plain carraro et al 2015 molinari et al 2012 rotiroti et al 2014 the former is mainly related to the agricultural land use and particularly to fertilization practices although point sources from sewage systems can be relevant in some cases sacchi et al 2013 rotiroti et al 2017 the latter is related to the hydrogeological and hydrochemical properties of the lower plain aquifer system that is multi layered and contains relevant amounts of buried organic matter as peat sediments these feed the ecological succession of terminal electron accepting processes leading to reducing conditions and high concentrations of mn fe as and nh4 rotiroti et al 2015 carraro et al 2015 concerning the water quality of surface water lake iseo has a better water quality as compared to the oglio river which has higher no3 concentrations due to the gaining of groundwater from the higher plain that is affected by no3 spring water is also affected by no3 since the spring belt constitutes in fact a surface outflow of groundwater from the higher plain tributaries of oglio river have generally worse water quality with respect to the oglio river itself being more impacted by anthropogenic activities rotiroti et al 2019a 2 2 available data the available dataset is the result of four field surveys conducted in the study area during february 2016 june 2016 september 2016 and march 2017 in each campaign samples from 68 monitoring points were collected including a total amount of 270 samples among the monitoring points 44 are wells 17 are rivers 12 stations on the oglio river and 5 tributaries 6 are springs and 1 is the lake iseo each sample was analysed for dissolved oxygen do total phosphorous p tot alkalinity as hco3 major ions ca mg na k cl so4 no3 and nh4 trace elements as fe and mn and stable water isotopes δ18o and δ2h as regards water sampling from wells they were purged until physico chemical parameters were stable generally after 2 3 well volumes were removed the do was measured in the field using the wtw multi 3430 meter in a flow cell each water sample was filtered through 0 2 μm filters on the field and samples for as fe and mn analysis were acidified with nitric acid after collection samples were stored in a portable fridge at 4 c alkalinity was analysed by h2so4 titration within 24 h from the sampling major ions were analysed by ion chromatography ammonium was analysed by spectrophotometry with nessler s reagent within 24 h from the sampling iron and manganese were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes whereas arsenic was analysed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry gfaas water isotopes were analysed by wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy ws crds the analytical uncertainty of the data was calculated for each set of analysed samples particularly before every set of analysis a standard solution was measured the analytical uncertainty was calculated as the percent difference between the value of a standard solution and the measurement with the analytical instruments furthermore since previous studies highlighted that field sampling operations can give a significant contribution to the total uncertainty grøn et al 2007 witczak 2006 with values up to 18 roy and fouillac 2004 the sampling uncertainty was also accounted the uncertainty related to the sampling transport and stocking of the samples was assumed to be 10 this value was chosen according with the average variation of measured concentrations 14 between two consecutive years in the same season i e winter 2016 and winter 2017 considered here as a proxy of the uncertainty related to sampling operations analytical and field sampling uncertainty were combined according with the recommendations of the eu project bridge witczak 2006 the main statistics of the data and their combined uncertainty are reported in table 1 the resulting concentration dataset used as input for the pmf together with the uncertainty dataset is a data matrix consisting in 270 samples described by 14 variables do p tot alkalinity as hco3 ca mg na k cl so4 no3 nh4 as fe and mn water isotopes were excluded from pmf since they are not conventionally expressed as a mass concentration and thus they cannot be directly inserted as an input of the pmf analysis however water isotopes were used for a validation of the pmf results 2 3 positive matrix factorization pmf paatero and tapper 1994 is a multivariate analysis in which the fundamental problem is to resolve the identities and contributions of different sources in a mixture the bilinear factorises a multivariate dataset into two matrices g and f leading to a reproduction of the dataset variability as a linear combination of a set of constant factors profile and their contribution to each sample unlike fa or pca and similarly to other techniques e g parallel factor analysis parafac in the pmf model no constraint are imposed about the orthogonality of the factors on the other hand other constraints are considered aimed at reproducing natural physical limit of the system which are a the composition of predicted source must be positive a source cannot have a negative contribution of an element b the predicted source contribution to each sample must all be positive a source cannot contribute to a sample with a negative mass the solution of the problem is found through a weighted least squares approach aimed at minimizing the value of the object function q for a given number of factor p q is defined as 1 q i 1 n i 1 m x i j k 1 p g i k f k j σ i j 2 where σ ij is the uncertainty of species j concentration data in the i th sample m is the number of analytes and n is the number of samples it transpires that the solution to the pmf problem depends on estimating uncertainties for each of the data points of the pmf input hopke 2000 in environmental datasets three types of data are typically available 1 in most of cases samples have concentration value that has been determined x ij and their associated uncertainty σ ij 2 there are samples in which certain species could not be precisely determined because their concentration was below the detection limit 3 missing data which have not been measured in the present study the following method to determine concentrations value and their associated error estimates was used according to polissar et al 1998 and reff et al 2007 2 x i j k c i j k for determined values x i j k d i j k 2 for values below detection limit x i j k c i j k for missing values 3 σ i j k u i j k d i j k 3 for determined values σ i j k 5 6 d i j k for values below detection limit σ i j k 4 c i j k for missing values where c i j k u i j k and d i j k are respectively the measured concentration the analytical uncertainty and the method detection limit for sample i element j and sampling site k c i j k is the geometric mean of the measured concentration of the element j at sampling site k to explore the reliability of different variables and different samples the signal to noise s n value was considered which is the ratio between the concentration and its uncertainty data with a low signal to noise i e s n between 0 2 and 2 are considered weak while data with a s n lower than 0 2 are considered bad in this work weak and bad concentrations values have been downscaled during the pmf analysis according to paatero and hopke 2003 concerning to the data weighting another important aspect to consider is the weight of extreme values environmental data typically show a skewed distribution with a heavy tail due to the presence of samples with higher concentration of certain species as compared to other samples these data can have a significant leverage on the solution of the model comero et al 2009 thus it is possible run the model in the so called robust mode where the extreme values influence is reduced in the robust mode the objective function is changed as follows 4 q r o b u s t i 1 n i 1 m e i j h i j σ i j 2 where h i j 1 for e i j σ i j α h i j e i j σ i j α for e i j σ i j α an α 4 value is suggested paatero 1997 and widely used buzcu et al 2003 cui et al 2018 kim and hopke 2004 li et al 2004 the total q value depends on the size of the data matrix thus for a more meaningful monitoring of the solution quality q value is normalized by qexp representing the degrees of freedom of the model which is both a function of the data matrix size n m and of the number of factors p 5 q e x p n m p n m n m in the present work the pmf algorithm was solved using the multilinear engine me 2 solver paatero 1999 the source finder toolkit sofi version 6 3 canonaco et al 2013 for igor pro software package wavematrics inc portland or usa was used to configure the me 2 model for the data downweighting and for post analysis unlike pca and fa for the pmf model it is not common to choose the number of factors by means of standardized methods but it is common practice to investigate solutions with different numbers of factors and observe q qexp the residual distributions as well as the environmental interpretability of the predicted factors e g brown et al 2015 karanasiou et al 2011 choosing the number of factor is a trade off increasing the number of factor always reduces the residual but too many factors can lead the model to split a meaningful factor into unrealistic ones e g yan et al 2016 obtaining solution which are no more environmentally interpretable here several runs with an increasing number of factors from two to seven were done and the solution was chosen based on the above mentioned criteria for the final solution 50 pmf runs with different seeds where performed and convergence was achieved for each run the main sources of uncertainty of a pmf solution are rotational ambiguity and random error in data values paatero et al 2014 uncertainty caused by rotational ambiguity arises because bilinear factor analytic models are ill posed which means that there are several solutions g f with the same q value henry 1987 the problem of rotations was discussed in paatero et al 2002 and paatero and hopke 2009 to assess rotational ambiguity the method proposed by paatero et al 2002 was here implemented it consists in assessing the rotational ambiguity of the selected pmf solution base case by using it as starting point for several runs i e without starting from pseudo random values in which different rotational parameter are set here at each run the factor profiles were constrained around the profiles of the selected base case solution with an α value randomly selected at each iteration between 0 and 1 the α value 0 α 1 determines the range in which the resolved factors may deviate from input values to assess the total uncertainty of the chosen pmf solution the effect of random error was investigated through a bootstrap analysis davison and hinkley 1997 this technique consists in iteratively randomly resampling a subset of data from the original dataset with their related uncertainty and performing the pmf analysis on each generated dataset at each iteration the data are perturbed by replicating part of the rows of the dataset i e samples while others are removed so that at each iteration the total amount of samples is kept constant paatero et al 2014 at each bootstrap iteration the resampled data includes on average 64 of the total original data per bootstrap run a total of 100 iterations have been performed the solution presented in the results session is the average solution calculated on the 100 performed runs bootstrap analysis and rotation were implemented using sofi pro version 6 4 2 4 factor analysis to compare the effectiveness of pmf with a more widely used technique fa analysis has been performed on the same dataset fa is a multivariate statistical analysis aimed at finding association between parameters by reducing the number of measured parameters to a limited number of factors which can explain the majority of the data variance avoiding redundant information and noise within the data papaioannou et al 2009 an important aspect of factor analysis is that the resulting factors are orthogonal and therefore not correlated the software ibm spss was used for performing fa the correlation matrix was used to perform factor analysis so that no need of a previous data autoscaling was needed todeschini 1998 the kaiser criterion kaiser 1958 was used to determine the significant factors it consists in selecting factors with an eigenvalue higher or equal to 1 after the selection of the relevant factors varimax rotation was applied which is an orthogonal rotation aiming at differentiating the original variables by extracted factor factor scores were analysed through gis system to understand their spatial variability 3 results and discussion 3 1 pmf the results of pmf showed that the best number of factors to properly represent the system is five table 2 in fact the first 5 factors were environmentally interpretable while increasing the number of factors would have only led to split existing factors into two similar sub factors therefore the solution with five factors was chosen and it is presented here while the solutions with four and six factors are shown as an example respectively in figs s1 and s2 results here presented are the average and the standard deviations over the 100 pmf runs qexp is 3780 while for the averaged solution qrobust is 17605 and qtrue 30420 qrobust is the actual error function that is minimized by the pmf model while qtrue is the hypothetical q value calculated after the solution convergence without downscaling the scaled residuals outside the 4 4 range the epa pmf user guide norris et al 2014 reports that similar qtrue and qrobust would be a symptom of overestimated analytical uncertainty implying that the model is not actually running in the robust mode while the difference between qtrue and qrobust is a measure of the presence of sources that are not consistently represented within the dataset in this case the ratio between qtrue and qrobust is 1 7 which indicates that the considered dataset comes under the second case indeed all the considered variables are positively skewed and particularly 10 out of 14 variables are highly skewed skewness between 1 and 4 furthermore ca 400 values of the data matrix are mathematically considerable outliers highly skewed variables and outliers are common in environmental datasets the risk is that they could have a higher leverage compared to lower values in the pmf solution which is not recommendable and the role of the robust mode is to reduce these higher leverages so that they can become comparable to those of lower values table 2 shows the relative contribution of each variable to each factor namely it is the f matrix of eqn 1 the values of table 2 are related to the concentration of each compound so that compounds with higher concentration have higher contributions in order to better appreciate the role of trace elements which have smaller concentration fig 3 shows the fraction of each variable represented by each factor allowing to understand by which factors every compound is represented the first factor red bar in fig 3 is characterized mainly by oxygen and secondly by major ions such as so4 hco3 cl ca mg na and k in this factor there is neither nitrate nor reduced species such as as fe and mn the profile of this factor coincides with the characteristics of surface water bodies directly connected with subalpine lakes more specifically it seems to represent the water of lake iseo which has higher so4 content compared to the other subalpine lakes salmaso et al 2007 the map of the spatial variability of factor 1 fig 4 a shows higher values in the lake iseo and in the oglio river which originates from it confirming the above tributaries have lower values of this factor as compared to the oglio river which is due firstly to a lower content of sulphate that in the oglio river comes mostly from the lake iseo and secondarily to a higher anthropogenic impact on the tributaries which lowers the oxygen content oxygen in the oglio river is kept high by the turbulence of the flow that determines an auto depuration even if sources of organic matter are present relevant values of factor 1 are also achieved in several wells in the higher plain fig 4a this is related to the aquifer recharge made by irrigation water sourced from the oglio river that is the main source of irrigation water in the higher plain sect 2 1 therefore this factor that represents lake iseo and oglio river water is able to trace aquifer recharge made by irrigation water sourced from oglio river the second factor orange bar in fig 3 is characterized by the reduced species as fe nh4 and mn together with p tot and na this leads us to consider the second factor as a proxy for reducing conditions more specifically it traces reduced conditions that evolved at advanced stages where nh4 is higher as the product of protracted organic matter degradation so4 is lower as the result of ongoing or occurred sulphate reduction dissolved fe and mn are higher as the products of mn and fe oxides reduction that can lead also to higher as and p tot values mcarthur et al 2004 rotiroti et al 2014 the spatial variability of this factor fig 4b shows that the sampling points with higher values are wells in the lower plain where as pollution is stronger i e mean as concentrations 40 μg l conversely groundwater samples in the higher plain and surface water samples have no contribution of this factor on this basis the second factor which identifies reducing condition at advanced stages is able to trace as pollution which affects groundwater in the lower plain the third factor blue bar in fig 3 is mainly characterized by mn and so4 and secondly by mg and k the higher concentrations of mn and so4 indicate the presence of reducing conditions at an earlier stage with respect to factor 2 characterized by the occurrence of mn oxide reduction with sulphate reduction that is not favoured yet concerning the spatial distribution of factor 3 fig 4c sampling points with the highest values of this factor are located at the transition between higher and lower plain aquifers and this is consistent with the above since here groundwater is passing from the oxidising conditions of the higher plain to the reducing conditions of the lower plain so mn oxide reduction can be favoured conversely groundwater samples in the higher plain and surface water samples have no contribution of this factor the fourth factor green bar in fig 3 is characterized by only major ions such as hco3 cl ca mg na and k major ions concentration in groundwater can be mainly driven by water rock interactions higher major ions concentrations can be reached as groundwater residence times become longer therefore this factor can be associated to groundwater residence times fig 4d shows the spatial variability of this factor highlighting an increase of its value from the higher to the lower plain this agrees with the hydrogeological features of the study area which has coarse sediments in the higher plain promoting faster groundwater circulation and so determining shorter residence times and fine sediments in the lower plain that determine slower groundwater circulation and so longer residence times surface water samples downstream show higher values of this factor highlighting the gaining behaviour of the river and therefore the increasing effect of groundwater to surface water the fifth factor light blue bar in fig 3 describes the total variability of the variable no3 with contributions also in terms of cl so4 ca and mg nitrate occurrence in groundwater can be associated with the use of organic and synthetic fertilizers recent studies jalali 2011 menció et al 2016 highlighted that an excessive use of fertilizers determines also a linear increase of the major ions cl so4 ca and mg in water thus the profile of this fifth factor can represent the impact related to the excessive use of fertilizers in agriculture not just in terms of no3 but also considering the contribution of the above mentioned major ions this allows to separate the amount of cl ca and mg determined by this anthropogenic source from the natural amount of these elements in water factor 4 concerning the spatial variability of this fifth factor fig 4e it shows high contributions in the samples collected from the higher plain aquifer that is more vulnerable since it is formed by coarse sediments and springs that are a surface outflow of higher plain groundwater conversely in the lower plain the values of this factor are low due to the occurrence of denitrification that lowers no3 concentrations close to zero concerning the oglio river on the other hand it is possible to notice an enrichment of this factor contribution along its course that attests the increase of no3 along the river due to the gaining of groundwater from the higher plain which is affected by no3 sect 2 1 fig 5 shows the histogram of the scaled residual of the averaged pmf solution the distribution is unimodal centred around zero and symmetric this indicates that the pmf solution residual are random and that the pmf model is not constantly overestimating or underestimating the observed concentration the majority of the scaled residual fall within 2 and 2 as suggested by juntto and paatero 1994 the peaks at 4 and 4 are due to the robust mode which substitutes every scaled residual outside the 4 4 range with 4 or 4 not having scaled residuals at the limit of the robust mode range would lead to equal qtrue and qrobust and this would imply too large uncertainties the amount of data spreading outside this range with the consequential difference between qtrue and qrobust has been related to inhomogeneous concentrations in the dataset particularly frequent when working with spatially distributed data comero et al 2009 norris et al 2014 polissar et al 1998 the spatial distribution of the residual indicates that the residuals don t have a specific spatial pattern that means that no relevant information has been neglected the samples collected from the well hl09 red dot in the northern area in fig 5b and from the mella river red triangle in the south area fig 5b show the highest residuals these sampling points located in and around urban environments are more likely affected by urban and industrial sources which are not present within the other samples considered in this study 3 2 fa the results of the fa table 3 and fig 6 show that only the first three factors can be considered significant as they have an eigenvalue higher than 1 these explain the 72 4 of the variance of the original dataset cumulative explained variance these first three factors explain 37 3 24 8 and 10 16 respectively of the total variance the first factor is mainly represented by p tot nh4 na as and fe and it has high negative loadings for the variables so4 the second one is mainly represented by alkalinity cl no3 ca and mg the third factor has higher loadings for the variables o2 cl no3 so4 and k and a strongly negative loading for mn the maps in fig 6 show the factor scores for the three factors resulting from fa the first factor has the highest scores in the lower plain in those wells were as pollution is more severe i e mean as 40 μg l that are the same points evidenced also by factor 2 of the pmf based on the loadings and the spatial distribution of the scores it is possible to identify the first factor as a proxy of reducing conditions particularly it seems to include the characteristics of factors 2 and 3 of the pmf but as concerns the spatial distribution the separation between the higher and the lower plain is less evident particularly it highlights also some differences between the points in the higher plain that cannot be related to as pollution all these points have as concentrations close to zero but instead can be related to differences in so4 and or na concentrations the second factor which has higher scores in the higher plain fig 6 and a higher loading of no3 could be associated to anthropogenic impacts mainly related to agricultural activities however high scores of this factor are present also in some wells in the lower plain and that is due to the presence of major ions and alkalinity with high loadings in the factor table 3 on this basis this second factor could be interpreted as a combination of factors 4 and 5 of the pmf the third factor resulting from fa represents the highly oxygenated water of surface water bodies also in this case it is evident the effect of the irrigation in the higher plain but relatively high scores are evident even within those wells in the lower plain which emerge for highly reduced conditions this is due to the fact that this factor is also well represented by mn 3 3 advantages and disadvantages of pmf with respect to fa comparing the results of pmf and fa several advantages of the former technique with respect to the latter has emerged firstly it seems that pmf factors depict information in a cleaner way with respect to fa factors explaining only one main feature or process in each factor conversely the orthogonality constraint in the fa reduces the possibility of discriminating variables which are correlated but related to different processes resulting in factors representing more than one process and or feature as described in 3 2 which leads to a more confusing description of the system secondly pmf considers the uncertainty of the data although this requires gathering the information about the uncertainty of the data it allows to weight differently data with higher uncertainty and to properly work with missing data and data below the detection limit by associating to them a higher uncertainty fa analysis on the other hand as conventionally performed considers all the data with the same weight thirdly the sofi tool which was used to perform pmf analysis is suitable for groundwater quality data as it allows to visualize spatial data by importing coordinates and classes vectors related to the samples which makes more agile the process of selecting and interpreting the solution an aspect of the pmf that can be considered a disadvantage could be the absence of a predefined method for selecting the number of pmf factors this choice is based on the comparison of several solutions with different number of factors as opposite to the fa where well defined criteria e g kaiser criterion are used this requires a bigger effort when interpreting the results but on the other hand it allows for a higher freedom in exploring the solutions space and a deeper understanding of the data in the present study pmf allowed to identify more factors than fa which are representative of environmental phenomena a second possible disadvantage of pmf is that it works on data expressed as concentration therefore data expressed with different units e g ph isotopes analysis electrical conductivity and oxidation reduction potential cannot be directly fed into the pmf model a last element for the comparison between pmf and fa that points out how pmf reached a more detailed description of the system is the results of validation with water isotope data more specifically water isotopes were used to validate pmf factor 1 and fa factor 3 representing lake iseo oglio river water and groundwater recharge by irrigation in the higher plain since lake iseo has a more depleted signature i e average value of 9 59 for δ18o and 65 12 for δ2h compared to local precipitations i e 7 70 for δ 18o and 50 1 for δ2h at the sarnico station longinelli and selmo 2003 which constitutes the other relevant source of recharge to groundwater in the area fig 7 a and b show the scatterplot of pmf factor 1 and fa factor 3 over δ2h of the wells in the higher plain and lake iseo average over the four field surveys fig 7c and d shows the scatterplot of δ18o over δ2h in which points are coloured respectively by pmf factor 1 and fa factor 3 wells in the higher plain which are recharged by irrigation present a more negative isotopic signature closer to the signature of lake iseo fig 7a and c highlights that pmf factor 1 reproduces more accurately the effect of irrigation on groundwater recharge samples with a more depleted isotopic signature also have higher contributions of pmf factor 1 and a linear relationship is evident on the other hand fa factor 3 does not show the same relationship with the isotopic signature of the samples fig 7b and d this validation performed using additional analysis such as isotopes data that were not included in the pmf itself is an additional evidence that pmf analysis could be a powerful tool to perform exploratory analyses of water quality data to support groundwater quality characterization and the further development of a conceptual model 4 conclusions this work presented a first application of pmf to perform groundwater and surface water quality characterization pmf results were then compared to those of a fa the results of both analysis were examined through a gis approach to appreciate their spatial variability and a validation was performed through the comparison of factor values with water isotope data this work proved the ability of pmf to provide an exhaustive characterization of the water quality of the hydro system under analysis indeed the pmf was able to evidence the main aspects featuring the study area that are concerning hydrochemical features the distinction between oxidised groundwater in the higher plain represented by factor 1 and reduced groundwater in the lower plain represented by factors 2 and 3 concerning pollution phenomena the presence of the no3 pollution in the higher plain groundwater and springs represented by factor 5 and the as pollution in the lower plain groundwater represented by factor 2 concerning main processes governing the system the occurrence of reducing processes in groundwater in the lower plain in particular the prevalence of mn oxide reduction represented by factor 3 at the transition between higher and lower plain and the prevalence of sulphate and fe oxide reductions represented by factor 2 in the lower plain the strong aquifer recharge made by irrigation water in the higher plain represented by factor 1 the faster groundwater circulation i e shorter residence times in the higher plain that becomes slower i e longer residence times in the lower plain represented by factor 4 the increase in no3 in the oglio river after crossing the higher plain due to the gaining of its no3 affected groundwater represented by factor 4 the comparison between pmf and fa highlighted that pmf allows a more detailed description of the system revealing and characterizing more features and processes compared to fa as opposite to fa pmf takes into account the analytical uncertainty of the data and can cope with missing and below detection limit data by associating to them a higher uncertainty the positivity constraints of the pmf allow a more environmentally interpretable representation of the system compared to fa in summary pmf could support the identification and quantification of anthropogenic and natural pollution sources in cases where more than one source is affecting a system as other data driven techniques the quality of the analysed dataset is crucial because pmf can only highlight information which is actually gathered within the data therefore pmf can be applied at any spatial scale as long as the data actually represent the spatial and chemical variability of a system concluding pmf could be a useful tool to perform water quality characterization in complex hydro systems where different water resources are involved e g groundwater lake rivers and springs and

18771,this study aims at testing the effectiveness of positive matrix factorization in characterizing groundwater and surface water quality in terms of identifying main hydrochemical features and processes natural and anthropogenic that govern them this method is applied in a hydro system featured by a strong interrelation between groundwater and surface water and highly impacted by agricultural activities therefore a holistic approach considering groundwater together with the surface water bodies consisting in lake several rivers and springs was used multivariate statistical analysis in particular factor analysis has been proved to be effective in elaborating and interpreting water quality data highlighting the information carried within them but it presents some limitations it does not consider data uncertainty and it groups variables which are correlated positively and negatively moreover in some cases the resulting factors are not clearly interpretable describing each one various overlapping features processes here positive matrix factorization is applied to groundwater and surface water quality data and the results are compared to those obtained through a factor analysis in terms of both factor profiles and their spatial distribution through a gis approach results of isotopes analysis are used to validate pmf output and support interpretation positive matrix factorization allows to consider data uncertainty and the solution respects two positivity constraints based on the concept of chemical mass balance which leads to a more environmentally interpretable solution results show that positive matrix factorization identifies five different factors reflecting main features and natural and anthropogenic processes affecting the study area 1 surface water used for irrigation 2 groundwater subjected to reducing processes at advanced stages 3 groundwater subjected to reducing processes at early stages 4 groundwater residence time and 5 the effects of the agricultural land use on both groundwater and surface water positive matrix factorization leads to a more detailed understanding of the studied system as compared to factor analysis which identifies only three factors with overlapping information based on the results of this study positive matrix factorization could be a useful technique to perform groundwater and surface water quality characterization and to reach a deeper understanding of the phenomena that govern water chemistry graphical abstract image 1 keywords multivariate statistical analysis water quality positive matrix factorization factor analysis oglio river 1 introduction groundwater and surface water are the main sources of freshwater and drinking water in many regions worldwide their quality should be preserved in order to guarantee the fulfilment of the different water needs by humans and ecosystems groundwater and surface water quality could be affected by several factors and processes such as anthropogenic impacts and natural phenomena as well as groundwater surface water interrelationships the understanding of the different water and pollution sources and the processes that affect them is fundamental to obtain an exhaustive characterization of water resources quality to this end the implementation of a proper water quality monitoring network is fundamental but it is also crucial to properly manage elaborate and interpret the collected data in order to gather all the information contained within them in the last decades attention toward multivariate statistical analysis increased dramatically as a tool to analyse water chemical data several authors performed principal component analysis pca factor analysis fa or cluster analysis ca to investigate groundwater and surface water chemical data and identify natural phenomena blake et al 2016 koh et al 2016 shrestha et al 2016 as well as anthropogenic impacts affecting water quality alberti et al 2016 devic et al 2014 gu et al 2018 phung et al 2015 stefania et al 2018 positive matrix factorization pmf paatero and tapper 1994 is a multivariate analysis aimed at source identification and apportionment specifically designed to cope with environmental data and manage their uncertainty and distributions pmf is specifically appropriate for environmental data because 1 it takes into account the analytical uncertainties often associated with measurements of environmental samples and 2 forces all of the values in the solution profiles and contributions to be positive which can lead to a more realistic representation of the system than solutions from other multivariate methods like pca reff et al 2007 in the last two decades pmf has been widely used in studies concerning air pollution since it was specifically designed to cope with application where mass balance is a key aspect and a known source is present particularly pmf has been widely applied to perform source apportionment of particulate matter and aerosol in several countries e g belis et al 2011 bozzetti et al 2017 daellenbach et al 2017 fortner et al 2018 kuang et al 2015 mohr et al 2012 2015 sowlat et al 2016 visser et al 2015 yan et al 2016 only in the last years a few authors applied pmf on datasets concerning different environmental compartments to reach a more realistic representation of the sources affecting different systems comero et al 2011 applied pmf on a geochemical dataset on sediments from 11 alpine lakes located in italy identifying four interpretable factors related to the mineralogical chemical features of lake sediments in the catchment area comero et al 2012 used pmf on soil sample on an abandoned mine dump in italy and supported the interpretation of the sources with a gis approach zheng et al 2014 performed a comprehensive study investigating with pmf the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in soils samples shao et al 2014 used pmf model to better understand the pahs sources in a karst water system soonthornnonda et al 2008 used chemical mass balance and pmf modelling in order to find origins of flows and pollutants in combined sewer wastewater pekey et al 2013 investigated through pmf analysis sources affecting surface sediment samples in a bay in turkey haji gholizadeh et al 2016 identified and quantified the potential pollution sources affecting the water quality of three major rivers of south florida by means of pmf the low uptake of pmf in water research compared to air pollution field is due to the lower suitability of water quality data to fit the requirements of the technique some limitations that could limit a successful pmf analysis are for instance 1 pmf requires only data expressed as concentration while some typical measurement of water samples have different units e g ph electrical conductivity oxidation reduction potential isotopes analysis age tracers thus they cannot be directly fed into a pmf model 2 a proper monitoring network specifically designed to capture the variability of the system and its contamination sources is crucial to obtain a complete representation of the system with a pmf analysis and 3 in cases where a single source is present a multivariate statistical analysis such as pmf might not be appropriate despite these limitations the potential advantages of pmf i e the inclusion of analytical uncertainties and the positivity constraints could be useful when investigating groundwater and surface water quality dataset to perform water quality characterization the aim of this work is to test the effectiveness of pmf as a tool to support water quality characterization intended to define the main hydrochemical features pollution phenomena and processes governing them such as groundwater surface water interactions here pmf is applied to a dataset concerning groundwater spring river and lake water collected within the oglio river basin located in the po plain n italy this area was subjected to previous studies rotiroti et al 2019a 2019b which identified main hydrochemical features and processes governing them so the information obtained through the pmf analysis can be tested with a known conceptual model of the study area the results of the pmf are then compared with those of a traditional multivariate statistical analysis such a fa in order to make a comparison with a more widely used multivariate technique to the best of the authors knowledge pmf has never been applied to characterize the water quality of a whole hydro system using a dataset consisting in groundwater and surface water samples moreover additional innovative aspects of this work are 1 both factor contributions to the samples and the residuals of the model are spatially analysed through gis approach and their interpretation is supported by considering the land use and hydrogeological features 2 results of the pmf model are validated through a comparison with water isotope data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the part of the oglio river basin po plain n italy that covers 2000 km2 around the oglio river between the outflow from lake iseo and the confluence with mella river fig 1 in this part of its course the oglio river receives water from 5 tributaries which are the cherio river the scolmatore di genivolta channel the saverona stream the strone river and the mella river fig 1 as regards the geomorphology fig 2 a and hydrogeology the study area can be divided into two parts with different characteristics rotiroti et al 2019a 2019b 1 the higher plain in the northern part that hosts a mono layer unconfined aquifer mainly composed of sands and gravels and 2 the lower plain in the southern part of the study area that hosts a multi layer aquifer where several layers of sands and silty clays alternate vertically this hydrogeological setting features the entire alpine sector of the po plain giuliano 1995 perego et al 2014 the transition zone between the higher and the lower plain is known as the springs belt as natural groundwater outflows are largely present all over the width of the area groundwater flows mainly from north to south rotiroti et al 2019a as regards the relationship between oglio river and groundwater the first stretch of oglio river i e from the outflow from lake iseo to approximately 20 30 km downstream is losing then it becomes gaining up to the confluence with mella river rotiroti et al 2019a lake iseo site lter eu it 008 southern alpine lakes www lter europe net is the fourth largest italian lake it has been classified as warm monomictic water temperatures do not drop below 4 c and water mixing occurring during or close to winter however due to their morphological characteristics and climatic conditions the lake does not reach a full thermal and chemical homogenisation every year and the complete water overturn over the last 40 years has happened only occasionally in 2005 and 2006 leoni et al 2014a pareeth et al 2017 so the lake can presently be regarded as holo oligomictic in the last five years the depth of mixing range between 30 and 75 m below the surface strongly influencing the physical and chemical features of epilimnion and of outlet waters lake iseo has been affected by an increase in mean total phosphorus concentrations since the 1970s phosphorus concentrations gradually increased in water column after 2005 from about 60 to 90 100 μg l and in epilimnion lightly decrease from 38 to 18 μg l during the last five years leoni et al 2014b marti et al 2016 rogora et al 2018 the land use of the area is mainly agricultural fig 2b the most frequent crop is corn mainly cultivated for the purpose of animal husbandry feeding cattle and pig within the area two different irrigation techniques are used respectively in the higher and the lower plain in the former irrigation water mainly comes from the oglio river through a complex network of irrigation channels in the latter the main source of water for irrigation is groundwater abstracted through hundreds of irrigation wells fig 2c in the higher plain that is formed by coarse sediments and thus has higher permeability irrigation water sourced by the oglio river constitutes a main source of aquifer recharge rotiroti et al 2019a as regards groundwater quality two main problems affect the study area rotiroti et al 2019a a a diffuse nitrate contamination in the higher plain such as in most of the higher part of the whole po plain cinnirella et al 2005 lasagna et al 2016 martinelli et al 2018 and b the natural contamination by mn fe as and nh4 in the lower plain such as in most of the lower part of the whole po plain carraro et al 2015 molinari et al 2012 rotiroti et al 2014 the former is mainly related to the agricultural land use and particularly to fertilization practices although point sources from sewage systems can be relevant in some cases sacchi et al 2013 rotiroti et al 2017 the latter is related to the hydrogeological and hydrochemical properties of the lower plain aquifer system that is multi layered and contains relevant amounts of buried organic matter as peat sediments these feed the ecological succession of terminal electron accepting processes leading to reducing conditions and high concentrations of mn fe as and nh4 rotiroti et al 2015 carraro et al 2015 concerning the water quality of surface water lake iseo has a better water quality as compared to the oglio river which has higher no3 concentrations due to the gaining of groundwater from the higher plain that is affected by no3 spring water is also affected by no3 since the spring belt constitutes in fact a surface outflow of groundwater from the higher plain tributaries of oglio river have generally worse water quality with respect to the oglio river itself being more impacted by anthropogenic activities rotiroti et al 2019a 2 2 available data the available dataset is the result of four field surveys conducted in the study area during february 2016 june 2016 september 2016 and march 2017 in each campaign samples from 68 monitoring points were collected including a total amount of 270 samples among the monitoring points 44 are wells 17 are rivers 12 stations on the oglio river and 5 tributaries 6 are springs and 1 is the lake iseo each sample was analysed for dissolved oxygen do total phosphorous p tot alkalinity as hco3 major ions ca mg na k cl so4 no3 and nh4 trace elements as fe and mn and stable water isotopes δ18o and δ2h as regards water sampling from wells they were purged until physico chemical parameters were stable generally after 2 3 well volumes were removed the do was measured in the field using the wtw multi 3430 meter in a flow cell each water sample was filtered through 0 2 μm filters on the field and samples for as fe and mn analysis were acidified with nitric acid after collection samples were stored in a portable fridge at 4 c alkalinity was analysed by h2so4 titration within 24 h from the sampling major ions were analysed by ion chromatography ammonium was analysed by spectrophotometry with nessler s reagent within 24 h from the sampling iron and manganese were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes whereas arsenic was analysed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry gfaas water isotopes were analysed by wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy ws crds the analytical uncertainty of the data was calculated for each set of analysed samples particularly before every set of analysis a standard solution was measured the analytical uncertainty was calculated as the percent difference between the value of a standard solution and the measurement with the analytical instruments furthermore since previous studies highlighted that field sampling operations can give a significant contribution to the total uncertainty grøn et al 2007 witczak 2006 with values up to 18 roy and fouillac 2004 the sampling uncertainty was also accounted the uncertainty related to the sampling transport and stocking of the samples was assumed to be 10 this value was chosen according with the average variation of measured concentrations 14 between two consecutive years in the same season i e winter 2016 and winter 2017 considered here as a proxy of the uncertainty related to sampling operations analytical and field sampling uncertainty were combined according with the recommendations of the eu project bridge witczak 2006 the main statistics of the data and their combined uncertainty are reported in table 1 the resulting concentration dataset used as input for the pmf together with the uncertainty dataset is a data matrix consisting in 270 samples described by 14 variables do p tot alkalinity as hco3 ca mg na k cl so4 no3 nh4 as fe and mn water isotopes were excluded from pmf since they are not conventionally expressed as a mass concentration and thus they cannot be directly inserted as an input of the pmf analysis however water isotopes were used for a validation of the pmf results 2 3 positive matrix factorization pmf paatero and tapper 1994 is a multivariate analysis in which the fundamental problem is to resolve the identities and contributions of different sources in a mixture the bilinear factorises a multivariate dataset into two matrices g and f leading to a reproduction of the dataset variability as a linear combination of a set of constant factors profile and their contribution to each sample unlike fa or pca and similarly to other techniques e g parallel factor analysis parafac in the pmf model no constraint are imposed about the orthogonality of the factors on the other hand other constraints are considered aimed at reproducing natural physical limit of the system which are a the composition of predicted source must be positive a source cannot have a negative contribution of an element b the predicted source contribution to each sample must all be positive a source cannot contribute to a sample with a negative mass the solution of the problem is found through a weighted least squares approach aimed at minimizing the value of the object function q for a given number of factor p q is defined as 1 q i 1 n i 1 m x i j k 1 p g i k f k j σ i j 2 where σ ij is the uncertainty of species j concentration data in the i th sample m is the number of analytes and n is the number of samples it transpires that the solution to the pmf problem depends on estimating uncertainties for each of the data points of the pmf input hopke 2000 in environmental datasets three types of data are typically available 1 in most of cases samples have concentration value that has been determined x ij and their associated uncertainty σ ij 2 there are samples in which certain species could not be precisely determined because their concentration was below the detection limit 3 missing data which have not been measured in the present study the following method to determine concentrations value and their associated error estimates was used according to polissar et al 1998 and reff et al 2007 2 x i j k c i j k for determined values x i j k d i j k 2 for values below detection limit x i j k c i j k for missing values 3 σ i j k u i j k d i j k 3 for determined values σ i j k 5 6 d i j k for values below detection limit σ i j k 4 c i j k for missing values where c i j k u i j k and d i j k are respectively the measured concentration the analytical uncertainty and the method detection limit for sample i element j and sampling site k c i j k is the geometric mean of the measured concentration of the element j at sampling site k to explore the reliability of different variables and different samples the signal to noise s n value was considered which is the ratio between the concentration and its uncertainty data with a low signal to noise i e s n between 0 2 and 2 are considered weak while data with a s n lower than 0 2 are considered bad in this work weak and bad concentrations values have been downscaled during the pmf analysis according to paatero and hopke 2003 concerning to the data weighting another important aspect to consider is the weight of extreme values environmental data typically show a skewed distribution with a heavy tail due to the presence of samples with higher concentration of certain species as compared to other samples these data can have a significant leverage on the solution of the model comero et al 2009 thus it is possible run the model in the so called robust mode where the extreme values influence is reduced in the robust mode the objective function is changed as follows 4 q r o b u s t i 1 n i 1 m e i j h i j σ i j 2 where h i j 1 for e i j σ i j α h i j e i j σ i j α for e i j σ i j α an α 4 value is suggested paatero 1997 and widely used buzcu et al 2003 cui et al 2018 kim and hopke 2004 li et al 2004 the total q value depends on the size of the data matrix thus for a more meaningful monitoring of the solution quality q value is normalized by qexp representing the degrees of freedom of the model which is both a function of the data matrix size n m and of the number of factors p 5 q e x p n m p n m n m in the present work the pmf algorithm was solved using the multilinear engine me 2 solver paatero 1999 the source finder toolkit sofi version 6 3 canonaco et al 2013 for igor pro software package wavematrics inc portland or usa was used to configure the me 2 model for the data downweighting and for post analysis unlike pca and fa for the pmf model it is not common to choose the number of factors by means of standardized methods but it is common practice to investigate solutions with different numbers of factors and observe q qexp the residual distributions as well as the environmental interpretability of the predicted factors e g brown et al 2015 karanasiou et al 2011 choosing the number of factor is a trade off increasing the number of factor always reduces the residual but too many factors can lead the model to split a meaningful factor into unrealistic ones e g yan et al 2016 obtaining solution which are no more environmentally interpretable here several runs with an increasing number of factors from two to seven were done and the solution was chosen based on the above mentioned criteria for the final solution 50 pmf runs with different seeds where performed and convergence was achieved for each run the main sources of uncertainty of a pmf solution are rotational ambiguity and random error in data values paatero et al 2014 uncertainty caused by rotational ambiguity arises because bilinear factor analytic models are ill posed which means that there are several solutions g f with the same q value henry 1987 the problem of rotations was discussed in paatero et al 2002 and paatero and hopke 2009 to assess rotational ambiguity the method proposed by paatero et al 2002 was here implemented it consists in assessing the rotational ambiguity of the selected pmf solution base case by using it as starting point for several runs i e without starting from pseudo random values in which different rotational parameter are set here at each run the factor profiles were constrained around the profiles of the selected base case solution with an α value randomly selected at each iteration between 0 and 1 the α value 0 α 1 determines the range in which the resolved factors may deviate from input values to assess the total uncertainty of the chosen pmf solution the effect of random error was investigated through a bootstrap analysis davison and hinkley 1997 this technique consists in iteratively randomly resampling a subset of data from the original dataset with their related uncertainty and performing the pmf analysis on each generated dataset at each iteration the data are perturbed by replicating part of the rows of the dataset i e samples while others are removed so that at each iteration the total amount of samples is kept constant paatero et al 2014 at each bootstrap iteration the resampled data includes on average 64 of the total original data per bootstrap run a total of 100 iterations have been performed the solution presented in the results session is the average solution calculated on the 100 performed runs bootstrap analysis and rotation were implemented using sofi pro version 6 4 2 4 factor analysis to compare the effectiveness of pmf with a more widely used technique fa analysis has been performed on the same dataset fa is a multivariate statistical analysis aimed at finding association between parameters by reducing the number of measured parameters to a limited number of factors which can explain the majority of the data variance avoiding redundant information and noise within the data papaioannou et al 2009 an important aspect of factor analysis is that the resulting factors are orthogonal and therefore not correlated the software ibm spss was used for performing fa the correlation matrix was used to perform factor analysis so that no need of a previous data autoscaling was needed todeschini 1998 the kaiser criterion kaiser 1958 was used to determine the significant factors it consists in selecting factors with an eigenvalue higher or equal to 1 after the selection of the relevant factors varimax rotation was applied which is an orthogonal rotation aiming at differentiating the original variables by extracted factor factor scores were analysed through gis system to understand their spatial variability 3 results and discussion 3 1 pmf the results of pmf showed that the best number of factors to properly represent the system is five table 2 in fact the first 5 factors were environmentally interpretable while increasing the number of factors would have only led to split existing factors into two similar sub factors therefore the solution with five factors was chosen and it is presented here while the solutions with four and six factors are shown as an example respectively in figs s1 and s2 results here presented are the average and the standard deviations over the 100 pmf runs qexp is 3780 while for the averaged solution qrobust is 17605 and qtrue 30420 qrobust is the actual error function that is minimized by the pmf model while qtrue is the hypothetical q value calculated after the solution convergence without downscaling the scaled residuals outside the 4 4 range the epa pmf user guide norris et al 2014 reports that similar qtrue and qrobust would be a symptom of overestimated analytical uncertainty implying that the model is not actually running in the robust mode while the difference between qtrue and qrobust is a measure of the presence of sources that are not consistently represented within the dataset in this case the ratio between qtrue and qrobust is 1 7 which indicates that the considered dataset comes under the second case indeed all the considered variables are positively skewed and particularly 10 out of 14 variables are highly skewed skewness between 1 and 4 furthermore ca 400 values of the data matrix are mathematically considerable outliers highly skewed variables and outliers are common in environmental datasets the risk is that they could have a higher leverage compared to lower values in the pmf solution which is not recommendable and the role of the robust mode is to reduce these higher leverages so that they can become comparable to those of lower values table 2 shows the relative contribution of each variable to each factor namely it is the f matrix of eqn 1 the values of table 2 are related to the concentration of each compound so that compounds with higher concentration have higher contributions in order to better appreciate the role of trace elements which have smaller concentration fig 3 shows the fraction of each variable represented by each factor allowing to understand by which factors every compound is represented the first factor red bar in fig 3 is characterized mainly by oxygen and secondly by major ions such as so4 hco3 cl ca mg na and k in this factor there is neither nitrate nor reduced species such as as fe and mn the profile of this factor coincides with the characteristics of surface water bodies directly connected with subalpine lakes more specifically it seems to represent the water of lake iseo which has higher so4 content compared to the other subalpine lakes salmaso et al 2007 the map of the spatial variability of factor 1 fig 4 a shows higher values in the lake iseo and in the oglio river which originates from it confirming the above tributaries have lower values of this factor as compared to the oglio river which is due firstly to a lower content of sulphate that in the oglio river comes mostly from the lake iseo and secondarily to a higher anthropogenic impact on the tributaries which lowers the oxygen content oxygen in the oglio river is kept high by the turbulence of the flow that determines an auto depuration even if sources of organic matter are present relevant values of factor 1 are also achieved in several wells in the higher plain fig 4a this is related to the aquifer recharge made by irrigation water sourced from the oglio river that is the main source of irrigation water in the higher plain sect 2 1 therefore this factor that represents lake iseo and oglio river water is able to trace aquifer recharge made by irrigation water sourced from oglio river the second factor orange bar in fig 3 is characterized by the reduced species as fe nh4 and mn together with p tot and na this leads us to consider the second factor as a proxy for reducing conditions more specifically it traces reduced conditions that evolved at advanced stages where nh4 is higher as the product of protracted organic matter degradation so4 is lower as the result of ongoing or occurred sulphate reduction dissolved fe and mn are higher as the products of mn and fe oxides reduction that can lead also to higher as and p tot values mcarthur et al 2004 rotiroti et al 2014 the spatial variability of this factor fig 4b shows that the sampling points with higher values are wells in the lower plain where as pollution is stronger i e mean as concentrations 40 μg l conversely groundwater samples in the higher plain and surface water samples have no contribution of this factor on this basis the second factor which identifies reducing condition at advanced stages is able to trace as pollution which affects groundwater in the lower plain the third factor blue bar in fig 3 is mainly characterized by mn and so4 and secondly by mg and k the higher concentrations of mn and so4 indicate the presence of reducing conditions at an earlier stage with respect to factor 2 characterized by the occurrence of mn oxide reduction with sulphate reduction that is not favoured yet concerning the spatial distribution of factor 3 fig 4c sampling points with the highest values of this factor are located at the transition between higher and lower plain aquifers and this is consistent with the above since here groundwater is passing from the oxidising conditions of the higher plain to the reducing conditions of the lower plain so mn oxide reduction can be favoured conversely groundwater samples in the higher plain and surface water samples have no contribution of this factor the fourth factor green bar in fig 3 is characterized by only major ions such as hco3 cl ca mg na and k major ions concentration in groundwater can be mainly driven by water rock interactions higher major ions concentrations can be reached as groundwater residence times become longer therefore this factor can be associated to groundwater residence times fig 4d shows the spatial variability of this factor highlighting an increase of its value from the higher to the lower plain this agrees with the hydrogeological features of the study area which has coarse sediments in the higher plain promoting faster groundwater circulation and so determining shorter residence times and fine sediments in the lower plain that determine slower groundwater circulation and so longer residence times surface water samples downstream show higher values of this factor highlighting the gaining behaviour of the river and therefore the increasing effect of groundwater to surface water the fifth factor light blue bar in fig 3 describes the total variability of the variable no3 with contributions also in terms of cl so4 ca and mg nitrate occurrence in groundwater can be associated with the use of organic and synthetic fertilizers recent studies jalali 2011 menció et al 2016 highlighted that an excessive use of fertilizers determines also a linear increase of the major ions cl so4 ca and mg in water thus the profile of this fifth factor can represent the impact related to the excessive use of fertilizers in agriculture not just in terms of no3 but also considering the contribution of the above mentioned major ions this allows to separate the amount of cl ca and mg determined by this anthropogenic source from the natural amount of these elements in water factor 4 concerning the spatial variability of this fifth factor fig 4e it shows high contributions in the samples collected from the higher plain aquifer that is more vulnerable since it is formed by coarse sediments and springs that are a surface outflow of higher plain groundwater conversely in the lower plain the values of this factor are low due to the occurrence of denitrification that lowers no3 concentrations close to zero concerning the oglio river on the other hand it is possible to notice an enrichment of this factor contribution along its course that attests the increase of no3 along the river due to the gaining of groundwater from the higher plain which is affected by no3 sect 2 1 fig 5 shows the histogram of the scaled residual of the averaged pmf solution the distribution is unimodal centred around zero and symmetric this indicates that the pmf solution residual are random and that the pmf model is not constantly overestimating or underestimating the observed concentration the majority of the scaled residual fall within 2 and 2 as suggested by juntto and paatero 1994 the peaks at 4 and 4 are due to the robust mode which substitutes every scaled residual outside the 4 4 range with 4 or 4 not having scaled residuals at the limit of the robust mode range would lead to equal qtrue and qrobust and this would imply too large uncertainties the amount of data spreading outside this range with the consequential difference between qtrue and qrobust has been related to inhomogeneous concentrations in the dataset particularly frequent when working with spatially distributed data comero et al 2009 norris et al 2014 polissar et al 1998 the spatial distribution of the residual indicates that the residuals don t have a specific spatial pattern that means that no relevant information has been neglected the samples collected from the well hl09 red dot in the northern area in fig 5b and from the mella river red triangle in the south area fig 5b show the highest residuals these sampling points located in and around urban environments are more likely affected by urban and industrial sources which are not present within the other samples considered in this study 3 2 fa the results of the fa table 3 and fig 6 show that only the first three factors can be considered significant as they have an eigenvalue higher than 1 these explain the 72 4 of the variance of the original dataset cumulative explained variance these first three factors explain 37 3 24 8 and 10 16 respectively of the total variance the first factor is mainly represented by p tot nh4 na as and fe and it has high negative loadings for the variables so4 the second one is mainly represented by alkalinity cl no3 ca and mg the third factor has higher loadings for the variables o2 cl no3 so4 and k and a strongly negative loading for mn the maps in fig 6 show the factor scores for the three factors resulting from fa the first factor has the highest scores in the lower plain in those wells were as pollution is more severe i e mean as 40 μg l that are the same points evidenced also by factor 2 of the pmf based on the loadings and the spatial distribution of the scores it is possible to identify the first factor as a proxy of reducing conditions particularly it seems to include the characteristics of factors 2 and 3 of the pmf but as concerns the spatial distribution the separation between the higher and the lower plain is less evident particularly it highlights also some differences between the points in the higher plain that cannot be related to as pollution all these points have as concentrations close to zero but instead can be related to differences in so4 and or na concentrations the second factor which has higher scores in the higher plain fig 6 and a higher loading of no3 could be associated to anthropogenic impacts mainly related to agricultural activities however high scores of this factor are present also in some wells in the lower plain and that is due to the presence of major ions and alkalinity with high loadings in the factor table 3 on this basis this second factor could be interpreted as a combination of factors 4 and 5 of the pmf the third factor resulting from fa represents the highly oxygenated water of surface water bodies also in this case it is evident the effect of the irrigation in the higher plain but relatively high scores are evident even within those wells in the lower plain which emerge for highly reduced conditions this is due to the fact that this factor is also well represented by mn 3 3 advantages and disadvantages of pmf with respect to fa comparing the results of pmf and fa several advantages of the former technique with respect to the latter has emerged firstly it seems that pmf factors depict information in a cleaner way with respect to fa factors explaining only one main feature or process in each factor conversely the orthogonality constraint in the fa reduces the possibility of discriminating variables which are correlated but related to different processes resulting in factors representing more than one process and or feature as described in 3 2 which leads to a more confusing description of the system secondly pmf considers the uncertainty of the data although this requires gathering the information about the uncertainty of the data it allows to weight differently data with higher uncertainty and to properly work with missing data and data below the detection limit by associating to them a higher uncertainty fa analysis on the other hand as conventionally performed considers all the data with the same weight thirdly the sofi tool which was used to perform pmf analysis is suitable for groundwater quality data as it allows to visualize spatial data by importing coordinates and classes vectors related to the samples which makes more agile the process of selecting and interpreting the solution an aspect of the pmf that can be considered a disadvantage could be the absence of a predefined method for selecting the number of pmf factors this choice is based on the comparison of several solutions with different number of factors as opposite to the fa where well defined criteria e g kaiser criterion are used this requires a bigger effort when interpreting the results but on the other hand it allows for a higher freedom in exploring the solutions space and a deeper understanding of the data in the present study pmf allowed to identify more factors than fa which are representative of environmental phenomena a second possible disadvantage of pmf is that it works on data expressed as concentration therefore data expressed with different units e g ph isotopes analysis electrical conductivity and oxidation reduction potential cannot be directly fed into the pmf model a last element for the comparison between pmf and fa that points out how pmf reached a more detailed description of the system is the results of validation with water isotope data more specifically water isotopes were used to validate pmf factor 1 and fa factor 3 representing lake iseo oglio river water and groundwater recharge by irrigation in the higher plain since lake iseo has a more depleted signature i e average value of 9 59 for δ18o and 65 12 for δ2h compared to local precipitations i e 7 70 for δ 18o and 50 1 for δ2h at the sarnico station longinelli and selmo 2003 which constitutes the other relevant source of recharge to groundwater in the area fig 7 a and b show the scatterplot of pmf factor 1 and fa factor 3 over δ2h of the wells in the higher plain and lake iseo average over the four field surveys fig 7c and d shows the scatterplot of δ18o over δ2h in which points are coloured respectively by pmf factor 1 and fa factor 3 wells in the higher plain which are recharged by irrigation present a more negative isotopic signature closer to the signature of lake iseo fig 7a and c highlights that pmf factor 1 reproduces more accurately the effect of irrigation on groundwater recharge samples with a more depleted isotopic signature also have higher contributions of pmf factor 1 and a linear relationship is evident on the other hand fa factor 3 does not show the same relationship with the isotopic signature of the samples fig 7b and d this validation performed using additional analysis such as isotopes data that were not included in the pmf itself is an additional evidence that pmf analysis could be a powerful tool to perform exploratory analyses of water quality data to support groundwater quality characterization and the further development of a conceptual model 4 conclusions this work presented a first application of pmf to perform groundwater and surface water quality characterization pmf results were then compared to those of a fa the results of both analysis were examined through a gis approach to appreciate their spatial variability and a validation was performed through the comparison of factor values with water isotope data this work proved the ability of pmf to provide an exhaustive characterization of the water quality of the hydro system under analysis indeed the pmf was able to evidence the main aspects featuring the study area that are concerning hydrochemical features the distinction between oxidised groundwater in the higher plain represented by factor 1 and reduced groundwater in the lower plain represented by factors 2 and 3 concerning pollution phenomena the presence of the no3 pollution in the higher plain groundwater and springs represented by factor 5 and the as pollution in the lower plain groundwater represented by factor 2 concerning main processes governing the system the occurrence of reducing processes in groundwater in the lower plain in particular the prevalence of mn oxide reduction represented by factor 3 at the transition between higher and lower plain and the prevalence of sulphate and fe oxide reductions represented by factor 2 in the lower plain the strong aquifer recharge made by irrigation water in the higher plain represented by factor 1 the faster groundwater circulation i e shorter residence times in the higher plain that becomes slower i e longer residence times in the lower plain represented by factor 4 the increase in no3 in the oglio river after crossing the higher plain due to the gaining of its no3 affected groundwater represented by factor 4 the comparison between pmf and fa highlighted that pmf allows a more detailed description of the system revealing and characterizing more features and processes compared to fa as opposite to fa pmf takes into account the analytical uncertainty of the data and can cope with missing and below detection limit data by associating to them a higher uncertainty the positivity constraints of the pmf allow a more environmentally interpretable representation of the system compared to fa in summary pmf could support the identification and quantification of anthropogenic and natural pollution sources in cases where more than one source is affecting a system as other data driven techniques the quality of the analysed dataset is crucial because pmf can only highlight information which is actually gathered within the data therefore pmf can be applied at any spatial scale as long as the data actually represent the spatial and chemical variability of a system concluding pmf could be a useful tool to perform water quality characterization in complex hydro systems where different water resources are involved e g groundwater lake rivers and springs and

18772,antibiotic resistance genes args have been regarded as an emerging pollutant in municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents due to their potential risk to human health and ecological safety when reused for landscape and irrigation conventional wastewater treatment processes generally fail to effectively reduce args especially extracellular args eargs which are persistent in the environment and play an important role in horizontal gene transfer via transformation herein an integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration was developed for removal of args especially eargs from wastewater effluent results show that the integrated process could effectively reduce the absolute abundances of total args targs 2 9 logs and eargs 5 2 logs from the effluent the excellent performance could be mainly attributed to the capture of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and eargs by pre coagulation and co rejection during subsequent microfiltration moreover the integrated process exhibited a good performance on removing common pollutants e g dissolved organic carbon and phosphate from the effluent to improve water quality besides the integrated process also greatly reduced membrane fouling compared with microfiltration these findings suggest that the integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration is a promising advanced wastewater treatment technology for args especially eargs removal from wwtp effluents to ensure water reuse security graphical abstract image 1 keywords effluent extracellular antibiotic resistance genes pre coagulation microfiltration membrane fouling mitigation 1 introduction antibiotic resistance genes args are regarded as emerging micropollutants which have aroused public concern because of their risks to both human health and environmental ecosystem zhu et al 2013 due to acquiring a diverse mixture of antibiotics from hospitals agriculture farming and industries wastewater treatment plants wwtps have become one of the most important reservoirs of various args auerbach et al 2007 guo et al 2017 the traditional biological treatment processes generally fail to effectively remove args from wastewater and abundant args in the wwtp effluent 106 1010 copies l could be found li et al 2017 this would inevitably challenge the security of water recycling and reuse when effluent was discharged to the receiving water bodies rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 xu et al 2015 recently advanced oxidation processes including ozonation chlorination and ultraviolet uv disinfection have been studied to reduce the abundances of args from wwtp effluents zhang et al 2015 sharma et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 generally these methods could achieve effective inactivation of antibiotic resistance bacteria arb but fail to reduce equivalent args under the same conditions moreover the inactivation and cell lysis of arb could release intracellular args iargs to wastewater leading to increased abundance of extracellular args eargs in the effluents for example the abundances of eargs have been detected to vary from 103 copies l to as high as 109 copies l in the wwtp effluents after ozonation and chlorination zhang et al 2018 up to date increasing attention has been paid to eargs due to their persistence in the environment and important role in horizontal gene transfer via transformation wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 chang et al 2017 found that uv disinfection could only reduce the abundance of eargs with short amplicon sizes 300 bps by 0 30 0 35 logs implying insufficient destruction of eargs by uv disinfection to effectively reduce eargs from wwtp effluents higher dosages of reagents e g ozone free chlorine and uv are required but this would increase the formation of carcinogenic by products dong et al 2017 the physical treatments e g coagulation filtration and sand filtration have also been investigated to remove args xu et al 2016 li et al 2017 ren et al 2018 among them microfiltration has shown its effectiveness on the removal of iargs breazeal et al 2013 however the application of microfiltration would be limited because of its poor performance on earg removal as well as severe membrane fouling zhu and li 2013 breazeal et al 2013 the fe based coagulation has been proved to decrease the abundances of args by 1 15 2 46 logs in wwtp effluents li et al 2017 also it is hypothesized that fe based coagulation could reduce arb and eargs via charge neutralization and adsorption by fe3 hydrolysis products however the unthorough solid liquid separation and resuspension of the solid precipitates by water disturbance would reduce the effectiveness of coagulation in wastewater treatment this problem could be solved if a microfiltration process is followed after coagulation moreover pre coagulation can not only achieve enhanced removal of soluble pollutants but also reduce membrane fouling rojas et al 2011 huang et al 2017 lee et al 2017 therefore an integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration can probably achieve enhanced removal of args and common pollutants as well as reduced membrane fouling which is vital in wastewater treatment and water reuse but has rarely been explored in this work a microfiltration process integrated with pre coagulation was developed to achieve the following objectives 1 to assess the performance of the integrated process on the removal of targs and eargs from wastewater effluent 2 to evaluate the removal of common pollutants e g dissolved organic carbon doc and phosphate by this integrated process 3 to investigate the effects of this integrated process on membrane fouling mitigation and membrane reusability this work will offer a promising wastewater treatment technology for args removal and membrane fouling mitigation for improved water reuse safety 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf microfiltration membranes cat no gvwp 09050 used in this work were purchased from millipore inc usa the main properties of the pvdf membrane are pore size 0 22 μm porosity 70 and water flux 2350 l m2 h the membrane diameter was tailored to be 6 3 cm with an effective filtration area of 9 6 cm2 the fecl3 synopharm chemicals co china was used as the coagulant the plasmid pbr322 sangon biotech china containing two args i e teta and blatem 1 was chosen for the eargs experiments 2 2 integrated pre coagulation and microfiltration experiments the effluent used in this work was taken from a lab scale sequencing batch bioreactor sbr the main properties of the effluent were uv254 0 06 0 005 cm 1 doc 14 9 1 2 mg l suspended solids ss 30 4 mg l po4 3 p 1 8 0 5 mg l and ph 8 2 0 2 the effluent was stored at 4 c prior to the coagulation and microfiltration experiments the coagulation experiments were conducted in a 500 ml feed bottle with a magnetic stirrer ika inc german the coagulant fecl3 with designed concentrations 15 30 45 60 and 90 mg fe3 l was added into the 250 ml effluent and followed by rapid agitation 250 rpm 3 min and slow agitation 100 rpm 27 min the resulting liquids were settled for 30 min for subsequent measurements the microfiltration experiments were performed in a 50 ml stirring cell millipore inc usa coupled with a 500 ml feed bottle using a dead end filtration mode prior to microfiltration the pristine membranes were soaked in deionized water for 12 h and then filtrated with deionized water until the variation of deionized water flux maintained below 5 the feed bottle was connected to a compressed n2 cylinder and a filtration cell the transmembrane pressure was maintained at 0 1 mpa a total amount of 250 ml effluent was fed to feed bottle with agitation of 100 rpm for microfiltration after microfiltration the fouled membranes were stored at 4 c for further analysis the integrated pre coagulation and microfiltration experiments were performed with a coagulation process followed by a microfiltration process according to the procedures as described above all experiments were performed in duplicate 2 3 removal of targs and eargs the performances of coagulation microfiltration and their combination on the removal of targs and eargs were assessed for the targs removal experiments 80 ml of the effluent supernatant after coagulation and filtrate after microfiltration were collected and then freeze dried for dna extraction the eargs are generally defined as the residual args in the filtrate after microfiltration 0 22 μm breazeal et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 therefore to investigate the removal of eargs by the coagulation and microfiltration the effluent was firstly filtrated 0 22 μm membrane to remove iargs due to the low presence of eargs in the effluent the plasmid pbr322 containing both teta and blatem 1 was spiked into the filtrated effluent as the eargs the concentration of plasmid pbr322 was set at 10 μg l which was in the range of environmental edna concentration 0 56 88 μg l karl et al 1989 the eargs containing effluent was treated by coagulation microfiltration and their combination respectively to further assess the contribution of membrane fouling on the removal of eargs the fouled membranes with and without pre coagulation 60 and 0 mg fe3 l were reused to filtrate the filtrated effluent containing 10 μg l plasmid pbr322 the liquid samples 80 ml before and after these treatments were freeze dried for dna extraction the dna was extracted using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories usa the purity and concentration of dna were measured by a spectramax m2e microplate reader molecular devices the dna samples were stored at 20 c before quantitative pcr qpcr analysis for args all experiments were run in duplicate the args removal was expressed as log10 reduction calculated by the following equation 1 log removal log10 c 0 c where c 0 and c copies ml were the absolute abundances of args in liquid samples before and after treatments respectively 2 4 arg quantification by qpcr for the targs removal experiments three args i e teta suli and sulii and class 1 integrase inti1 were determined by qpcr using sybr premix ex taqii takara japan for the earg removal experiments teta and blatem 1 were quantified all qpcr assays were performed using a roche lightcycler 96 system roche diagnostics gmbh mannheim germany the primer sequence annealing temperature amplicon size and qpcr running condition were used as described previously chang et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 all samples were analyzed in duplicate in each qpcr run with a 6 point standard curve 10 fold dilutions and a negative control the qpcr amplification efficiencies of standard curves for various args should be between 90 and 110 with r2 values 0 99 2 5 membrane resistance calculation in this work the membrane flux was measured via using an electronic balance connected to a personal computer then the unified membrane fouling index umfi was calculated as eq 2 and a higher umfi value means more severe membrane fouling zhou et al 2017 2 umfi j 0 j t 1 v s where j 0 and j t represented the initial and end fluxes of membrane l m2 h respectively v s was the specific permeate volume l m2 the membrane resistance of the fouled membrane was calculated based on the following equations rahimpour et al 2008 lee and kim 2014 3 r t p μj t 4 r t r m r r r ir 5 r t r m r ir where p and μ were the transmembrane pressure pa and filtrate viscosity pa s respectively r t r m r r r t and r ir m 1 represented the total resistance membrane intrinsic resistance physically reversible resistance by rinsing residual total resistance after backwash and physically irreversible removable resistance respectively each resistance was calculated by the end flux of filtration at the given pressure using eq 3 the r t and r m were measured by filtrating the effluents and deionized water through the pristine membrane respectively the fouled membrane was backwashed with 100 ml deionized water and then r t was measured by re filtrating 50 ml deionized water the r r and r ir were calculated according to eqs 4 and 5 2 6 application of the integrated process for wwtp effluent the performance of the integrated process in membrane fouling mitigation and args removal was also assessed by using the real effluent from a local municipal wwtp hefei china all experimental procedures were performed as described above for treating the sbr effluent the main properties of the wwtp effluent were listed below uv254 0 23 0 002 cm 1 doc 20 7 1 1 mg l ss 14 2 mg l po4 3 p 0 14 0 01 mg l and ph 7 2 0 2 the fe3 dosage 30 mg l of pre coagulation was based on the practical coagulation dosage in the wwtp 2 7 analytical methods and statistical analysis all liquid samples except filtrate after microfiltration were filtrated by 0 45 μm filter prior to doc phosphate and uv254 analysis doc was measured by a total carbon analyzer multi n c2100 analytikjena german phosphate and ss

was analyzed by a contact angle meter jc2000a powereach china three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to distinguish the variation of certain classes of organic matters in the effluents before and after treatments zhang et al 2016 all samples were analyzed in duplicate statistical analysis was based on one way anova a difference was considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 total args removal the performances of coagulation microfiltration and their combination in args removal were compared based on the decrease of absolute abundances of targs after treatments as shown in fig 1 a coagulation could effectively remove the target genes i e inti1 teta suli and sulii by more than 1 45 logs from the sbr effluent at fe3 dosages of 15 90 mg l the increased fe3 dosage did not enhance the removal of targs the highest removal of targs was achieved at 15 mg fe3 l reducing the absolute abundances of teta inti1 suli and sulii by 3 29 3 05 2 02 and 3 42 logs respectively after coagulation the absolute abundances of teta inti1 suli and sulii were 6 01 103 9 94 102 1 56 104 and 3 76 103 copies ml in the supernatants respectively the microfiltration also exhibited its effectiveness in targs removal with teta intli suli and sulii reduction of 3 76 3 20 2 68 and 4 00 logs respectively fig 1b after microfiltration the absolute abundances of teta inti1 and suli were 2 06 103 7 04 102 and 3 43 103 copies ml in the filtrate respectively while the abundance of sulii was below the detection limit the high removal efficiencies of targs resulted from the complete rejection of arbs by microfiltration in contrast the integrated pre coagulation and microfiltration fig 1b showed more excellent removal performances for all target genes 4 0 log reduction the absolute abundances of teta intli suli and sulii in the filtrate were all below the detection limits at fe3 dosages of 15 90 mg l similar results were observed in targs removal for treating the wwtp effluent as shown in fig 1c the coagulation 30 mg fe3 l and microfiltration treatments could remove the absolute abundances of targs by 1 3 1 8 and 1 9 3 5 logs respectively in contrast the integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration could achieve much better performances in targs removal 2 9 logs and all the target targs in the filtrate were below the detection limits 3 2 extracellular args removal the absolute abundances of teta and blatem 1 in the effluent before and after treatments were quantified to explore the performances of coagulation microfiltration and their combination in earg removal as shown in fig 2 a microfiltration could remove extracellular teta and blatem 1 by 1 3 and 1 4 logs from the sbr effluent respectively this was much lower compared with those from 2 7 to 4 0 logs achieved in the targs removal by microfiltration fig 1b the coagulation 60 mg fe3 l showed higher removal efficiencies for extracellular teta 3 1 logs and blatem 1 3 1 logs the integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration could further remove eargs by more than 5 2 logs from the sbr effluent the integrated process also achieved excellent earg removal 7 0 logs for the wwtp effluent which was much higher compared with those obtained by microfiltration 0 9 1 0 logs or coagulation 3 2 3 3 logs fig 2b 3 3 improvement of the effluent quality the performance of the integrated process was assessed in the removal of common pollutants including po4 3 doc uv254 and total fe as shown in fig 3 a compared with the microfiltration the integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration 15 90 mg fe3 l enhanced po4 3 removal efficiency by about 75 in treating the sbr effluent similar results were observed for the removal of doc fig 3a and uv254 fig 3b which were enhanced by 65 82 and 13 40 by the integrated process at fe3 dosages of 15 90 mg l in treating sbr effluent respectively compared with microfiltration the integrated process also could improve the water quality of the wwtp effluent table s1 and the removal efficiencies of doc uv254 and po4 3 were enhanced by 73 9 59 5 and 90 1 at 30 mg fe3 l respectively the 3d eem was used to further analyze the changes of doc components after treatment by the integrated process as illustrated in fig 4 the raw sbr effluent had four obvious peaks in the eem spectrum two for proteins ex em 240 350 nm and 285 330 nm and the others for humic like substance ex em 250 425 nm and fulvic like substance ex em 340 425 nm respectively the fluorescent intensities of these components decreased with the increase of fe3 dosage in particular at 90 mg fe3 l the fluorescent intensities of these organic matters were reduced by about 40 which partly accounted for the removal of doc however the suva254 showed an opposite trend which increased with the increase of fe3 dosage fig 3b elevated suva254 was also observed by the integrated process in treating wwtp effluent table s1 this indicates that fecl3 coagulation might have lower removal for some aromatic components compared with the removal of other components of doc the residual total fe concentration in the sbr effluent after treatments fig s1 was also quantified given that it might increase the turbidity and color of the treated water the total fe concentration in the supernatant after coagulation varied in the range of 0 03 0 39 mg l at fe3 dosages of 0 90 mg l in contrast the total fe concentration in the filtrate after the integrated process was much lower 0 0 018 mg l suggesting complete solid liquid separation was achieved in the subsequent microfiltration 3 4 performance of anti fouling and reusability of membrane by pre coagulation the performance of pre coagulation in anti fouling and membrane reusability was evaluated by monitoring the fluxes of the membranes with and without pre coagulation in treating the sbr effluent the flux of microfiltration without pre coagulation decreased quickly with increased volume of filtrate finally reaching only 1 7 41 l m2 h of the initial flux fig 5 a in contrast the membrane fouling was effectively mitigated with pre coagulation 15 90 mg l in particular the highest end flux 430 l m2 h of the membrane was achieved at 60 mg fe3 l which also reduced the filtration time by 87 compared with that without pre coagulation fig s2a similar result was observed for umfi which achieved its lowest value at 60 mg fe3 l pre coagulation fig 5b meanwhile the total resistance r t physically reversible resistance r r and physically irreversible removable resistance r ir all decreased with the increase of fe3 dosage and reached the lowest values after pre coagulation at 60 mg fe3 l table 1 these indicate that pre coagulation at 60 mg fe3 l was the optimum condition for reducing membrane fouling with the lowest formation of reversible and irreversible fouling for the sbr effluent the reusability of membrane after filtrating sbr effluent was also investigated fig s2b the deionized water fluxes 1900 l m2 h of the backwashed membranes with pre coagulation were much higher compared with that without pre coagulation 1534 l m2 h in particular the highest deionized water flux 2273 l m2 h of the backwashed membrane was obtained at 60 mg fe3 l which was about 97 of the original membrane flux 2350 l m2 h in treating wwtp effluent the membrane fouling was also greatly mitigated by 30 mg fe3 l pre coagulation fig 5c and fig s2c the umfi of the membrane with pre coagulation was about 1 7 of that without pre coagulation fig 5d the deionized water flux of the backwashed membrane 2200 l m2 h with pre coagulation was much higher than that 991 l m2 h without pre coagulation fig s2d 3 5 mechanism of pre coagulation on membrane fouling mitigation the mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation by pre coagulation could be related to the changes of membrane and effluent properties after filtrating the effluent with and without pre coagulation the membrane hydrophilicity was compared by monitoring the water contact angle of the fouled membrane shen et al 2017 as shown in fig 6 a pre coagulation at 15 90 mg fe3 l significantly reduced the contact angle of the fouled membrane 47 53 compared with that without pre coagulation 80 thereby increasing the membrane hydrophilicity for a high filtration flux the particle size of flocs in the effluent was also an important factor affecting the membrane resistance huang et al 2017 with the increase of fe3 dosage from 0 to 60 mg l the average particle size of fe coagulated flocs increased from 38 μm to around 170 μm fig 6b this would lead to the formation of looser cake layer and reduction of membrane pore blocking leading to a high flux and a low membrane resistance this result was confirmed by the membrane flux and resistance analysis fig 5a and table 1 when the fe3 dosage further increased to 90 mg l the particle size of the fe coagulated flocs decreased to 119 μm meanwhile decreased filtration flux as well as increased r r and r ir were also observed at 90 mg fe3 l fig 5a and table 1 the deteriorative performance at 90 mg fe3 l dosage might be attributed to the decrease in solution ph fig 6c and increase in the positive zeta potential of the effluents fig 6d at excess fe3 this result implies that the excess dosage of fe3 positively charged the colloids in effluent and would make it re stable and thus aggravate the membrane fouling maleki et al 2009 4 discussion in this study high removal efficiencies of both targs and eargs from wastewater effluents were achieved by the integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration figs 1 and 2 they were much higher compared with those obtained by most previously reported methods such as uv disinfection 0 54 1 21 logs for targs 0 30 0 35 logs for eargs chang et al 2017 sharma et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 ozonation 0 18 0 30 logs for targs zheng et al 2017 chlorination 0 18 0 27 logs for targs zhang et al 2015 and microfiltration 1 85 2 75 logs for targs 1 0 logs for eargs breazeal et al 2013 cheng and hong 2017 the absolute abundances of targs and eargs in the filtrate after the integrated process were all below the detection limit 102 copies ml greatly reducing the potential risks of args to the environment and human health when discharged to receiving waters thus the integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration offers a promising alternative to args removal from wastewater the excellent performance of integrated pre coagulation and microfiltration in args removal could be attributed to the following reasons in the coagulation process the zeta potential of effluents increased with the increase of fe3 dosage fig 6d this suggests that the electric double layer compression and charge neutralization of colloid would occur which might lead to the destabilization of eargs and arb li et al 2017 qin et al 2017 also found that fe3 would enhance the aggregation of edna through complexing with the negatively charged phosphate groups in edna and thus enhance the rejection of edna by microfiltration besides at a suitable ph range the fecl3 can hydrolyze to fe oh 2 and then convert to amorphous hydroxide colloids which are positively charged wang et al 2008 therefore the negatively charged eargs and arb would bind with the positively charged fe hydroxide colloids through electrostatic adsorption and entrapment in the coagulation process wang et al 2016 then the fe precipitates containing eargs and arb with large size 0 22 μm would be thoroughly rejected by the subsequent microfiltration fig 6b cheng and hong 2017 finally the fe precipitates on the membrane also contributed to the removal of eargs given that the earg removal efficiencies by coagulant fouled membrane was significantly p 0 05 higher than those by wastewater fouled membrane fig s3 since the flux 250 l m2 h of the coagulant fouled membrane was much higher than that 50 l m2 h of wastewater fouled membrane fig s4 the enhanced earg removal could be largely due to the absorption of eargs by fe precipitates in membrane surface rather than rejection of blocked membrane pore schmidt and martínez 2018 although excellent args removal from wastewater and mitigated membrane fouling were achieved by the integrated pre coagulation and microfiltration process several limitations may exist first args were just transferred to coagulation sludge from wastewater which may still pose risks to the environment if the coagulation sludge with concentrated args was not handled appropriately zhao et al 2018 thus a post treatment e g incineration and anaerobic digestion for coagulation sludge is required lin et al 2018 tian et al 2016 second this integrated process generally fails to remove some aromatic compounds fig 3b table s1 and hydrophilic components with low molecule weights e g low molecule weight natural organic matters liang and singer 2003 thus development and application of more effective coagulants in removing various kinds of pollutants is significantly important liu et al 2019 in the future more concerns should be paid to the post treatment of coagulation sludge for complete mineralization of args and development of novel coagulants for effective removal of various kinds of pollutants 5 conclusions in this study the integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration achieved excellent removal of both targs 2 9 logs and eargs 5 2 logs from wastewater effluents which was much higher compared with the commonly applied advanced wastewater treatment methods e g uv disinfection ozonation and chlorination this could be mainly attributed to the capture of negatively charged arb and eargs by the positively charged fe coagulated flocs in pre coagulation followed by co rejection in subsequent microfiltration meanwhile the integrated process showed good performance on the removal of soluble pollutants including doc phosphate and uv254 due to the presence of pre coagulation the membrane fouling was greatly mitigated and the reusability of membrane was significantly enhanced the findings suggest that pre coagulation coupled with microfiltration is a promising technology to effectively remove args both targs and eargs and common pollutants from wastewater for improved reused water

18772,antibiotic resistance genes args have been regarded as an emerging pollutant in municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents due to their potential risk to human health and ecological safety when reused for landscape and irrigation conventional wastewater treatment processes generally fail to effectively reduce args especially extracellular args eargs which are persistent in the environment and play an important role in horizontal gene transfer via transformation herein an integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration was developed for removal of args especially eargs from wastewater effluent results show that the integrated process could effectively reduce the absolute abundances of total args targs 2 9 logs and eargs 5 2 logs from the effluent the excellent performance could be mainly attributed to the capture of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and eargs by pre coagulation and co rejection during subsequent microfiltration moreover the integrated process exhibited a good performance on removing common pollutants e g dissolved organic carbon and phosphate from the effluent to improve water quality besides the integrated process also greatly reduced membrane fouling compared with microfiltration these findings suggest that the integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration is a promising advanced wastewater treatment technology for args especially eargs removal from wwtp effluents to ensure water reuse security graphical abstract image 1 keywords effluent extracellular antibiotic resistance genes pre coagulation microfiltration membrane fouling mitigation 1 introduction antibiotic resistance genes args are regarded as emerging micropollutants which have aroused public concern because of their risks to both human health and environmental ecosystem zhu et al 2013 due to acquiring a diverse mixture of antibiotics from hospitals agriculture farming and industries wastewater treatment plants wwtps have become one of the most important reservoirs of various args auerbach et al 2007 guo et al 2017 the traditional biological treatment processes generally fail to effectively remove args from wastewater and abundant args in the wwtp effluent 106 1010 copies l could be found li et al 2017 this would inevitably challenge the security of water recycling and reuse when effluent was discharged to the receiving water bodies rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 xu et al 2015 recently advanced oxidation processes including ozonation chlorination and ultraviolet uv disinfection have been studied to reduce the abundances of args from wwtp effluents zhang et al 2015 sharma et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 generally these methods could achieve effective inactivation of antibiotic resistance bacteria arb but fail to reduce equivalent args under the same conditions moreover the inactivation and cell lysis of arb could release intracellular args iargs to wastewater leading to increased abundance of extracellular args eargs in the effluents for example the abundances of eargs have been detected to vary from 103 copies l to as high as 109 copies l in the wwtp effluents after ozonation and chlorination zhang et al 2018 up to date increasing attention has been paid to eargs due to their persistence in the environment and important role in horizontal gene transfer via transformation wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 chang et al 2017 found that uv disinfection could only reduce the abundance of eargs with short amplicon sizes 300 bps by 0 30 0 35 logs implying insufficient destruction of eargs by uv disinfection to effectively reduce eargs from wwtp effluents higher dosages of reagents e g ozone free chlorine and uv are required but this would increase the formation of carcinogenic by products dong et al 2017 the physical treatments e g coagulation filtration and sand filtration have also been investigated to remove args xu et al 2016 li et al 2017 ren et al 2018 among them microfiltration has shown its effectiveness on the removal of iargs breazeal et al 2013 however the application of microfiltration would be limited because of its poor performance on earg removal as well as severe membrane fouling zhu and li 2013 breazeal et al 2013 the fe based coagulation has been proved to decrease the abundances of args by 1 15 2 46 logs in wwtp effluents li et al 2017 also it is hypothesized that fe based coagulation could reduce arb and eargs via charge neutralization and adsorption by fe3 hydrolysis products however the unthorough solid liquid separation and resuspension of the solid precipitates by water disturbance would reduce the effectiveness of coagulation in wastewater treatment this problem could be solved if a microfiltration process is followed after coagulation moreover pre coagulation can not only achieve enhanced removal of soluble pollutants but also reduce membrane fouling rojas et al 2011 huang et al 2017 lee et al 2017 therefore an integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration can probably achieve enhanced removal of args and common pollutants as well as reduced membrane fouling which is vital in wastewater treatment and water reuse but has rarely been explored in this work a microfiltration process integrated with pre coagulation was developed to achieve the following objectives 1 to assess the performance of the integrated process on the removal of targs and eargs from wastewater effluent 2 to evaluate the removal of common pollutants e g dissolved organic carbon doc and phosphate by this integrated process 3 to investigate the effects of this integrated process on membrane fouling mitigation and membrane reusability this work will offer a promising wastewater treatment technology for args removal and membrane fouling mitigation for improved water reuse safety 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf microfiltration membranes cat no gvwp 09050 used in this work were purchased from millipore inc usa the main properties of the pvdf membrane are pore size 0 22 μm porosity 70 and water flux 2350 l m2 h the membrane diameter was tailored to be 6 3 cm with an effective filtration area of 9 6 cm2 the fecl3 synopharm chemicals co china was used as the coagulant the plasmid pbr322 sangon biotech china containing two args i e teta and blatem 1 was chosen for the eargs experiments 2 2 integrated pre coagulation and microfiltration experiments the effluent used in this work was taken from a lab scale sequencing batch bioreactor sbr the main properties of the effluent were uv254 0 06 0 005 cm 1 doc 14 9 1 2 mg l suspended solids ss 30 4 mg l po4 3 p 1 8 0 5 mg l and ph 8 2 0 2 the effluent was stored at 4 c prior to the coagulation and microfiltration experiments the coagulation experiments were conducted in a 500 ml feed bottle with a magnetic stirrer ika inc german the coagulant fecl3 with designed concentrations 15 30 45 60 and 90 mg fe3 l was added into the 250 ml effluent and followed by rapid agitation 250 rpm 3 min and slow agitation 100 rpm 27 min the resulting liquids were settled for 30 min for subsequent measurements the microfiltration experiments were performed in a 50 ml stirring cell millipore inc usa coupled with a 500 ml feed bottle using a dead end filtration mode prior to microfiltration the pristine membranes were soaked in deionized water for 12 h and then filtrated with deionized water until the variation of deionized water flux maintained below 5 the feed bottle was connected to a compressed n2 cylinder and a filtration cell the transmembrane pressure was maintained at 0 1 mpa a total amount of 250 ml effluent was fed to feed bottle with agitation of 100 rpm for microfiltration after microfiltration the fouled membranes were stored at 4 c for further analysis the integrated pre coagulation and microfiltration experiments were performed with a coagulation process followed by a microfiltration process according to the procedures as described above all experiments were performed in duplicate 2 3 removal of targs and eargs the performances of coagulation microfiltration and their combination on the removal of targs and eargs were assessed for the targs removal experiments 80 ml of the effluent supernatant after coagulation and filtrate after microfiltration were collected and then freeze dried for dna extraction the eargs are generally defined as the residual args in the filtrate after microfiltration 0 22 μm breazeal et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 therefore to investigate the removal of eargs by the coagulation and microfiltration the effluent was firstly filtrated 0 22 μm membrane to remove iargs due to the low presence of eargs in the effluent the plasmid pbr322 containing both teta and blatem 1 was spiked into the filtrated effluent as the eargs the concentration of plasmid pbr322 was set at 10 μg l which was in the range of environmental edna concentration 0 56 88 μg l karl et al 1989 the eargs containing effluent was treated by coagulation microfiltration and their combination respectively to further assess the contribution of membrane fouling on the removal of eargs the fouled membranes with and without pre coagulation 60 and 0 mg fe3 l were reused to filtrate the filtrated effluent containing 10 μg l plasmid pbr322 the liquid samples 80 ml before and after these treatments were freeze dried for dna extraction the dna was extracted using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories usa the purity and concentration of dna were measured by a spectramax m2e microplate reader molecular devices the dna samples were stored at 20 c before quantitative pcr qpcr analysis for args all experiments were run in duplicate the args removal was expressed as log10 reduction calculated by the following equation 1 log removal log10 c 0 c where c 0 and c copies ml were the absolute abundances of args in liquid samples before and after treatments respectively 2 4 arg quantification by qpcr for the targs removal experiments three args i e teta suli and sulii and class 1 integrase inti1 were determined by qpcr using sybr premix ex taqii takara japan for the earg removal experiments teta and blatem 1 were quantified all qpcr assays were performed using a roche lightcycler 96 system roche diagnostics gmbh mannheim germany the primer sequence annealing temperature amplicon size and qpcr running condition were used as described previously chang et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 all samples were analyzed in duplicate in each qpcr run with a 6 point standard curve 10 fold dilutions and a negative control the qpcr amplification efficiencies of standard curves for various args should be between 90 and 110 with r2 values 0 99 2 5 membrane resistance calculation in this work the membrane flux was measured via using an electronic balance connected to a personal computer then the unified membrane fouling index umfi was calculated as eq 2 and a higher umfi value means more severe membrane fouling zhou et al 2017 2 umfi j 0 j t 1 v s where j 0 and j t represented the initial and end fluxes of membrane l m2 h respectively v s was the specific permeate volume l m2 the membrane resistance of the fouled membrane was calculated based on the following equations rahimpour et al 2008 lee and kim 2014 3 r t p μj t 4 r t r m r r r ir 5 r t r m r ir where p and μ were the transmembrane pressure pa and filtrate viscosity pa s respectively r t r m r r r t and r ir m 1 represented the total resistance membrane intrinsic resistance physically reversible resistance by rinsing residual total resistance after backwash and physically irreversible removable resistance respectively each resistance was calculated by the end flux of filtration at the given pressure using eq 3 the r t and r m were measured by filtrating the effluents and deionized water through the pristine membrane respectively the fouled membrane was backwashed with 100 ml deionized water and then r t was measured by re filtrating 50 ml deionized water the r r and r ir were calculated according to eqs 4 and 5 2 6 application of the integrated process for wwtp effluent the performance of the integrated process in membrane fouling mitigation and args removal was also assessed by using the real effluent from a local municipal wwtp hefei china all experimental procedures were performed as described above for treating the sbr effluent the main properties of the wwtp effluent were listed below uv254 0 23 0 002 cm 1 doc 20 7 1 1 mg l ss 14 2 mg l po4 3 p 0 14 0 01 mg l and ph 7 2 0 2 the fe3 dosage 30 mg l of pre coagulation was based on the practical coagulation dosage in the wwtp 2 7 analytical methods and statistical analysis all liquid samples except filtrate after microfiltration were filtrated by 0 45 μm filter prior to doc phosphate and uv254 analysis doc was measured by a total carbon analyzer multi n c2100 analytikjena german phosphate and ss were measured according to the standard methods apha 1998 solution ph was determined by a ph meter phs 3c leici china uv254 was quantified by a uv spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan at 254 nm wavelength and suva254 was calculated as the ratio of uv254 to doc the total fe in the supernatant was determined as previously reported ma et al 2016 the size of fe coagulated flocs after coagulation was photographed and then calculated by image pro plus software zeta potential of effluents before and after treatments was assessed by a zetasizer malvern inc uk the contact angle of the membranes was analyzed by a contact angle meter jc2000a powereach china three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to distinguish the variation of certain classes of organic matters in the effluents before and after treatments zhang et al 2016 all samples were analyzed in duplicate statistical analysis was based on one way anova a difference was considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 total args removal the performances of coagulation microfiltration and their combination in args removal were compared based on the decrease of absolute abundances of targs after treatments as shown in fig 1 a coagulation could effectively remove the target genes i e inti1 teta suli and sulii by more than 1 45 logs from the sbr effluent at fe3 dosages of 15 90 mg l the increased fe3 dosage did not enhance the removal of targs the highest removal of targs was achieved at 15 mg fe3 l reducing the absolute abundances of teta inti1 suli and sulii by 3 29 3 05 2 02 and 3 42 logs respectively after coagulation the absolute abundances of teta inti1 suli and sulii were 6 01 103 9 94 102 1 56 104 and 3 76 103 copies ml in the supernatants respectively the microfiltration also exhibited its effectiveness in targs removal with teta intli suli and sulii reduction of 3 76 3 20 2 68 and 4 00 logs respectively fig 1b after microfiltration the absolute abundances of teta inti1 and suli were 2 06 103 7 04 102 and 3 43 103 copies ml in the filtrate respectively while the abundance of sulii was below the detection limit the high removal efficiencies of targs resulted from the complete rejection of arbs by microfiltration in contrast the integrated pre coagulation and microfiltration fig 1b showed more excellent removal performances for all target genes 4 0 log reduction the absolute abundances of teta intli suli and sulii in the filtrate were all below the detection limits at fe3 dosages of 15 90 mg l similar results were observed in targs removal for treating the wwtp effluent as shown in fig 1c the coagulation 30 mg fe3 l and microfiltration treatments could remove the absolute abundances of targs by 1 3 1 8 and 1 9 3 5 logs respectively in contrast the integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration could achieve much better performances in targs removal 2 9 logs and all the target targs in the filtrate were below the detection limits 3 2 extracellular args removal the absolute abundances of teta and blatem 1 in the effluent before and after treatments were quantified to explore the performances of coagulation microfiltration and their combination in earg removal as shown in fig 2 a microfiltration could remove extracellular teta and blatem 1 by 1 3 and 1 4 logs from the sbr effluent respectively this was much lower compared with those from 2 7 to 4 0 logs achieved in the targs removal by microfiltration fig 1b the coagulation 60 mg fe3 l showed higher removal efficiencies for extracellular teta 3 1 logs and blatem 1 3 1 logs the integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration could further remove eargs by more than 5 2 logs from the sbr effluent the integrated process also achieved excellent earg removal 7 0 logs for the wwtp effluent which was much higher compared with those obtained by microfiltration 0 9 1 0 logs or coagulation 3 2 3 3 logs fig 2b 3 3 improvement of the effluent quality the performance of the integrated process was assessed in the removal of common pollutants including po4 3 doc uv254 and total fe as shown in fig 3 a compared with the microfiltration the integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration 15 90 mg fe3 l enhanced po4 3 removal efficiency by about 75 in treating the sbr effluent similar results were observed for the removal of doc fig 3a and uv254 fig 3b which were enhanced by 65 82 and 13 40 by the integrated process at fe3 dosages of 15 90 mg l in treating sbr effluent respectively compared with microfiltration the integrated process also could improve the water quality of the wwtp effluent table s1 and the removal efficiencies of doc uv254 and po4 3 were enhanced by 73 9 59 5 and 90 1 at 30 mg fe3 l respectively the 3d eem was used to further analyze the changes of doc components after treatment by the integrated process as illustrated in fig 4 the raw sbr effluent had four obvious peaks in the eem spectrum two for proteins ex em 240 350 nm and 285 330 nm and the others for humic like substance ex em 250 425 nm and fulvic like substance ex em 340 425 nm respectively the fluorescent intensities of these components decreased with the increase of fe3 dosage in particular at 90 mg fe3 l the fluorescent intensities of these organic matters were reduced by about 40 which partly accounted for the removal of doc however the suva254 showed an opposite trend which increased with the increase of fe3 dosage fig 3b elevated suva254 was also observed by the integrated process in treating wwtp effluent table s1 this indicates that fecl3 coagulation might have lower removal for some aromatic components compared with the removal of other components of doc the residual total fe concentration in the sbr effluent after treatments fig s1 was also quantified given that it might increase the turbidity and color of the treated water the total fe concentration in the supernatant after coagulation varied in the range of 0 03 0 39 mg l at fe3 dosages of 0 90 mg l in contrast the total fe concentration in the filtrate after the integrated process was much lower 0 0 018 mg l suggesting complete solid liquid separation was achieved in the subsequent microfiltration 3 4 performance of anti fouling and reusability of membrane by pre coagulation the performance of pre coagulation in anti fouling and membrane reusability was evaluated by monitoring the fluxes of the membranes with and without pre coagulation in treating the sbr effluent the flux of microfiltration without pre coagulation decreased quickly with increased volume of filtrate finally reaching only 1 7 41 l m2 h of the initial flux fig 5 a in contrast the membrane fouling was effectively mitigated with pre coagulation 15 90 mg l in particular the highest end flux 430 l m2 h of the membrane was achieved at 60 mg fe3 l which also reduced the filtration time by 87 compared with that without pre coagulation fig s2a similar result was observed for umfi which achieved its lowest value at 60 mg fe3 l pre coagulation fig 5b meanwhile the total resistance r t physically reversible resistance r r and physically irreversible removable resistance r ir all decreased with the increase of fe3 dosage and reached the lowest values after pre coagulation at 60 mg fe3 l table 1 these indicate that pre coagulation at 60 mg fe3 l was the optimum condition for reducing membrane fouling with the lowest formation of reversible and irreversible fouling for the sbr effluent the reusability of membrane after filtrating sbr effluent was also investigated fig s2b the deionized water fluxes 1900 l m2 h of the backwashed membranes with pre coagulation were much higher compared with that without pre coagulation 1534 l m2 h in particular the highest deionized water flux 2273 l m2 h of the backwashed membrane was obtained at 60 mg fe3 l which was about 97 of the original membrane flux 2350 l m2 h in treating wwtp effluent the membrane fouling was also greatly mitigated by 30 mg fe3 l pre coagulation fig 5c and fig s2c the umfi of the membrane with pre coagulation was about 1 7 of that without pre coagulation fig 5d the deionized water flux of the backwashed membrane 2200 l m2 h with pre coagulation was much higher than that 991 l m2 h without pre coagulation fig s2d 3 5 mechanism of pre coagulation on membrane fouling mitigation the mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation by pre coagulation could be related to the changes of membrane and effluent properties after filtrating the effluent with and without pre coagulation the membrane hydrophilicity was compared by monitoring the water contact angle of the fouled membrane shen et al 2017 as shown in fig 6 a pre coagulation at 15 90 mg fe3 l significantly reduced the contact angle of the fouled membrane 47 53 compared with that without pre coagulation 80 thereby increasing the membrane hydrophilicity for a high filtration flux the particle size of flocs in the effluent was also an important factor affecting the membrane resistance huang et al 2017 with the increase of fe3 dosage from 0 to 60 mg l the average particle size of fe coagulated flocs increased from 38 μm to around 170 μm fig 6b this would lead to the formation of looser cake layer and reduction of membrane pore blocking leading to a high flux and a low membrane resistance this result was confirmed by the membrane flux and resistance analysis fig 5a and table 1 when the fe3 dosage further increased to 90 mg l the particle size of the fe coagulated flocs decreased to 119 μm meanwhile decreased filtration flux as well as increased r r and r ir were also observed at 90 mg fe3 l fig 5a and table 1 the deteriorative performance at 90 mg fe3 l dosage might be attributed to the decrease in solution ph fig 6c and increase in the positive zeta potential of the effluents fig 6d at excess fe3 this result implies that the excess dosage of fe3 positively charged the colloids in effluent and would make it re stable and thus aggravate the membrane fouling maleki et al 2009 4 discussion in this study high removal efficiencies of both targs and eargs from wastewater effluents were achieved by the integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration figs 1 and 2 they were much higher compared with those obtained by most previously reported methods

logs for targs zhang et al 2015 and microfiltration 1 85 2 75 logs for targs 1 0 logs for eargs breazeal et al 2013 cheng and hong 2017 the absolute abundances of targs and eargs in the filtrate after the integrated process were all below the detection limit 102 copies ml greatly reducing the potential risks of args to the environment and human health when discharged to receiving waters thus the integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration offers a promising alternative to args removal from wastewater the excellent performance of integrated pre coagulation and microfiltration in args removal could be attributed to the following reasons in the coagulation process the zeta potential of effluents increased with the increase of fe3 dosage fig 6d this suggests that the electric double layer compression and charge neutralization of colloid would occur which might lead to the destabilization of eargs and arb li et al 2017 qin et al 2017 also found that fe3 would enhance the aggregation of edna through complexing with the negatively charged phosphate groups in edna and thus enhance the rejection of edna by microfiltration besides at a suitable ph range the fecl3 can hydrolyze to fe oh 2 and then convert to amorphous hydroxide colloids which are positively charged wang et al 2008 therefore the negatively charged eargs and arb would bind with the positively charged fe hydroxide colloids through electrostatic adsorption and entrapment in the coagulation process wang et al 2016 then the fe precipitates containing eargs and arb with large size 0 22 μm would be thoroughly rejected by the subsequent microfiltration fig 6b cheng and hong 2017 finally the fe precipitates on the membrane also contributed to the removal of eargs given that the earg removal efficiencies by coagulant fouled membrane was significantly p 0 05 higher than those by wastewater fouled membrane fig s3 since the flux 250 l m2 h of the coagulant fouled membrane was much higher than that 50 l m2 h of wastewater fouled membrane fig s4 the enhanced earg removal could be largely due to the absorption of eargs by fe precipitates in membrane surface rather than rejection of blocked membrane pore schmidt and martínez 2018 although excellent args removal from wastewater and mitigated membrane fouling were achieved by the integrated pre coagulation and microfiltration process several limitations may exist first args were just transferred to coagulation sludge from wastewater which may still pose risks to the environment if the coagulation sludge with concentrated args was not handled appropriately zhao et al 2018 thus a post treatment e g incineration and anaerobic digestion for coagulation sludge is required lin et al 2018 tian et al 2016 second this integrated process generally fails to remove some aromatic compounds fig 3b table s1 and hydrophilic components with low molecule weights e g low molecule weight natural organic matters liang and singer 2003 thus development and application of more effective coagulants in removing various kinds of pollutants is significantly important liu et al 2019 in the future more concerns should be paid to the post treatment of coagulation sludge for complete mineralization of args and development of novel coagulants for effective removal of various kinds of pollutants 5 conclusions in this study the integrated process of pre coagulation and microfiltration achieved excellent removal of both targs 2 9 logs and eargs 5 2 logs from wastewater effluents which was much higher compared with the commonly applied advanced wastewater treatment methods e g uv disinfection ozonation and chlorination this could be mainly attributed to the capture of negatively charged arb and eargs by the positively charged fe coagulated flocs in pre coagulation followed by co rejection in subsequent microfiltration meanwhile the integrated process showed good performance on the removal of soluble pollutants including doc phosphate and uv254 due to the presence of pre coagulation the membrane fouling was greatly mitigated and the reusability of membrane was significantly enhanced the findings suggest that pre coagulation coupled with microfiltration is a promising technology to effectively remove args both targs and eargs and common pollutants from wastewater for improved reused water

18773,floating treatment wetlands ftws are a plant based treatment technology shown to remove excess nutrients and metals from surface waters under a variety of conditions plants established in ftws can accumulate and store nutrients within their tissues but the amount of uptake and storage is dependent on plant species and nutrient influent concentration this research was designed to quantify the influence of nutrient load and two plant species on nutrient uptake and partitioning patterns within plant tissues shoots and roots so that management recommendations for ftws can be developed to better protect surface water quality treatments consisted of 1 two nutrient loads a high concentration of 15 mg l 1 nitrogen n and a low concentration of 5 mg l 1 n supplied as water soluble fertilizer and 2 four mesocosm treatments a open water b artificial mat only no plants c artificial mats planted with pontederia cordata l and d artificial mats planted with juncus effusus l plant growth n and phosphorus p uptake of both p cordata and j effusus were greater in the high nutrient treatment than in the low pontederia cordata facilitated the highest rates of n 0 31 mg l day 1 and p 0 34 mg l day 1 removal the nutrient removal rates facilitated by juncus effusus in the high nutrient treatment were much lower for both n 0 03 mg l day 1 and p 0 02 mg l day 1 peak n and p accumulation in j effusus occurred in september within both root 50 g n and 4 8 g p and shoot tissues 98 g n and 12 5 g p the uptake of n and p in p cordata was highest in root tissues in august 307 g n and 30 5 g p and in shoot tissues in september 1490 g n and 219 5 g p in both species shoots accumulated more n and p than the roots resulting in a small root shoot ratio at all stages of the experiment harvest of plants from ftws should occur before plants senesce in the fall which using p cordata and j effusus as model species occurred from mid to late september in usda hardiness zone 8a

remediation lynch et al 2015 stewart et al 2008 wang et al 2015 white and cousins 2013 floating treatment wetlands consist of emergent plants established on a buoyant mat with openings for plant insertion suspended on the surface of a water body in ftw systems the shoots and crowns of the plants grow above the water level while the roots extend down into the water column developing an

increases accumulation and storage of n and p have been shown to increase keizer vlek et al 2014 kyambadde et al 2004 zhu et al 2011 the presence of plants within a treatment system designed to remediate nutrients may not always prove beneficial for example if biomass is not harvested before the plant begins to senesce it is possible for some of the nutrients sequestered within plant tissues to be released into the water column as plant tissues decay li et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 pavlineri et al 2017 suggested that plant harvest in ftw applications is essential for removing nutrients completely from the water system and that whole plant harvesting needs to be further examined zhou and wang 2010 also suggested regular harvesting to increase system efficacy and prevent decaying plant tissue from reentering the system limited information is available regarding the uptake and translocation of nutrients within ftw vegetation kadlec and reddy 2001 indicated that the influence of vegetation on contaminant removal is not based solely on temperature but may also vary over the different seasons wang et al 2015 observed seasonal changes in biomass and p accumulation in ftw plants recommending harvest of above ground vegetation be conducted during summer in june for maximum p removal or in september to prevent p release due to plant senescence wang et al 2015 noted information is lacking with regard to plant growth rates and plant tissue capacity to accumulate and store nutrients within soilless environments such as those that plants within ftws inhabit this knowledge gap is in large part due to a lack of information on two factors 1 species selection and 2 the rate of nutrient uptake release over time the biomass accumulation nutrient storage capacity and allocation root structure microbial communities and the growth cycle of the plant e g annual perennial differ among plant species specifically plants with high biomass accumulation potential can extract larger amounts of nutrients from their environment and store these nutrients in biomass and litter meuleman et al 2002 therefore the nutrient removal efficacy of ftws is highly dependent upon the species used within the system headley and tanner 2012 li and guo 2017 several researchers have demonstrated that increased influent nutrient concentration rates heighten removal efficacy by increasing vegetative growth and subsequently nutrient uptake by plants karnchanawong and sanjitt 1995 white and cousins 2013 yang et al 2008 species selection and rate of nutrient removal have been undertaken for free water surface and subsurface flow cws the sampling periods during selected studies with cws have varied from short term on the scale of hours or days to long term multiple year studies these short and long term studies have assisted with determination of peak nutrient uptake of the system schaafsma et al 1999 duration of optimal performance al rubaei et al 2016 and reactions of the system to variable influent loading rates dusek et al 2008 gebremariam and beutel 2008 many ftw studies table s1 have been conducted that range in duration sampling periods and plant species trialed yet few considered the changes in nutrient remediation rates over the experiment nor identified peak uptake understanding of nutrient remediation rates and therefore optimal harvest time is imperative for ftw systems due to potential for release of nutrients back into the surface waters when plants senesce this experiment studied both the short weekly and long term seasonal nutrient remediation patterns of two aquatic plants at two levels of nutrient availability quantifying changes in nutrient uptake over time will help better explain species uptake efficiencies and ftw planting and harvest times to promote the greatest nutrient removal 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental floating treatment wetland construction the experiment was conducted from may october 2015 20 weeks representative of a typical growing season for plants in usda hardiness zone 8a the experimental system was assembled at the water treatment technology laboratory at the south carolina water resources center at clemson university pendleton south carolina usa 34 640n 82 773w and consisted of 32 378 5 l structural foam stock tanks or mesocosms rubbermaid atlanta ga fig 1 each mesocosm had a surface area of 1 15 m2 and a volume of 0 59 m3 mesocosms were equipped with a quarter turn valve at the outflow to control release of water holes were drilled 6 cm from the rim at one end of the mesocosm to regulate overflow and release of water each mesocosm held an average of 314 l of water mesocosms were arranged in a completely randomized block design each mesocosm could be filled from either of two 5867 l black plastic storage stock tanks norwesco st bonifacius mn depending on the treatment assigned each mesocosm was supplied with water from the stock tanks via pvc pipe and fittings with an inline pump little giant fort wayne in inlets to each mesocosm were equipped with a quarter turn valve to control water volume and which stock tank filled each mesocosm once a mesocosm was assigned to a treatment it consistently received water from the same stock tank the floating mat used to hold plants above the water was a 2 cm thick solid core foam mat beemats new smyrna beach fl cut to 60 cm 30 cm and joined using 10 cm nylon connectors each mat section had 20 7 5 cm pre cut holes spaced 12 cm on center holes allowed for the insertion of specially designed plastic aerator cups in which plants were placed keeping the crown of the plant above the water surface while permitting the plant roots to extend into the water column below the mat the experiment was designed as a 4 2 factorial with 4 plant mat combinations and 2 nutrient exposure levels table 1 the 4 plant mat treatments were 1 no plants no mat 2 no plants with mat 3 pontederia cordata pickerel weed with mat and 4 juncus effusus soft rush with mat these species were selected based upon their common use within ftw systems as well as their differences in growth cycle deciduous vs evergreen plants were purchased as bareroot liners 8 10 cm long florida aquatic nursery davie fl and washed using municipal water to remove any remaining residues or substrates prior to planting plants were planted at 10 plants per mat or 50 plant coverage to prevent crowding as the plants grew over the 20 week experiment 2 2 simulation of runoff containing nutrients mesocosms were filled with municipal water to which water soluble fertilizer was added to simulate concentrations similar to either nursery irrigation runoff or stormwater runoff average total nitrogen tn levels were 14 6 5 2 mg l 1 n high or 4 88 1 75 mg l 1 n low and total phosphorus tp levels were 2 3 0 68 mg l 1 p high and 0 82 0 44 mg l 1 p low table 2 the 15 mg l 1 n solution was comparable to nursery irrigation runoff while the 5 mg l 1 n solution was comparable to stormwater runoff from an urban area leisenring et al 2010 white 2013 the simulated runoff was prepared by dissolving water soluble fertilizer 343 g 5500 l 1 for the high treatment and 115 g 5500 l 1

were continuously mixed using the inline pump for 2 h prior to filling the mesocosms sixteen mesocosms were filled from the high n stock tank and 16 mesocosms were filled from the low n stock tank using the pump and pvc distribution system mesocosms were filled on day 0 from the stock tanks and then drained on day 7 to simulate a seven day hydraulic retention time hrt throughout the 20 week experiment duration for a total of 20 fills 2 3 water sampling and analysis for each experimental mesocosm n 32 water samples were collected at day 7 for all 20 weeks all samples were taken at a 15 cm depth in the morning between 7 00 and 9 00 a m every other week samples were also collected on day 3 and day 5 beginning at week 1 to better understand the short term dynamics of the system water samples were also collected weekly from the stock tanks prior to filling the mesocosms to establish a baseline of the average concentration of nutrients in the two simulated runoff treatments table 2

handheld multi meter with individual sensors for each parameter ysi yellow springs oh the sensors on the hand held multi meter were allowed to stabilize prior to recording measurements 2 4 plant sampling and analysis the roots below mat biomass and shoots above mat biomass of six representative plants per species juncus effusus and pontederia cordata were harvested at day 0 of the experiment to establish baseline allocation and concentration of nutrients within the plant tissues plant size measurements were performed every 14 days on the same three plants per species per experimental mesocosm over the sampling period those plants were then harvested at the end of the 20 week period for final tissue concentrations to determine plant nutrient accumulation and allocation over time four separate mesocosms two per species were treated as harvest mesocosms and were used to harvest plants overtime during the experiment so as not to confound results from the experimental mesocosms one mesocosm per plant species was exposed to the high nutrient treatment and the other to the low nutrient treatment the four 378 5 l structural foam mesocosms identical in size to the 32 experimental mesocosms were drained and filled in the same manner as the experimental units every four weeks beginning at week 4 two plants from each harvest mesocosm were harvested at random to quantify changes in nutrient composition and biomass over time for a total of five harvests plant size measurement shoot height cm longest root length cm and plant width cm in two directions cm widest and narrowest point were taken on the two harvest plants at each harvest interval these measurements were then compared to the same measurements collected on plants within the experimental mesocosms

mg l and k is the rate constant mg l day 1 estimates of k provide an indication of the rate constant at which nutrient uptake occurred several steps were needed to quantify the effects of time and treatment nutrient concentration and plant species on nutrient removal efficacy and rate plant nutrient uptake efficiency and nutrient allocation within plant tissues the first step determined if the weekly changes were best represented by an overall change from day 0 to day 7 endpoints day 7 only weekly slope rate of change etc in the second step we developed a model relating the weekly change to the overall effects of time and treatment analysis of variance anova was used to test the time and treatment effects of the model in the third step we developed a model determining the rate of change rate constant by treatment within each week and then anova was used to test the effect of treatment in the models for each week when treatment and week or their interaction were found to have a significant effect the fisher s least significant difference test was used to further study the nature of these effects for monthly effects the monthly plant tissue concentration was plotted to determine visually when peak uptake occurs an anova was used to test the effect of treatment on the monthly plant nutrient concentration finally in step four we calculated nutrient budgets to quantify the overall change and efficacy of each treatment all statistical calculations were conducted using jmp v13 sas institute inc cary nc and p values 0 05 were considered evidence of statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient removal over time plant nutrient uptake facilitated by the presence of plants and ftws was evaluated over both the short term 7 days and long term 20 weeks when assessing changes in concentration on a weekly basis after each seven day exposure to p cordata or j effusus with high and low tn fig 2 and tp fig 3 loads results were clustered by plant species and separated by influent nutrient concentrations data are presented as loading rates to account for mass of nutrients per unit surface area of the water covered by ftws g m 2 initial nutrient loads were variable by week as adjustments to stock tanks resulted in fluctuations during the first six weeks of the experiment p cordata consistently removed tn and tp between days 0 3 5 and 7 beginning in week 7 nutrient removal by j effusus was inconsistent throughout the experiment with fluctuations in tn and tp concentrations during days 3 and 5 figs 2 and 3 in most cases the nutrient load on day 7 was lower than the load on day 0 indicating net removal instances occurred in the beginning of the study in which nutrient load at day 7 was higher than at day 0 indicating release of n and p this occurred in week 5 for both species tn and tp and week 3 for j effusus tn during weeks 4 and 9 the tn load measured at day 7 was lower than on day 0 for both plant species however the load of tp increased over the course of the week for j effusus while decreasing in the presence of p cordata figs 2 and 3 this initial period of fluctuation week 1 6 could indicate transplant shock root and shoot dieback and adaptation to a new environment followed by increased growth beginning in week 7 fig 4 these findings align with previous research with wetland plants where once plants were established n removal stabilized heffernan and fisher 2012 spangler et al 2019 see fig 2 pontederia cordata reduced the load of tn in the hyp from 4 5 1 2 g m 2 tn to 1 6 0 92 g m 2 similar to the final tn load of the low solution 1 8 0 51 g m 2 p 0 0001 fig 2 this may indicate that p cordata has a lower limit of remediation in these conditions of approximately 0 86 g m 2 tn further in situations where initial nutrient loads fall within the low nutrient range p cordata may not be the most suitable plant selection for use in ftws research from other studies indicate plants such as canna bengal tiger and peltandra virginica can perform well when exposed to low nutrient conditions polomski et al 2007 within the hyp treatment the load of tp remaining in solution at day 7 were more variable than for tn 0 02 g m 2 tp to 0 92 g m 2 tp for many weeks tp removal in hyp was at or below the day 0 load of the lyp treatment at day 7 fig 3 this continued tp removal was not seen within the lyj treatment juncus effusus is a comparatively slower growing plant with low minimum nutrient requirements mccorry and renou 2003 as evidenced by the similar amount of nutrients removed in both the high and low nutrient treatments an average of 0 58 0 35 g m 2 for hyj and 0 54 0 26 g m 2 for lyj p 0 05 these changes can be further assessed by observing the rate constant in tn and tp over the course of the seven days figs 5 and 6 while j effusus had a consistent low weekly rate of change rate constant mg m 2 day 1 over the duration of the experiment the rate for p cordata increased over time peaking around week 14 for high concentrations of tn and tp p 0 001 and week 12 for low concentrations of tn and tp p 0 005 the initial concentration of nutrients in simulated runoff did not influence the nutrient removal rate of hyj or lyj p 0 238 for tn and p 0 623 for tp initial concentration was important for p cordata p 0 005 for tn and tp with the hyp treatment facilitating faster removal rates than the lyp treatment figs 5 and 6 these differences are most likely attributable to differences in the growth characteristics of j effusus and p cordata and are consistent with other published findings gettys and dumroese 2009 godfrey and wooten 1979 both species are herbaceous perennials however in usda hardiness zone 8a juncus effusus is also evergreen this means there is potential for year round accumulation of nutrients within plant tissues whereas pontederia cordata vegetation grew rapidly until it flowered during august and september thereafter the vegetative growth of pontederia cordata slowed and nutrient uptake declined as the plant entered dormancy and tissues began to senesce in late october to mid november fig 4 the species of plant established within the ftw greatly influenced removal of both tn and tp compared with j effusus p cordata consistently reduced the effluent nutrient concentration by 37 tn and 42 tp in high treatments and by 34 tn and 22 tp in low concentrations p 0 0001 table 3 3 2 plant nutrient accumulation and partitioning an important component when assessing the rate of removal of p and n in ftws is the mass of nutrients accumulated within the plants in comparison to other removal processes table 3 nitrogen accumulation within p cordata 35 4 g m 2 high and 10 5 g m 2 low was higher than j effusus 4 89 g m 2 high and 2 89 g m 2 low p 0 0001 for both high and low treatments phosphorus assimilation trends were similar for high and low nutrient treatments with p cordata accumulating 4 36 g m 2 and 1 25 g m 2 respectively compared to j effusus accumulating 0 53 g m 2 g and 0 27 g m 2 respectively p 0 0001 for both high and low treatments table 3 the n accumulation values correlate with plant growth and plant mass data at harvest p 0 0001 fig 7 data show that on a per m2 basis p cordata was able to remove 3 6 to 7 2 times more n and between 4 6 and 8 2 time more p than j effusus depending on treatment peak uptake of both n and p was in september for both p cordata and j effusus in the high nutrient treatments uptake of n and p p 0 0001 for p cordata p 0 002 for juncus was similarly consistent in low nutrient treatments peaking in september for all except the lyp treatment which demonstrated continued accumulation of p in root and shoot tissues fig 7 the peak in nutrient accumulation may be an indicator of ideal harvest time to prevent the majority of nutrient release back into the water as plant tissues senesce temperature did not influence accumulation patterns p 0 324 during the experiment however multiple iterations of the experiment performed over different years and locations would help to better understand if time to peak accumulation is temperature related or seasonally driven for example had the experiment been initiated one month earlier would peak removal shift back a month to august or if september were hotter than the 2015 average of 24 8 c would this delay time to peak also physiological senescence initiation and morphological flowering changes within plants in ftws may be more pertinent drivers of peak accumulation than time planted or temperature keizer vlek et al 2014 kyambadde et al 2004 zhu et al 2011 mamolos et al 2011 found that wetland species typically have a delayed peak in biomass production and accumulation in comparison to upland species due to a longer growing period furthermore mamolos et al 2011 determined a delay in peak of biomass by one month from peak of nutrient accumulation in this study biomass decreased the month accumulation peak but could be attributed to senescence from cooler weather and preparation for dormancy fig 4 determining the pattern of nutrient partitioning within plants is important for understanding which portion of the plant to harvest to remove the largest mass of nutrients edwards et al 2006 karathanasis et al 2003 zhu et al 2011 initial n and p allocations for j effusus were concentrated in the shoot with 66 9 of n and 64 6 of p for both high and low nutrient concentrations fig s1 during the growing season the majority of n allocation was in the j effusus shoots with an average root shoot ratio of 0 31 0 69 for hyj and 0 33 0 67 for lyj phosphorus partitioning trends were similar to n for j effusus p 0 05 with root shoot allocations of 0 29 0 71 for hyj and 0 32 0 68 for lyj while n ratios were similar for p cordata and j effusus p ratios differed p 0 034 with a greater allocation of p within shoot tissues for p cordata while p cordata initially in may at transplant had more n and p within root tissues than shoot tissues 0 66 0 34 n and 0 51 0 49 p by june n and p partitioning had shifted and n and p were predominantly stored in shoot tissues 0 16 0 84 n and 0 08 0 92 p nitrogen and p partitioning mainly within shoot tissues persisted for the remainder of the growing season with some variability between months p 0 004 fig s1 the changes in nutrient allocation were correlated with biomass production r 0 83 fig 4 a both pontederia cordata and juncus effusus had a greater increase in shoot biomass throughout the growing season than root biomass p 0 0032 pontederia and p 0 029 juncus therefore a greater proportion of nutrients were accumulated in the actively growing tissues the shoots diminution of nutrients within tissues following peak uptake in september were most likely regulated by metabolic processes in the shoots nutrient concentration did not contribute to changes in nutrient storage location low vs high nutrient treatments and partitioning differences in roots and shoots the nutrient levels in this experiment may have been higher than those previously shown to affect partitioning and biomass distribution wang et al 2015 despite relatively lower mass of nutrients fixed within root tissues root tissues still contribute considerable nutrient removal thus our recommendation concurs with that of pavlineri et al 2017 according to which the whole plant should be harvested to prevent release of nutrients back into the water column maintenance costs and feasibility of harvest for nutrient removal are debated based on whether ftws are actively or passively managed if the ultimate purpose of a ftw installation is nutrient management then active management including harvest is needed to remove plant absorbed nutrients and better prevent and short circuit internal nutrient cycles in natural waters if ftws are installed as a best management practices for mitigation of nutrients in watersheds as part of basin wide nutrient management plans then harvest of the whole plant is critical as nutrient credits are based on total biomass removed and tissue concentrations additional research in different geographic locations and expanding start of the experiment and harvest through additional months would enhance understanding of the effect of seasonality and plant growth decay on nutrient partitioning 3 3 role of the ftw mat in remediation of n and p previously some studies have assessed how the ftw mat used influences the remediation capacity of ftws hu et al 2010 wang and sample 2014 zhao et al 2013 results from the these studies conflicted with each other hu et al 2010 found no difference with or without the ftw mat in an ecological sludge floating bed artificial eco system wang and sample 2014 determined their mat a 20 cm thick blended fiber matrix facilitated removal of a similar mass of nutrients as those treatments established with both plants and the mat indicating a substantial role of microorganisms zhao et al 2013 reported that once established the mat plastic trays with 12 holes filled with mixed media in rhizo bags performed better than the control no ftw mat but worse than a planted mat results from this study add another scenario as the control no mat outperformed the mat only treatment in removal of both tn and tp at both nutrient levels table 4 furthermore the control facilitated removal of a greater mass of both n and p in comparison to hyj treatments p 0 05 and n compared to lyj p 0 05 however mats planted with pontederia cordata outperformed the control for both n and p removal p 0 05 57 5 g m 2 n and 48 8 g m 2 p compared to 28 7 g m 2 n and 9 00 g m 2 p for high fertilizer table 3 no measurements were collected quantifying the mass of algae and chlorophyll a present in the system which would have been beneficial however based on observations larger amounts of algae grew in the mesocosms with no mat in comparison to those with a mat this could be one explanation for the higher remediation levels achieved by the no mat control algal communities in the no mat control may have contributed to some removal of nutrients while mesocosms covered with a mat were shaded leaving the system with little surface area open to the sunlight needed by the algal communities for energy production and growth dissolved oxygen concentration plays an important role in nitrification and denitrification of a system as nitrification is an aerobic process do 2 0 mg l while denitrification is an anaerobic process do 1 0 mg

18773,floating treatment wetlands ftws are a plant based treatment technology shown to remove excess nutrients and metals from surface waters under a variety of conditions plants established in ftws can accumulate and store nutrients within their tissues but the amount of uptake and storage is dependent on plant species and nutrient influent concentration this research was designed to quantify the influence of nutrient load and two plant species on nutrient uptake and partitioning patterns within plant tissues shoots and roots so that management recommendations for ftws can be developed to better protect surface water quality treatments consisted of 1 two nutrient loads a high concentration of 15 mg l 1 nitrogen n and a low concentration of 5 mg l 1 n supplied as water soluble

remediation lynch et al 2015 stewart et al 2008 wang et al 2015 white and cousins 2013 floating treatment wetlands consist of emergent plants established on a buoyant mat with openings for plant insertion suspended on the surface of a water body in ftw systems the shoots and crowns of the plants grow above the water level while the roots extend down into the water column developing an extensive below mat root system pavlineri et al 2017 plants are an important component facilitating contaminant transformation and removal within ftws akratos and tsihrintzis 2007 headley and tanner

within plant root and shoot tissues positively correlates with overall system treatment efficacy keizer vlek et al 2014 kyambadde et al 2004 white and cousins 2013 additionally as plant biomass increases accumulation and storage of n and p have been shown to increase keizer vlek et al 2014 kyambadde et al 2004 zhu et al 2011 the presence of plants within a treatment system designed to remediate nutrients may not always prove beneficial for example if biomass is not harvested before the plant begins to senesce it is possible for some of the nutrients sequestered within plant tissues to be released into the water column as plant tissues decay li et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 pavlineri et al 2017 suggested that plant harvest in ftw applications is essential for removing nutrients completely from the water system and that whole plant harvesting needs to be further examined zhou and wang 2010 also suggested regular harvesting to increase system efficacy and prevent decaying plant tissue from reentering the system limited information is available regarding the uptake and translocation of nutrients within ftw vegetation kadlec and reddy 2001 indicated that the influence of vegetation on contaminant removal is not based solely on temperature but may also vary over the different seasons wang et al 2015 observed seasonal changes in biomass and p accumulation in ftw plants recommending harvest of above ground vegetation be conducted during summer in june for maximum p removal or in september to prevent p release due to plant senescence wang et al 2015 noted information is lacking with regard to plant growth rates and plant tissue capacity to accumulate and store nutrients within soilless environments such as those that plants within ftws inhabit this knowledge gap is in large part due to a lack of information on two factors 1 species selection and 2 the rate of nutrient uptake release over time the biomass accumulation nutrient storage capacity and allocation root structure microbial communities and the growth cycle of the plant e g annual perennial differ among plant species specifically plants with high biomass accumulation potential can extract larger amounts of nutrients from their environment and store these nutrients in biomass and litter meuleman et al 2002 therefore the nutrient removal efficacy of ftws is highly dependent upon the species used within the system headley and tanner 2012 li and guo 2017 several researchers have demonstrated that increased influent nutrient concentration rates heighten removal efficacy by increasing vegetative growth and subsequently nutrient uptake by plants karnchanawong and sanjitt 1995 white and cousins 2013 yang et al 2008 species selection and rate of nutrient removal have been undertaken for free water surface and subsurface flow cws the sampling periods during selected studies with cws have varied from short term on the scale of hours or days to long term multiple year studies these short and long term studies have assisted with determination of peak nutrient uptake of the system schaafsma et al 1999 duration of optimal performance al rubaei et al 2016 and reactions of the system to variable influent loading rates dusek et al 2008 gebremariam and beutel 2008 many ftw studies table s1 have been conducted that range in duration sampling periods and plant species trialed yet few considered the changes in nutrient remediation rates over the experiment nor identified peak uptake understanding of nutrient remediation rates and therefore optimal harvest time is imperative for ftw systems due to potential for release of nutrients back into the surface waters when plants senesce this experiment studied both the short weekly and long term seasonal nutrient remediation patterns of two aquatic plants at two levels of nutrient availability quantifying changes in nutrient uptake over time will help better explain species uptake efficiencies and ftw planting and harvest times to promote the greatest nutrient removal 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental floating treatment wetland construction the experiment was conducted from may october 2015 20 weeks representative of a typical growing season for plants in usda hardiness zone 8a the experimental system was assembled at the water treatment technology laboratory at the south carolina water resources center at clemson university pendleton south carolina usa 34 640n 82 773w and consisted of 32 378 5 l structural foam stock tanks or mesocosms rubbermaid atlanta ga fig 1 each mesocosm had a surface area of 1 15 m2 and a volume of 0 59 m3 mesocosms were equipped with a quarter turn valve at the outflow to control release of water holes were drilled 6 cm from the rim at one end of the mesocosm to regulate overflow and release of water each mesocosm held an average of 314 l of water mesocosms were arranged in a completely randomized block design each mesocosm could be filled from either of two 5867 l black plastic storage stock tanks norwesco st bonifacius mn depending on the treatment assigned each mesocosm was supplied with water from the stock tanks via pvc pipe and fittings with an inline pump little giant fort wayne in inlets to each mesocosm were equipped with a quarter turn valve to control water volume and which stock tank filled each mesocosm once a mesocosm was assigned to a treatment it consistently received water from the same stock tank the floating mat used to hold plants above the water was a 2 cm thick solid core foam mat beemats new smyrna beach fl cut to 60 cm 30 cm and joined using 10 cm nylon connectors each mat section had 20 7 5 cm pre cut holes spaced 12 cm on center holes allowed for the insertion of specially designed plastic aerator cups in which plants were placed keeping the crown of the plant above the water surface while permitting the plant roots to extend into the water column below the mat the experiment was designed as a 4 2 factorial with 4 plant mat combinations and 2 nutrient exposure levels table 1 the 4 plant mat treatments were 1 no plants no mat 2 no plants with mat 3 pontederia cordata pickerel weed with mat and 4 juncus effusus soft rush with mat these species were selected based upon their common use within ftw systems as well as their differences in growth cycle deciduous vs evergreen plants were purchased as bareroot liners 8 10 cm long florida aquatic nursery davie fl and washed using municipal water to remove any remaining residues or substrates prior to planting plants were planted at 10 plants per mat or 50 plant coverage to prevent crowding as the plants grew over the 20 week experiment 2 2 simulation of runoff containing nutrients mesocosms were filled with municipal water to which water soluble fertilizer was added to simulate concentrations similar to either nursery irrigation runoff or stormwater runoff average total nitrogen tn levels were 14 6 5 2 mg l 1 n high or 4 88 1 75 mg l 1 n low and total phosphorus tp levels were 2 3 0 68 mg l 1 p high and 0 82 0 44 mg l 1 p low table 2 the 15 mg l 1 n solution was comparable to nursery irrigation runoff while the 5 mg l 1 n solution was comparable to stormwater runoff from an urban area leisenring et al 2010 white 2013 the simulated runoff was prepared by dissolving water soluble fertilizer 343 g 5500 l 1 for the high treatment and 115 g 5500 l 1 for the low treatment of 24n 8p 16k nitrate special soluble fertilizer southern agricultural insecticides inc hendersonville nc in water within the stock tanks weekly following preparation stock tanks were continuously mixed using the inline pump for 2 h prior to filling the mesocosms sixteen mesocosms were filled from the high n stock tank and 16 mesocosms were filled from the low n stock tank using the pump and pvc distribution system mesocosms were filled on day 0 from the stock tanks and then drained on day 7 to simulate a seven day hydraulic retention time hrt throughout the 20 week experiment duration for a total of 20 fills 2 3 water sampling and analysis for each experimental mesocosm n 32 water samples were collected at day 7 for all 20 weeks all samples were taken at a 15 cm depth in the morning between 7 00 and 9 00 a m every other week samples were also collected on day 3 and day 5 beginning at week 1 to better understand the short term dynamics of the system water samples were also collected weekly from the stock tanks prior to filling the mesocosms to establish a baseline of the average concentration of nutrients in the two simulated runoff treatments table 2

handheld multi meter with individual sensors for each parameter ysi yellow springs oh the sensors on the hand held multi meter were allowed to stabilize prior to recording measurements 2 4 plant sampling and analysis the roots below mat biomass and shoots above mat biomass of six representative plants per species juncus effusus and pontederia cordata were harvested at day 0 of the experiment to establish baseline allocation and concentration of nutrients within the plant tissues plant size measurements were performed every 14 days on the same three plants per species per experimental mesocosm over the sampling period those plants were then harvested at the end of the 20 week period for final tissue concentrations to determine plant nutrient accumulation and allocation over time four separate mesocosms two per species were treated as harvest mesocosms and were used to harvest plants overtime during the experiment so as not to confound results from the experimental mesocosms one mesocosm per plant species was exposed to the high nutrient treatment and the other to the low nutrient treatment the four 378 5 l structural foam mesocosms identical in size to the 32 experimental mesocosms were drained and filled in the same manner as the experimental units every four weeks beginning at week 4 two plants from each harvest mesocosm were harvested at random to quantify changes in nutrient composition and biomass over time for a total of five harvests plant size measurement shoot height cm longest root length cm and plant width cm in two directions cm widest and narrowest point were taken on the two harvest plants at each harvest interval these measurements were then compared to the same measurements collected on plants within the experimental mesocosms

mg l and k is the rate constant mg l day 1 estimates of k provide an indication of the rate constant at which nutrient uptake occurred several steps were needed to quantify the effects of time and treatment nutrient concentration and plant species on nutrient removal efficacy and rate plant nutrient uptake efficiency and nutrient allocation within plant tissues the first step determined if the weekly changes were best represented by an overall change from day 0 to day 7 endpoints day 7 only weekly slope rate of change etc in the second step we developed a model relating the weekly change to the overall effects of time and treatment analysis of variance anova was used to test the time and treatment effects of the model in the third step we developed a model determining the rate of change rate constant by treatment within each week and then anova was used to test the effect of treatment in the models for each week when treatment and week or their interaction were found to have a significant effect the fisher s least significant difference test was used to further study the nature of these effects for monthly effects the monthly plant tissue concentration was plotted to determine visually when peak uptake occurs an anova was used to test the effect of treatment on the monthly plant nutrient concentration finally in step four we calculated nutrient budgets to quantify the overall change and efficacy of each treatment all statistical calculations were conducted using jmp v13 sas institute inc cary nc and p values 0 05 were considered evidence of statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient removal over time plant nutrient uptake facilitated by the presence of plants and ftws was evaluated over both the short term 7 days and long term 20 weeks when assessing changes in concentration on a weekly basis after each seven day exposure to p cordata or j effusus with high and low tn fig 2 and tp fig 3 loads results were clustered by plant species and separated by influent nutrient concentrations data are presented as loading rates to account for mass of nutrients per unit surface area of the water covered by ftws g m 2 initial nutrient loads were variable by week as adjustments to stock tanks resulted in fluctuations during the first six weeks of the experiment p cordata consistently removed tn and tp between days 0 3 5 and 7 beginning in week 7 nutrient removal by j effusus was inconsistent throughout the experiment with fluctuations in tn and tp concentrations during days 3 and 5 figs 2 and 3 in most cases the nutrient load on day 7 was lower than the load on day 0 indicating net removal instances occurred in the beginning of the study in which nutrient load at day 7 was higher than at day 0 indicating release of n and p this occurred in week 5 for both species tn and tp and week 3 for j effusus tn during weeks 4 and 9 the tn load measured at day 7 was lower than on day 0 for both plant species however the load of tp increased over the course of the week for j effusus while decreasing in the presence of p cordata figs 2 and 3 this initial period of fluctuation week 1 6 could indicate transplant shock root and shoot dieback and adaptation to a new environment followed by increased growth beginning in week 7 fig 4 these findings align with previous research with wetland plants where once plants were established n removal stabilized heffernan and fisher 2012 spangler et al 2019 see fig 2 pontederia cordata reduced the load of tn in the hyp from 4 5 1 2 g m 2 tn to 1 6 0 92 g m 2 similar to the final tn load of the low solution 1 8 0 51 g m 2 p 0 0001 fig 2 this may indicate that p cordata has a lower limit of remediation in these conditions of approximately 0 86 g m 2 tn further in situations where initial nutrient loads fall within the low nutrient range p cordata may not be the most suitable plant selection for use in ftws research from other studies indicate plants such as canna bengal tiger and peltandra virginica can perform well when exposed to low nutrient conditions polomski et al 2007 within the hyp treatment the load of tp remaining in solution at day 7 were more variable than for tn 0 02 g m 2 tp to 0 92 g m 2 tp for many weeks tp removal in hyp was at or below the day 0 load of the lyp treatment at day 7 fig 3 this continued tp removal was not seen within the lyj treatment juncus effusus is a comparatively slower growing plant with low minimum nutrient requirements mccorry and renou 2003 as evidenced by the similar amount of nutrients removed in both the high and low nutrient treatments an average of 0 58 0 35 g m 2 for hyj and 0 54 0 26 g m 2 for lyj p 0 05 these changes can be further assessed by observing the rate constant in tn and tp over the course of the seven days figs 5 and 6 while j effusus had a consistent low weekly rate of change rate constant mg m 2 day 1 over the duration of the experiment the rate for p cordata increased over time peaking around week 14 for high concentrations of tn and tp p 0 001 and week 12 for low concentrations of tn and tp p 0 005 the initial concentration of nutrients in simulated runoff did not influence the nutrient removal rate of hyj or lyj p 0 238 for tn and p 0 623 for tp initial concentration was important for p cordata p 0 005 for tn and tp with the hyp treatment facilitating faster removal rates than the lyp treatment figs 5 and 6 these differences are most likely attributable to differences in the growth characteristics of j effusus and p cordata and are consistent with other published findings gettys and dumroese 2009 godfrey and wooten 1979 both species are herbaceous perennials however in usda hardiness zone 8a juncus effusus is also evergreen this means there is potential for year round accumulation of nutrients within plant tissues whereas pontederia cordata vegetation grew rapidly until it flowered during august and september thereafter the vegetative growth of pontederia cordata slowed and nutrient uptake declined as the plant entered dormancy and tissues began to senesce in late october to mid november fig 4 the species of plant established within the ftw greatly influenced removal of both tn and tp compared with j effusus p cordata consistently reduced the effluent nutrient concentration by 37 tn and 42 tp in high treatments and by 34 tn and 22 tp in low concentrations p 0 0001 table 3 3 2 plant nutrient accumulation and partitioning an important component when assessing the rate of removal of p and n in ftws is the mass of nutrients accumulated within the plants in comparison to other removal processes table 3 nitrogen accumulation within p cordata 35 4 g m 2 high and 10 5 g m 2 low was higher than j effusus 4 89 g m 2 high and 2 89 g m 2 low p 0 0001 for both high and low treatments phosphorus assimilation trends were similar for high and low nutrient treatments with p cordata accumulating 4 36 g m 2 and 1 25 g m 2 respectively compared to j effusus accumulating 0 53 g m 2 g and 0 27 g m 2 respectively p 0 0001 for both high and low treatments table 3 the n accumulation values correlate with plant growth and plant mass data at harvest p 0 0001 fig 7 data show that on a per m2 basis p cordata was able to remove 3 6 to 7 2 times more n and between 4 6 and 8 2 time more p than j effusus depending on treatment peak uptake of both n and p was in september for both p cordata and j effusus in the high nutrient treatments uptake of n and p p 0 0001 for p cordata p 0 002 for juncus was similarly consistent in low nutrient treatments peaking in september for all except the lyp treatment which demonstrated continued accumulation of p in root and shoot tissues fig 7 the peak in nutrient accumulation may be an indicator of ideal harvest time to prevent the majority of nutrient release back into the water as plant tissues senesce temperature did not influence accumulation patterns p 0 324 during the experiment however multiple iterations of the experiment performed over different years and locations would help to better understand if time to peak accumulation is temperature related or seasonally driven for example had the experiment been initiated one month earlier would peak removal shift back a month to august or if september were hotter than the 2015 average of 24 8 c would this delay time to peak also physiological senescence initiation and morphological flowering changes within plants in ftws may be more pertinent drivers of peak accumulation than time planted or temperature keizer vlek et al 2014 kyambadde et al 2004 zhu et al 2011 mamolos et al 2011 found that wetland species typically have a delayed peak in biomass production and accumulation in comparison to upland species due to a longer growing period furthermore mamolos et al 2011 determined a delay in peak of biomass by one month from peak of nutrient accumulation in this study biomass decreased the month accumulation peak but could be attributed to senescence from cooler weather and preparation for dormancy fig 4 determining the pattern of nutrient partitioning within plants is important for understanding which portion of the plant to harvest to remove the largest mass of nutrients edwards et al 2006 karathanasis et al 2003 zhu et al 2011 initial n and p allocations for j effusus were concentrated in the shoot with 66 9 of n and 64 6 of p for both high and low nutrient concentrations fig s1 during the growing season the majority of n allocation was in the j effusus shoots with an average root shoot ratio of 0 31 0 69 for hyj and 0 33 0 67 for lyj phosphorus partitioning trends were similar to n for j effusus p 0 05 with root shoot allocations of 0 29 0 71 for hyj and 0 32 0 68 for lyj while n ratios were similar for p cordata and j effusus p ratios differed p 0 034 with a greater allocation of p within shoot tissues for p cordata while p cordata initially in may at transplant had more n and p within root tissues than shoot tissues 0 66 0 34 n and 0 51 0 49 p by june n and p partitioning had shifted and n and p were predominantly stored in shoot tissues 0 16 0 84 n and 0 08 0 92 p nitrogen and p partitioning mainly within shoot tissues persisted for the remainder of the growing season with some variability between months p 0 004 fig s1 the changes in nutrient allocation were correlated with biomass production r 0 83 fig 4 a both pontederia cordata and juncus effusus had a greater increase in shoot biomass throughout the growing season than root biomass p 0 0032 pontederia and p 0 029 juncus therefore a greater proportion of nutrients were accumulated in the actively growing tissues the shoots diminution of nutrients within tissues following peak uptake in september were most likely regulated by metabolic processes in the shoots nutrient concentration did not contribute to changes in nutrient storage location low vs high nutrient treatments and partitioning differences in roots and shoots the nutrient levels in this experiment may have been higher than those previously shown to affect partitioning and biomass distribution wang et al 2015 despite relatively lower mass of nutrients fixed within root tissues root tissues still contribute considerable nutrient removal thus our recommendation concurs with that of pavlineri et al 2017 according to which the whole plant should be harvested to prevent release of nutrients back into the water column maintenance costs and feasibility of harvest for nutrient removal are debated based on whether ftws are actively or passively managed if the ultimate purpose of a ftw installation is nutrient management then active management including harvest is needed to remove plant absorbed nutrients and better prevent and short circuit internal nutrient cycles in natural waters if ftws are installed as a best management practices for mitigation of nutrients in watersheds as part of basin wide nutrient management plans then harvest of the whole plant is critical as nutrient credits are based on total biomass removed and tissue concentrations additional research in different geographic locations and expanding start of the experiment and harvest through additional months would enhance understanding of the effect of seasonality and plant growth decay on nutrient partitioning 3 3 role of the ftw mat in remediation of n and p previously some studies have assessed how the ftw mat used influences the remediation capacity of ftws hu et al 2010 wang and sample 2014 zhao et al 2013 results from the these studies conflicted with each other hu et al 2010 found no difference with or without the ftw mat in an ecological sludge floating bed artificial eco system wang and sample 2014 determined their mat a 20 cm thick blended fiber matrix facilitated removal of a similar mass of nutrients as those treatments established with both plants and the mat indicating a substantial role of microorganisms zhao et al 2013 reported that once established the mat plastic trays with 12 holes filled with mixed media in rhizo bags performed better than the control no ftw mat but worse than a planted mat results from this study add another scenario as the control no mat outperformed the mat only treatment in removal of both tn and tp at both nutrient levels table 4 furthermore the control facilitated removal of a greater mass of both n and p in comparison to hyj treatments p 0 05 and n compared to lyj p 0 05 however mats planted with pontederia cordata outperformed the control for both n and p removal p 0 05 57 5 g m 2 n and 48 8 g m 2 p compared to 28 7 g m 2 n and 9 00 g m 2 p for high fertilizer table 3 no measurements were collected quantifying the mass of algae and chlorophyll a present in the system which would have been beneficial however based on observations larger amounts of algae grew in the mesocosms with no mat in comparison to those with a mat this could be one explanation for the higher remediation levels achieved by the no mat control algal communities in the no mat control may have contributed to some removal of nutrients while mesocosms covered with a mat were shaded leaving the system with little surface area open to the sunlight needed by the algal communities for energy production and growth dissolved oxygen concentration plays an important role in nitrification and denitrification of a system as nitrification is an aerobic process do 2 0 mg l while denitrification is an anaerobic process do 1 0 mg l debusk 1999 tallec et al 2008 dissolved oxygen levels in the water column of mesocosms with mats were lower than those without mats p 0 05 fig s2 furthermore mats planted with p cordata and j effusus further reduced the do levels within the water column of the mesocosms from those without mats p 0 05 the change in do likely impacted n removal processes however the system never reached anaerobic levels do 1 mg l fig s2 it is possible that were algal growth controlled results would be similar to hu et al 2010 or zhao et al 2013 however neither hu et al or zhao et al discussed the role presence of algae within their systems based upon our findings the plant species used within ftws in combination with a mat is highly important to facilitate removal of nutrients however the mat itself is not the major contributor to nutrient removal 4 conclusions p cordata proved more efficient than j effusus at accumulation of both n and p p cordata facilitated the highest rates of n 0 31 mg l day 1 and p 0 34 mg l day 1 removal from water nutrient removal rates facilitated by j effusus in the high nutrient treatment were much lower for both n 0 03 mg l day 1 and p 0 02 mg l day 1 compared with p cordata peak n and p accumulation in j effusus occurred in september within both root 50 g n and 4 8 g p and shoot tissues 98 g n and 12 5 g p the uptake of n and p in p cordata was highest in root tissues in august 307 g n and 30 5 g p and in shoot tissues in september 1490 g n and 219 5 g p in both species shoots accumulated more n and p than the roots resulting in a small root shoot ratio at all stages of the experiment the presence of the mat only within a water body i e shade only impact did not enhance nutrient remediation within the system as little to no n or p removal

18774,a compilation and analysis of experimentally determined microbial growth yields for syntrophic volatile fatty acid vfa lactate oxidisers and methanogens in anaerobic digestion ad systems is presented only studies based on experimental determinations or sound model to data fitting that specifically address parameter identifiability have been considered the experimentally determined values are compared and discussed with estimations based on bioenergetic correlations only for acetoclastic methanogens the experimentally determined microbial yields appear in good consistency with bioenergetic estimations for syntrophic microbial groups the experimetal yield values reported appear much higher than those expected from the low amount of metabolic energy available these large deviations imply either inaccuracy on the microbial biomass quantification methods or that the syntrophic interspecies electron transfer occurs under mechanisms or hydrogen equivalent intermediate activities much below those ever observed in methanogenic environments in addition the microbial growth yield values most widely adopted in ad model applications those reported in the iwa anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 are even higher than the experimental determinations from literature it is therefore proposed that microbial growth yield values should be restricted by the maximum harvestable atp calculated through a detailed bioenergetic pathway analysis model simulations with different parameter configurations for different yield sources default adm1 experimentally determined and bioenergetically estimated values displayed low sensitivity of the simulations with respect to the yield values as long as the maximum specific microbial growth rate μmax remain the same this suggests that model calibrations could target the accuracy of μmax maintaining the bioenergetic upper limit for microbial growth yields keywords microbial growth yield bioenergetics syntrophy modelling anaerobic digestion 1 introduction microbial growth yields represent the amount of biomass growth of a microbial functional group microorganisms from one or more species that share catabolic function consuming the same substrate per amount of substrate consumed generally microbial growth yields have been quantified for microorganisms grown either in well isolated pure cultures single species or well defined cocultures at least two different microbial species the number of microbial species for which growth yields have been accurately determined is however scarce since only a small fraction of the existing microbial species has been isolated for pure culture growth stewart 2012 furthermore in nature microorganisms live in the so called microbial communities widder et al 2016 the separate quantification of biomass growth for each individual group within a microbial community presents important experimental challenges only few attempts have addressed the absolute quantification of individual biomass concentrations in microbial communities junicke et al 2014 life under syntrophy is an example of the advantage of membership to a microbial community under syntrophy a microbial group utilises the product s of a partner microbial group thereby increasing the energy available or even enabling thermodynamically its growth while in turn it benefits from the available substrate provided by its partner schink 1997 this close relationship makes it even more complex to meaningfully quantify the biomass growth of the two microbial groups separately due to the intermediate nature of their exchanged product substrate the nature of this intermediate being either hydrogen and or formate has been discussed stams and plugge 2009 schink et al 2017 evidence of syntrophic partners transferring electrons through conductive pili structures nanowires has also been reported shrestha and rotaru 2014 despite the intrinsic complexity of individual growth yields quantification in microbial communities numerous studies have compiled microbial growth yields in anaerobic environments henze and harremoës 1983 pavlostathis giraldo gomez 1991 elferink et al 1994 batstone et al 2002 roden and jin 2011 several of these studies correspond to direct experimental determinations of yields in microbial cultures typically in pure culture or well defined co culture the reported experimentally determined microbial growth yields can refer to the apparent or to the so called maximum growth yields differing only on the substrate consumption required for cell maintenance and other functions different than cell synthesis pirt 1965 methods employed for microbial growth yield quantification are diverse including i total suspended solids tss quantification as a proxy for microbial biomass changes huser et al 1982 ii dna rna quantification ahn et al 2008 iii optical density measurements at a specific calibrated wavelength sowers et al 1984 sass et al 2004 iv microbial growth yield correlation to protein synthesis quantification patel 1984 beaty and mcinerney 1989 or v direct cell count traore et al 1983 scholten and conrad 2000 each of the above methods presents its drawbacks with some being very time intensive and error prone when dealing with more than one microbial species cell count wagner et al 2003 while others rely on conversion factors that can lead to erroneous results protein or dna rna quantification overall the separate identification of biomass yields for each microbial functional group has been and remains troublesome most of the microbial yield values reported in literature are result of calibrations of biokinetic models to fit dynamic experimental data for which adequate model parameter identification is an aspect not always properly addressed rodríguez et al 2009b the proper identification of microbial yields through model fitting is somehow problematic according to the herbert pirt model the maximum growth rate is described as per equation 1 1 μ max q max m s y x s max in which μmax is the product of a maximum specific substrate uptake rate qmax and the maximum microbial growth yield yxs max and ms is the substrate uptake for maintenance the μmax values for each microbial functional group correspond to a representative μmax of different microbial species that perform the same catabolic activity suitable experimental data are required for the separate identification of qmax and yxs max values without falling into overfitting i e the same μmax can be described for a microbial group by multiple equivalent combinations of qmax and yxs max values the estimation of microbial growth yields for biokinetic models requires of experimental methodologies capable of consistently quantifying biomass groups separately junicke et al 2016 modelling practice for dynamic ad processes in recent years has been dominated by the iwa anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 batstone et al 2002 by far the most widely applied and studied model in anaerobic digestion the adm1 when originally published provided a series of reference default values for all its biokinetic parameters including microbial growth yields a practice followed by previous ad models and by the adm1 is that all the parameters are assumed constant microbial growth yields however are known to depend on the catabolic energy available for the microorganisms to grow in energy scarce environments such as anaerobic reactors catabolic energy available may change significantly due to product accumulation e g hydrogen concentration this effect has been successfully modelled by introducing hydrogen inhibition kinetic terms for vfa oxidisers batstone et al 2002 this has led to an almost equivalent decrease in microbial growth rate as if it was modelled as a decrease in microbial growth yields instead other more complex approaches have introduced variable stoichiometries to dynamically describe changes in microbial growth yields penumathsa et al 2008 the common practice in most ad modelling applications in recent years has been that of adopting and maintaining constant the default microbial growth yield values from the adm1 batstone et al 2002 while focusing the calibration efforts on the kinetic parameters qmax half saturation and or inhibition coefficients blumensaat and keller 2005 boubaker and cheikh 2009 silva et al 2009 hinken et al 2014 razaviarani and buchanan 2015 this practice is thought to have recurrently led to reported parameter values of questionable mechanistic significance result of model overfitting rodríguez et al 2006b bioenergetics correlations can estimate microbial growth yields through the thermodynamic calculation of the energy available to a microbial group given a catabolic function and the carbon source von stockar et al 2008 examples of those correlations include a gibbs energy dissipation method heijnen and van dijken 1992 a method based on gibbs efficiency roels 1983 the so called thermodynamic electron equivalent method teem rittmann and mccarty 2001 mccarty 2007 mccarty and bae 2011 and a correlation method based on atp consumed per unit of biomass grown bauchop and elsden 1960 all these approaches are based on the principle that the metabolic gibbs energy available affects the microbial growth yield reactions with low available energy must lead to low microbial growth yields and vice versa in this work a compilation of experimentally determined microbial growth yield values for syntrophs and methanogens in anaerobic systems is presented and compared with bioenergetic estimations additionally those yields are compared with the ones used in ad modelling applications also a set of dynamic model simulations were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of ad models to different microbial yields to provide recommendations for yield estimation strategies 2 compilation and bioenergetic estimation of microbial growth yields among the literature sources revised that report microbial growth yields in anaerobic reactors only the studies reporting yield values from direct experimental determination or via sound model based parameter identification were selected a growth yield reported from a literature source was considered if the reactor was fed with a single carbon source as a substrate and no electron acceptor was present e g reactors where sulfate was the electron acceptor to measure microbial growth were discarded a single pure culture or well defined co culture were grown in a reactor sufficient data was measured to identify each microbial group if more than two microbial functional groups were grown the yield values compiled are presented in fig 1 in cod units of microbial biomass grown per unit of electron donor substrate used gcodx gcods and refer to the catabolic reactions as defined in table 1 relevant information regarding the experimental conditions for each literature source are summarised in table 2 for additional information on the yield values presented and more details on the experimental conditions please refer to supplementary material bioenergetic growth yield estimations using the energy dissipation method heijnen and van dijken 1992 were computed for the same concentration values of substrates and products as reported in each experimental source including the ph and its effect on substrate concentrations catabolism and anabolism are linked as per equation 2 2 λ c a t δ g c a t λ a n a δ g d i s s δ g a n a 0 where λcat is the number of times the catabolism needs to run to build 1 mol of biomass λana 1 under the gibbs energy dissipation method heijnen and van dijken 1992 the main source of dissipation of energy is assumed to be in the anabolism due to the large amount of reactions required in the synthesis of the cell i e dna repair protein formation membrane formation etc which are much larger than in the catabolism the deprotonated form was selected as it is the variable most present at typical ad ph values 7 butyric propionic and acetic acid have very similar pka values therefore different phs values may be impactful on the bioenergetic estimations of yields for butyrate oxidation protons produced and for acetoclastic methanogenesis protons consumed for those cases in which the experimental conditions were not fully defined the uncertain components were evaluated within a range concentration 50 higher and lower from its most likely value to see the concentration values adopted refer to supplementary material this leads to the intervals of microbial yields shown as error bars in fig 1 the relative differences between the bioenergetically estimated and the experimentally determined microbial growth yields are also indicated in fig 1 all bioenergetically estimated microbial growth yields were calculated based on the assumption that all the energy produced in the catabolism was used in the anabolism and for maintenance purposes no secondary metabolites were assumed to be produced that would decrease the observed microbial growth yields neither they are considered in most ad models to date additionally the reference yield values recommended by the iwa adm1 model batstone et al 2002 the most widely used biokinetic model in anaerobic digestion are also presented and compared with bioenergetic estimations to compute the bioenergetically estimated growth yields for adm1 the benchmark simulation model no 2 bsm2 concentrations were used rosen and jeppsson 2006 the bsm2 consists of a simulation with adm1 of a typical anaerobic digester in steady state treating municipal wastewater in fig 1 a comparison between the experimentally determined and the bioenergetically estimated via gibbs energy dissipation method microbial growth yield values for vfa butyrate and propionate lactate oxidisers and methanogens acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic are presented 3 impact of microbial growth yields on dynamic ad simulations to evaluate the impact and sensitivity of ad dynamic simulations to different microbial yield values a set of dynamic simulations were conducted the model selected given its widespread application was the iwa adm1 model batstone et al 2002 and simulations were solved using an excel matlab implementation rodríguez et al 2009a in molar units a highly dynamic ad experimental case study scenario was simulated the experimental data as described by ruiz et al 2004 correspond to a 2 l reactor that treated wastewater from a distillery zaher et al 2004 in order to evaluate the impact of microbial growth yields in isolation from that of the kinetic parameters the latter were adjusted such that the maximum specific growth rates for each microbial functional group defined in adm1 remain unchanged therefore qmax values for each microbial functional group were adjusted to the yields as described in equation 3 3 q max n e w μ max a d m 1 y x s max where for each microbial functional group μmax is the maximum growth rate recommended by adm1 in h 1 yxs max is the microbial growth yield value under evaluation in mol cx mol s and qmax is the maximum specific substrate uptake rate in mol s mol cx h three different sets of microbial growth yields and qmax were evaluated namely i the original yield values recommended as default in adm1 ii averaged yield values as determined from the experimental sources and iii bioenergetically estimated yield values using the gibbs energy dissipation method heijnen and van dijken 1992 the specific parameter values used are shown in table 3 the dynamic simulation results for ph butyrate propionate and acetate concentration for the three parameter configurations are presented in fig 2 against the experimental data only minor to negligible differences are appreciated between simulations suggesting that the effect of microbial growth yields is tightly correlated with that of the maximum specific growth rates the nomenclature used in table 3 corresponds to the equivalent presented in adm1 su sugars aa amino acids fa long chain fatty acids va valerate bu butyrate pro propionate ac acetate h2 hydrogen the biomass composition assumed for model simulations was ch1 4o0 5n0 2 the one described in the adm1 technical report batstone et al 2002 4 discussion 4 1 comparison between microbial growth yield determination approaches microbial growth yields estimated through the gibbs energy dissipation method heijnen and van dijken 1992 have been regarded as reasonably accurate for aerobic growth however this has not been confirmed to be the case for anaerobic environments liu et al 2007 the bioenergetically estimated growth yield values for acetoclastic methanogens fig 1d display a good correspondence with their experimentally determined values this suggests that the gibbs energy dissipation method is adequate for this microbial group for butyrate and propionate oxidation however the bioenergetic yield estimations are significantly lower than their experimentally determined values fig 1a and b lactate oxidisers fig 1c follow a similar pattern those low yield values are expected due to the very small metabolic energy available in vfa oxidation although the experimentally determined yield values for vfa oxidisers correspond to cultures in syntrophy with hydrogenotrophs at already low hydrogen concentrations the amount of metabolic energy available is still not sufficient for the high yield values reported this discrepancy and thermodynamic inconsistency suggest either experimental inaccuracies with the biomass quantification and or data interpretation methods or an alternative mechanism for syntrophic electron transfer the syntrophic interspecies hydrogen or electron transfer could take place at hydrogen equivalent activities much smaller than those corresponding to the hydrogen concentrations measured in methanogenic systems examples of these hydrogen equivalent activities could include the recently reported electron transfer through nanowires shrestha and rotaru 2014 or another unknown mechanism hydrogenotrophic methanogens growth yields unlike the case for vfa oxidisers do not display a clear specific pattern of over or underestimation fig 1e the experimental sources presented correspond to pure non syntrophic cultures with environments of 80 20 of h2 co2 and some of them at rather high temperatures if the syntrophic hydrogen transfer between microbial groups would occur at a lower equivalent activity than the one corresponding to the measured bulk media concentrations the experimental yields for the syntrophic methanogen partner should appear significantly lower than the value bioenergetically estimated at those concentrations the oxidiser obtaining additional energy at the expense of the methanogen overall there are limited data available of experimentally determined microbial growth yields especially for microbial groups that live under syntrophic associations methods such as optical density combined with flow cytometry in well defined syntrophic co cultures could be used to quantify growth yields separately alternative approaches could include fluorescent labelling of microorganisms well defined co cultures via techniques such as fish fluorescence in situ hybridisation 4 2 impact of microbial growth yields on dynamic ad model simulations as seen also in fig 1 the default microbial growth yield values recommended for adm1 applications are even higher than the experimentally determined ones reported in literature this observation of microbial growth yield overestimation in adm1 was also reported bonk et al 2018a 2018b this yield overestimation appears to have originated from legacy literature sources that may have relied on data fitting to older models at the time for which proper parameter identification may have been not fully addressed or available these yield overestimations have however not posed a major drawback to the wide application of models such as the adm1 to methanogenic reactors this is due to the very low sensitivity of model simulations to the use of different pairs of yxs qmax with resulting constant μmax at the reference value rodríguez et al 2006b the model simulations shown in fig 2 for the three parameter configurations under constant μmax table 3 illustrate this low sensitivity to yield values for microbial syntrophic groups with the reactions in table 1 neither the high experimentally determined yield values nor the even higher reference yield values from adm1 are recommended as they both appear thermodynamically inconsistent with the amount of metabolic energy available bioenergetic yield estimations such as the gibbs energy dissipation method ensure thermodynamic consistency but its accuracy for anaerobic systems has not been sufficiently demonstrated liu et al 2007 more accurate microbial growth yield values would lead to simulations with a more accurate biomass composition this in turn will represent more accurately the specific catalitic capacities present in the reactors at a given time especifically relevant during overload periods additionally accurate biomass yield parameters are of importance for other biokinetic models including those describing non methanogenic anaerobic fermentations e g biohydrogen production estimations of maximum microbial growth yields should be restricted to the maximum harvestable energy in the catabolic pathway of any given microbial group in terms of atp equivalents and never to exceed the theoretical available energy this makes a detailed bioenergetic pathway analysis focused on net atp generation either via substrate level phosphorylation or via proton translocation rodríguez et al 2006a gonzález cabaleiro et al 2013 as the recommended option to establish upper limits for maximum microbial growth yields as an example for a yx atp of 0 442 molcx molatp the use of the adm1 reference yield value for butyrate oxidisers of yxbu 0 3 molcx molbu would require for the microorganism to harvest around 0 675 molatp molbu this is an impossibly high value due to the low energy available from butyrate oxidation even under methanogenic conditions their maximum growth yield should therefore have a theoretical upper limit under a given environment in a typical anaerobic digestion scenario rosen and jeppsson 2006 the metabolic energy available for butyrate oxidisers is of approximately 15 kj molbu assuming a minimum energy quantum of 1 3 of atp per proton translocated for a δgatp of 44 kj mol in physiological conditions and ph 7 thauer et al 1977 the δg of a minimum quantum is 14 6 kj mol therefore under these conditions the yield may reach 0 333 molatp molbu at the most corresponding to an yxbu 0 147 molcx molbu around half the adm1 reference yield value dynamic model calibrations could be aimed at improving the accuracy of μmax values of high impact on model simulations complemented with the upper limit yield estimations based on bioenergetic pathway analysis 5 conclusions the compilation and thermodynamic evaluation of microbial growth yields conducted for syntrophic and methanogenic microbial groups in anaerobic digestion led to the following conclusions the experimentally determined microbial growth yield values reported in literature appear too high for the metabolic energy available for syntrophic vfa oxidisers only for acetoclastic methanogens the bioenergetic estimation of microbial growth yields via the gibbs energy dissipation method appeared consistent with experimental observations a detailed biochemical pathway analysis of each microbial conversion appears as recommended for the estimation of upper limits for microbial growth yields this is mainly due to the difficulty of obtaining meaningful and reliable experimentally determined yield values together with the known limitations of black box bioenergetic correlation methods dynamic ad biokinetic models such as the adm1 display low sensitivity to microbial growth yield values for a constant μmax this implies that model calibrations could target the accuracy of μmax maintaining the bioenergetic

dynamic simulation results for ph butyrate propionate and acetate concentration for the three parameter configurations are presented in fig 2 against the experimental data only minor to negligible differences are appreciated between simulations suggesting that the effect of microbial growth yields is tightly correlated with that of the maximum specific growth rates the nomenclature used in

for model simulations was ch1 4o0 5n0 2 the one described in the adm1 technical report batstone et al 2002 4 discussion 4 1 comparison between microbial growth yield determination approaches microbial growth yields estimated through the gibbs energy dissipation method heijnen and van dijken 1992 have been regarded as reasonably accurate for aerobic growth however this has not been confirmed to be the case for anaerobic environments liu et al 2007 the bioenergetically estimated growth yield values for acetoclastic methanogens fig 1d display a good correspondence with their experimentally determined values this suggests that the gibbs energy dissipation method is adequate for this microbial group for butyrate and propionate oxidation however the bioenergetic yield estimations are significantly lower than their experimentally determined values fig 1a and b lactate oxidisers fig 1c follow a similar pattern those low yield values are expected due to the very small metabolic energy available in vfa oxidation although the experimentally determined yield values for vfa oxidisers correspond to cultures in syntrophy with hydrogenotrophs at already low hydrogen concentrations the amount of metabolic energy available is still not sufficient for the high yield values reported this discrepancy and thermodynamic inconsistency suggest either experimental inaccuracies with the biomass quantification and or data interpretation methods or an alternative mechanism for syntrophic electron transfer the syntrophic interspecies hydrogen or electron transfer could take place at hydrogen equivalent activities much smaller than those corresponding to the hydrogen concentrations measured in methanogenic systems examples of these hydrogen equivalent activities could include the recently reported electron transfer through nanowires shrestha and rotaru 2014 or another unknown mechanism hydrogenotrophic methanogens growth yields unlike the case for vfa oxidisers do not display a clear specific pattern of over or underestimation fig 1e the experimental sources presented correspond to pure non syntrophic cultures with environments of 80 20 of h2 co2 and some of them at rather high temperatures if the syntrophic hydrogen transfer between microbial groups would occur at a lower equivalent activity than the one corresponding to the measured bulk media concentrations the experimental yields for the syntrophic methanogen partner should appear significantly lower than the value bioenergetically estimated at those concentrations the oxidiser obtaining additional energy at the expense of the methanogen overall there are limited data available of experimentally determined microbial growth yields especially for microbial groups that live under syntrophic associations methods such as optical density combined with flow cytometry in well defined syntrophic co cultures could be used to quantify growth yields separately alternative approaches could include fluorescent labelling of microorganisms well defined co cultures via techniques such as fish fluorescence in situ hybridisation 4 2 impact of microbial growth yields on dynamic ad model simulations as seen also in fig 1 the default microbial growth yield values recommended for adm1 applications are even higher than the experimentally determined ones reported in literature this observation of microbial growth yield overestimation in adm1 was also reported bonk et al 2018a 2018b this yield overestimation appears to have originated from legacy literature sources that may have relied on data fitting to older models at the time for which proper parameter identification may have been not fully addressed or available these yield overestimations have however not posed a major drawback to the wide application of models such as the adm1 to methanogenic reactors this is due to the very low sensitivity of model simulations to the use of different pairs of yxs qmax with resulting constant μmax at the reference value rodríguez et al 2006b the model simulations shown in fig 2 for the three parameter configurations under constant μmax table 3 illustrate this low sensitivity to yield values for microbial syntrophic groups with the reactions in table 1 neither the high experimentally determined yield values nor the even higher reference yield values from adm1 are recommended as they both appear thermodynamically inconsistent with the amount of metabolic energy available bioenergetic yield estimations such as the gibbs energy dissipation method ensure thermodynamic consistency but its accuracy for anaerobic systems has not been sufficiently demonstrated liu et al 2007 more accurate microbial growth yield values would lead to simulations with a more accurate biomass composition this in turn will represent more accurately the specific catalitic capacities present in the reactors at a given time especifically relevant during overload periods additionally accurate biomass yield parameters are of importance for other biokinetic models including those describing non methanogenic anaerobic fermentations e g biohydrogen production estimations of maximum microbial growth yields should be restricted to the maximum harvestable energy in the catabolic pathway of any given microbial group in terms of atp equivalents and never to exceed the theoretical available energy this makes a detailed bioenergetic pathway analysis focused on net atp generation either via substrate level phosphorylation or via proton translocation rodríguez et al 2006a gonzález cabaleiro et al 2013 as the recommended option to establish upper limits for maximum microbial growth yields as an example for a yx atp of 0 442 molcx molatp the use of the adm1 reference yield value for butyrate oxidisers of yxbu 0 3 molcx molbu would require for the microorganism to harvest around 0 675 molatp molbu this is an impossibly high value due to the low energy available from butyrate oxidation even under methanogenic conditions their maximum growth yield should therefore have a theoretical upper limit under a given environment in a typical anaerobic digestion scenario rosen and jeppsson 2006 the metabolic energy available for butyrate oxidisers is of approximately 15 kj molbu assuming a minimum energy quantum of 1 3 of atp per proton translocated for a δgatp of 44 kj mol in physiological conditions and ph 7 thauer et al 1977 the δg of a minimum quantum is 14 6 kj mol therefore under these conditions the yield may reach 0 333 molatp molbu at the most corresponding to an yxbu 0 147 molcx molbu around half the adm1 reference yield value dynamic model calibrations could be aimed at improving the accuracy of μmax values of high impact on model simulations complemented with the upper limit yield estimations based on bioenergetic pathway analysis 5 conclusions the compilation and thermodynamic evaluation of microbial growth yields conducted for syntrophic and methanogenic microbial groups in anaerobic digestion led to the following conclusions the experimentally determined microbial growth yield values reported in literature appear too high for the metabolic energy available for syntrophic vfa oxidisers only for acetoclastic methanogens the bioenergetic estimation of microbial growth yields via the gibbs energy dissipation method appeared consistent with experimental observations a detailed biochemical pathway analysis of each microbial conversion appears as recommended for the estimation of upper limits for microbial growth yields this is mainly due to the difficulty of obtaining meaningful and reliable experimentally determined yield values together with the known limitations of black box bioenergetic correlation methods dynamic ad biokinetic models such as the adm1 display low sensitivity to microbial growth yield values for a constant μmax this implies that model calibrations could target the accuracy of μmax maintaining the bioenergetic
