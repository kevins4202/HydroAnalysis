average settlement ratio the load sharing ratio decreased with increase in pile spacing whereas it increased with increase in pile length with increase in pile spacing bending moment ratio increased and as the length of pile increased bending moment ratio decreased up to pile group to raft width ratio of 0 6 and thereafter it increased keywords piled raft numerical modeling clay soil settlement ratio bending moment ratio shear force ratio raft soil stiffness ratio 1 introduction the piled raft is a geotechnical foundation consisting of the three elements raft piles and soil burland 1977 proposed that the piles can be used to reduce the settlement of the raft foundation in piled raft foundation the total load of the superstructure is partly carried by the piles and the raft the distribution of total load among the piles raft and soil depends on their relative stiffnesses based on the dimensions of the raft and piles the piled raft has been classified as a small piled raft b r l p 1 and large piled raft b r l p 1 viggiani 2001 sanctis and mandolini 2006 mandolini et al 2013 in a small piled raft the flexural stiffness of the raft is usually high and the differential settlement does not represent a problem here the primary reason to add the piles is to achieve a sufficient factor of safety against the bearing failure however in a large piled raft piles are added essentially to reduce the settlement poulos 2001 indicated that the 3 d numerical modeling is the most reliable method for the analysis of the piled raft foundation in a clay soils the maximum settlement differential settlement raft bending moments and shear force axial loads and pile bending moments are considered as crucial parameter for optimum design of piled raft foundation several researchers have been investigated the settlement prakoso and kulhawy 2001 cho et al 2012 sinha and hanna 2016 and bearing behavior reul 2004 sanctis and mandolini 2006 lee et al 2010 of a piled raft foundation on clay soils by numerical modeling oh et al 2008 conducted a study on the piled raft foundation in sandy soil by numerical modeling they reported that with increase in raft thickness and pile spacing the bending moment of the piled raft increased the different design aspects of the piled raft foundation have been reported by seo et al 2003 and reul and randolph 2004 ghalesari et al 2015 suggested that the piled raft foundation can be adopted as offshore foundation to reduce the settlement and to enhance the bearing capacity of the foundation furthermore poulos and devdas 2005 poulos and bunce 2008 poulos et al 2011 rabiei and choobbasti 2016 indicated that the piled raft can be used as an effective and economic foundation alternative for tall buildings to control the settlement and to enhance the bearing capacities in addition to this nguyen et al 2014 conducted a parametric study of large piled raft foundations in sandy soil through finite element modeling they indicated that the concentrated pile arrangement method can help to considerably reduce the settlements and bending moments of the raft however very few parametric studies by means of numerical modeling have been reported for the large piled raft foundation on a clay soils therefore the effect of different parameters on large piled raft foundation needs to be investigated the intended large piled raft foundation can be used for the construction of residential or commercial buildings situated near onshore line where mostly undrained conditions prevail 1 1 objective and scope of the study in a large piled raft foundation the width of raft is relatively larger in comparison with the length of piles and the piles are added primarily to reduce the settlements thus the present paper aims to analyze the settlement load sharing bending moment and shear force behavior of large piled raft foundation subjected to vertical load on a clay soil in order to understand these behaviors the influence of various parameters such as pile spacing s p pile length l p pile diameter d p and raft soil stiffness ratio k rs was studied through plaxis 3d software a series of numerical simulations for different piled raft configurations was performed to fulfill the aim of the present study based on the parametric study the approximate design steps and concluded observations are summarized 2 finite element modeling 2 1 finite element mesh and boundary conditions the model consisted of the soil mass with unaffected boundary conditions foundation geometry with square raft of 45 m width b r interface element and the applied uniformly distributed load q of 200 kpa fig 1 shows the typical finite element mesh plan view of quarter piled raft and 10 node tetrahedral soil element with 3 node embedded beam element the water table was considered at ground level from the edge of the raft lateral soil domain boundaries of the model were placed at a distance of twice the width of raft and restrained against horizontal translation but with vertical translation of soil being allowed fig 2 shows the cross sectional view of piled raft foundation the bottom soil boundary was at a vertical distance of a twice the width of raft plus two third the length of pile and was restricted from both horizontal and vertical translations gandhi and maharaj 1995 globally fine mesh has been selected for the entire soil domain and relatively very fine mesh was chosen in the vicinity of the structural elements the very fine meshing has been generated with coarseness factor of 0 25 i e the size of element in very fine meshing is 0 25 times that of size of element in fine meshing the analysis of piled raft involved two stages namely initial stage and loading stage in the initial stage the soil domain was activated and in the loading stage the piled raft geometry and applied load were activated and run was made as reported by shrestha et al 2017 in the present study undrained soil response was modeled for the precise modeling of onshore piled raft foundations from the preliminary analysis of the piled raft under the applied loading it was found that the selected lateral boundaries of the soil domain were sufficient because the observed zone of plastic strain developed in the soil was equal to width of raft b r laterally from the edge of the raft 2 2 constitutive modeling mohr coulomb model require lesser number of input parameter of soil therefore in present study the soil was modeled as 10 node tetrahedral elements with the elastic perfectly plastic mohr coulomb model the parameters required for modeling consisted of cohesion angle of internal friction young s modulus and poisson s ratio as per the mohr coulomb failure criteria the yielding or failure takes place in the soil mass as the mobilized shear stress at any plane becomes equal to the shear strength of soil to simplify the analysis process the constant values of the material parameters were used for entire soil domain ranjan and rao 2007 the raft and piles were modeled as 5 node triangular plate elements and 4 node line elements respectively the raft and piles remains in elastic state as their modulus of elasticity is greater than the soil therefore the material of raft and piles were considered to be linear elastically the piles and raft were connected by rigid connection moreover the raft soil interface was considered as a smooth contact with strength reduction factor r inter of 0 67 the r inter indicates the strength of interface element as a percentage of the shear strength of adjacent soil and is indicated by the eqns 1 and 2 1 c i r i n t e r c s o i l 2 t a n i r i n t e r t a n s o i l where c i is the interface cohesion φ i is the interface friction angle c soil is the surrounding soil cohesion and φ soil is the surrounding soil friction angle fig 3 shows the pile soil interface technique used in the present study jeong et al 2004 fig 3 a and b show the no slip and slip conditions between the soil and pile elements respectively the interaction between the soil and the pile was modeled by the embedded interface elements of 3 node line elements with pairs of nodes instead of single nodes one node of each pair belongs to the beam element whereas other node is point in the 10 node wedge element belonging to soil element in the finite element formulation the coordinates of each node pair are identical which indicates that the interface element has a zero thickness h 0 fig 3 a interface elements follow the mohr coulomb failure criterion once the shear stress τ in soil equal to the yield shear strength of the soil σ h t a n φ c u the slippage occurs at the interface fig 3 b the elastic shear behavior exists until the shear stress reaches a critical value γ crit beyond which the shear displacement increases without an accompanying increase in shear stress fig 3 c after meshing interfaces are composed of 12 node interface elements the interface elements were introduced mainly to simulate the displacement discontinuity between the structural elements piles and the soil mass in practice the pile installation changes the state of stress in surrounding soil the stress change in soil is mainly governed by the pile installation process boring or driving pile dimensions length and diameter and type and state of the soil soft or stiff in the earlier numerical studies the stress change in the soil due to pile installation was neglected baguelin and frank 1982 cho et al 2012 lee et al 2010 ghalesari et al 2015 in the present study bored piles are used which cause a limited disturbance of the surrounding soil during pile installation brinkgreve et al 2015 2 3 model validation the present finite element model in the plaxis 3d has been validated by comparing with the results reported by sinha and hanna 2016 a raft of 24 m 24 m size with 2 0 m thickness and 16 piles of 1 0 m diameter with different lengths 5 m 10 m and 15 m were used in their study the piles were spaced at six times of pile diameter and uniformly distributed load of 0 5 mpa was applied on the foundation the material properties of the soil raft and piles are shown in table 1 the comparative results of the present study with the reported results are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the results of the present study are in reasonably good agreement with that of reported results for the different length of piles 3 parametric study in this section the settlement load sharing bending moment and shear force behavior of the large piled raft foundation is studied with the variation of s p l p d p and k rs the properties of soil raft and pile are summarized in table 2 the geometrical dimensions of piled raft and the values of e s e r k rs e p have been selected from viggiani 2001 fig 5 shows the different pile arrangements for the parametric study the layout of piles beneath the raft for different pile spacings are shown in fig 6 vertical settlement profile of the raft is as shown in fig 7 see table 3 the results are plotted in the form of average settlement ratio r avg differential settlement ratio r diff load sharing ratio g pr bending moment ratio r bm and shear force ratio r sf the r avg is defined as the ratio of average settlement of piled raft to the average settlement of unpiled raft the average settlement w avg and differential settlement w diff are expressed in eqns 3 and 4 the r avg and r diff and are represented by eqns 5 and 6 the g pr is defined as the ratio of total load carried by the piles r pile to the total applied load static load r total on the foundation the objective of introducing g pr is to know the percentage load carried by piles and raft separately r pile is calculated by summing the axial load carried by the individual piles at its head eqn 7 indicates the expression for g pr the value of 1 0 for g pr indicates a freestanding pile group and value of 0 for g pr describes an unpiled raft whereas g pr in the range of 0 1 indicates the piled raft foundation r bm and r sf are the ratios of maximum bending moment of piled raft to the maximum bending moment of unpiled raft and maximum shear force of piled raft to the maximum shear force of unpiled raft respectively the raft soil stiffness ratio k rs for different raft thicknesses is calculated from eqn 8 which has been given by fraser and wardle 1976 where e r is the modulus of elasticity of the raft v r is the raft poisson s ratio e s is the modulus of elasticity of the soil v s is the soil poisson s ratio t r is the raft thickness and b r is the raft width 3 w avg 1 3 2 w center w corner 4 w diff w center w corner 5 r avg w avg o f p i l e d r a f t w avg o f u n p i l e d r a f t 6 r diff diff settlement of piled raf t diff settlement of unpiled raft 7 g p r r p i l e r t o t a l 8 k rs 4 e r 1 v s 2 3 e s 1 v r 2 t r 3 b r 3 3 1 effect of pile spacing sp a square 45 m 45 m raft with k rs of 0 09 and piles of l p d p equal to 30 and d p of 1 0 m was analyzed for different b g b r ratios 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 the effects of s p d p for different b g b r ratios on r avg and r diff are shown in fig 8 a and b respectively r avg corresponds to 1 0 indicates that the average settlement of the piled raft is equal to the average settlement of the unpiled raft it can be seen that with increase in s p d p from zero r avg decreases for different b g b r ratios and the decrease is noted to be more for higher b g b r ratio of 0 8 fig 8 a for any b g b r ratio the r avg attains a minimum value at s p d p 5 6 approx and then afterword it increases gradually beyond s p d p of 5 6 the number of piles decreases and also a group of piles might have started to behave as individual pile elements thus from the average settlement point of view the s p d p of 5 6 can be considered as optimum value as the s p d p increases r diff decreases for different b g b r ratios and the decrease is noted to be more for lower b g b r ratio of 0 2 fig 8 b r diff corresponds to 1 0 indicates that the differential settlement of the piled raft is equal to the differential settlement of the unpiled raft at any b g b r ratio r diff decreases initially up to s p d p 6 approx and subsequently increases at b g b r ratios of 0 2 piles are mostly concentrated near the central portion of the raft due to which r diff decreases for minimizing the differential settlement pile should be placed near the central portion of the raft with s p d p of 5 6 fig 9 shows the effect of pile spacing on average settlement ratio for different raft soil stiffnesses and b g b r ratios it can be observed that for same s p d p and b g b r ratio with increase in raft soil stiffness ratio k rs r avg increases for same k rs with increase in b g b r ratio r avg is observed to be decreases therefore raft with smaller k rs and larger b g b r ratio can be selected to decrease the r avg effectively fig 10 shows the load settlement plot for piled raft pr pile group pg unpiled raft ur raft in piled raft r pr and piles in piled raft g pr it can be seen that the load carried by pg and ur is higher than that of g pr and r pr respectively such behavior may be due to the interaction of piles and raft in piled raft at any settlement value the load carried by pr is equal to the load carried by r pr and g pr fig 11 shows the effect of s p d p on g pr for different b g b r ratios g pr of 1 0 indicates that the total load of the superstructure is carried by the piles only it can be seen that as the s p d p increases from 4 to 36 g pr decreases linearly since with increase in s p d p the number of piles decreases consequently the contact pressure beneath the raft increases the effect of s p d p on r bm and r sf for different b g b r ratios is shown in fig 12 a and b respectively at any b g b r ratio with increase in s p d p r bm decreases initially up to s p d p 5 approx and thereafter it increases fig 12 a at same s p d p r bm is observed to be less for lower b g b r ratio like differential settlement for bending moment pile should be placed near the central portion of the raft with lower s p d p ratio for any b g b r ratios with increase in s p d p r sf increases gradually at same s p d p r sf is observed to be lesser for higher b g b r ratio fig 12 b see fig 14 3 2 effect of pile length lp in order to understand the effect l p simulations were carried on a piled raft with l p d p of 10 20 and 30 and piles were spaced at s p 5d p fig 13 a and b show the effect of l p d p on r avg and r diff for different b g b r ratios the results show that r avg decreases with increase in l p d p for every b g b r ratios the decrease in settlement is attributed to the increase in the amount of skin friction with increase in l p d p in addition to this the decrease of r avg observed to be more for larger b g b r ratio of 0 8 fig 13 a therefore to minimize r avg the more numbers of piles with longer lengths are the most effective in comparison with the r avg the trends of decrease in r diff for different b g b r ratio are dissimilar fig 13 b r diff decreases with increase in l p d p for b g b r ratio of 0 2 and 0 6 then it increases for b g b r 0 8 fig 13 presents the effect of l p d p on g pr for different b g b r ratios as expected the g pr increases linearly as the l p d p increases and the increase is more at higher l p d p fig 15 shows the combined effect of effect of l p d p and b g b r ratios on r bm and r fm with increase in b g b r ratios r bm decreases initially up to b g b r 0 6 and thereafter increases for every l p d p fig 15 a thus for minimum r bm higher l p d p can be selected with increase in b g b r r sf increased gradually for all l p d p fig 15 b thus for minimum r sf it can be suggested to select lower l p d p 3 3 effect of pile diameter dp in order to understand the effect of d p simulations were conducted on a piled raft with varying d p from 0 5 to 2 0 m it can be observed that r avg decreases as the d p increases fig 16 a an increase in d p up to 1 0 m for b g b r 0 6 and 0 8 might attributed the increased stiffness of the pile raft at d p equal to 1 0 m the piled raft system might have achieved the maximum stiffness the effect of d p on r diff is plotted in fig 16 b as the b g b r ratio changes from 0 2 to 0 6 the r diff decreases up to d p 1 0 m and it remains constant thereafter as the b g b r ratio changes from 0 6 to 0 8 r diff increases significantly for every pile diameter fig 17 shows the variation of g pr with d p for different b g b r ratios with increase in d p g pr increases and the increase is noted to be marginal beyond d p of 1 0 m for every b g b r ratios fig 18 shows the combined effect of d p and b g b r ratios on r bm and r fm r bm decreases as the b g b r decreases up to 0 6 and thereafter it increases also it can be seen that r bm was higher at d p 4 0 and lower at d p 1 0 fig 18 a fig 18 b shows the variation of r sf with d p for different b g b r ratios with increase in b g b r for every d p r sf increases up to b g b r 0 2 and decreases thereafter thus for minimum r sf lesser d p with higher b g b r ratio can be selected 3 4 effect of raft soil stiffness ratio krs in this series simulations were carried on a piled raft by varying k rs from 0 01 to 0 32 k rs have been varied by varying the thickness of the raft from 1 to 3 m fig 19 a and b shows the bending moment and shear force variation along the entire width of raft for different k rs at b g b r 0 6 it was noted that in unpiled raft and piled raft the bending moment was maximum at the center of the raft except k rs 0 01 and it decreases to zero at the edge of raft fig 19 a for same raft soil stiffness ratio k rs 0 09 the bending moment response of piled raft is dissimilar as that of unpiled raft from 22 5 m to 9 m span of the raft bending moment decreases and from 9 m to 3 m span it increases and again it decreases towards the left edge of the raft the shear force is minimum at the center of the raft 22 5 m and it attains maximum values at 12 m 6 m and 0 m fig 19 b the piles are located at a distance of 9 m 13 5 m 18 m and 22 5 m fig 6 in general at any k rs the shear force changes its sign in the vicinity of the edge pile fig 20 a shows the combined effect of k rs and b g b r on maximum bending moment m max of raft and maximum shear force τ max of raft with increase in b g b r m max decreases initially up to b g b r of 0 6 and after that increases for every k rs values with variation of b g b r ratio for different k rs values similar trends are observed for τ max fig 20 b 3 5 behavior of piles in piled raft in order understand the behavior of piles in piled raft simulations were carried on the piled raft with l p d p 40 for different b g b r ratios of 0 2 0 6 and 0 8 middle pile edge pile and corner piles are abbreviated as mp ep and cp respectively the pile abbreviated as mp 0 6 indicates the middle pile with b g b r ratio of 0 6 fig 21 shows the variation of vertical settlement and lateral displacement along the depth of piles it can be seen that vertical settlement of piles is more at the head of the pile and it decreases nominally towards the tip of the pile fig 21 a the vertical settlement is observed to be more in cp 0 2 and is less in cp 1 0 the settlement in corner pile is observed to be more for b g b r ratios of 0 2 because of lesser number of piles it can also be seen that of the piles are displaced laterally at its tip and the lateral displacement of pile is observed to be more in ep 1 0 fig 21 b for smaller b g b r ratios the lateral displacement of pile is noted to be lesser than that of larger b g b r ratio at lower b g b r ratio piles in piled raft may possess greater soil confinement variation of axial force along the depth of piles is shown in fig 22 the axial force in the pile is observed to be higher at the head of pile and decreases towards the tip of the piles the axial force in cp 0 2 is observed to be higher and mp 1 0 carried lesser axial force for smaller b g b r ratio the axial forces in the piles are noted to be higher than as that of larger b g b r ratios the distribution of bending moment along the depth of piles is shown in fig 23 a it can be seen that the bending moment is observed to be more at the head of piles and decreases to zero at the tip of the piles the bending moment in pile might be induced due to the lateral movement of the soil the ep 1 0 carried higher bending moment followed by cp 0 8 fig 23 b shows the distribution of shear force along the depth of piles shear force in the piles were observed to be higher at the head and decreased to zero approx at the tip of the piles likewise bending moment the shear force in ep 0 8 was observed to be more 4 conclusions a series of 3 d numerical analysis were carried out on a large piled raft foundation in a clay soil under the action vertical loading the effect of pile spacing s p pile length l p pile diameter d p and raft soil stiffness ratio k rs on the settlement load sharing bending moment and shear force behavior of the large piled raft foundation were investigated based on the results of the present study the following conclusions are drawn 1 for any pile group to raft width ratio with increase in pile spacing to diameter ratio average settlement ratio differential settlement ratio and bending moment ratio decreases up to the pile spacing of 5 6 times the pile diameter and then increases also load sharing ratio decreases and shear force ratio increases raft with smaller raft soil stiffness ratio and larger pile group to raft width ratio observed to be effective in decreasing the average settlement ratio raft and pile group in piled raft has carried fewer loads as that of unpiled raft and free standing pile groups 2 for any pile group to raft width ratio with increase in pile length to diameter ratio average settlement ratio differential settlement ratio decreases and load sharing ratio increase also the bending moment ratio decreases up to b g b r 0 6 and thereafter it increases whereas shear force ratio increases linearly 3 with increase in pile diameter average settlement ratio and differential settlement ratio decreases and load sharing ratio increases up to pile diameter 1 0 for any pile group to raft width ratio with increase in pile diameter from 0 5 to 1 0 m the bending moment ratio decreases and increases thereafter for any pile diameter the shear force ratio increases up to pile group to raft width ratio of 0 2 and then it decreases 4 in unpiled raft and piled raft maximum bending moment and minimum shear force is obtained at the center of the raft the bending moment was affected marginally when raft soil stiffness increases more than 0 09 the shear force increase as the raft soil stiffness ratio increase at any raft soil stiffness ratio shear force at the edge pile is noted to be minimal as compared to inside piles also shear force changes its sign in the vicinity of edge pile as the raft soil stiffness ratio increases the maximum bending moment and maximum shear force in the raft increases 5 the vertical settlement of piles is more at its head and less at its tip whereas the lateral displacement in piles is more at its tip corner pile with pile group to raft width ratio of 0 2 settle more and the lateral displacement is more in pile group to raft width ratio of 0 8 the axial force bending moment and shear force in piles are more at its head and less at its tip axial force is more in corner pile with pile group to raft width ratio of 0 2 and is lesser in middle pile with pile group to raft width ratio 1 0 edge pile with pile group to raft width ratio of 0 8 carries higher bending moment and shear force

surrounding soil the stress change in soil is mainly governed by the pile installation process boring or driving pile dimensions length and diameter and type and state of the soil soft or stiff in the earlier numerical studies the stress change in the soil due to pile installation was neglected baguelin and frank 1982 cho et al 2012 lee et al 2010 ghalesari et al 2015 in the present study bored piles are used which cause a limited disturbance of the surrounding soil during pile installation brinkgreve et al 2015 2 3 model validation the present finite element model in the plaxis 3d has been validated by comparing with the results reported by sinha and hanna 2016 a raft of 24 m 24 m size with 2 0 m thickness and 16 piles of 1 0 m diameter with different lengths 5 m 10 m and 15 m were used in their study the piles were spaced at six times of pile diameter and uniformly distributed load of 0 5 mpa was applied on the foundation the material properties of the soil raft and piles are shown in table 1 the comparative results of the present study with the reported results are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the results of the present study are in reasonably good agreement with that of reported results for the different length of piles 3 parametric study in this section the settlement load sharing bending moment and shear force behavior of the large piled raft foundation is studied with the variation of s p l p d p and k rs the properties of soil raft and pile are summarized in table 2 the geometrical dimensions of piled raft and the values of e s e r k rs e p have been selected from viggiani 2001 fig 5 shows the different pile arrangements for the parametric study the layout of piles beneath the raft for different pile spacings are shown in fig 6 vertical settlement profile of the raft is as shown in fig 7 see table 3 the results are plotted in the form of average settlement ratio r avg differential settlement ratio r diff load sharing ratio g pr bending moment ratio r bm and shear force ratio r sf the r avg is defined as the ratio of average settlement of piled raft to the average settlement of unpiled raft the average settlement w avg and differential settlement w diff are expressed in eqns 3 and 4 the r avg and r diff and are represented by eqns 5 and 6 the g pr is defined as the ratio of total load carried by the piles r pile to the total applied load static load r total on the foundation the objective of introducing g pr is to know the percentage load carried by piles and raft separately r pile is calculated by summing the axial load carried by the individual piles at its head eqn 7 indicates the expression for g pr the value of 1 0 for g pr indicates a freestanding pile group and value of 0 for g pr describes an unpiled raft whereas g pr in the range of 0 1 indicates the piled raft foundation r bm and r sf are the ratios of maximum bending moment of piled raft to the maximum bending moment of unpiled raft and maximum shear force of piled raft to the maximum shear force of unpiled raft respectively the raft soil stiffness ratio k rs for different raft thicknesses is calculated from eqn 8 which has been given by fraser and wardle 1976 where e r is the modulus of elasticity of the raft v r is the raft poisson s ratio e s is the modulus of elasticity of the soil v s is the soil poisson s ratio t r is the raft thickness and b r is the raft width 3 w avg 1 3 2 w center w corner 4 w diff w center w corner 5 r avg w avg o f p i l e d r a f t w avg o f u n p i l e d r a f t 6 r diff diff settlement of piled raf t diff settlement of unpiled raft 7 g p r r p i l e r t o t a l 8 k rs 4 e r 1 v s 2 3 e s 1 v r 2 t r 3 b r 3 3 1 effect of pile spacing sp a square 45 m 45 m raft with k rs of 0 09 and piles of l p d p equal to 30 and d p of 1 0 m was analyzed for different b g b r ratios 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 the effects of s p d p for different b g b r ratios on r avg and r diff are shown in fig 8 a and b respectively r avg corresponds to 1 0 indicates that the average settlement of the piled raft is equal to the average settlement of the unpiled raft it can be seen that with increase in s p d p from zero r avg decreases for different b g b r ratios and the decrease is noted to be more for higher b g b r ratio of 0 8 fig 8 a for any b g b r ratio the r avg attains a minimum value at s p d p 5 6 approx and then afterword it increases gradually beyond s p d p of 5 6 the number of piles decreases and also a group of piles might have started to behave as individual pile elements thus from the average settlement point of view the s p d p of 5 6 can be considered as optimum value as the s p d p increases r diff decreases for different b g b r ratios and the decrease is noted to be more for lower b g b r ratio of 0 2 fig 8 b r diff corresponds to 1 0 indicates that the differential settlement of the piled raft is equal to the differential settlement of the unpiled raft at any b g b r ratio r diff decreases initially up to s p d p 6 approx and subsequently increases at b g b r ratios of 0 2 piles are mostly concentrated near the central portion of the raft due to which r diff decreases for minimizing the differential settlement pile should be placed near the central portion of the raft with s p d p of 5 6 fig 9 shows the effect of pile spacing on average settlement ratio for different raft soil stiffnesses and b g b r ratios it can be observed that for same s p d p and b g b r ratio with increase in raft soil stiffness ratio k rs r avg increases for same k rs with increase in b g b r ratio r avg is observed to be decreases therefore raft with smaller k rs and larger b g b r ratio can be selected to decrease the r avg effectively fig 10 shows the load settlement plot for piled raft pr pile group pg unpiled raft ur raft in piled raft r pr and piles in piled raft g pr it can be seen that the load carried by pg and ur is higher than that of g pr and r pr respectively such behavior may be due to the interaction of piles and raft in piled raft at any settlement value the load carried by pr is equal to the load carried by r pr and g pr fig 11 shows the effect of s p d p on g pr for different b g b r ratios g pr of 1 0 indicates that the total load of the superstructure is carried by the piles only it can be seen that as the s p d p increases from 4 to 36 g pr decreases linearly since with increase in s p d p the number of piles decreases consequently the contact pressure beneath the raft increases the effect of s p d p on r bm and r sf for different b g b r ratios is shown in fig 12 a and b respectively at any b g b r ratio with increase in s p d p r bm decreases initially up to s p d p 5 approx and thereafter it increases fig 12 a at same s p d p r bm is observed to be less for lower b g b r ratio like differential settlement for bending moment pile should be placed near the central portion of the raft with lower s p d p ratio for any b g b r ratios with increase in s p d p r sf increases gradually at same s p d p r sf is observed to be lesser for higher b g b r ratio fig 12 b see fig 14 3 2 effect of pile length lp in order to understand the effect l p simulations were carried on a piled raft with l p d p of 10 20 and 30 and piles were spaced at s p 5d p fig 13 a and b show the effect of l p d p on r avg and r diff for different b g b r ratios the results show that r avg decreases with increase in l p d p for every b g b r ratios the decrease in settlement is attributed to the increase in the amount of skin friction with increase in l p d p in addition to this the decrease of r avg observed to be more for larger b g b r ratio of 0 8 fig 13 a therefore to minimize r avg the more numbers of piles with longer lengths are the most effective in comparison with the r avg the trends of decrease in r diff for different b g b r ratio are dissimilar fig 13 b r diff decreases with increase in l p d p for b g b r ratio of 0 2 and 0 6 then it increases for b g b r 0 8 fig 13 presents the effect of l p d p on g pr for different b g b r ratios as expected the g pr increases linearly as the l p d p increases and the increase is more at higher l p d p fig 15 shows the combined effect of effect of l p d p and b g b r ratios on r bm and r fm with increase in b g b r ratios r bm decreases initially up to b g b r 0 6 and thereafter increases for every l p d p fig 15 a thus for minimum r bm higher l p d p can be selected with increase in b g b r r sf increased gradually for all l p d p fig 15 b thus for minimum r sf it can be suggested to select lower l p d p 3 3 effect of pile diameter dp in order to understand the effect of d p simulations were conducted on a piled raft with varying d p from 0 5 to 2 0 m it can be observed that r avg decreases as the d p increases fig 16 a an increase in d p up to 1 0 m for b g b r 0 6 and 0 8 might attributed the increased stiffness of the pile raft at d p equal to 1 0 m the piled raft system might have achieved the maximum stiffness the effect of d p on r diff is plotted in fig 16 b as the b g b r ratio changes from 0 2 to 0 6 the r diff decreases up to d p 1 0 m and it remains constant thereafter as the b g b r ratio changes from 0 6 to 0 8 r diff increases significantly for every pile diameter fig 17 shows the variation of g pr with d p for different b g b r ratios with increase in d p g pr increases and the increase is noted to be marginal beyond d p of 1 0 m for every b g b r ratios fig 18 shows the combined effect of d p and b g b r ratios on r bm and r fm r bm decreases as the b g b r decreases up to 0 6 and thereafter it increases also it can be seen that r bm was higher at d p 4 0 and lower at d p 1 0 fig 18 a fig 18 b shows the variation of r sf with d p for different b g b r ratios with increase in b g b r for every d p r sf increases up to b g b r 0 2 and decreases thereafter thus for minimum r sf lesser d p with higher b g b r ratio can be selected 3 4 effect of raft soil stiffness ratio krs in this series simulations were carried on a piled raft by varying k rs from 0 01 to 0 32 k rs have been varied by varying the thickness of the raft from 1 to 3 m fig 19 a and b shows the bending moment and shear force variation along the entire width of raft for different k rs at b g b r 0 6 it was noted that in unpiled raft and piled raft the bending moment was maximum at the center of the raft except k rs 0 01 and it decreases to zero at the edge of raft fig 19 a for same raft soil stiffness ratio k rs 0 09 the bending moment response of piled raft is dissimilar as that of unpiled raft from 22 5 m to 9 m span of the raft bending moment decreases and from 9 m to 3 m span it increases and again it decreases towards the left edge of the raft the shear force is minimum at the center of the raft 22 5 m and it attains maximum values at 12 m 6 m and 0 m fig 19 b the piles are located at a distance of 9 m 13 5 m 18 m and 22 5 m fig 6 in general at any k rs the shear force changes its sign in the vicinity of the edge pile fig 20 a shows the combined effect of k rs and b g b r on maximum bending moment m max of raft and maximum shear force τ max of raft with increase in b g b r m max decreases initially up to b g b r of 0 6 and after that increases for every k rs values with variation of b g b r ratio for different k rs values similar trends are observed for τ max fig 20 b 3 5 behavior of piles in piled raft in order understand the behavior of piles in piled raft simulations were carried on the piled raft with l p d p 40 for different b g b r ratios of 0 2 0 6 and 0 8 middle pile edge pile and corner piles are abbreviated as mp ep and cp respectively the pile abbreviated as mp 0 6 indicates the middle pile with b g b r ratio of 0 6 fig 21 shows the variation of vertical settlement and lateral displacement along the depth of piles it can be seen that vertical settlement of piles is more at the head of the pile and it decreases nominally towards the tip of the pile fig 21 a the vertical settlement is observed to be more in cp 0 2 and is less in cp 1 0 the settlement in corner pile is observed to be more for b g b r ratios of 0 2 because of lesser number of piles it can also be seen that of the piles are displaced laterally at its tip and the lateral displacement of pile is observed to be more in ep 1 0 fig 21 b for smaller b g b r ratios the lateral displacement of pile is noted to be lesser than that of larger b g b r ratio at lower b g b r ratio piles in piled raft may possess greater soil confinement variation of axial force along the depth of piles is shown in fig 22 the axial force in the pile is observed to be higher at the head of pile and decreases towards the tip of the piles the axial force in cp 0 2 is observed to be higher and mp 1 0 carried lesser axial force for smaller b g b r ratio the axial forces in the piles are noted to be higher than as that of larger b g b r ratios the distribution of bending moment along the depth of piles is shown in fig 23 a it can be seen that the bending moment is observed to be more at the head of piles and decreases to zero at the tip of the piles the bending moment in pile might be induced due to the lateral movement of the soil the ep 1 0 carried higher bending moment followed by cp 0 8 fig 23 b shows the distribution of shear force along the depth of piles shear force in the piles were observed to be higher at the head and decreased to zero approx at the tip of the piles likewise bending moment the shear force in ep 0 8 was observed to be more 4 conclusions a series of 3 d numerical analysis were carried out on a large piled raft foundation in a clay soil under the action vertical loading the effect of pile spacing s p pile length l p pile diameter d p and raft soil stiffness ratio k rs on the settlement load sharing bending moment and shear force behavior of the large piled raft foundation were investigated based on the results of the present study the following conclusions are drawn 1 for any pile group to raft width ratio with increase in pile spacing to diameter ratio average settlement ratio differential settlement ratio and bending moment ratio decreases up to the pile spacing of 5 6 times the pile diameter and then increases also load sharing ratio decreases and shear force ratio increases raft with smaller raft soil stiffness ratio and larger pile group to raft width ratio observed to be effective in decreasing the average settlement ratio raft and pile group in piled raft has carried fewer loads as that of unpiled raft and free standing pile groups 2 for any pile group to raft width ratio with increase in pile length to diameter ratio average settlement ratio differential settlement ratio decreases and load sharing ratio increase also the bending moment ratio decreases up to b g b r 0 6 and thereafter it increases whereas shear force ratio increases linearly 3 with increase in pile diameter average settlement ratio and differential settlement ratio decreases and load sharing ratio increases up to pile diameter 1 0 for any pile group to raft width ratio with increase in pile diameter from 0 5 to 1 0 m the bending moment ratio decreases and increases thereafter for any pile diameter the shear force ratio increases up to pile group to raft width ratio of 0 2 and then it decreases 4 in unpiled raft and piled raft maximum bending moment and minimum shear force is obtained at the center of the raft the bending moment was affected marginally when raft soil stiffness increases more than 0 09 the shear force increase as the raft soil stiffness ratio increase at any raft soil stiffness ratio shear force at the edge pile is noted to be minimal as compared to inside piles also shear force changes its sign in the vicinity of edge pile as the raft soil stiffness ratio increases the maximum bending moment and maximum shear force in the raft increases 5 the vertical settlement of piles is more at its head and less at its tip whereas the lateral displacement in piles is more at its tip corner pile with pile group to raft width ratio of 0 2 settle more and the lateral displacement is more in pile group to raft width ratio of 0 8 the axial force bending moment and shear force in piles are more at its head and less at its tip axial force is more in corner pile with pile group to raft width ratio of 0 2 and is lesser in middle pile with pile group to raft width ratio 1 0 edge pile with pile group to raft width ratio of 0 8 carries higher bending moment and shear force 
23666,as the demand of environmental restriction and cost reduction increases a fin typed structure attached around a propeller has been developed to reduce fuel consumption rate of a vessel by improving the thrust force some cracks have been reported in the vicinity of the root of the fin i e the welded line between esd and hull structure which is caused by the fluctuating hydrodynamic force induced by the ship motion as a method of fatigue strength assessment for ship structure the spectral approach has been widely utilized based on the hydrodynamic loads calculated using the potential theory however the nonlinear vertical lift force caused by the vertical motion of the esd cannot be properly considered in the spectral approach to take into account the nonlinear effect computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis was adopted for the assessment of hydrodynamic force and the results were approximated by an artificial neural network lee et al 2016 then a time series of vertical velocity of energy saving device under irregular wave is converted to time series of lift force and lift moment using the trained neural networks however in the previous research ship speed heading angle and esd shape were fixed and their variations could not be reflected in the safety assessment the proposed neural network is a useful method but it cannot be directly applied to an actual project due to the absence of information about the artificial neural network itself this research aims at developing simplified formulas to predict lift force and lift moment instead of the neural network and covering heading angle esd shape and ship speed additionally to investigate the effects of additional variables a series of cfd analysis is performed and polynomial regression models are employed to examine their relationship with the life force and moment the established simplified formulas are used for the generation of a time series of lift force and lift moment required in ultimate and fatigue strength assessments the rainflow counting method is used for the calculation of fatigue damage and the resultant long term distribution is compared with a simplified long term distribution method the proposed formulas are expected to be used for the same type of esd with different configuration and ship speed without any further time consuming cfd analysis keywords energy saving devices ultimate limit strength fatigue limit strength cfd analysis simplified formula 1 introduction due to the growing interest about environmental problem the demand of the reduction of fuel oil consumption is greater than ever before various types of energy saving devices esd have been developed abs 2013 hooijmans et al 2010 among esds a series of fin typed esd attached around a propeller has been proposed lee et al 1992 while most researches are focused on the evaluation of energy saving performance of esd celik and guner 2007 kim et al 2015 few have studied on the structural safety assessment the conventional spectral method was used for a calculation of extreme design load and fatigue analysis for esd woo et al 2013 presented strength and fatigue assessments of duct type esd using a linear transfer function however it can t reflect the nonlinearity of induced hydrodynamic force in order to accurately consider the nonlinearity of the hydrodynamic force acting on esd cfd analysis has been used up to now many studies focused on the calculation of lift force and drag force performance of a hydrofoil under steady state flow using cfd analysis 2d cfd analysis was used to compute the lift coefficient and drag coefficient hutchison et al 2010 kinnas et al 2012 the 3d effect was estimated by comparing the 2d and 3d cfd analysis results nowruzi et al 2017 spentoz et al 2004 however in case of esd hydrofoils are attached on hull structure and the effect of hull form is necessary to be taken into account in the calculation of the hydrodynamic force of vertically oscillating hydrofoils in addition to the 3d effect of esd itself the hydrodynamic force on esd is found to be affected not only by the three dimensional shape of esd but also by the ship hull lee and jang 2014 therefore a 3d cfd analysis for entire hull should be performed to obtain the hydrodynamic forces acting on esd in an extreme environmental condition a large ship motion particularly heave and pitch motion can induce large nonlinear lift force and lift moment on esd therefore some cracks at the root of hydrofoil type device have been reported continuously as an effort of safety assessment of esd lee et al 2016 proposed a new procedure taking into account the nonlinearity of hydrodynamic loads this procedure which is called as level iii method consists of four main parts as shown in fig 1 a sea keeping analysis part i a cfd analysis and an artificial neural network training part ii a long term analysis and an ultimate strength assessment part iii and a fatigue strength assessment using rain flow counting method part iv the artificial neural network explained in this procedure is trained for cfd results for a specific shape of esd and one ship speed for a different esd configuration and different ship speeds a series of cfd analysis should be newly carried out and a new neural network model needs to be constructed in order for a neural network to include the additional shape parameters and the ship speed the number of cfd simulations required for generating sampling points drastically increases due to the increased dimension of input variables for this reason it is necessary to establish an efficient way to cover those additional variables moreover an explicit formula to predict the lifting force and moment would be preferred to the neural network for a direct use in a real project this research aims at providing simplified formulas to predict lift force and lift moment acting on esd instead of the neural network to be trained for cfd analysis results the effect of each additional parameter is reflected into its respective adjustment factor based on the assumption that the coupling effect with other variables are not significant a few steps to derive the simplified formula are described in section 2 and section 3 this simplified formula can be used for the generation of a time series data of lift force and lift moment required in ultimate limit strength assessment uls and fatigue limit strength assessment fls instead of the artificial neural network proposed by lee et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 this method is named level ii method and the artificial neural network in level iii method is replaced by the proposed simplified formula furthermore this research also suggests a level i method that can be used for uls and fls based on a simplified long term distribution generated using the proposed simplified formula it doesn t require to generate times series of lift force and moment for all sea states in the wave scatter diagram therefore level i method can be regarded as the simplest method even if its accuracy deteriorates compared to level ii and leve iii methods the detailed explanation about level ii and level i methods are explained in section 4 2 an overall approach to derive a simplified formula all variables affecting the lift force and moment need to be included in a simplified formula however the number of required sample points drastically increases with the number of considered variables the dimension of design space can be reduced by assuming some parameters constant the slope angle of esd blade is set zero in a conservative way because its vertically projected area becomes the largest at zero slop angle the following six variables are expected to have substantial influence on the lifting force and moment heading angle h a degree vertical velocity of esd v v m s vertical velocity period of esd p v sec esd blade root length l a m esd blade span length l b m ship speed v s m s here the v v indicates the vertical velocity of the hull location where the esd is attached and it can be calculated by combining the heave velocity and the pitch angular velocity of the vessel two approaches for the development of simplified formulas for lifting force and moment can be assumed they are presented briefly in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively in alternative approach i fig 3 all six variables are treated together and the lift force is defined as a function of six variables through a six dimensional regression analysis it is capable of taking into account the full coupling effects of six parameters however a large number of sample points are required to achieve relatively high accuracy and this leads to considerable burden of cfd simulation in alternative approach ii fig 4 a regression formula is built first for the vertical velocity of esd v v and the vertical velocity period of esd p v here the effect of heading angle h a is excluded from the regression analysis if it is included this predicted value could be more accurate than when excluded however the computational burden of cfd simulation increases significantly further detailed discussion about the effect of heading angle is laid in subsection 3 1 their coupling effects are expected to be larger than others a series of cfd analysis is performed for various combinations of two parameter values while fixing other three parameters to their respective reference values then the constructed regression formula is adjusted by multiplying two factors that can reflect the differences of esd shape and ship speed from their reference values the factor is determined from a regression analysis for data obtained from a series of cfd analysis with varying only one variable while fixing all other variables this approach is based on the assumption that the esd shape and the ship speed are independent of other variables for example if the lifting force is proportional to ship speed at a specific vertical velocity and a vertical velocity period the proportional relationship is kept nearly the same even for other vertical velocities and vertical periods the number of sampling points is much less than the alternative approach i so that the number of cfd analyses is acceptable this research adopts alternative approach ii and the accuracy is verified through some case studies for the cfd analysis using star ccm cd adapco 2014 the same model of ship and esd of lee et al 2016 is adopted trimmed mesh consisting of about 2 1 million cells is generated over the entire solution domain 1 560 m l 660 m b 700 m d a sufficient fine mesh zone is used in the vicinity of free surface kelvin wake region ship and esd while y is kept under 40 using a prism layer the main dimensions of vessel are summarized in tables 1 and 2 and the arrangement of four hydrofoils in fig 2 3 simplified formula to calculate the lift force and lift moment 3 1 effect of heading angle the previous original procedure for structural safety assessment of an esd proposed by lee et al 2016 considers only head sea condition however ships can encounter lots of waves of different heading angles such as beam sea or quarter sea in real operating conditions therefore it is required to include different heading angles in cfd analysis to increase the accuracy of neural network training cfd analysis example under a quartering sea is illustrated in fig 5 the heading angle is chosen from head sea condition 180 to beam sea condition 90 at an interval of 30 these heading angles are combined with various values of wave height and period thus total 134 cfd simulation cases are generated for a mild sea state ship can navigate along any direction regardless of the wave incoming direction however under a harsh sea state a ship may take her course to encounter waves in head sea direction for her stable voyage similarly the cfd analysis for beam sea ship capsizes and the analysis stops due to its stability problem when such a stability problem occurs the cfd analysis diverges and the simulation stops this case is classified to a failure case all cases are examined by the cfd analysis and the results are marked in fig 6 a for heading angles of 135 and 150 the corresponding cases are plotted versus wave height and wave period there are some areas where both failure cases and success cases are mixed and it is due to the effect of different wave periods as an example a case with a fairly small wave period for a large wave height is a failed case however it can be seen from this figure that the smaller the heading angle is the more likely the cfd analysis fails at small wave height since the ship model doesn t include bilge keel the roll damping is not incorporated properly and the stability may be underestimated for these reasons it should be judged whether the ship can sail at stable condition at a specific operating condition composed of heading angle wave height and wave period before predicting lifting force and moment since it is very time consuming to determine the ship stability by cfd analysis each time this paper adopts a pattern recognition neural network mathworks 2016 it is composed of three input nodes 10 hidden nodes and 1 output node as depicted in fig 7 table 3 lists 134 sample points obtained from cfd analysis the points are classified into success cases 105 cases and failure cases 29 cases and used for training the pattern recognition neural network two neural networks are trained the first model is trained for voyage conditions defined by heading angle wave height and wave period and the other model for resultant vertical speed at vertical velocity and vertical velocity period the vertical velocity period is the same as the encounter period calculated for a given heading angle two trained pattern recognition neural networks are used to judge the ship stability if judged un stable the heading angle is assumed to be changed to head sea and the lifting force and moment are calculated for the head sea for a certain wave period and heading angle the maximum wave height to ensure the stability can be found by running the model 1 neural network with increasing the wave height this resultant limiting wave height is visualized in a quadrant diagram as depicted in fig 8 gunther et al 2003 from this diagram it can be identified that the limiting wave height decreases from head sea to beam sea in this study a time series of vertical velocity is converted to two time series of lift force and moment a set of vertical velocity and vertical velocity period values are extracted from each cycle of the time series of vertical velocity and the values are used as input to a model to predict the lift force and lift moment imposed on esd therefore model 2 neural network is required for a judge of stability while model 1 neural network is hard to apply since it is trained for wave height and wave frequency for a given vertical velocity period and heading angle the limiting vertical velocity can be computed from the same method as the limiting wave height using model 2 pattern recognition neural network the obtained limiting vertical velocity is plotted in a quadrant diagram as depicted in fig 9 the limiting vertical velocity values decrease gradually as the heading angles goes from head sea to beam sea overall tendency is similar to fig 8 since the vertical velocity is proportional to wave height but the rate differs depending on the period and it can be determined from a vertical velocity rao in addition it can be observed that the limiting vertical velocity increases as the vertical velocity period decreases this is due to the similar tendency of the ship motion and the vertical velocity that they become smaller in the lower period overall procedure to predict lifting force and moment for given vertical velocity vertical velocity period and heading angle is shown in fig 10 first besides the two pattern recognition model mentioned in fig 7 two general neural network models are trained to predict lifting force and moment the input nodes are heading angle vertical velocity and vertical velocity period and the output node is lifting force and moment respectively among the 134 data listed in table 3 105 success cases are used for their training these neural networks are used to convert irregular time series of vertical velocity to two time series of lifting force and moment respectively the slop of vertical velocity is continuously traced along the time series of the vertical velocity vertical velocity value is determined from a peak point of zero slope and a zero crossing period from two sequent zero crossing points some difference may be incurred since all neural network are trained for cfd results under regular wave however the ship response subject to regular wave was found to be more severe than irregular wave lee et al 2016 and it is hard to reflect the wave irregularity into the training of artificial neural networks therefore from a conservative point of view the neural network results obtained from regular wave are used to judge the stability and to predict lifting force and moment as well if the given operating condition is judged to be stable for a specific heading angle lifting force and moment corresponding to the heading angle are calculated from the neural networks on the other hand if unstable heading angle is changed to 180 and the lift force and moment are calculated for head sea condition ultimately the long term extreme values of lift force and lift moment obtained considering only head sea condition and considering various heading angles are summarized in table 4 the extreme value is determined by taking into account the occurrence frequency of all sea states bishop and price 1979 in this research the world wide wave scatter data is used and the time domain analysis for 3 h are repeated 20 times in order to reflect the randomness the 20 maximums are collected and gumbel distribution is used to fit the data after constructing the gumbel distributions in all sea states the long term value of lift force and lift moment is obtained from the exceedance probability of 3 h maximum value q x 3 h x haver and winterstein 2008 the exceedance probability of 3 h maximum value can be calculated by using this formulation

considering only head sea condition is conservative than considering heading angle this means that the lift force generated from the head sea to the beam sea gradually decreases in the same vertical velocity and vertical velocity period to confirm this the lift force calculated from the neural network obtained for each heading angle is shown in fig 11 from fig 11 it can be demonstrated that the smaller the heading angle the smaller the lift force in addition as the heading angle becomes smaller only the results according to a small vertical velocity appear this is due to the limiting vertical velocity obtained from the pattern recognition neural network although the results are more accurate when the heading angle is considered the difference is not sufficiently large and considering only head sea condition is much simple for this reason heading angle effect is ignored and heading angle is fixed as 180 in simplified formula 3 2 regression analysis with vertical velocity of esd and vertical velocity period of esd the regression analysis is conducted for vertical velocity of esd and vertical velocity period of esd by using the 58 head sea data and 15 additional points the additional data is intended for a prediction of zero lift force and moment for zero vertical velocity regardless of period values the zero vertical velocity means that there is no vertical motion of the vessel stern where the esd is located so the corresponding lift force and the lift moment acting on the esd are also zero the vertical force is kept zero while varying the vertical velocity period from 2 5 sec to 20 sec at interval of 1 25 sec v v p v 0 2 5 0 3 75 0 5 0 20 in fact it is meaningless to define the period of vertical velocity for the zero velocity however it is intended to reflect it to the regression model that the lift force and moment converges to zero as the vertical velocity goes to zero regardless of different periods it is an essential condition that should be satisfied by regression model but those points cannot be obtained from the cfd simulation even they are intentionally added in the case of small lift force it may not be critical in the extreme analysis but it is not negligible in fatigue analysis however fatigue damage accumulated by the small stress range is not ignorable because the number of occurrence increases as the stress range becomes smaller moreover the occurrence probability of mild sea states in a wave scatter diagram is much higher than that of harsh sea states therefore an accurate prediction for small lift force zone is also important especially the condition of zero lift force for zero vertical velocity should be satisfied by the regression model but its exact satisfaction is not easy due to insufficient data for zero vertical velocity this can be compensated by intentional addition of sample data 58 head sea cases among the total 134 cfd analysis results are listed in table 5 these 58 sample points are designed to cover the wide ranges of vertical velocity and vertical velocity period this feature prevents data distortion in certain region when creating the regression formula the distribution of head sea data are plotted in fig 26 the correlation between vertical velocity of esd and lift force is depicted in fig 12 the relationship for low vertical velocity is likely linear however the nonlinearity increase as the vertical velocity goes beyond 8 m s this nonlinear region is critical for an exact prediction of extreme value of lift force and moment this research adopts a 2nd order polynomial to fit the lift force data as identified in fig 13 the correlation between the lift force and lift moment is nearly linear the ratio of the lift force to the lift moment is constant as 1 76 this is enabled by the uniform pressure distribution on the esd horizontal surface since the lift moment is measured from the esd root uniform pressure distribution means that the moment arm is constant in practice the ratio of 1 76 m is almost the half of the esd span length shown in fig 20 which is the moment arm when a uniform pressure distribution is applied to the esd surface as an example fig 14 shows pressure distribution for 18 m of wave height and 16 s of wave period the pressure variation along the span length is negligible therefore the same 2nd order polynomial regression is also used for the lift moment in this step the esd blade root length the esd blade span length and the ship speed are fixed as reference values l a r e f 1 8 m l b r e f 3 6 m v s r e f 8 23 m s respectively the lift force and lift moment regression formulas obtained from the regression analysis are as follows 1 lift force f l v v p v 1 376 10 4 1552 p v 3 9613 10 4 v v 69 p v 2 453 p v v v 752 v v 2 2 lift moment m l v v p v 0 416 10 5 4290 p v 1 003 10 5 v v 230 p v 2 930 p v v v 1350 v v 2 the coefficient of vertical velocity term is much larger than that of vertical velocity period term this implies that the vertical velocity is a dominant factor to the lift force and lift moment in addition the coefficient of first order term is much larger than that of second order term this is because the relationship between vertical velocity and the lift force is close to linear below 8 m s of vertical velocity as shown in fig 12 the lift force and moment predicted using the above equations approaches zero as the vertical velocity becomes zero but are not perfect zero at the zero velocity in spite of the 15 additional sample data of zero velocities the constant term and the first and second order terms of vertical velocity period are the reason of the nonzero lift force the inappropriate fitting is adjusted such that the formula is a linear function of the vertical velocity v v with zero y intercept i e lift force or moment c v v for v v 0 75 m s here the coefficient c should be a function of the vertical velocity period p v in order for the formula to be continuous with the original formula at v v 0 75 m s when v v 0 75 m s the original formula of lift force becomes as follows lift force 3 647 10 4 1892 p v 69 p v 2 at v v 0 75 m s therefore the original formula is adjusted to the following two formula using the above formula 3 lift force 1 376 10 4 1552 p v 3 9613 10 4 v v 69 p v 2 453 p v v v 752 v v 2 for v v 0 75 m s 3 647 10 4 1892 p v 69 p v 2 v v 0 75 5 852 10 4 2522 p v 92 p v 2 v v for v v 0 75 m s in the same manner the lift moment can be modified as follows 4 lift moment 0 416 10 5 4290 p v 1 003 10 5 v v 230 p v 2 930 p v v v 1350 v v 2 for v v 0 75 1 5475 10 5 6650 p v 306 7 p v 2 v v for v v 0 75 fig 15 illustrates two examples of corrections of two formula for p v 10 s two adjusted curves have continuity at v v 0 75 m s the effect of the adjustment can be explained as follows the lift force and moment need to be converted to hotspot stress at the root of the energy saving fin for a fatigue analysis the conversion is made by multiplying stress effect factor to lifting force the factor depends on the distance from the root since the moment at the root differs the distance corresponds to moment arm that is the ratio of lifting moment to lifting force thus a set of stress responses subject to unit force at different locations should be calculated in advance as illustrated in fig 16 a lee et al 2016 the stress effect factor is proportional to the ratio of the lifting moment to lifting force i e moment arm as shown in fig 16 b however because the lifting force approaches closer to zero than the lifting moment as identified in fig 15 the ratio becomes drastically increases as the vertical velocity goes to zero this makes the stress effect factor abnormally large and the resultant hotspot stress at the root of esd blade becomes larger than the actual value even if this fitting error seems to be small but it makes the probabilistic distribution of lift force for the entire sea states in the wave scatter diagram having two peaks as depicted in fig 17 original formula this abnormal distribution at the low lift force can lead to the increase of fatigue damage since the occurrence frequency of low lift force is much larger than that of high lift force these inappropriate distribution can be corrected by adjusting the fitting curves the lifting force and moments are adjusted such that the lines pass zero values at zero vertical velocity this reduces the moment arm as shown in fig 18 consequently the resultant probabilistic distribution changes to a reasonable shape in fig 17 adjusted formula the accuracy of the regression formula can be verified by comparing the formulas with cfd results fig 19 plots the comparison results the effects of esd shape and ship speed are excluded here and only those of vertical velocity and vertical velocity period are examined the maximum difference between the regression formula and cfd results is less than about 20 the average errors of lift force and lift moment compared to cfd results and neural network results are 8 30 and 7 39 respectively here the neural network employed by lee et al 2016 is also trained for the same sample data used for regression formula the average errors between cfd results and 2nd order polynomial regression formulas are 9 64 and 10 29 respectively these results are summarized in table 6 the prediction results of 2nd order polynomial regression are slightly less accurate than the neural network results however it is more convenient to use due to its explicit expression in a formula in the proposed simplified method to be explained later the 2nd order polynomial regression formulas are adopted for the prediction of lift force and lift moment in place of cfd analysis and neural network 3 3 inclusion of the effect of esd shape to consider the effect of esd shape two parameters esd blade root length l a and esd blade span length l b can be taken into account fig 20 the governing factor to the lift force may be the vertically projected area of esd the area is determined by these two parameters in order to investigate the influence of different esd shape on the lift force and moment cfd analysis is performed by varying two parameters the blade root length is changed from 1 59 m to 2 47 m and the blade span length from 3 10 m to 4 88 m the variation covers the range from 90 to 140 of the original values total 16 cases are simulated under the same wave height 12 m wave period 14 s and ship speed 8 23 m s the vertical velocity and vertical velocity period resulted from the cfd simulation are found the same for all cases this means the influence of shape change on the ship motion is negligible it facilitates focusing on the effect of esd shape these cfd analysis results for the 16 different esd shapes are used to determine esd shape correction factor which is multiplied to equations 3 and 4 to reflect the influence from the reference shape the plots of lift force and lift moments are depicted in figs 21 24 in the plots the esd blade root length and the esd blade span length are normalized to reference values l a r e f 1 8 m and l b r e f 3 6 m respectively the normalizations of lift force and lift moment are also made to the reference lift force and moment at the reference shape defined by l a r e f and l b r e f the esd blade root length and span length have different tendency a 2nd order polynomial function is adopted for a data fitting for a logarithmic scale of l a and l b itself the use of logarithmic scale for l a is found to give slightly higher accuracy than l a itself as in regression analysis of these two methods the error with the cfd result is approximately 6 and 6 6 respectively which is acceptable level ultimately the correction factor to take into account the effect of the esd shape is defined below a comparison of the results multiplied by the esd shape correction factor and the cfd results are plotted in fig 25 however since the regression analysis selects a quadratic form instead of a linear form a peak point exists therefore the equations are not valid if it deviates greatly from the range of fitting data esd shape correction factor for lift force c a f is 5 c a f l a l b 0 0034 1 1866 ln l a 0 5739 l b 2 2283 ln l a 2 2 9108 l n l a l b 0 3208 l b 2 0 3208 l b 2 esd shape correction factor for lift moment c a m is 6 c a m l a l b 0 9136 2 8597 ln l a 1 7631 l b 3 2637 ln l a 2 4 8482 l n l a l b 1 8007 l a 2 here the shape parameters are normalized below l a l a l a r e f l b l b l b r e f 0 9 l a 1 4 0 9 l b 1 4 conclusively the simplified formulas including the esd shape correction factor have the following forms lift moment m l v v p v c a m l a l b 3 4 inclusion of the effect of ship speed for an investigation of the effect of ship speed variation a series of cfd analysis is conducted for different ship speeds in actual exact inlet speed at the right front of esd can be a more directly related parameter to the lift force and moment than ship speed however the inlet speed can be computed by only cfd analysis and the objective of the simplified formula is to predict the lift force and moment without any time consuming simulation thus ship speed is adopted instead of the inlet speed nonetheless a strong correlation between inlet speed and ship speed needs to be identified first to observe the relationship between inlet speed and ship speed ten head sea cases are selected among the 58 head sea data such that the ship speed effect are examined across the entire range of vertical velocity of esd as depicted in fig 26 these selected ten cases can be paired to have similar vertical velocity case2 case3 case8 case10 case26 case27 case32 case37 and case53 case54 the ship speed is changed from 6 23 m s 12 knots to 9 23 m s 18 knots for each case in general 2 3 of design speed is used for a spectral fatigue analysis dnvgl 2010 this ship speed range can cover the whole range of containership cruising speed the inlet speed is measured at the front of esd as shown in fig 27 the relationships between the inlet speed and ship speed for five cases are plotted in fig 28 in fig 28 the inlet speed is normalized by the inlet speed at the reference ship speed v s r e f 8 23 m s the relationships between inlet speed and ship speed are found to have a linear form but the slops are different depending on the vertical velocity and the vertical velocity period however the effect of vertical velocity and vertical velocity period are already included in the 2nd order regression formulas f l v v p v m l v v p v thus the inlet speed can be replaced by ship speed hereafter the ship speed is used in simplified formula instead of inlet speed to get a relationship between ship speeds and lift force only ship speed is varied while keeping vertical velocity and vertical velocity period the same in the cfd analysis thus seven head sea cases which satisfy this constraint are selected among the ten head sea cases in fig 26 for each case cfd analysis is performed at different ship speeds i e 6 23 m s 7 23 m s 8 23 m s 9 23 m s the results for seven cases are plotted in figs 29 and 30 shows linear regression results between ship speed and lift force for each case these regression lines proves that the relationship between ship speed and lift force can be assumed to be linear based on this findings the effect of ship speed can be included in equations 5 and 6 as follows lift force f l v v p v c a f l a l b v s v s r e f for 6 23 m s v s 8 23 m s lift moment m l v v p v c a m l a l b v s v s r e f for 6 23 m s v s 8 23 m s 3 5 verification of simplified formula the simplified formula can be verified for specific configurations within the ranges of sample points among total 24 cases generated from three esd configurations two ship speeds and four pairs of wave height and wave period cfd analysis is performed for arbitrary 12 cases table 7 in order to increase the reliability of the verification each variable is selected evenly within the range of the variable heading angle is fixed as 180 in cfd analysis in this case the vertical velocity and vertical velocity period to be used as inputs to the simplified formula are measured from the cfd simulation however in a general application they can be obtained from a hydrodynamic motion analysis that is the vertical velocity can be obtained from rao and the period from the encounter frequency the results obtained from the cfd analysis and simplified formula for the 12 cases are compared in figs 31 and 32 respectively from these figures it is identified that the resultant lifting force and moment are evenly distributed over the entire range the average difference of lift force between the cfd analysis and simplified formula is 10 82 and that of lifting moment 8 16 these errors are acceptable since the errors of the original formulas before multiplying correction factor compared with cfd analysis i e eq 1 and eq 2 are 9 64 and 10 29 summarized in table 6 4 level i and level ii method for ultimate limit strength assessment and fatigue limit strength assessment in fig 1 the procedure of ultimate limit strength assessment and the fatigue limit strength assessment using cfd analysis and neural network are explained this procedure is named level iii method in this paper even if this approach is the most reliable in terms of accuracy its huge computational time makes it hard to be used at the early design stage in this respect this research proposes level ii and level i methods that can reduce the computational burden and simplify the implicational process with an acceptable level of accuracy deterioration overall procedures of level ii and level i are explained in figs 33 and 34 respectively in level ii method the neural network trained for cfd analysis results is replaced by the simplified formula which can be represented as an explicit form other processes for the calculation of long term extreme value and fatigue damage using rainflow counting methods are kept the same as level iii method since the accuracy of the regression formula was proved to be nearly the same as the neural network the calculation results are expected to be similar to level iii method level i method adopts a simplified method to generate long term distributions of lift force and stress range while they are directly obtained from the respective time series in level iii and level ii methods on the other hand level i method is based on an assumption that a lift force of specific exceedance probability occurs at a vertical velocity of the same exceedance probability it is based on the linear relationship between the lift force and the vertical velocity however some nonlinearity is observed in high vertical velocity zone as identified in fig 12 the accuracy reduction is unavoidable a set of vertical velocities values for specific exceedance probabilities e g 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 8 are calculated from a long term analysis using the vertical velocity spectrums for a given wave scatter diagram they are plotted in fig 35 then the corresponding lift forces and lift moments are calculated using the simplified formula and they are assumed to have the same exceedance probability as the corresponding vertical velocity the long term data obtained in this way is named a simplified long term distribution hereafter the simplified long term distribution of lift force can be transformed to that of hotspot stress range using the pre determined stress factors i e stress responses under unit force then weibull shape parameter h is calculated by fitting the simplified long term distribution of stress range to weibull distribution a simplified fatigue analysis can be performed using the simplified long term distribution and weibull shape parameter in this research the analysis is carried out in accordance with dnv cn 30 7 dnvgl 2010 this simplified fatigue analysis requires just a part of long term analysis for vertical velocity using a spectral approach while level ii and level iii the computational burden of level i method is negligible since it doesn t require a generation of time series of vertical velocity for all sea states in a wave scatter diagram like level ii and level iii a simplified long term distribution of lift force of level i method is plotted in fig 36 this distribution can be compared with the cfd analysis results table 5 used for a training of neural network in level iii method the exceedance probability of each of lift forces from cfd analysis is assumed to be the same as the corresponding vertical velocity which is evaluated by a linear interpolation using the regression curve of fig 35 this is one of the reasons of level i method together with the assumption that the exceedance probability of lift force follows the corresponding vertical velocity the predicted extreme lift force values of 10 8 exceedance probability and fatigue damage ratio values using level iii level ii level i methods are listed in table 8 in this calculation the esd blade root length l a r e f esd blade span length l b r e f and ship speed v s r e f are fixed as 1 8 m 3 6 m 8 23 m s respectively the world wide wave scatter data and pm wave spectrum are used the level i method gives the most conservative results for both extreme lift force the difference of extreme lift force between level i and level ii is about 35 and nearly the same with level iii in case of fatigue damage 20 years of lift time and stress range of 10 4 level is used with dnv cn30 7 s n curve i dnvgl 2010 level i method uses a simplified fatigue analysis method but level ii and level iii the rainflow counting method is used for time histories generated for all sea states in the world wide scatter diagram the fatigue damage of level i is considerably larger than other methods this is because the fatigue damage ratio is very sensitive to long term distribution of stress range if comparing the long term distributions of stress range of three methods as shown in fig 37 the curve of level i is above the other two curves on the whole 5 conclusion for simplified methods such as level i and level ii method simplified formula needs to be developed to replace cfd analysis and neural network training the simplified formulas cover six variables heading angle vertical velocity of esd vertical velocity period of esd esd blade root length esd blade span length and ship speed to predict lift force and lift moment through a regression analysis and parametric study first in order to judge the heading angle effect various kinds of cfd analysis are performed from the head sea to beam sea for heading angle except the head sea condition the ship loses stability over certain vertical velocity this limiting vertical velocity is calculated by using pattern recognition neural network and it is utilized to decide the operation condition is possible or not under a specific heading angle when the influence of heading angle is taken into account slightly smaller results are obtained because the difference between considering heading angle and considering only head sea condition is slight and the fact that to consider heading angle procedure is needed several neural network training the heading angle effect is ignored in simplified formula for simplicity and next total 58 head sea data is used to construct 2nd order polynomial regression formula in terms of vertical velocity and period of esd the vertical velocity and vertical velocity can be calculated simultaneously in cfd analysis so that the joint consideration of these two variables is available the 58 head sea data cover the wide range of vertical velocity and vertical velocity period this feature can prevent the data distortion of regression analysis in specific region additional cases which have zero vertical velocity are added as a sample points for accurate prediction for small lift force zone then a series of additional cfd analysis is performed to investigate the relation between esd shapes and lift force two lengths root length and span length which have direct relation with vertically projected area of esd are chosen to reflect the esd area effect inlet speed can be converted to ship speed because they are found to have linear relation a series of another additional cfd analysis is performed to examine the relation between ship speeds and lift force based on the two parametric studies the regression formulas are modified this modified regression formulas are applied in level i and level ii level ii method uses the simplified formulas to convert time series of vertical velocity to lift force and lift moment uls and fls procedures are the same as level iii procedure the neural network training with cfd analysis is not needed in level ii method on the other hand level i method adopts a simplified long term distribution method and the regression formulas as well there is no need for time series of vertical velocity long term analysis and rain flow counting from the simplified long term distribution weibull shape parameter can be calculated and fatigue damage can be calculated using a simplified fatigue analysis method selected techniques for each method are summarized in table 9 respectively the most time consuming part of the level iii method is neural network training with cfd analysis the generation of time series of vertical velocity for each sea state through ifft and rainflow counting for fls also take a lot of time in terms of time requirements level ii and level i are significantly more efficient than level iii moreover in level i the results of uls and fls can be found immediately after motion analysis and long term analysis of vertical velocity however since level i result is more conservative value than other methods it is expected to be used at early design stage for rough estimation level i method can be used for ultimate strength assessment and fatigue strength assessment without any cfd analysis or rain flow counting process from adopting the simplified formula and simplified fatigue analysis as a result time consumption to evaluate a structural safety of an esd drastically decrease in simplified method even though the simplified method gives a little conservative result than the original procedure composed of cfd analysis and neural network training it is well worth using in early design stage in terms of time requirements acknowledgements the present research is a

23666,as the demand of environmental restriction and cost reduction increases a fin typed structure attached around a propeller has been developed to reduce fuel consumption rate of a vessel by improving the thrust force some cracks have been reported in the vicinity of the root of the fin i e the welded line between esd and hull structure which is caused by the fluctuating hydrodynamic force induced by the ship motion as a method of fatigue strength assessment for ship structure the spectral approach has been widely utilized based on the hydrodynamic loads calculated using the potential theory however the nonlinear vertical lift force caused by the vertical motion of the esd cannot be properly considered in the spectral approach to take into account the nonlinear effect computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis was adopted for the assessment of hydrodynamic force and the results were approximated by an artificial neural network lee et al 2016 then a time series of vertical velocity of energy saving device under irregular wave is converted to time series of lift force and lift moment using the trained neural networks however in the previous research ship speed heading angle and esd shape were fixed and their variations could not be reflected in the safety assessment the proposed neural network is a useful method but it cannot be directly applied to an actual project due to the absence of information about the artificial neural network itself this research aims at developing simplified formulas to predict lift force and lift moment instead of the neural network and covering heading angle esd shape and ship speed additionally to investigate the effects of additional variables a series of cfd analysis is performed and polynomial regression models are employed to examine their relationship with the life force and moment the established simplified formulas are used for the generation of a time series of lift force and lift moment required in ultimate and fatigue strength assessments the rainflow counting method is used for the calculation of fatigue damage and the resultant long term distribution is compared with a simplified long term distribution method the proposed formulas are expected to be used for the same type of esd with different configuration and ship speed without any further time consuming cfd analysis keywords energy saving devices ultimate limit strength fatigue limit strength cfd analysis simplified formula 1 introduction due to the growing interest about environmental problem the demand of the reduction of fuel oil consumption is greater than ever before various types of energy saving devices esd have been developed abs 2013 hooijmans et al 2010 among esds a series of fin typed esd attached around a propeller has been proposed lee et al 1992 while most researches are focused on the evaluation of energy saving performance of esd celik and guner 2007 kim et al 2015 few have studied on the structural safety assessment the conventional spectral method was used for a calculation of extreme design load and fatigue analysis for esd woo et al 2013 presented strength and fatigue assessments of duct type esd using a linear transfer function however it can t reflect the nonlinearity of induced hydrodynamic force in order to accurately consider the nonlinearity of the hydrodynamic force acting on esd cfd analysis has been used up to now many studies focused on the calculation of lift force and drag force performance of a hydrofoil under steady state flow using cfd analysis 2d cfd analysis was used to compute the lift coefficient and drag coefficient hutchison et al 2010 kinnas et al 2012 the 3d effect was estimated by comparing the 2d and 3d cfd analysis results nowruzi et al 2017 spentoz et al 2004 however in case of esd hydrofoils are attached on hull structure and the effect of hull form is necessary to be taken into account in the calculation of the hydrodynamic force of vertically oscillating hydrofoils in addition to the 3d effect of esd itself the hydrodynamic force on esd is found to be affected not only by the three dimensional shape of esd but also by the ship hull lee and jang 2014 therefore a 3d cfd analysis for entire hull should be performed to obtain the hydrodynamic forces acting on esd in an extreme environmental condition a large ship motion particularly heave and pitch motion can induce large nonlinear lift force and lift moment on esd therefore some cracks at the root of hydrofoil type device have been reported continuously as an effort of safety assessment of esd lee et al 2016 proposed a new procedure taking into account the nonlinearity of hydrodynamic loads this procedure which is called as level iii method consists of four main parts as shown in fig 1 a sea keeping analysis part i a cfd analysis and an artificial neural network training part ii a long term analysis and an ultimate strength assessment part iii and a fatigue strength assessment using rain flow counting method part iv the artificial neural network explained in this procedure is trained for cfd results for a specific shape of esd and one ship speed for a different esd configuration and different ship speeds a series of cfd analysis should be newly carried out and a new neural network model needs to be constructed in order for a neural network to include the additional shape parameters and the ship speed the number of cfd simulations required for generating sampling points drastically increases due to the increased dimension of input variables for this reason it is necessary to establish an efficient way to cover those additional variables moreover an explicit formula to predict the lifting force and moment would be preferred to the neural network for a direct use in a real project this research aims at providing simplified formulas to predict lift force and lift moment acting on esd instead of the neural network to be trained for cfd analysis results the effect of each additional parameter is reflected into its respective adjustment factor based on the assumption that the coupling effect with other variables are not significant a few steps to derive the simplified formula are described in section 2 and section 3 this simplified formula can be used for the generation of a time series data of lift force and lift moment required in ultimate limit strength assessment uls and fatigue limit strength assessment fls instead of the artificial neural network proposed by lee et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 this method is named level ii method and the artificial neural network in level iii method is replaced by the proposed simplified formula furthermore this research also suggests a level i method that can be used for uls and fls based on a simplified long term distribution generated using the proposed simplified formula it doesn t require to generate times series of lift force and moment for all sea states in the wave scatter diagram therefore level i method can be regarded as the simplest method even if its accuracy deteriorates compared to level ii and leve iii methods the detailed explanation about level ii and level i methods are explained in section 4 2 an overall approach to derive a simplified formula all variables affecting the lift force and moment need to be included in a simplified formula however the number of required sample points drastically increases with the number of considered variables the dimension of design space can be reduced by assuming some parameters constant the slope angle of esd blade is set zero in a conservative way because its vertically projected area becomes the largest at zero slop angle the following six variables are expected to have substantial influence on the lifting force and moment heading angle h a degree vertical velocity of esd v v m s vertical velocity period of esd p v sec esd blade root length l a m esd blade span length l b m ship speed v s m s here the v v indicates the vertical velocity of the hull location where the esd is attached and it can be calculated by combining the heave velocity and the pitch angular velocity of the vessel two approaches for the development of simplified formulas for lifting force and moment can be assumed they are presented briefly in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively in alternative approach i fig 3 all six variables are treated together and the lift force is defined as a function of six variables through a six dimensional regression analysis it is capable of taking into account the full coupling effects of six parameters however a large number of sample points are required to achieve relatively high accuracy and this leads to considerable burden of cfd simulation in alternative approach ii fig 4 a regression formula is built first for the vertical velocity of esd v v and the vertical velocity period of esd p v here the effect of heading angle h a is excluded from the regression analysis if it is included this predicted value could be more accurate than when excluded however the computational burden of cfd simulation increases significantly further detailed discussion about the effect of heading angle is laid in subsection 3 1 their coupling effects are expected to be larger than others a series of cfd analysis is performed for various combinations of two parameter values while fixing other three parameters to their respective reference values then the constructed regression formula is adjusted by multiplying two factors that can reflect the differences of esd shape and ship speed from their reference values the factor is determined from a regression analysis for data obtained from a series of cfd analysis with varying only one variable while fixing all other variables this approach is based on the assumption that the esd shape and the ship speed are independent of other variables for example if the lifting force is proportional to ship speed at a specific vertical velocity and a vertical velocity period the proportional relationship is kept nearly the same even for other vertical velocities and vertical periods the number of sampling points is much less than the alternative approach i so that the number of cfd analyses is acceptable this research adopts alternative approach ii and the accuracy is verified through some case studies for the cfd analysis using star ccm cd adapco 2014 the same model of ship and esd of lee et al 2016 is adopted trimmed mesh consisting of about 2 1 million cells is generated over the entire solution domain 1 560 m l 660 m b 700 m d a sufficient fine mesh zone is used in the vicinity of free surface kelvin wake region ship and esd while y is kept under 40 using a prism layer the main dimensions of vessel are summarized in tables 1 and 2 and the arrangement of four hydrofoils in fig 2 3 simplified formula to calculate the lift force and lift moment 3 1 effect of heading angle the previous original procedure for structural safety assessment of an esd proposed by lee et al 2016 considers only head sea condition however ships can encounter lots of waves of different heading angles such as beam sea or quarter sea in real operating conditions therefore it is required to include different heading angles in cfd analysis to increase the accuracy of neural network training cfd analysis example under a quartering sea is illustrated in fig 5 the heading angle is chosen from head sea condition 180 to beam sea condition 90 at an interval of 30 these heading angles are combined with various values of wave height and period thus total 134 cfd simulation cases are generated for a mild sea state ship can navigate along any direction regardless of the wave incoming direction however under a harsh sea state a ship may take her course to encounter waves in head sea direction for her stable voyage similarly the cfd analysis for beam sea ship capsizes and the analysis stops due to its stability problem when such a stability problem occurs the cfd analysis diverges and the simulation stops this case is classified to a failure case all cases are examined by the cfd analysis and the results are marked in fig 6 a for heading angles of 135 and 150 the corresponding cases are plotted versus wave height and wave period there are some areas where both failure cases and success cases are mixed and it is due to the effect of different wave periods as an example a case with a fairly small wave period for a large wave height is a failed case however it can be seen from this figure that the smaller the heading angle is the more likely the cfd analysis fails at small wave height since the ship model doesn t include bilge keel the roll damping is not incorporated properly and the stability may be underestimated for these reasons it should be judged whether the ship can sail at stable condition at a specific operating condition composed of heading angle wave height and wave period before predicting lifting force and moment since it is very time consuming to determine the ship stability by cfd analysis each time this paper adopts a pattern recognition neural network mathworks 2016 it is composed of three input nodes 10 hidden nodes and 1 output node as depicted in fig 7 table 3 lists 134 sample points obtained from cfd analysis the points are classified into success cases 105 cases and failure cases 29 cases and used for training the pattern recognition neural network two neural networks are trained the first model is trained for voyage conditions defined by heading angle wave height and wave period and the other model for resultant vertical speed at vertical velocity and vertical velocity period the vertical velocity period is the same as the encounter period calculated for a given heading angle two trained pattern recognition neural networks are used to judge the ship stability if judged un stable the heading angle is assumed to be changed to head sea and the lifting force and moment are calculated for the head sea for a certain wave period and heading angle the maximum wave height to ensure the stability can be found by running the model 1 neural network with increasing the wave height this resultant limiting wave height is visualized in a quadrant diagram as depicted in fig 8 gunther et al 2003 from this diagram it can be identified that the limiting wave height decreases from head sea to beam sea in this study a time series of vertical velocity is converted to two time series of lift force and moment a set of vertical velocity and vertical velocity period values are extracted from each cycle of the time series of vertical velocity and the values are used as input to a model to predict the lift force and lift moment imposed on esd therefore model 2 neural network is required for a judge of stability while model 1 neural network is hard to apply since it is trained for wave height and wave frequency for a given vertical velocity period and heading angle the limiting vertical velocity can be computed from the same method as the limiting wave height using model 2 pattern recognition neural network the obtained limiting vertical velocity is plotted in a quadrant diagram as depicted in fig 9 the limiting vertical velocity values decrease gradually as the heading angles goes from head sea to beam sea overall tendency is similar to fig 8 since the vertical velocity is proportional to wave height but the rate differs depending on the period and it can be determined from a vertical velocity rao in addition it can be observed that the limiting vertical velocity increases as the vertical velocity period decreases this is due to the similar tendency of the ship motion and the vertical velocity that they become smaller in the lower period overall procedure to predict lifting force and moment for given vertical velocity vertical velocity period and heading angle is shown in fig 10 first besides the two pattern recognition model mentioned in fig 7 two general neural network models are trained to predict lifting force and moment the input nodes are heading angle vertical velocity and vertical velocity period and the output node is lifting force and moment respectively among the 134 data listed in table 3 105 success cases are used for their training these neural networks are used to convert irregular time series of vertical velocity to two time series of lifting force and moment respectively the slop of vertical velocity is continuously traced along the time series of the vertical velocity vertical velocity value is determined from a peak point of zero slope and a zero crossing period from two sequent zero crossing points some difference may be incurred since all neural network are trained for cfd results under regular wave however the ship response subject to regular wave was found to be more severe than irregular wave lee et al 2016 and it is hard to reflect the wave irregularity into the training of artificial neural networks therefore from a conservative point of view the neural network results obtained from regular wave are used to judge the stability and to predict lifting force and moment as well if the given operating condition is judged to be stable for a specific heading angle lifting force and moment corresponding to the heading angle are calculated from the neural networks on the other hand if unstable heading angle is changed to 180 and the lift force and moment are calculated for head sea condition ultimately the long term extreme values of lift force and lift moment obtained considering only head sea condition and considering various heading angles are summarized in table 4 the extreme value is determined by taking into account the occurrence frequency of all sea states bishop and price 1979 in this research the world wide wave scatter data is used and the time domain analysis for 3 h are repeated 20 times in order to reflect the randomness the 20 maximums are collected and gumbel distribution is used to fit the data after constructing the gumbel distributions in all sea states the long term value of lift force and lift moment is obtained from the exceedance probability of 3 h maximum value q x 3 h x haver and winterstein 2008 the exceedance probability of 3 h maximum value can be calculated by using this formulation q x 3 h x 1 d e s i g n l i f e 365 d a y s 24 h o u r s 3 h o u r s q x 3 h x 1 f x 3 h x 0 0 1 f x 3 h h s t p x h t f h s t p h t d t d h q x 3 h x e x c e e d a n c e p r o b a b i l i t y o f 3 h

considering only head sea condition is conservative than considering heading angle this means that the lift force generated from the head sea to the beam sea gradually decreases in the same vertical velocity and vertical velocity period to confirm this the lift force calculated from the neural network obtained for each heading angle is shown in fig 11 from fig 11 it can be demonstrated that the smaller the heading angle the smaller the lift force in addition as the heading angle becomes smaller only the results according to a small vertical velocity appear this is due to the limiting vertical velocity obtained from the pattern recognition neural network although the results are more accurate when the heading angle is considered the difference is not sufficiently large and considering only head sea condition is much simple for this reason heading angle effect is ignored and heading angle is fixed as 180 in simplified formula 3 2 regression analysis with vertical velocity of esd and vertical velocity period of esd the regression analysis is conducted for vertical velocity of esd and vertical velocity period of esd by using the 58 head sea data and 15 additional points the additional data is intended for a prediction of zero lift force and moment for zero vertical velocity regardless of period values the zero vertical velocity means that there is no vertical motion of the vessel stern where the esd is located so the corresponding lift force and the lift moment acting on the esd are also zero the vertical force is kept zero while varying the vertical velocity period from 2 5 sec to 20 sec at interval of 1 25 sec v v p v 0 2 5 0 3 75 0 5 0 20 in fact it is meaningless to define the period of vertical velocity for the zero velocity however it is intended to reflect it to the regression model that the lift force and moment converges to zero as the vertical velocity goes to zero regardless of different periods it is an essential condition that should be satisfied by regression model but those points cannot be obtained from the cfd simulation even they are intentionally added in the case of small lift force it may not be critical in the extreme analysis but it is not negligible in fatigue analysis however fatigue damage accumulated by the small stress range is not ignorable because the number of occurrence increases as the stress range becomes smaller moreover the occurrence probability of mild sea states in a wave scatter diagram is much higher than that of harsh sea states therefore an accurate prediction for small lift force zone is also important especially the condition of zero lift force for zero vertical velocity should be satisfied by the regression model but its exact satisfaction is not easy due to insufficient data for zero vertical velocity this can be compensated by intentional addition of sample data 58 head sea cases among the total 134 cfd analysis results are listed in table 5 these 58 sample points are designed to cover the wide ranges of vertical velocity and vertical velocity period this feature prevents data distortion in certain region when creating the regression formula the distribution of head sea data are plotted in fig 26 the correlation between vertical velocity of esd and lift force is depicted in fig 12 the relationship for low vertical velocity is likely linear however the nonlinearity increase as the vertical velocity goes beyond 8 m s this nonlinear region is critical for an exact prediction of extreme value of lift force and moment this research adopts a 2nd order polynomial to fit the lift force data as identified in fig 13 the correlation between the lift force and lift moment is nearly linear the ratio of the lift force to the lift moment is constant as 1 76 this is enabled by the uniform pressure distribution on the esd horizontal surface since the lift moment is measured from the esd root uniform pressure distribution means that the moment arm is constant in practice the ratio of 1 76 m is almost the half of the esd span length shown in fig 20 which is the moment arm when a uniform pressure distribution is applied to the esd surface as an example fig 14 shows pressure distribution for 18 m of wave height and 16 s of wave period the pressure variation along the span length is negligible therefore the same 2nd order polynomial regression is also used for the lift moment in this step the esd blade root length the esd blade span length and the ship speed are fixed as reference values l a r e f 1 8 m l b r e f 3 6 m v s r e f 8 23 m s respectively the lift force and lift moment regression formulas obtained from the regression analysis are as follows 1 lift force f l v v p v 1 376 10 4 1552 p v 3 9613 10 4 v v 69 p v 2 453 p v v v 752 v v 2 2 lift moment m l v v p v 0 416 10 5 4290 p v 1 003 10 5 v v 230 p v 2 930 p v v v 1350 v v 2 the coefficient of vertical velocity term is much larger than that of vertical velocity period term this implies that the vertical velocity is a dominant factor to the lift force and lift moment in addition the coefficient of first order term is much larger than that of second order term this is because the relationship between vertical velocity and the lift force is close to linear below 8 m s of vertical velocity as shown in fig 12 the lift force and moment predicted using the above equations approaches zero as the vertical velocity becomes zero but are not perfect zero at the zero velocity in spite of the 15 additional sample data of zero velocities the constant term and the first and second order terms of vertical velocity period are the reason of the nonzero lift force the inappropriate fitting is adjusted such that the formula is a linear function of the vertical velocity v v with zero y intercept i e lift force or moment c v v for v v 0 75 m s here the coefficient c should be a function of the vertical velocity period p v in order for the formula to be continuous with the original formula at v v 0 75 m s when v v 0 75 m s the original formula of lift force becomes as follows lift force 3 647 10 4 1892 p v 69 p v 2 at v v 0 75 m s therefore the original formula is adjusted to the following two formula using the above formula 3 lift force 1 376 10 4 1552 p v 3 9613 10 4 v v 69 p v 2 453 p v v v 752 v v 2 for v v 0 75 m s 3 647 10 4 1892 p v 69 p v 2 v v 0 75 5 852 10 4 2522 p v 92 p v 2 v v for v v 0 75 m s in the same manner the lift moment can be modified as follows 4 lift moment 0 416 10 5 4290 p v 1 003 10 5 v v 230 p v 2 930 p v v v 1350 v v 2 for v v 0 75 1 5475 10 5 6650 p v 306 7 p v 2 v v for v v 0 75 fig 15 illustrates two examples of corrections of two formula for p v 10 s two adjusted curves have continuity at v v 0 75 m s the effect of the adjustment can be explained as follows the lift force and moment need to be converted to hotspot stress at the root of the energy saving fin for a fatigue analysis the conversion is made by multiplying stress effect factor to lifting force the factor depends on the distance from the root since the moment at the root differs the distance corresponds to moment arm that is the ratio of lifting moment to lifting force thus a set of stress responses subject to unit force at different locations should be calculated in advance as illustrated in fig 16 a lee et al 2016 the stress effect factor is proportional to the ratio of the lifting moment to lifting force i e moment arm as shown in fig 16 b however because the lifting force approaches closer to zero than the lifting moment as identified in fig 15 the ratio becomes drastically increases as the vertical velocity goes to zero this makes the stress effect factor abnormally large and the resultant hotspot stress at the root of esd blade becomes larger than the actual value even if this fitting error seems to be small but it makes the probabilistic distribution of lift force for the entire sea states in the wave scatter diagram having two peaks as depicted in fig 17 original formula this abnormal distribution at the low lift force can lead to the increase of fatigue damage since the occurrence frequency of low lift force is much larger than that of high lift force these inappropriate distribution can be corrected by adjusting the fitting curves the lifting force and moments are adjusted such that the lines pass zero values at zero vertical velocity this reduces the moment arm as shown in fig 18 consequently the resultant probabilistic distribution changes to a reasonable shape in fig 17 adjusted formula the accuracy of the regression formula can be verified by comparing the formulas with cfd results fig 19 plots the comparison results the effects of esd shape and ship speed are excluded here and only those of vertical velocity and vertical velocity period are examined the maximum difference between the regression formula and cfd results is less than about 20 the average errors of lift force and lift moment compared to cfd results and neural network results are 8 30 and 7 39 respectively here the neural network employed by lee et al 2016 is also trained for the same sample data used for regression formula the average errors between cfd results and 2nd order polynomial regression formulas are 9 64 and 10 29 respectively these results are summarized in table 6 the prediction results of 2nd order polynomial regression are slightly less accurate than the neural network results however it is more convenient to use due to its explicit expression in a formula in the proposed simplified method to be explained later the 2nd order polynomial regression formulas are adopted for the prediction of lift force and lift moment in place of cfd analysis and neural network 3 3 inclusion of the effect of esd shape to consider the effect of esd shape two parameters esd blade root length l a and esd blade span length l b can be taken into account fig 20 the governing factor to the lift force may be the vertically projected area of esd the area is determined by these two parameters in order to investigate the influence of different esd shape on the lift force and moment cfd analysis is performed by varying two parameters the blade root length is changed from 1 59 m to 2 47 m and the blade span length from 3 10 m to 4 88 m the variation covers the range from 90 to 140 of the original values total 16 cases are simulated under the same wave height 12 m wave period 14 s and ship speed 8 23 m s the vertical velocity and vertical velocity period resulted from the cfd simulation are found the same for all cases this means the influence of shape change on the ship motion is negligible it facilitates focusing on the effect of esd shape these cfd analysis results for the 16 different esd shapes are used to determine esd shape correction factor which is multiplied to equations 3 and 4 to reflect the influence from the reference shape the plots of lift force and lift moments are depicted in figs 21 24 in the plots the esd blade root length and the esd blade span length are normalized to reference values l a r e f 1 8 m and l b r e f 3 6 m respectively the normalizations of lift force and lift moment are also made to the reference lift force and moment at the reference shape defined by l a r e f and l b r e f the esd blade root length and span length have different tendency a 2nd order polynomial function is adopted for a data fitting for a logarithmic scale of l a and l b itself the use of logarithmic scale for l a is found to give slightly higher accuracy than l a itself as in regression analysis of these two methods the error with the cfd result is approximately 6 and 6 6 respectively which is acceptable level ultimately the correction factor to take into account the effect of the esd shape is defined below a comparison of the results multiplied by the esd shape correction factor and the cfd results are plotted in fig 25 however since the regression analysis selects a quadratic form instead of a linear form a peak point exists therefore the equations are not valid if it deviates greatly from the range of fitting data esd shape correction factor for lift force c a f is 5 c a f l a l b 0 0034 1 1866 ln l a 0 5739 l b 2 2283 ln l a 2 2 9108 l n l a l b 0 3208 l b 2 0 3208 l b 2 esd shape correction factor for lift moment c a m is 6 c a m l a l b 0 9136 2 8597 ln l a 1 7631 l b 3 2637 ln l a 2 4 8482 l n l a l b 1 8007 l a 2 here the shape parameters are normalized below l a l a l a r e f l b l b l b r e f 0 9 l a 1 4 0 9 l b 1 4 conclusively the simplified formulas including the esd shape correction factor have the following forms lift moment m l v v p v c a m l a l b 3 4 inclusion of the effect of ship speed for an investigation of the effect of ship speed variation a series of cfd analysis is conducted for different ship speeds in actual exact inlet speed at the right front of esd can be a more directly related parameter to the lift force and moment than ship speed however the inlet speed can be computed by only cfd analysis and the objective of the simplified formula is to predict the lift force and moment without any time consuming simulation thus ship speed is adopted instead of the inlet speed nonetheless a strong correlation between inlet speed and ship speed needs to be identified first to observe the relationship between inlet speed and ship speed ten head sea cases are selected among the 58 head sea data such that the ship speed effect are examined across the entire range of vertical velocity of esd as depicted in fig 26 these selected ten cases can be paired to have similar vertical velocity case2 case3 case8 case10 case26 case27 case32 case37 and case53 case54 the ship speed is changed from 6 23 m s 12 knots to 9 23 m s 18 knots for each case in general 2 3 of design speed is used for a spectral fatigue analysis dnvgl 2010 this ship speed range can cover the whole range of containership cruising speed the inlet speed is measured at the front of esd as shown in fig 27 the relationships between the inlet speed and ship speed for five cases are plotted in fig 28 in fig 28 the inlet speed is normalized by the inlet speed at the reference ship speed v s r e f 8 23 m s the relationships between inlet speed and ship speed are found to have a linear form but the slops are different depending on the vertical velocity and the vertical velocity period however the effect of vertical velocity and vertical velocity period are already included in the 2nd order regression formulas f l v v p v m l v v p v thus the inlet speed can be replaced by ship speed hereafter the ship speed is used in simplified formula instead of inlet speed to get a relationship between ship speeds and lift force only ship speed is varied while keeping vertical velocity and vertical velocity period the same in the cfd analysis thus seven head sea cases which satisfy this constraint are selected among the ten head sea cases in fig 26 for each case cfd analysis is performed at different ship speeds i e 6 23 m s 7 23 m s 8 23 m s 9 23 m s the results for seven cases are plotted in figs 29 and 30 shows linear regression results between ship speed and lift force for each case these regression lines proves that the relationship between ship speed and lift force can be assumed to be linear based on this findings the effect of ship speed can be included in equations 5 and 6 as follows lift force f l v v p v c a f l a l b v s v s r e f for 6 23 m s v s 8 23 m s lift moment m l v v p v c a m l a l b v s v s r e f for 6 23 m s v s 8 23 m s 3 5 verification of simplified formula the simplified formula can be verified for specific configurations within the ranges of sample points among total 24 cases generated from three esd configurations two ship speeds and four pairs of wave height and wave period cfd analysis is performed for arbitrary 12 cases table 7 in order to increase the reliability of the verification each variable is selected evenly within the range of the variable heading angle is fixed as 180 in cfd analysis in this case the vertical velocity and vertical velocity period to be used as inputs to the simplified formula are measured from the cfd simulation however in a general application they can be obtained from a hydrodynamic motion analysis that is the vertical velocity can be obtained from rao and the period from the encounter frequency the results obtained from the cfd analysis and simplified formula for the 12 cases are compared in figs 31 and 32 respectively from these figures it is identified that the resultant lifting force and moment are evenly distributed over the entire range the average difference of lift force between the cfd analysis and simplified formula is 10 82 and that of lifting moment 8 16 these errors are acceptable since the errors of the original formulas before multiplying correction factor compared with cfd analysis i e eq 1 and eq 2 are 9 64 and 10 29 summarized in table 6 4 level i and level ii method for ultimate limit strength assessment and fatigue limit strength assessment in fig 1 the procedure of ultimate limit strength assessment and the fatigue limit strength assessment using cfd analysis and neural network are explained this procedure is named level iii method in this paper even if this approach is the most reliable in terms of accuracy its huge computational time makes it hard to be used at the early design stage in this respect this research proposes level ii and level i methods that can reduce the computational burden and simplify the implicational process with an acceptable level of accuracy deterioration overall procedures of level ii and level i are explained in figs 33 and 34 respectively in level ii method the neural network trained for cfd analysis results is replaced by the simplified formula which can be represented as an explicit form other processes for the calculation of long term extreme value and fatigue damage using rainflow counting methods are kept the same as level iii method since the accuracy of the regression formula was proved to be nearly the same as the neural network the calculation results are expected to be similar to level iii method level i method adopts a simplified method to generate long term distributions of lift force and stress range while they are directly obtained from the respective time series in level iii and level ii methods on the other hand level i method is based on an assumption that a lift force of specific exceedance probability occurs at a vertical velocity of the same exceedance probability it is based on the linear relationship between the lift force and the vertical velocity however some nonlinearity is observed in high vertical velocity zone as identified in fig 12 the accuracy reduction is unavoidable a set of vertical velocities values for specific exceedance probabilities e g 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 8 are calculated from a long term analysis using the vertical velocity spectrums for a given wave scatter diagram they are plotted in fig 35 then the corresponding lift forces and lift moments are calculated using the simplified formula and they are assumed to have the same exceedance probability as the corresponding vertical velocity the long term data obtained in this way is named a simplified long term distribution hereafter the simplified long term distribution of lift force can be transformed to that of hotspot stress range using the pre determined stress factors i e stress responses under unit force then weibull shape parameter h is calculated by fitting the simplified long term distribution of stress range to weibull distribution a simplified fatigue analysis can be performed using the simplified long term distribution and weibull shape parameter in this research the analysis is carried out in accordance with dnv cn 30 7 dnvgl 2010 this simplified fatigue analysis requires just a part of long term analysis for vertical velocity using a spectral approach while level ii and level iii the computational burden of level i method is negligible since it doesn t require a generation of time series of vertical velocity for all sea states in a wave scatter diagram like level ii and level iii a simplified long term distribution of lift force of level i method is plotted in fig 36 this distribution can be compared with the cfd analysis results table 5 used for a training of neural network in level iii method the exceedance probability of each of lift forces from cfd analysis is assumed to be the same as the corresponding vertical velocity which is evaluated by a linear interpolation using the regression curve of fig 35 this is one of the reasons of level i method together with the assumption that the exceedance probability of lift force follows the corresponding vertical velocity the predicted extreme lift force values of 10 8 exceedance probability and fatigue damage ratio values using level iii level ii level i methods are listed in table 8 in this calculation the esd blade root length l a r e f esd blade span length l b r e f and ship speed v s r e f are fixed as 1 8 m 3 6 m 8 23 m s respectively the world wide wave scatter data and pm wave spectrum are used the level i method gives the most conservative results for both extreme lift force the difference of extreme lift force between level i and level ii is about 35 and nearly the same with level iii in case of fatigue damage 20 years of lift time and stress range of 10 4 level is used with dnv cn30 7 s n curve i dnvgl 2010 level i method uses a simplified fatigue analysis method but level ii and level iii the rainflow counting method is used for time histories generated for all sea states in the world wide scatter diagram the fatigue damage of level i is considerably larger than other methods this is because the fatigue damage ratio is very sensitive to long term distribution of stress range if comparing the long term distributions of stress range of three methods as shown in fig 37 the curve of level i is above the other two curves on the whole 5 conclusion for simplified methods such as level i and level ii method simplified formula needs to be developed to replace cfd analysis and neural network training the simplified formulas cover six variables heading angle vertical velocity of esd vertical velocity period of esd esd blade root length esd blade span length and ship speed to predict lift force and lift moment through a regression analysis and parametric study first in order to judge the heading angle effect various kinds of cfd analysis are performed from the head sea to beam sea for heading angle except the head sea condition the ship loses stability over certain vertical velocity this limiting vertical velocity is calculated by using pattern recognition neural network and it is utilized to decide the operation condition is possible or not under a specific heading angle when the influence of heading angle is taken into account slightly smaller results are obtained because the difference between considering heading angle and considering only head sea condition is slight and the fact that to consider heading angle procedure is needed several neural network training the heading angle effect is ignored in simplified formula for simplicity and next total 58 head sea data is used to construct 2nd order polynomial regression formula in terms of vertical velocity and period of esd the vertical velocity and vertical velocity can be calculated simultaneously in cfd analysis so that the joint consideration of these two variables is available the 58 head sea data cover the wide range of vertical velocity and vertical velocity period this feature can prevent the data distortion of regression analysis in specific region additional cases which have zero vertical velocity are added as a sample points for accurate prediction for small lift force zone then a series of additional cfd analysis is performed to investigate the relation between esd shapes and lift force two lengths root length and span length which have direct relation with vertically projected area of esd are chosen to reflect the esd area effect inlet speed can be converted to ship speed because they are found to have linear relation a series of another additional cfd analysis is performed to examine the relation between ship speeds and lift force based on the two parametric studies the regression formulas are modified this modified regression formulas are applied in level i and level ii level ii method uses the simplified formulas to convert time series of vertical velocity to lift force and lift moment uls and fls procedures are the same as level iii procedure the neural network training with cfd analysis is not needed in level ii method on the other hand level i method adopts a simplified long term distribution method and the regression formulas as well there is no need for time series of vertical velocity long term analysis and rain flow counting from the simplified long term distribution weibull shape parameter can be calculated and fatigue damage can be calculated using a simplified fatigue analysis method selected techniques for each method are summarized in table 9 respectively the most time consuming part of the level iii method is neural network training with cfd analysis the generation of time series of vertical velocity for each sea state through ifft and rainflow counting for fls also take a lot of time in terms of time requirements level ii and level i are significantly more efficient than level iii moreover in level i the results of uls and fls can be found immediately after motion analysis and long term analysis of vertical velocity however since level i result is more conservative value than other methods it is expected to be used at early design stage for rough estimation level i method can be used for ultimate strength assessment and fatigue strength assessment without any cfd analysis or rain flow counting process from adopting the simplified formula and simplified fatigue analysis as a result time consumption to evaluate a structural safety of an esd drastically decrease in simplified method even though the simplified method gives a little conservative result than the original procedure composed of cfd analysis and neural network training it is well worth using in early design stage in terms of time requirements acknowledgements the present research is a

for electrical grid stabilization keywords experimental validation nonlinear and robust control sliding mode marine turbine synchronous generator 1 introduction among all renewable energies marine currents became really attractive recently due to their worldwide energetic potential which is estimated at 100 gw ben elghali 2008 marine turbines use part of marine currents in order to extract mechanical energy to produce electrical energy via synchronous generator and supplement conventional energy sources moreover marine currents are regular predictable and vary slowly this behavior is a significant advantage for marine turbines compared to other renewable energy production systems dansoko et al 2014 but their connection to electrical grid adds complexity to regulators design indeed in electricity production terminal voltage and frequency regulation are required to establish a direct connection in addition coupled renewable energy systems must be robust against electrical and mechanical perturbations in this context we need to develop a robust control taking into account nonlinear specifications of the synchronous generator and simultaneous regulation of terminal voltage

experimental validation can produce unsatisfactory results because of simplifications considered during system modeling moreover it may be impossible to achieve the experimental validation of some theoretical models due to unmeasurable variables of model very recent works toumi et al 2017 guangxing et al 2017 are also limited to numerical simulations authors of toumi et al 2017 use a classical

2014 2015a 2015b 2015c 2016 have obtained satisfactory results on pitch angle control and control strategy development for wind turbines these controls do not regulate terminal voltage and frequency simultaneously in this condition it is impossible to envisage a direct connection to electrical grid only two authors were interested in experimental validations of marine turbine system so far andreica et al 2008 ben elghali et al 2011 in paper andreica et al 2008 the authors implement a marine turbine system using permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg in this context it is impossible to regulate terminal voltage and frequency simultaneously to achieve the connection to electrical grid not direct authors use a controlled converter with two linear regulators pi these regulators are less efficient and less robust than nonlinear controller against perturbations in paper ben elghali et al 2011 the authors also experiment a marine turbine system using pmsg which can t be directly connected to the electrical grid here the authors implement a control to regulate the frequency of marine turbine system without taking into account the voltage regulation which makes impossible the connection to electrical network the main drawback of this system marine turbine using pmsg is the necessity to use an electronic power system to obtain the electrical grid connection which increases the technical complexity and economic costs compared with direct grid connection in marine environment because of technical constraints installation waterproofness of power electronic system and its replacement in fault case it is necessary to envisage the direct grid connection to achieve this objective the control development has to take into account system nonlinear specifications thus helping to avoid the stall phenomena during severe perturbations in addition none of the two authors has experimented a marine turbine system in direct connection moreover no robustness test is performed in order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed models and no multivariable nonlinear controller voltage and frequency regulation is implemented in this paper we study a marine turbine system which is directly connected to an electrical grid then we implementt in real time a nonlinear sliding mode control nsmc in order to avoid the stall phenomena during the robustness tests electrical and mechanical perturbations the choice of this control technique is due to its great robustness and its convergence rapidity the major advantage of this control law consists in simultaneous regulation of both outputs terminal voltage and speed through a single input the synchronous generator excitation this double regulation makes possible the direct connection to grid this nonlinear control design inspired by the one described in kenné et al 2010a is improved by using sliding mode techniques in order to increase the robustness properties in addition the dc motor which drives the synchronous generator is controlled in order to reproduce the marine turbine behaviors the experimental setup includes a monitor pc which controls all devices via a conversion board dsp rti 1103 the model of marine turbine system is described in section marine turbine system modeling the synthesis of the proposed control law is detailed in section control strategy description the results of simulation are presented in section simulation results in order to highlight the robustness properties of the proposed control scheme compared with avr pss the validation of these results are illustrated in section experimental validation finally some concluding remarks are made in section conclusion 1 1 marine turbine system modeling in this study the electrical generator is driven by a three blade marine turbine with horizontal axis the blades profile inspired from national advisory committee for aeronautics naca 44 is based on bem theory up to date this profile is the best in blades design and it is given in more details in ben elghali et al 2007 the mechanical power p m provided by the marine turbine is given as follows ben elghali et al 2012 dansoko et al 2013 2014 toumi et al 2014 1 p m 1 2 ρ

represent the medium tide coefficients which correspond to spring and neap water in order to convert mechanical energy into electricity synchronous generators are more advantageous than asynchronous generators in marine turbine applications ben elghali et al 2010 2012 this synchronous generator advantage is due to their better conversion efficiency and their better operation capacity in marine environment ben elghali et al 2010 2012 moreover there are two types of synchronous generators wound rotor synchronous generator wrsg and permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg the wrsg well regulated can be directly connected to electrical grid while the pmsg must inevitably use power electronic interface to ensure the grid connection dansoko et al 2013 2014 this fact is a technical and economic advantage for the use of wrsg indeed it is not necessary to use electronic power interface in these conditions for this reason we have chosen the wrsg generator in this study the dynamics of this generator connected to infinite bus system are presented by the following third order model kenné et al 2010a 2010b damm et al 2004 4 δ ω ω d h ω ω s h p e p m p e x d s x d s t d 0 p e v s x d s

control strategy description in this study our main goal consists in the direct connection of the marine turbine system to electrical grid this requires the nonlinear control law development to regulate simultaneously two outputs frequency and terminal voltage via a single input generator excitation in addition this control law must be robust in order to reject perturbations coming to tide and avoid the instability problem of synchronous generators connected to the grid indeed in kenné et al 2010a authors obtain satisfactory experimental results by validating a robust nonlinear control law to regulate terminal voltage and stabilize transient regimes of synchronous generator connected to infinite bus the basic idea of this technique assumes that the mechanical power varies slowly so that its derivative can be neglected with respect to others system dynamics this behavior is compatible with marine turbine dynamics which are very slow to increase the robustness properties we have combined the developed method in kenné et al 2010a with sliding mode technique the proposed control technique compared to second order sliding mode control sosmc in ben elghali et al 2011 is simpler regarding the design and the parameters number to tune three parameters for the proposed control which regulates two outputs and three parameters for sosmc which regulates only one output the parameters number with sosmc will increase if this controller must regulate two outputs note that the parameters tuning is a difficult step in practice in addition the proposed control regulates two outputs via one input while the sosmc proposed in ben elghali et al 2011 regulates one output via one input to achieve our control objective it should be necessary to combine this sosmc with other techniques in order to ensure the double regulation via single input the synthesis technique of proposed control law is described as follows let us now consider the following transformation 5 t δ δ r e f λ 0 ω with λ 0 a positive constant this transformation t establishes a link between the speed and the terminal voltage regulation because the control designed must regulates two outputs through a single input synchronous machine excitation note that the terminal voltage regulation is realized through the convergence of power angle towards its reference the power angle and its reference are given as follows kenné et al 2010a damm et al 2004 marino et al 2001 6 δ a r cot g v s x s p e x d v s x d s v t 2 x s 2 v s 2 p e 2 7 δ r e f a r cot g v s x s p m x d v s x d s v t r e f 2 x s 2 v s 2 p m 2 if δ converges to its reference δ r e f and p e converges towards p m consequently the terminal voltage v t converges to its reference v t r e f as the terminal voltage dynamic is not directly represented in the state mode of eq 1 we will use the estimation model given as follows kenné et al 2010a damm et al 2004 marino et al 2001 8 v t x s 2 p e 2 v s 2 sin 2 δ x d 2 v s 2 x d s 2 x d x s

λ 0 d h p m let us consider the slide surface s p e p e r e f as well as lyapunov function 10 v 1 2 s 2 1 2 p e p e r e f 2 the time derivative of 10 is v s s p e p e r e f p e p e r e f where p e r e f is the derivate of p e r e f the equivalent part of sliding mode control is obtained for a zero time derivate of sliding surface s 0 by choosing a discontinuous part as follows e f d i s x d s t d 0 v s sin δ k s i g n s we easily prove that if k 0 11 v k s s i g n s k s 0 the above equation 11 proves that lyapunov function v converges to 0 which implies the convergence of p e to p eref as t converges exponentially to 0 we can deduce that the relative speed ω converges to 0 and the power angle δ converges to its reference δ ref from 6 and 7 we can conclude that p e converges to p m and v t converges to v tref by summing the discontinuous and equivalent parts we obtain the complete structure of the proposed control as follows 12 e f x d s t d 0 v s sin δ p e x d s x d s t d 0 ω cot δ x d s x d s x d s x d s ω v s 2 sin 2 δ a 2 h λ 0 ω s t 1 λ 0 d h d λ 0 ω s ω 1 λ 0 p e p m k s i g n s the structure of the proposed control is illustrated by the fig 1 3 simulation results the marine turbine system fig 2 controlled is simulated in matlab simulink environment over one tide period of semidiurnal type 12h25mn and under some perturbations mechanical and electrical the obtained results under perturbation are presented over 20s duration in order to highlight robustness properties of the proposed nonlinear sliding mode control with respect to classical controller avr pss the electrical perturbation is a short circuit which is illustrated by the following sequence 1 at t 0 the system is in pre fault state 2 at t 5s the system is subjected to a short circuit 3 at t 5 2s the short circuit is removed and the system is carried back to its initial state the mechanical perturbation is a temporary turbine fault which is summarized as follows 1 at t 0 the system is in pre fault state 2 at t 5s the mechanical power is increased of 20 of its value 3 at t 6s the mechanical power is carried back to its initial value for a reference voltage of 1 p u the obtained simulation results are illustrated by the following figures figs 3 5 although the proposed control regulates effectively terminal voltage and relative speed fig 3 we notice that these two outputs vary under tide speed effect the simulation results figs 4 and 5 prove that the proposed control is efficient to regulate relative speed and terminal voltage before and even after significant faults without any damage we have proved that the marine turbine system can be coupled to electrical grid the comparative study shows the nsmc efficiency with respect to conventional avr pss in terms of convergence quickness peak overshoots attenuation oscillations damping and precision in terminal voltage regulation these robustness properties prove that the proposed nonlinear sliding mode control further improves the grid connection quality compared with avr pss which is the most used controller in the electrical networks stabilization this fact is very important to avoid the well known stall phenomena of synchronous generators to electrical grid 4 experimental validation in order to validate our obtained simulation results we have implemented the proposed control law on experimental setup this experimental setup which is illustrated by fig 6 includes a synchronous generator and a dc motor which are coupled on the same shaft a tachometer with speed to voltage ratio constant of 1000 rpm 60 v fixed on the shaft end allows measuring the machines rotation speed in addition voltage and current sensors are used to send control input variables toward the personal computer pc via a conversion board dsp rti 1103 the dsp rti 1103 is the interface between machines and matlab simulink environment software which allows realizing data acquisition in real time a first control voltage obtained from tide profile is sent by pc toward the dsp rti 1103 then toward a dc dc voltage converter to drive dc motor so that it behaves as marine turbine in the same way a second control voltage generated by our proposed controller is sent to act on synchronous generator excitation in order to regulate its terminal voltage and speed as the mechanical power is not physically measurable we do use an observer to estimate it see kenné et al 2010a for further informations this estimation is given by 13 ω ˆ ω s h p ˆ m d h ω ω s h p e u avec u k ω sign ω ω ˆ p ˆ m k p m sign e p m k p m sign h ω s u e q where u e q is the equivalent part of u which is also considered as its average when the experimental bench has been achieved we have implemented our nonlinear sliding mode control and the obtained results were not satisfactory due to the well known chattering effect introduced by the sign function because of this undesirable effect making unstable the bench we replace the sign function by one of its classical approximation defined in beltran et al 2008 as follows s i g n s s s ε where ε is a small positive constant and s p e p e r e f is the slide surface the choice of this approximation can be explained by two reasons firstly we can easily prove mathematically the new control law stability without imposing the conditions on the slide surface secondly we can adjust the parameter ε so to approximate in practice the sign function stability conditions while avoiding the chattering phenomena the new control law is defined as follows 14 e f x d s t d 0 v s sin δ p e x d s x d s t d 0 ω cot δ x d s x d s x d s x d s ω v s 2 sin 2 δ a 2 h λ 0 ω s t 1 λ 0 d h d λ 0 ω s ω 1 λ 0 p e p m k s s ε by using the technique developed in control strategy description part we prove mathematically the new control law stability by 15 v s s s k s 2 s ε 0 where v s is the lyapunov function and k is a positive real in these conditions we will loose the finite time convergence but we obtain an asymptotic convergence the structure of this new control law is described in fig 7 and a photo figure of experimental bench is illustrated in fig 8 the new control nonlinear sliding mode control approximated nsmca has been validated experimentally in two steps firstly over one tide period 12h25mn whose variations are brought back to 60s duration in order to study speed tide variations effect on the direct grid connection possibility secondly over 20s duration in order to evaluate the nsmca effectiveness compared to avr pss under electrical and mechanical perturbations in practice we have not an automatic device to produce a short circuit consequently the electrical perturbation has been realized on one of the three transmission lines the first electrical perturbation is a temporary opening of one transmission line as shown the following sequence 1 at t 0 the system is in pre fault state 2 at t 5s one of the three transmission lines is opened and at t 6s this transmission line is reconnected the second electrical perturbation is verified with respect to permanent opening of one transmission line the following sequence summarizes this fault 1 at t 0 the system is in pre fault state 2 at t 5s one of the three transmission lines is opened and the system operates under this condition the mechanical perturbation is a turbine temporary fault which is realized through a speed drop the following sequence summarizes this fault 1 at t 0 the system is in pre fault state 2 at t 5s a temporary speed fault generates a mechanical power increase of 20 3 at t 6s the speed fault is removed and the system operates in post fault state the obtained experimental results are illustrated on the following figures in all experimental results the proposed control can be used to ensure connection to grid even under significant perturbations in this case the proposed control ensures the energy production continuity the results of fig 9 show that the proposed control regulates effectively and precisely terminal voltage and rotor speed of synchronous generator despite the tide speed variations as a consequence the marine turbine simulator can be directly coupled in electrical grid the comparative study figs 10 12 reveals that the proposed control regulates effectively the terminal voltage before and after fault this is not case for avr pss in addition it shows that after fault the proposed control law reduces oscillation number compared with avr pss moreover we have noticed that contrary in simulation the peak overshoot values with proposed control in practice are higher compared to those of avr pss this problem is due to the sign function approximation using to avoid the undesirable chattering effect in practice it is necessary to note that these peak overshoot values remain in very small proportions lower than 1 globally the proposed control is more efficient than avr pss regarding terminal voltage regulation and oscillations damping this fact is very important because it improves the grid connection quality and reduces the mechanical efforts on the drive shaft in the future it will be interesting to analyze sosmc stability applied on marine turbine system and to estimate the mechanical and electrical power losses when this system is connected to electrical grid 5 conclusion in this paper an experimental validation of nonlinear sliding mode control for wrsg excitation driven by marine turbine directly connected to grid has been studied first of all the control has been successfully tested in numerical simulations then we have decided to implement these satisfactory results on a bench including a wrsg coupled with a dc motor in order to look like marine turbine the obtained results have proved that the proposed nonlinear sliding mode control can be well used in practice and that our marine turbine system can be directly coupled to electrical grid mechanical and electrical perturbations have been performed and the results have showed that the proposed control is robust enough to avoid the grid stall phenomena simulation and real time experimental results have showed the efficiency of our control compared to conventional avr pss in terms of terminal voltage regulation precision and oscillations damping the high simplicity design the parameters number to tune three parameters and practical

for electrical grid stabilization keywords experimental validation nonlinear and robust control sliding mode marine turbine synchronous generator 1 introduction among all renewable energies marine currents became really attractive recently due to their worldwide energetic potential which is estimated at 100 gw ben elghali 2008 marine turbines use part of marine currents in order to extract mechanical energy to produce electrical energy via synchronous generator and supplement conventional energy sources moreover marine currents are regular predictable and vary slowly this behavior is a significant advantage for marine turbines compared to other renewable energy production systems dansoko et al 2014 but their connection to electrical grid adds complexity to regulators design indeed in electricity production terminal voltage and frequency regulation are required to establish a direct connection in addition coupled renewable energy systems must be robust against electrical and mechanical perturbations in this context we need to develop a robust control taking into account nonlinear specifications of the synchronous generator and simultaneous regulation of terminal voltage

turbine system fig 2 controlled is simulated in matlab simulink environment over one tide period of semidiurnal type 12h25mn and under some perturbations mechanical and electrical the obtained results under perturbation are presented over 20s duration in order to highlight robustness properties of the proposed nonlinear sliding mode control with respect to classical controller avr pss the electrical perturbation is a short circuit which is illustrated by the following sequence 1 at t 0 the system is in pre fault state 2 at t 5s the system is subjected to a short circuit 3 at t 5 2s the short circuit is removed and the system is carried back to its initial state the mechanical perturbation is a temporary turbine fault which is summarized as follows 1 at t 0 the system is in pre fault state 2 at t 5s the mechanical power is increased of 20 of its value 3 at t 6s the mechanical power is carried back to its initial value for a reference voltage of 1 p u the obtained simulation results are illustrated by the following figures figs 3 5 although the proposed control regulates effectively terminal voltage and relative speed fig 3 we notice that these two outputs vary under tide speed effect the simulation results figs 4 and 5 prove that the proposed control is efficient to regulate relative speed and terminal voltage before and even after significant faults without any damage we have proved that the marine turbine system can be coupled to electrical grid the comparative study shows the nsmc efficiency with respect to conventional avr pss in terms of convergence quickness peak overshoots attenuation oscillations damping and precision in terminal voltage regulation these robustness properties prove that the proposed nonlinear sliding mode control further improves the grid connection quality compared with avr pss which is the most used controller in the electrical networks stabilization this fact is very important to avoid the well known stall phenomena of synchronous generators to electrical grid 4 experimental validation in order to validate our obtained simulation results we have implemented the proposed control law on experimental setup this experimental setup which is illustrated by fig 6 includes a synchronous generator and a dc motor which are coupled on the same shaft a tachometer with speed to voltage ratio constant of 1000 rpm 60 v fixed on the shaft end allows measuring the machines rotation speed in addition voltage and current sensors are used to send control input variables toward the personal computer pc via a conversion board dsp rti 1103 the dsp rti 1103 is the interface between machines and matlab simulink environment software which allows realizing data acquisition in real time a first control voltage obtained from tide profile is sent by pc toward the dsp rti 1103 then toward a dc dc voltage converter to drive dc motor so that it behaves as marine turbine in the same way a second control voltage generated by our proposed controller is sent to act on synchronous generator excitation in order to regulate its terminal voltage and speed as the mechanical power is not physically measurable we do use an observer to estimate it see kenné et al 2010a for further informations this estimation is given by 13 ω ˆ ω s h p ˆ m d h ω ω s h p e u avec u k ω sign ω ω ˆ p ˆ m k p m sign e p m k p m sign h ω s u e q where u e q is the equivalent part of u which is also considered as its average when the experimental bench has been achieved we have implemented our nonlinear sliding mode control and the obtained results were not satisfactory due to the well known chattering effect introduced by the sign function because of this undesirable effect making unstable the bench we replace the sign function by one of its classical approximation defined in beltran et al 2008 as follows s i g n s s s ε where ε is a small positive constant and s p e p e r e f is the slide surface the choice of this approximation can be explained by two reasons firstly we can easily prove mathematically the new control law stability without imposing the conditions on the slide surface secondly we can adjust the parameter ε so to approximate in practice the sign function stability conditions while avoiding the chattering phenomena the new control law is defined as follows 14 e f x d s t d 0 v s sin δ p e x d s x d s t d 0 ω cot δ x d s x d s x d s x d s ω v s 2 sin 2 δ a 2 h λ 0 ω s t 1 λ 0 d h d λ 0 ω s ω 1 λ 0 p e p m k s s ε by using the technique developed in control strategy description part we prove mathematically the new control law stability by 15 v s s s k s 2 s ε 0 where v s is the lyapunov function and k is a positive real in these conditions we will loose the finite time convergence but we obtain an asymptotic convergence the structure of this new control law is described in fig 7 and a photo figure of experimental bench is illustrated in fig 8 the new control nonlinear sliding mode control approximated nsmca has been validated experimentally in two steps firstly over one tide period 12h25mn whose variations are brought back to 60s duration in order to study speed tide variations effect on the direct grid connection possibility secondly over 20s duration in order to evaluate the nsmca effectiveness compared to avr pss under electrical and mechanical perturbations in practice we have not an automatic device to produce a short circuit consequently the electrical perturbation has been realized on one of the three transmission lines the first electrical perturbation is a temporary opening of one transmission line as shown the following sequence 1 at t 0 the system is in pre fault state 2 at t 5s one of the three transmission lines is opened and at t 6s this transmission line is reconnected the second electrical perturbation is verified with respect to permanent opening of one transmission line the following sequence summarizes this fault 1 at t 0 the system is in pre fault state 2 at t 5s one of the three transmission lines is opened and the system operates under this condition the mechanical perturbation is a turbine temporary fault which is realized through a speed drop the following sequence summarizes this fault 1 at t 0 the system is in pre fault state 2 at t 5s a temporary speed fault generates a mechanical power increase of 20 3 at t 6s the speed fault is removed and the system operates in post fault state the obtained experimental results are illustrated on the following figures in all experimental results the proposed control can be used to ensure connection to grid even under significant perturbations in this case the proposed control ensures the energy production continuity the results of fig 9 show that the proposed control regulates effectively and precisely terminal voltage and rotor speed of synchronous generator despite the tide speed variations as a consequence the marine turbine simulator can be directly coupled in electrical grid the comparative study figs 10 12 reveals that the proposed control regulates effectively the terminal voltage before and after fault this is not case for avr pss in addition it shows that after fault the proposed control law reduces oscillation number compared with avr pss moreover we have noticed that contrary in simulation the peak overshoot values with proposed control in practice are higher compared to those of avr pss this problem is due to the sign function approximation using to avoid the undesirable chattering effect in practice it is necessary to note that these peak overshoot values remain in very small proportions lower than 1 globally the proposed control is more efficient than avr pss regarding terminal voltage regulation and oscillations damping this fact is very important because it improves the grid connection quality and reduces the mechanical efforts on the drive shaft in the future it will be interesting to analyze sosmc stability applied on marine turbine system and to estimate the mechanical and electrical power losses when this system is connected to electrical grid 5 conclusion in this paper an experimental validation of nonlinear sliding mode control for wrsg excitation driven by marine turbine directly connected to grid has been studied first of all the control has been successfully tested in numerical simulations then we have decided to implement these satisfactory results on a bench including a wrsg coupled with a dc motor in order to look like marine turbine the obtained results have proved that the proposed nonlinear sliding mode control can be well used in practice and that our marine turbine system can be directly coupled to electrical grid mechanical and electrical perturbations have been performed and the results have showed that the proposed control is robust enough to avoid the grid stall phenomena simulation and real time experimental results have showed the efficiency of our control compared to conventional avr pss in terms of terminal voltage regulation precision and oscillations damping the high simplicity design the parameters number to tune three parameters and practical application possibilities constitute the main positive features of the proposed nonlinear control acknowledgements the experimental part of this work has been realized in the electro technical

23668,understanding and predicting vortex induced motion vim of offshore systems for deep seawater applications is crucial to improve the system safety and integrity we report on experimental tow tank

solid objects are encountered across many engineering applications including bridges buildings chimney stacks vibrating tubes in heat exchangers and aerial terrestrial and aquatic vehicles in particular this work focuses on the large amplitude motion of a tethered offshore structure induced by periodic vortex shedding from its pillars von karman vortex streets a bluff body immersed in a stream of fluid is susceptible to vortex resonance and galloping instabilities especially when its natural frequency coincides with the vortex shedding frequency recent years have shown an increasing interest in the response of offshore floaters to the action of sea currents waals et al 2007 guoxing et al 2006 goncalves et al 2013 jaime et al 2013 nevertheless accurate prediction of vortex induced vibration or motion viv or vim has proven difficult owing to nonlinear fluid forces and feedback between cylindrical pillars or columns of a multi column floater and the fluid flow blevins 2009 goncalves et al 2012 the trend in offshore oil exploration has been to move into deeper water to satisfy the increasing energy demands and exploit reserves in deep and ultra deep water such as the deep water regions in the gulf of mexico gom depending on the water depth and oil production system design wet tree subsea or dry tree surface lee et al 2014 lim 2009 the industry uses a few predominant platform design concepts tension leg platforms tlps spars and semisubmersibles halkyard 2005 antony et al 2015 the study of vim of offshore platforms has become of utmost importance since many regions experience strong loop currents e g deepwater region of gom which trigger resonant motions due to vortex shedding for instance in moderate water depth up to around 1500 m spar mono column design platforms have proven so far to be a satisfactory solution for oil exploration however the single cylindrical shape of platform or a mono column with high level of current speeds is susceptible to synchronized vortex shedding that induces oscillatory motion with relatively high amplitude on the order of the cylinder s diameter in the gulf of mexico extreme water depths beyond 1800 m are dominated by semi submersibles antony et al 2015 this design also known as a semi has drawn a lot of attention for deep water reservoir development due to large payload capacity and quayside integration feasibility there are two main types of semi submersible design a a four column platform also known as conventional semi or c semi already deployed and operating and b an eight column platform also known as paired column or pc semi which is still in development stage while the latter design is the main focus of this study our results also shed light on the behavior of the c semi design the pc semi is specifically targeted at dry tree applications in the gulf of mexico as an alternative to the spar concept in deep and ultra deep water development depth beyond 1800 m the philosophy of developing the pc semi concept is to utilize conventional designs of hull structure tensioner systems already developed spar like ram style tensioner and well bay arrangements and to maintain quayside integration to avoid extensive offshore installation cost and risk zou et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 the pc semi has eight rectangular columns with rounded corners arranged in pairs at each of the 4 corners the inner columns are thinner than the outer columns also the pc semi draft is deeper and the slenderness ratio is larger than a conventional semi submersible in general larger column slenderness ratio is likely to make the structure more susceptible to vim thus it is anticipated that the pc semi has unique vim response characteristics zou et al 2013 previous survey of the open literature showed that nominal amplitude of cross flow vim motion can be substantially lower in pc semi designs compared to the c semi designs vinayan et al 2015 while there is a reasonable body of work related to conventional semis goncalves et al 2012 2013 ma et al 2014 zeng et al 2014 lie et al 2016 and even more so related to spars halkyard et al 2005 2006 lefevre et al 2013 fujiwara et al 2013 only limited amount of work is available in open literature related to vim response of a pc semi since it is a more recent design concept periodic vim motion manifested through large displacements and drift on the sea surface imposes important static and fatigue loads on the mooring lines and riser system ma et al 2013 over time vim can impact the integrity of vital offshore system components and the overall system safety as a response vim has emerged as an important issue in offshore engineering for oil exploration in ultra deep water antony et al 2015 as well as for offshore wind turbine platforms fujiwara et al 2013 as measurements from the offshore field are mainly proprietary and limited one must rely on model scale tow tank testing and cfd simulations to study vim in general there is a need for a well defined benchmark framework to compare the full scale field data prototype scale to the model scale results and developing experimentally validated practical cfd methodology for applications in model scale and full scale however accurate prediction of vortex induced motion vim using cfd is challenging even at model scale as it requires sufficiently accurate modeling of vortex shedding and interactions between the immersed body and fluid further cfd simulation of vim requires substantial computational resources due to the large mesh size dynamic range of length scales owed to the complex vortex shedding dynamics and long transient vim motion history needed for statistical analyses one typically requires between 10 and 15 fully developed vim cycles in a previous work kim et al 2015 we reported the cfd and experimental results for drag tests flow around a stationary pc semi and compared the drag force as the key validation parameter we also conducted cfd and experiments for free decay where the fluid is stationary while the body undergoes damped oscillations after being taken out of the equilibrium position translation or rotation these free decay tests were used to compare the natural frequency of the system for cross flow and yaw motions the present work adds one more degree of freedom to the system to focus on a more realistic yet complex case of vim motion cross flow in line and yaw with tightly coupled fluid structure interaction fsi the main purpose of the present study is to test the physical validity of our simulations as compared to laboratory scale tow tank experimental measurements scaling these simulations to real size offshore rigs will be the focus of a future study we describe the experimental measurements in section 2 then section 3 presents the theoretical model and numerical setup followed by the experimental and numerical results as well as their comparisons in section 4 finally section 5 summarizes the conclusions of this work 2 experimental measurements the experiments supporting the current study were conducted at marin s tow basin in the netherlands kim et al 2015 zou et al 2014 because of that facility s capability to measure the response of scaled models to vortex induced motions vim for the current study a 1 54 scale model of a pc semi fig 1 was tested in the marin s towing basin fig 1 shows top views of the prototype pc semi and its scaled model detailing their main dimensions these and additional dimensions of prototype and model are listed in table 1 in this section we develop the scaling relationships to estimate the inertial properties of the prototype based on the basin model as well as the governing equations for the dynamical behavior of the prototype the purpose of the current study is to characterize motion in three degrees of freedom with respect to a plane parallel to the water surface that is 1 streamwise translation in line 2 cross flow translation cross flow and 3 rotational motion around the surface normal yaw roll pitch and heave motions were restricted and not considered in the study in fact since vim induced cross flow fatigues the mooring lines and risers of offshore systems its action is critical for the rig s structural integrity therefore this is the key parameter analyzed in the present study in particular the experimentally measured amplitude and frequency of cross flow are used to assess the accuracy and quality of the subsequent cfd simulations fig 2 a contains a schematic of the marin s tow tank facility its basin s dimensions are 240 m long 18 m wide 8 m deep based on the ratio between the submerged frontal area of the model and the basin dimensions the blockage factor is less than 3 as shown in fig 2b the suspension system carriage tows the model at a prescribed velocity while measuring its response to vortex loading as detailed in fig 2c the model is connected to the carriage by means of two vertically oriented pre tensioned springs that provide the needed restoring force in the surface parallel plane a smooth plate 3 m 1 5 m mounted under the carriage sets the model at the desired draft the model was equipped with three air bearings to minimize its friction contact with the smooth plate and freely allow it to respond to vim see fig 2b and c for reference the response of a pc semi to fluid loads is modulated by the stiffness of its anchoring system to replicate this effect the scaled model is mounted on springs whose tension can be modified to obtain the correct scaled system stiffness scaling follows from similarity based on the froude number fr note that the wave effect on the free surface is not taken into account for the current scaling analysis because the froude number turns out to be less than 0 1 in both model and prototype froude similarity implies 1 f r p f r m or 2 u 2 g l p u 2 g l m where u is a characteristic velocity g the magnitude of the gravitational field l a characteristic length and the sub indices p and m stand for prototype and model respectively satisfying equations 1 and 2 ensures that the model is under similar dynamic conditions in a free surface flow environment as the prototype let λ l p l m be the length scaling between the prototype and the model λ 54 for the current case then since both could be considered to be under the same gravitational field the velocity scaling follows from equation 2 3 u p u m λ given that the model and prototype can be floating in water of different salinity it is convenient to express gravity in terms of specific weight in equation 2 then considering that density is in general ρ m l 3 equation 2 becomes 4 u 2 γ m l 4 p u 2 γ m l 4 m from which the mass scaling follows 5 m p m m ϱ λ 3 6 ϱ γ p γ m here ϱ 1 025 is the ratio of specific weights of the water used in the prototype and the model using the ratios λ and ϱ and equations 3 and 5 all other scaling laws can be determined from dimensional considerations alone becker and beér 1977 these laws are summarized in table 2 including their numerical values for the current experiments according to fig 2c the model is attached to two springs which will define the system s response to loading in particular based on the schematic on fig 3 a horizontal loads imposing cross flow or in line displacements can be defined in terms of the geometry of the system and spring characteristics as follows 7 f x x 2 k x 1 l i l x x 2 k x 1 l 0 t 0 k l 0 2 x 2 8 f y y 2 k y 1 l i l y y 2 k y 1 l 0 t 0 k l 0 2 y 2 where k is the spring constant l i l 0 t 0 k is the un stretched spring length l 0 is the initial length of the spring under pre tension t 0 is the pre tension l x x l 0 2 x 2 and l y y l 0 2 y 2 represent the final lengths of the spring under in line and cross flow displacements respectively and x and y are the in line streamwise and cross flow cross stream displacements respectively the factor 2 in front of equations 7 and 8 is the number of springs in the system similarly the yaw generating moment determined is reported in fig 3b these values are listed in table 3 and will be used in the simulations performed herein overall mooring stiffness is represented by horizontal and yaw stiffness values present work does not consider any active damping e g from risers appurtenances and chains we show the recorded time history for all three motion components in fig 4 for one test we usually had 3 repeated tests at each flow condition measurement results shown here are for the baseline case in our study ur 8 and zero heading the semisubmersible is towed in still water along the channel as shown in fig 2 starting from zero velocity it typically takes on the order of 10 15 s for the carriage to accelerate from zero to the uniform velocity which is then maintained through the rest of a test case in response the in line trajectory of the center of gravity of the immersed pc semisubmersible initial peaks to around 0 45 m and then settles to a relatively steady value through the remainder of the run fig 4 top the cross flow motion shows transients through the first one to 2 min and then develops steady oscillatory behavior throughout the rest of the run fig 4 middle this oscillatory cross flow motion is characterized by amplitude and period see equation 29 and related discussion finally the semi exhibits yaw motion within 2 degrees of equilibrium position however with broader frequency spectrum than the cross flow component 3 theoretical model and numerical setup 3 1 turbulence model the behavior of a turbulent flow whose first statistical moment is unsteady can be modeled by decomposing its instantaneous pressure and velocity fields into the summation of a low pass and a high pass filtered signal 9 u i x i t u i x i t u i x i t 10 p x i t p x i t p x i t where u i x i t and p x i t are the velocity and pressure fields respectively t is the time coordinate and x i is the set of spatial coordinates with i 1 2 3 here is the low pass filter defined in equation 11 as a moving time average of length t 11 1 t t t 2 t t 2 d t in steady turbulent flows the result of loses its time dependence that is t can be made arbitrarily large without changing the result and simply becomes the time average of the signal and equations 9 and 10 become the classical reynolds decomposition the primed quantities on the right hand side of equations 9 and 10 represent the high pass filtered portion of the signals or simply the turbulent fluctuations these are obtained by subtracting the low pass portion of the signal from the original field this decomposition is consistent with the formulation of rodi s rodi 1993 for flows with long wavelength periodic and short wavelength stochastic fluctuations after introducing the decomposed fields 9 and 10 into the continuity and momentum equations for an incompressible fluid with no body forces and using the low pass filter 11 in the system of equations one obtains 12 u i x i 0 13 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j u i u j x j here ρ and ν are the density and kinematic viscosity respectively and τ i j u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor summation over repeated indices is implied in these equations this system is dubbed unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations urans due to its close relation to classical rans note that τ i j is a symmetric second order tensor that introduces six new unknowns to the system without adding more equations hence the system requires a closure formulation to be solvable a typical approach boussinesq 1877 boussinesq 1877 is to introduce a turbulent viscosity ν t mathematically analogous to the stress rate of strain relation for a newtonian fluid 14 u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i 2 3 k δ i j where δ i j is the kronecker delta and k 1 2 u i u i is the turbulent kinetic energy equation 14 reduces the number of new unknowns from six to two that is the turbulent viscosity ν t and the turbulent kinetic energy k this study will follow the shear stress transport sst formulation of menter 1993 1994 to model the turbulent viscosity without going into details this formulation defines the turbulent viscosity as proportional to the ratio between the turbulent kinetic energy and a function of vorticity ω further the model adds two more transport equations one for k and one for ω each containing a set of constants calibrated experimentally because of these additional transport equations this is called a two equation model the value of these constants and the form of the transport equation for ω are different in the inner and outer regions of boundary layers depending on the region of the flow the resulting two equation model coincides with the k ω model inner region see wilcox 1988 for details or the k ε model outer region and free stream see jones and launder 1972 launder and sharma 1974 squires et al 2005 khalak and williamson 1997 for details where ε is the viscous dissipation noteworthy the sst formulation expresses the dissipation equation in the outer region in terms of vorticity to simplify the jump between k ω and k ε models the two equations of the sst model are re written here for completeness 15 k t u j k x j u i u j u i x j β ω k x j ν σ k ν t k x j 16 ω t u j ω x j γ ν t u i u j u i x j β ω 2 x j ν σ ω ν t ω x j 2 1 f i σ ω 2 1 ω k x j ω x j where β 0 09 and the other constants σ k σ ω γ and β are defined differently in the inner k ω and the outer k ε regions inner region σ k 1 0 85 σ ω 1 0 5 β

and outer regions is made gradually by means of the blending function f i as follows 17 ϕ f i ϕ 1 1 f i ϕ 2 where ϕ takes the place of any one of the constants σ k σ ω γ or β and the sub indices 1 and 2 refer to their values in the inner and outer regions respectively the blending function is defined as follows 18 f i t a n h a r g i 4 19 a r g i min max k 0 09 ω δ 500 ν δ 2 ω 4 ρ σ ω 2 k d k ω δ 2 20 d k ω max 2 ρ σ ω 2 1 ω k x j ω x j 10 20 where δ in equation 19 is a length scale that will be defined later on finally the turbulent viscosity is defined as follows 21 ν t a k max a ω ω f ii 22 f ii t a n h a r g ii 2 23 a r g ii max 2 k 0 09 ω δ 500 ν δ 2 ω with a 0 31 in equation 21 in general urans models perform well when there is a significant separation of scales between the long wavelength and the short wavelength components that is when the time scale of turbulent fluctuations is too short compared to the time scale of the slow varying component recovered by the low pass filter 11 when this is not the case like in separated flow around bluff bodies there would be interactions between the turbulent fluctuations and the large scale slow varying components that could challenge the standard calibration of urans models becker and beér 1977 in such cases the applicability of urans without further experimental calibration would be questionable a different formulation large eddy simulation les can be used in the outer region and all the way to the free stream to go around the need for new experimental calibration the main principle of les is to simulate the energetic scales down to an appropriate threshold within the inertial range of turbulent flows while modeling the rest of the scales down to the dissipative range the basic premise behind this formulation is that small scales tend toward universal cascading behavior this premise seems to hold for high reynolds numbers and away from walls near walls the presence of boundary layers would affect homogeneity in essence les uses the same averaged equations as urans 12 and 13 but the definition of the reynolds stress tensor τ i j is different while urans seeks to use physical quantities to define τ i j les uses what is known as a sub grid model which is based on a characteristic measure of the computational grid spacing that being said the strategy of the present work is to keep the sst formulation but transitioning to les instead of the k ε model in the outer region of boundary layers and free stre this formulation is basically a form of what is known as detached eddy simulation becker and beér 1977 frohlich and terzi 2008 spalart and allmaras 1992 spalart 2000 2009 which combines the advantages of the k ω wall model with the ones of les away from the wall effectively we implement the les formulation into our sst model by means of the length scale δ which we strategically left undefined in equations 19 and 23 24 δ min δ sst c des δ 25 c des c des k ω f i c des k ε 1 f

spacing there are other definitions for δ but this one is considered appropriate for unstructured grids becker and beér 1977 with δ x i the local grid spacing along the i th coordinate for the rest of this article we will refer to our numerical scheme as ddes sst 3 2 numerical scheme and discretization a cell centered finite volume based navier stoke fluid solver i e ansys fluent15 2 was used to solve the above defined model in the domain of interest ansys fluent 15 0 user s 2014 the transient terms are discretized using a bounded first order implicit time formulation which is required with the dynamic mesh approach in ansys fluent the overall size of the computational domain in this simulation is 45 m 18 m 5 m see fig 5 a for reference tow tank basin depth was 8 m however the 5 m depth of the cfd domain is sufficient to capture vim while making the domain smaller and thus computationally less expensive the computational domain was divided in three basic regions that were discretized differently according to resolution requirements see fig 5b for reference region 1 is attached to the pc semi to capture near wall behavior as such it has the smallest element size of all regions this mesh is composed by eight prism layers around the solid structure starting with a thickness of 0 5 mm at the wall and growing in thickness with a factor of 1 2 throughout the eight layers this initial element thickness is approximately equivalent to two wall units y y w y 2 motivated by the necessity of resolving scales of size similar to the viscous scale y near the wall this will ensure capturing a dynamic range in the turbulent boundary layer that will include both ends of the inertial range of the energy cascade the viscous scale is defined in terms of the wall shear stress τ w as 27 y ν ρ τ w though the wall shear stress is not really known a priori its value is estimated based on the case of a turbulent boundary layer under zero pressure gradient for the free stream conditions studied herein this is a reasonable approximation to define the smallest meshing size in this domain on the other hand the lateral characteristic length of the near wall elements is 1 5cm region 2 is a cylinder surrounding region 1 and its purpose is to capture detached vortices and turbulence behavior the mesh in this region is composed by tetrahedral elements with characteristic cell size of 5cm 0 14d where d 35 9 cm is the characteristic length of the outer columns region 1 could also be considered as the boundary layer region and region 2 as the near wake region where massive flow separation and vortex shedding take place together these two regions are the near region region 3 has the purpose of capturing free stream and far wake behavior and hence its resolution is the coarsest of all regions being composed of tetrahedral elements with characteristic mesh size of 50cm this region is considered the outer region and it is attached to the near wake region by a non conformal mesh interface for simplicity only the submerged portion of the semisubmersible platform is considered in the computational domain see region 1 in fig 5b after meshing the domain with the above described strategy the total number of volume elements is 6 1 million the effects of the basin s walls are assumed to be small and thus neglected in the simulation the inlet condition is specified as a homogeneously distributed reduced velocity u r defined as follows 28 u r u f d where u f and d are the free stream velocity natural frequency and effective diameter respectively the characteristic length d is the pc semi s outer column diagonal d 0 36 m in model scale see fig 1d and table 1 for reference and is fixed in this study i e d does not change with heading the simulation is repeated under different inlet flow conditions in which the reduced velocity is modified to different values in the interval 4 u r 10 pressure outlet condition is defined at the back wall right hand side in fig 5b symmetric boundary conditions are adopted on the two sidewalls top and bottom walls of the domain water surface and the bottom of the channel respectively are defined as dirichlet boundary conditions known values of velocity u r at the surface and zero at the bottom of the channel or no slip since the froude value is small fr 0 09 free surface is not modeled in this simulation ansys fluent uses dynamic deformable mesh technique to accommodate platform motion the mesh movement in solver is integrated into the iterative solution process within a time step typically the solution for solid motion and fluid flow is solved iteratively within the step so the mesh motion is updated several times each step each time the current flow solution is projected onto the updated mesh nodes at their new locations the motion of the semisubmersible rigid body motion is calculated from solving a corresponding force balance equation for the semisubmersible with a spring based dynamic meshing method and a rigid body solver with three degrees of freedom dof ansys fluent 15 0 user s 2014 dynamic deformable mesh due to vim is applied only to region 3 see fig 5b for reference hence the mesh in regions 1 and 2 remains unaltered while moving as a rigid body attached to the structure as a response to vim forces 3 3 grid independence in order to appropriately utilize the hybrid turbulence model i e ddes sst it is recommended to perform a well designed grid independence study and time step convergence study lie et al 2016 we report the sensitivity analysis of cross flow vim motion with respect to mesh refinement spatial effect and time step temporal effect first to conduct the grid independence study the ddes sst model presented in section 3 1 was solved under three different levels of refinement of the near wake region region 2 in fig 5b while the outer region region 3 in fig 5b remains unrefined details of the three meshes with different levels of refinement in the near wake zone are presented in table 4 the reduced velocity was set to u r 8 for this assessment unless noted otherwise numerical simulation results are shown for zero heading fig 1d the normalized nominal cross flow amplitude a nom d and the average zero crossing period t z responses of the pc semi under these different refinement levels were observed as indicators of convergence here the nominal cross flow amplitude is defined as follows 29 a nom 2 s t d e v y t i e a square root of 2 multiplied by the standard deviation of the cross flow motion y t further t z is simply defined by counting the number of times that the model crosses its transversal equilibrium position during a given period of time in the positive direction of y axis see fig 4 and related discussion at the end of section 2 for more details while both the experiments and cfd ran from zero time i e t 0 and the body at rest no initial velocity applied or prescribed for the body it takes a certain period of time for vim oscillatory motion to develop we use 12 to 15 fully developed vim cycles to calculate anom and tz and exclude the initial 3 to 5 vim developing cycles as the motion hasn t fully developed it should be noted that this mesh refinement study is not independent of time step given that we enforce the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition to ensure numerical convergence sarpkaya 2004 singh and mittal 2005 in the present case we enforced cfl 0 1 which implies the following relation between mesh size and time step 30 u δ t δ s 0 1 as a result the time step will also be refined as the mesh is refined in the near wake region nevertheless mesh convergence analysis was carried out and the results are presented in fig 6 for this analysis at least 15 cycles of cross flow motion were used to determine a nom d and t z for the present study with main focus on providing engineering estimate for cross flow vim we consider a simulation valid if the numerical results for a nom d and t z fall within 10 and 5 of their respective experimental results noting that reported experimental measurements also have an 5 error as can be seen in fig 6a the coarse mesh m1 does not produce a valid result for a nom d while both the baseline m2 and fine m3 meshes can be considered valid since their results fall within 10 of the experimental value of a nom d on the other hand according to fig 6b all meshes tested produce valid results for t z nevertheless the results from a nom d and t z calculation with three different mesh types conclude that m2 as a feasible discretization for the current simulation campaign on the other hand fig 7 shows vortex shedding from the columns of the pc semi these coherent motions were detected using the q criterion the q criterion considers that vortices are defined by regions in which the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor is positive fig 7 clearly demonstrates that detection of vortex activity increases with mesh refinement if the purpose of this study were to conduct a detailed assessment of turbulence generated at the wake of the pc semi then the obvious choice for mesh refinement would be m3 or even finer however the purpose of this study is to determine the response of the pc semi to vortex induced forces in the hierarchy of turbulent scales the larger eddies carry most of the kinetic energy ergo momentum and the energy and momentum content tapers down as eddy size decreases henceforth to study vim we just need to resolve the range of larger scale eddies that carry enough momentum to induce significant forces in the pc semi in fact our initial observations of the effect of mesh refinement on a nom d indicate that m2 is enough to replicate the experimental response of the pc semi this means that the additional vortices resolved by m3 are too small to add any significant load to the pc semi in conclusion since there is not any significant gain in accuracy of capturing cross flow vim motion of the floater by increasing mesh refinement beyond the level of m2 but there is a significant increase in computational cost by refining the mesh to the level of m3 m2 is selected as the optimal mesh for the present study 3 4 time step refinement in order to evaluate time step effect on the fidelity of our simulations we conducted a series of simulations with the baseline mesh m2 for the same inlet conditions as in the mesh independence analysis u r 8 these simulations were conducted for time steps of 0 1s 0 06s and 0 03s keeping all other parameters fixed as a result the average value of the cfl condition in the near wake region were 0 4 0 2 and 0 1 respectively see equation 30 for reference the results are shown in fig 8 demonstrating that as time step decreases the value of a nom d gets closer to the experimental result in fact among the tested values only the time step of 0 03s falls within the region of acceptance 10 error band consequently the mean value of cfl 0 1 in the near wake zone is sufficient to ensure adequate fidelity in our vim simulation on the other hand as with the mesh refinement analysis time step selection has less effect on the value of t z which remains within acceptable values regardless of time step choice this result speaks of the robustness of this particular output as in the experiment the simulations start with the pc semi at the equilibrium position with zero initial velocity at in line cross flow and yaw the pc semi takes some time to reach its full motion amplitudes and periodicity this initial developing period decreases in the simulation as the time step is decreased i e cross flow periodic vim motion develops faster reinforcing the need for using the smallest time step possible in the simulation kim et al 2015 vinayan et al 2015 antony et al 2016 4 results and discussion the amplitude of vim cross flow motion is described by normalized nominal cross flow amplitude a nom d which is a dimensionless number based on the statistically determined standard deviation of y t over sufficiently high number of vim cycles anom and the characteristic dimension of the platform column d we define d as the diameter of the outer column d 0 36 m in model scale see fig 1d experimental measurements were conducted at several different headings or encounter angles of the incoming main flow shown in fig 9 for all headings results are reported using identical characteristic length d 0 36 m for both a nom d and u r note that some reports with rectangular columns may adjust the characteristic length for specific heading second for comparison of the present results to the earlier studies with conventional semisubmersibles note that c semi studies often have a different heading convention i e rotated by 45 for each heading tests were performed over a range of reduced velocity values u r from u r 3 to u r 16 results are summarized in fig 9 a number of cases of interest high amplitude was repeated up to three times to observe statistical variability experimental uncertainty is within 5 for each measured cross flow amplitude for u r 3 the cross flow amplitudes are very small and almost identical for all headings as u r is increased to 4 a sharp increase in amplitude is observed for all headings except for the 45 heading for zero heading and u r 4 and 5 we observe large scatter in the experimental data as this is the onset of the lock in the range of ur where vim is taking place for these u r values although initial conditions for each repeated run are nominally identical small variations in the experimental conditions residual currents and turbulence in the basin can cause relatively large variations in the measured amplitudes interestingly very little scatter is recorded in the cross flow period considerable periodic cross flow motion has been observed for headings 0 11 25 and 22 5 in the u r range between 5 and 10 so called lock in region large cross flow amplitude in this u r range is consistent for both c semi and pc semi where previous survey of the available data vinayan et al 2015 revealed that a c semi could have nominal cross flow amplitudes that are 50 or more higher compared to the pc semi designs from the present tests the pc semi is particularly prone to vim at headings between zero and 22 5 the maximum anom d occurs at zero heading between u r 7 and 9 at this u r range and heading the long term fatigue of the mooring lines and risers in the offshore system will be affected the most by high cross flow amplitude hence we define the case of zero heading and u r 8 as the baseline case in our numerical study time history of the in line motion cross flow motion and yaw are shown earlier in fig 4 end of section 2 six different cases at zero heading were computed as the amplitude is the largest for these cases each one at a different reduced velocity u r 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 flow regime characteristics for each reduced velocity are shown in table 5 the free stream velocity u is a prescribed variable but it is also linked to the reduced velocity via equation 28 the reynolds number is determined from the geometry diameter of the outer column free stream velocity and kinematic viscosity of sea water ν 1 83 10 6 m2 s according to the values of the reynolds number the flow around the model is in the subcritical regime 500 r e 2 10 5 where the boundary layers around the upstream pillar i e column have not endured transition to turbulence but the vortices shed from the pillar are turbulent fig 10 compares time histories of all three motion components 3 degrees of freedom between numerical simulation and tow tank measurements noting that the cross flow is the key motion component considered in our study we present the histories for the baseline case zero heading and u r 8 from these results the pc semi takes some time to reach a state of fully developed cross flow oscillation around 40 s in the cfd case shown in fig 10a and around 70s in the tow tank test in fig 10b initial transients were excluded from statistical analyses in both cfd and experimental data analysis the data after that initial transient was used to determine the statistical variables i e normalized nominal cross flow amplitude and the average zero crossing period t z for the numerical results the time period simulated corresponded to around 15 vim cycles of cross flow motion which was determined sufficient for the statistical analyses adding more cycles to the calculations prolonged the computing time without changing the statistically determined amplitude for the tow tank tests the number of cycles was determined by the length of the channel and by the ur for specific flow condition see fig 4 450 s for the baseline case test from equation 29 the nominal amplitude a nom is defined as 2 s t d e v y t the normalized nominal amplitude a nom d determined experimentally and numerically is shown in fig 11 a fig 11 shows a very good agreement between the experimental data and the simulations numerical prediction for both the normalized nominal amplitude and zero crossing period is within 5 of the measured values across the u r range of interest which is acceptable for engineering applications we reiterate that both experimental and numerical values of amplitude and period is obtained from statistical analyses of relatively long time series such results lend credibility to the ddes sst method to predict the behavior of the model scale vim studied here and extend the study to a real scale prototype in our ongoing and future work simulation was also conducted at 45 heading and the baseline u r 8 anom d was reduced by more than a factor of 3 when the heading was changed from zero to 45 which is consistent with the measurements further in a previous study kim et al 2015 we demonstrated that the use of urans model with the remaining parameters of the numerical model identical mesh time step can overestimate cross flow amplitudes by more than 20 interestingly the average zero crossing period showed reasonable agreement with experiments for both ddes sst and urans in contrast the free decay and current drag tests are shown to be less sensitive to turbulence model and to an extent mesh refinement therefore computationally less expensive urans can be used to accurately predict the natural frequency and drag forces in these cases finally the computational model described in section 3 was implemented with ansys fluent 15 0 and solved in a 16 node cluster each node has eight dual socket intel xeon 5500 processors 2 66 ghz 4 core nehalem and 24 gb of ram with these resources a typical calculation time is 7 5 days to obtain up to 15 full cross flow cycles between 4 and 5 min of simulated time 5 summary and concluding remarks in this study a 1 54 scale model of a paired column semisubmersible pc semi was used to conduct tow tank experiments at the marin tow tank facility over a range of reduced velocity u r from 3 to 12 and for several different headings characteristic length d 0 36 m diameter of the outer column was fixed in all calculations for anom and ur substantial periodic cross flow motion has been observed for headings 0 11 25 and 22 5 in the u r range between 5 and 10 while the 45 heading showed small cross flow amplitudes across the u r range considered a subset of these measurements with maximum values of cross flow vim amplitudes is then compared to numerical simulations at the same time we present a strategy for vim simulation as we investigate numerical parameters mesh refinement time step and previously the turbulence model detached eddy simulation shear stress transport formulation was used to numerically replicate the experimental observations under sufficiently fine mesh in the region of interest near wake and sufficiently small time step the simulations followed the experimental response of the model to fluid loads very closely suggesting that this numerical strategy is well suited to predict model scale cross flow vim motion due to fluid structure interactions in semisubmersible applications the results of this parametric study should provide useful guidelines for model scale vim simulation previously kim et al 2015 we showed that a computationally less expensive urans turbulence model would give satisfactory results for the flow around a fixed semisubmersible and in free decay tests however we determined with the present study that the cfd requirements for vim simulation are more stringent than for the simulation of flow around a fixed bluff body further we emphasize that there are many details which would depend on particular geometry flow conditions the way vim problem is set up free surface deforming mesh or rigid body etc ideally the ultimate validation of a particular vim problem will be a comparison with experimental data for specific geometry flow conditions and value of interest in the present case we compared the cross flow component of the platform motion however when the experimental data is not available the present findings could serve as a reasonable starting point we anticipate that this work will be useful in full scale simulations which are not likely to have measurement data available ongoing efforts focus on both conventional and paired column semi submersible platform designs effects of scaling full scale vs model scale and damping as well as looking at different design parameters to serve as vim mitigation finally our ongoing work examines measurement and simulation of forces at individual columns and the pontoon to serve as a set of validation data in addition to the vim motions acknowledgments the present cfd results are part of vortex induced vibration study for deep draft

23668,understanding and predicting vortex induced motion vim of offshore systems for deep seawater applications is crucial to improve the system safety and integrity we report on experimental tow tank measurements and numerical simulations of vim of a deep draft offshore platform specifically paired column semisubmersible pc semi the study is carried out in model scale 1 54 at subcritical flow regime with re 104 motion of the floating structure has three degrees of freedom in line cross flow and yaw large periodic cross flow motion is measured for headings 0 11 25 and 22 5 for reduced

solid objects are encountered across many engineering applications including bridges buildings chimney stacks vibrating tubes in heat exchangers and aerial terrestrial and aquatic vehicles in particular this work focuses on the large amplitude motion of a tethered offshore structure induced by periodic vortex shedding from its pillars von karman vortex streets a bluff body immersed in a stream of fluid is susceptible to vortex resonance and galloping instabilities especially when its natural frequency coincides with the vortex shedding frequency recent years have shown an increasing interest in the response of offshore floaters to the action of sea currents waals et al 2007 guoxing et al 2006 goncalves et al 2013 jaime et al 2013 nevertheless accurate prediction of vortex induced vibration or motion viv or vim has proven difficult owing to nonlinear fluid forces and feedback between cylindrical pillars or columns of a multi column floater and the fluid flow blevins 2009 goncalves et al 2012 the trend in offshore oil exploration has been to move into deeper water to satisfy the increasing energy demands and exploit reserves in deep and ultra deep water such as the deep water regions in the gulf of mexico gom depending on the water depth and oil production system design wet tree subsea or dry tree surface lee et al 2014 lim 2009 the industry uses a few predominant platform design concepts tension leg platforms tlps spars and semisubmersibles halkyard 2005 antony et al 2015 the study of vim of offshore platforms has become of utmost importance since many regions experience strong loop currents e g deepwater region of gom which trigger resonant motions due to vortex shedding for instance in moderate water depth up to around 1500 m spar mono column design platforms have proven so far to be a satisfactory solution for oil exploration however the single cylindrical shape of platform or a mono column with high level of current speeds is susceptible to synchronized vortex shedding that induces oscillatory motion with relatively high amplitude on the order of the cylinder s diameter in the gulf of mexico extreme water depths beyond 1800 m are dominated by semi submersibles antony et al 2015 this design also known as a semi has drawn a lot of attention for deep water reservoir development due to large payload capacity and quayside integration feasibility there are two main types of semi submersible design a a four column platform also known as conventional semi or c semi already deployed and operating and b an eight column platform also known as paired column or pc semi which is still in development stage while the latter design is the main focus of this study our results also shed light on the behavior of the c semi design the pc semi is specifically targeted at dry tree applications in the gulf of mexico as an alternative to the spar concept in deep and ultra deep water development depth beyond 1800 m the philosophy of developing the pc semi concept is to utilize conventional designs of hull structure tensioner systems already developed spar like ram style tensioner and well bay arrangements and to maintain quayside integration to avoid extensive offshore installation cost and risk zou et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 the pc semi has eight rectangular columns with rounded corners arranged in pairs at each of the 4 corners the inner columns are thinner than the outer columns also the pc semi draft is deeper and the slenderness ratio is larger than a conventional semi submersible in general larger column slenderness ratio is likely to make the structure more susceptible to vim thus it is anticipated that the pc semi has unique vim response characteristics zou et al 2013 previous survey of the open literature showed that nominal amplitude of cross flow vim motion can be substantially lower in pc semi designs compared to the c semi designs vinayan et al 2015 while there is a reasonable body of work related to conventional semis goncalves et al 2012 2013 ma et al 2014 zeng et al 2014 lie et al 2016 and even more so related to spars halkyard et al 2005 2006 lefevre et al 2013 fujiwara et al 2013 only limited amount of work is available in open literature related to vim response of a pc semi since it is a more recent design concept periodic vim motion manifested through large displacements and drift on the sea surface imposes important static and fatigue loads on the mooring lines and riser system ma et al 2013 over time vim can impact the integrity of vital offshore system components and the overall system safety as a response vim has emerged as an important issue in offshore engineering for oil exploration in ultra deep water antony et al 2015 as well as for offshore wind turbine platforms fujiwara et al 2013 as measurements from the offshore field are mainly proprietary and limited one must rely on model scale tow tank testing and cfd simulations to study vim in general there is a need for a well defined benchmark framework to compare the full scale field data prototype scale to the model scale results and developing experimentally validated practical cfd methodology for applications in model scale and full scale however accurate prediction of vortex induced motion vim using cfd is challenging even at model scale as it requires sufficiently accurate modeling of vortex shedding and interactions between the immersed body and fluid further cfd simulation of vim requires substantial computational resources due to the large mesh size dynamic range of length scales owed to the complex vortex shedding dynamics and long transient vim motion history needed for statistical analyses one typically requires between 10 and 15 fully developed vim cycles in a previous work kim et al 2015 we reported the cfd and experimental results for drag tests flow around a stationary pc semi and compared the drag force as the key validation parameter we also conducted cfd and experiments for free decay where the fluid is stationary while the body undergoes damped oscillations after being taken out of the equilibrium position translation or rotation these free decay tests were used to compare the natural frequency of the system for cross flow and yaw motions the present work adds one more degree of freedom to the system to focus on a more realistic yet complex case of vim motion cross flow in line and yaw with tightly coupled fluid structure interaction fsi the main purpose of the present study is to test the physical validity of our simulations as compared to laboratory scale tow tank experimental measurements scaling these simulations to real size offshore rigs will be the focus of a future study we describe the experimental measurements in section 2 then section 3 presents the theoretical model and numerical setup followed by the experimental and numerical results as well as their comparisons in section 4 finally section 5 summarizes the conclusions of this work 2 experimental measurements the experiments supporting the current study were conducted at marin s tow basin in the netherlands kim et al 2015 zou et al 2014 because of that facility s capability to measure the response of scaled models to vortex induced motions vim for the current study a 1 54 scale model of a pc semi fig 1 was tested in the marin s towing basin fig 1 shows top views of the prototype pc semi and its scaled model detailing their main dimensions these and additional dimensions of prototype and model are listed in table 1 in this section we develop the scaling relationships to estimate the inertial properties of the prototype based on the basin model as well as the governing equations for the dynamical behavior of the prototype the purpose of the current study is to characterize motion in three degrees of freedom with respect to a plane parallel to the water surface that is 1 streamwise translation in line 2 cross flow translation cross flow and 3 rotational motion around the surface normal yaw roll pitch and heave motions were restricted and not considered in the study in fact since vim induced cross flow fatigues the mooring lines and risers of offshore systems its action is critical for the rig s structural integrity therefore this is the key parameter analyzed in the present study in particular the experimentally measured amplitude and frequency of cross flow are used to assess the accuracy and quality of the subsequent cfd simulations fig 2 a contains a schematic of the marin s tow tank facility its basin s dimensions are 240 m long 18 m wide 8 m deep based on the ratio between the submerged frontal area of the model and the basin dimensions the blockage factor is less than 3 as shown in fig 2b the suspension system carriage tows the model at a prescribed velocity while measuring its response to vortex loading as detailed in fig 2c the model is connected to the carriage by means of two vertically oriented pre tensioned springs that provide the needed restoring force in the surface parallel plane a smooth plate 3 m 1 5 m mounted under the carriage sets the model at the desired draft the model was equipped with three air bearings to minimize its friction contact with the smooth plate and freely allow it to respond to vim see fig 2b and c for reference the response of a pc semi to fluid loads is modulated by the stiffness of its anchoring system to replicate this effect the scaled model is mounted on springs whose tension can be modified to obtain the correct scaled system stiffness scaling follows from similarity based on the froude number fr note that the wave effect on the free surface is not taken into account for the current scaling analysis because the froude number turns out to be less than 0 1 in both model and prototype froude similarity implies 1 f r p f r m or 2 u 2 g l p u 2 g l m where u is a characteristic velocity g the magnitude of the gravitational field l a characteristic length and the sub indices p and m stand for prototype and model respectively satisfying equations 1 and 2 ensures that the model is under similar dynamic conditions in a free surface flow environment as the prototype let λ l p l m be the length scaling between the prototype and the model λ 54 for the current case then since both could be considered to be under the same gravitational field the velocity scaling follows from equation 2 3 u p u m λ given that the model and prototype can be floating in water of different salinity it is convenient to express gravity in terms of specific weight in equation 2 then considering that density is in general ρ m l 3 equation 2 becomes 4 u 2 γ m l 4 p u 2 γ m l 4 m from which the mass scaling follows 5 m p m m ϱ λ 3 6 ϱ γ p γ m here ϱ 1 025 is the ratio of specific weights of the water used in the prototype and the model using the ratios λ and ϱ and equations 3 and 5 all other scaling laws can be determined from dimensional considerations alone becker and beér 1977 these laws are summarized in table 2 including their numerical values for the current experiments according to fig 2c the model is attached to two springs which will define the system s response to loading in particular based on the schematic on fig 3 a horizontal loads imposing cross flow or in line displacements can be defined in terms of the geometry of the system and spring characteristics as follows 7 f x x 2 k x 1 l i l x x 2 k x 1 l 0 t 0 k l 0 2 x 2 8 f y y 2 k y 1 l i l y y 2 k y 1 l 0 t 0 k l 0 2 y 2 where k is the spring constant l i l 0 t 0 k is the un stretched spring length l 0 is the initial length of the spring under pre tension t 0 is the pre tension l x x l 0 2 x 2 and l y y l 0 2 y 2 represent the final lengths of the spring under in line and cross flow displacements respectively and x and y are the in line streamwise and cross flow cross stream displacements respectively the factor 2 in front of equations 7 and 8 is the number of springs in the system similarly the yaw generating moment determined is reported in fig 3b these values are listed in table 3 and will be used in the simulations performed herein overall mooring stiffness is represented by horizontal and yaw stiffness values present work does not consider any active damping e g from risers appurtenances and chains we show the recorded time history for all three motion components in fig 4 for one test we usually had 3 repeated tests at each flow condition measurement results shown here are for the baseline case in our study ur 8 and zero heading the semisubmersible is towed in still water along the channel as shown in fig 2 starting from zero velocity it typically takes on the order of 10 15 s for the carriage to accelerate from zero to the uniform velocity which is then maintained through the rest of a test case in response the in line trajectory of the center of gravity of the immersed pc semisubmersible initial peaks to around 0 45 m and then settles to a relatively steady value through the remainder of the run fig 4 top the cross flow motion shows transients through the first one to 2 min and then develops steady oscillatory behavior throughout the rest of the run fig 4 middle this oscillatory cross flow motion is characterized by amplitude and period see equation 29 and related discussion finally the semi exhibits yaw motion within 2 degrees of equilibrium position however with broader frequency spectrum than the cross flow component 3 theoretical model and numerical setup 3 1 turbulence model the behavior of a turbulent flow whose first statistical moment is unsteady can be modeled by decomposing its instantaneous pressure and velocity fields into the summation of a low pass and a high pass filtered signal 9 u i x i t u i x i t u i x i t 10 p x i t p x i t p x i t where u i x i t and p x i t are the velocity and pressure fields respectively t is the time coordinate and x i is the set of spatial coordinates with i 1 2 3 here is the low pass filter defined in equation 11 as a moving time average of length t 11 1 t t t 2 t t 2 d t in steady turbulent flows the result of loses its time dependence that is t can be made arbitrarily large without changing the result and simply becomes the time average of the signal and equations 9 and 10 become the classical reynolds decomposition the primed quantities on the right hand side of equations 9 and 10 represent the high pass filtered portion of the signals or simply the turbulent fluctuations these are obtained by subtracting the low pass portion of the signal from the original field this decomposition is consistent with the formulation of rodi s rodi 1993 for flows with long wavelength periodic and short wavelength stochastic fluctuations after introducing the decomposed fields 9 and 10 into the continuity and momentum equations for an incompressible fluid with no body forces and using the low pass filter 11 in the system of equations one obtains 12 u i x i 0 13 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j u i u j x j here ρ and ν are the density and kinematic viscosity respectively and τ i j u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor summation over repeated indices is implied in these equations this system is dubbed unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations urans due to its close relation to classical rans note that τ i j is a symmetric second order tensor that introduces six new unknowns to the system without adding more equations hence the system requires a closure formulation to be solvable a typical approach boussinesq 1877 boussinesq 1877 is to introduce a turbulent viscosity ν t mathematically analogous to the stress rate of strain relation for a newtonian fluid 14 u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i 2 3 k δ i j where δ i j is the kronecker delta and k 1 2 u i u i is the turbulent kinetic energy equation 14 reduces the number of new unknowns from six to two that is the turbulent viscosity ν t and the turbulent kinetic energy k this study will follow the shear stress transport sst formulation of menter 1993 1994 to model the turbulent viscosity without going into details this formulation defines the turbulent viscosity as proportional to the ratio between the turbulent kinetic energy and a function of vorticity ω further the model adds two more transport equations one for k and one for ω each containing a set of constants calibrated experimentally because of these additional transport equations this is called a two equation model the value of these constants and the form of the transport equation for ω are different in the inner and outer regions of boundary layers depending on the region of the flow the resulting two equation model coincides with the k ω model inner region see wilcox 1988 for details or the k ε model outer region and free stream see jones and launder 1972 launder and sharma 1974 squires et al 2005 khalak and williamson 1997 for details where ε is the viscous dissipation noteworthy the sst formulation expresses the dissipation equation in the outer region in terms of vorticity to simplify the jump between k ω and k ε models the two equations of the sst model are re written here for completeness 15 k t u j k x j u i u j u i x j β ω k x j ν σ k ν t k x j 16 ω t u j ω x j γ ν t u i u j u i x j β ω 2 x j ν

wavelength and the short wavelength components that is when the time scale of turbulent fluctuations is too short compared to the time scale of the slow varying component recovered by the low pass filter 11 when this is not the case like in separated flow around bluff bodies there would be interactions between the turbulent fluctuations and the large scale slow varying components that could challenge the standard calibration of urans models becker and beér 1977 in such cases the applicability of urans without further experimental calibration would be questionable a different formulation large eddy simulation les can be used in the outer region and all the way to the free stream to go around the need for new experimental calibration the main principle of les is to simulate the energetic scales down to an appropriate threshold within the inertial range of turbulent flows while modeling the rest of the scales down to the dissipative range the basic premise behind this formulation is that small scales tend toward universal cascading behavior this premise seems to hold for high reynolds numbers and away from walls near walls the presence of boundary layers would affect homogeneity in essence les uses the same averaged equations as urans 12 and 13 but the definition of the reynolds stress tensor τ i j is different while urans seeks to use physical quantities to define τ i j les uses what is known as a sub grid model which is based on a characteristic measure of the computational grid spacing that being said the strategy of the present work is to keep the sst formulation but transitioning to les instead of the k ε model in the outer region of boundary layers and free stre this formulation is basically a form of what is known as detached eddy simulation becker and beér 1977 frohlich and terzi 2008 spalart and allmaras 1992 spalart 2000 2009 which combines the advantages of the k ω wall model with the ones of les away from the wall effectively we implement the les formulation into our sst model by means of the length scale δ which we strategically left undefined in equations 19 and 23 24 δ min δ sst c des δ 25 c des c des k ω f i c des k ε 1 f

this article we will refer to our numerical scheme as ddes sst 3 2 numerical scheme and discretization a cell centered finite volume based navier stoke fluid solver i e ansys fluent15 2 was used to solve the above defined model in the domain of interest ansys fluent 15 0 user s 2014 the transient terms are discretized using a bounded first order implicit time formulation which is required with the dynamic mesh approach in ansys fluent the overall size of the computational domain in this simulation is 45 m 18 m 5 m see fig 5 a for reference tow tank basin depth was 8 m however the 5 m depth of the cfd domain is sufficient to capture vim while making the domain smaller and thus computationally less expensive the computational domain was divided in three basic regions that were discretized differently according to resolution requirements see fig 5b for reference region 1 is attached to the pc semi to capture near wall behavior as such it has the smallest element size of all regions this mesh is composed by eight prism layers around the solid structure starting with a thickness of 0 5 mm at the wall and growing in thickness with a factor of 1 2 throughout the eight layers this initial element thickness is approximately equivalent to two wall units y y w y 2 motivated by the necessity of resolving scales of size similar to the viscous scale y near the wall this will ensure capturing a dynamic range in the turbulent boundary layer that will include both ends of the inertial range of the energy cascade the viscous scale is defined in terms of the wall shear stress τ w as 27 y ν ρ τ w though the wall shear stress is not really known a priori its value is estimated based on the case of a turbulent boundary layer under zero pressure gradient for the free stream conditions studied herein this is a reasonable approximation to define the smallest meshing size in this domain on the other hand the lateral characteristic length of the near wall elements is 1 5cm region 2 is a cylinder surrounding region 1 and its purpose is to capture detached vortices and turbulence behavior the mesh in this region is composed by tetrahedral elements with characteristic cell size of 5cm 0 14d where d 35 9 cm is the characteristic length of the outer columns region 1 could also be considered as the boundary layer region and region 2 as the near wake region where massive flow separation and vortex shedding take place together these two regions are the near region region 3 has the purpose of capturing free stream and far wake behavior and hence its resolution is the coarsest of all regions being composed of tetrahedral elements with characteristic mesh size of 50cm this region is considered the outer region and it is attached to the near wake region by a non conformal mesh interface for simplicity only the submerged portion of the semisubmersible platform is considered in the computational domain see region 1 in fig 5b after meshing the domain with the above described strategy the total number of volume elements is 6 1 million the effects of the basin s walls are assumed to be small and thus neglected in the simulation the inlet condition is specified as a homogeneously distributed reduced velocity u r defined as follows 28 u r u f d where u f and d are the free stream velocity natural frequency and effective diameter respectively the characteristic length d is the pc semi s outer column diagonal d 0 36 m in model scale see fig 1d and table 1 for reference and is fixed in this study i e d does not change with heading the simulation is repeated under different inlet flow conditions in which the reduced velocity is modified to different values in the interval 4 u r 10 pressure outlet condition is defined at the back wall right hand side in fig 5b symmetric boundary conditions are adopted on the two sidewalls top and bottom walls of the domain water surface and the bottom of the channel respectively are defined as dirichlet boundary conditions known values of velocity u r at the surface and zero at the bottom of the channel or no slip since the froude value is small fr 0 09 free surface is not modeled in this simulation ansys fluent uses dynamic deformable mesh technique to accommodate platform motion the mesh movement in solver is integrated into the iterative solution process within a time step typically the solution for solid motion and fluid flow is solved iteratively within the step so the mesh motion is updated several times each step each time the current flow solution is projected onto the updated mesh nodes at their new locations the motion of the semisubmersible rigid body motion is calculated from solving a corresponding force balance equation for the semisubmersible with a spring based dynamic meshing method and a rigid body solver with three degrees of freedom dof ansys fluent 15 0 user s 2014 dynamic deformable mesh due to vim is applied only to region 3 see fig 5b for reference hence the mesh in regions 1 and 2 remains unaltered while moving as a rigid body attached to the structure as a response to vim forces 3 3 grid independence in order to appropriately utilize the hybrid turbulence model i e ddes sst it is recommended to perform a well designed grid independence study and time step convergence study lie et al 2016 we report the sensitivity analysis of cross flow vim motion with respect to mesh refinement spatial effect and time step temporal effect first to conduct the grid independence study the ddes sst model presented in section 3 1 was solved under three different levels of refinement of the near wake region region 2 in fig 5b while the outer region region 3 in fig 5b remains unrefined details of the three meshes with different levels of refinement in the near wake zone are presented in table 4 the reduced velocity was set to u r 8 for this assessment unless noted otherwise numerical simulation results are shown for zero heading fig 1d the normalized nominal cross flow amplitude a nom d and the average zero crossing period t z responses of the pc semi under these different refinement levels were observed as indicators of convergence here the nominal cross flow amplitude is defined as follows 29 a nom 2 s t d e v y t i e a square root of 2 multiplied by the standard deviation of the cross flow motion y t further t z is simply defined by counting the number of times that the model crosses its transversal equilibrium position during a given period of time in the positive direction of y axis see fig 4 and related discussion at the end of section 2 for more details while both the experiments and cfd ran from zero time i e t 0 and the body at rest no initial velocity applied or prescribed for the body it takes a certain period of time for vim oscillatory motion to develop we use 12 to 15 fully developed vim cycles to calculate anom and tz and exclude the initial 3 to 5 vim developing cycles as the motion hasn t fully developed it should be noted that this mesh refinement study is not independent of time step given that we enforce the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition to ensure numerical convergence sarpkaya 2004 singh and mittal 2005 in the present case we enforced cfl 0 1 which implies the following relation between mesh size and time step 30 u δ t δ s 0 1 as a result the time step will also be refined as the mesh is refined in the near wake region nevertheless mesh convergence analysis was carried out and the results are presented in fig 6 for this analysis at least 15 cycles of cross flow motion were used to determine a nom d and t z for the present study with main focus on providing engineering estimate for cross flow vim we consider a simulation valid if the numerical results for a nom d and t z fall within 10 and 5 of their respective experimental results noting that reported experimental measurements also have an 5 error as can be seen in fig 6a the coarse mesh m1 does not produce a valid result for a nom d while both the baseline m2 and fine m3 meshes can be considered valid since their results fall within 10 of the experimental value of a nom d on the other hand according to fig 6b all meshes tested produce valid results for t z nevertheless the results from a nom d and t z calculation with three different mesh types conclude that m2 as a feasible discretization for the current simulation campaign on the other hand fig 7 shows vortex shedding from the columns of the pc semi these coherent motions were detected using the q criterion the q criterion considers that vortices are defined by regions in which the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor is positive fig 7 clearly demonstrates that detection of vortex activity increases with mesh refinement if the purpose of this study were to conduct a detailed assessment of turbulence generated at the wake of the pc semi then the obvious choice for mesh refinement would be m3 or even finer however the purpose of this study is to determine the response of the pc semi to vortex induced forces in the hierarchy of turbulent scales the larger eddies carry most of the kinetic energy ergo momentum and the energy and momentum content tapers down as eddy size decreases henceforth to study vim we just need to resolve the range of larger scale eddies that carry enough momentum to induce significant forces in the pc semi in fact our initial observations of the effect of mesh refinement on a nom d indicate that m2 is enough to replicate the experimental response of the pc semi this means that the additional vortices resolved by m3 are too small to add any significant load to the pc semi in conclusion since there is not any significant gain in accuracy of capturing cross flow vim motion of the floater by increasing mesh refinement beyond the level of m2 but there is a significant increase in computational cost by refining the mesh to the level of m3 m2 is selected as the optimal mesh for the present study 3 4 time step refinement in order to evaluate time step effect on the fidelity of our simulations we conducted a series of simulations with the baseline mesh m2 for the same inlet conditions as in the mesh independence analysis u r 8 these simulations were conducted for time steps of 0 1s 0 06s and 0 03s keeping all other parameters fixed as a result the average value of the cfl condition in the near wake region were 0 4 0 2 and 0 1 respectively see equation 30 for reference the results are shown in fig 8 demonstrating that as time step decreases the value of a nom d gets closer to the experimental result in fact among the tested values only the time step of 0 03s falls within the region of acceptance 10 error band consequently the mean value of cfl 0 1 in the near wake zone is sufficient to ensure adequate fidelity in our vim simulation on the other hand as with the mesh refinement analysis time step selection has less effect on the value of t z which remains within acceptable values regardless of time step choice this result speaks of the robustness of this particular output as in the experiment the simulations start with the pc semi at the equilibrium position with zero initial velocity at in line cross flow and yaw the pc semi takes some time to reach its full motion amplitudes and periodicity this initial developing period decreases in the simulation as the time step is decreased i e cross flow periodic vim motion develops faster reinforcing the need for using the smallest time step possible in the simulation kim et al 2015 vinayan et al 2015 antony et al 2016 4 results and discussion the amplitude of vim cross flow motion is described by normalized nominal cross flow amplitude a nom d which is a dimensionless number based on the statistically determined standard deviation of y t over sufficiently high number of vim cycles anom and the characteristic dimension of the platform column d we define d as the diameter of the outer column d 0 36 m in model scale see fig 1d experimental measurements were conducted at several different headings or encounter angles of the incoming main flow shown in fig 9 for all headings results are reported using identical characteristic length d 0 36 m for both a nom d and u r note that some reports with rectangular columns may adjust the characteristic length for specific heading second for comparison of the present results to the earlier studies with conventional semisubmersibles note that c semi studies often have a different heading convention i e rotated by 45 for each heading tests were performed over a range of reduced velocity values u r from u r 3 to u r 16 results are summarized in fig 9 a number of cases of interest high amplitude was repeated up to three times to observe statistical variability experimental uncertainty is within 5 for each measured cross flow amplitude for u r 3 the cross flow amplitudes are very small and almost identical for all headings as u r is increased to 4 a sharp increase in amplitude is observed for all headings except for the 45 heading for zero heading and u r 4 and 5 we observe large scatter in the experimental data as this is the onset of the lock in the range of ur where vim is taking place for these u r values although initial conditions for each repeated run are nominally identical small variations in the experimental conditions residual currents and turbulence in the basin can cause relatively large variations in the measured amplitudes interestingly very little scatter is recorded in the cross flow period considerable periodic cross flow motion has been observed for headings 0 11 25 and 22 5 in the u r range between 5 and 10 so called lock in region large cross flow amplitude in this u r range is consistent for both c semi and pc semi where previous survey of the available data vinayan et al 2015 revealed that a c semi could have nominal cross flow amplitudes that are 50 or more higher compared to the pc semi designs from the present tests the pc semi is particularly prone to vim at headings between zero and 22 5 the maximum anom d occurs at zero heading between u r 7 and 9 at this u r range and heading the long term fatigue of the mooring lines and risers in the offshore system will be affected the most by high cross flow amplitude hence we define the case of zero heading and u r 8 as the baseline case in our numerical study time history of the in line motion cross flow motion and yaw are shown earlier in fig 4 end of section 2 six different cases at zero heading were computed as the amplitude is the largest for these cases each one at a different reduced velocity u r 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 flow regime characteristics for each reduced velocity are shown in table 5 the free stream velocity u is a prescribed variable but it is also linked to the reduced velocity via equation 28 the reynolds number is determined from the geometry diameter of the outer column free stream velocity and kinematic viscosity of sea water ν 1 83 10 6 m2 s according to the values of the reynolds number the flow around the model is in the subcritical regime 500 r e 2 10 5 where the boundary layers around the upstream pillar i e column have not endured transition to turbulence but the vortices shed from the pillar are turbulent fig 10 compares time histories of all three motion components 3 degrees of freedom between numerical simulation and tow tank measurements noting that the cross flow is the key motion component considered in our study we present the histories for the baseline case zero heading and u r 8 from these results the pc semi takes some time to reach a state of fully developed cross flow oscillation around 40 s in the cfd case shown in fig 10a and around 70s in the tow tank test in fig 10b initial transients were excluded from statistical analyses in both cfd and experimental data analysis the data after that initial transient was used to determine the statistical variables i e normalized nominal cross flow amplitude and the average zero crossing period t z for the numerical results the time period simulated corresponded to around 15 vim cycles of cross flow motion which was determined sufficient for the statistical analyses adding more cycles to the calculations prolonged the computing time without changing the statistically determined amplitude for the tow tank tests the number of cycles was determined by the length of the channel and by the ur for specific flow condition see fig 4 450 s for the baseline case test from equation 29 the nominal amplitude a nom is defined as 2 s t d e v y t the normalized nominal amplitude a nom d determined experimentally and numerically is shown in fig 11 a fig 11 shows a very good agreement between the experimental data and the simulations numerical prediction for both the normalized nominal amplitude and zero crossing period is within 5 of the measured values across the u r range of interest which is acceptable for engineering applications we reiterate that both experimental and numerical values of amplitude and period is obtained from statistical analyses of relatively long time series such results lend credibility to the ddes sst method to predict the behavior of the model scale vim studied here and extend the study to a real scale prototype in our ongoing and future work simulation was also conducted at 45 heading and the baseline u r 8 anom d was reduced by more than a factor of 3 when the heading was changed from zero to 45 which is consistent with the measurements further in a previous study kim et al 2015 we demonstrated that the use of urans model with the remaining parameters of the numerical model identical mesh time step can overestimate cross flow amplitudes by more than 20 interestingly the average zero crossing period showed reasonable agreement with experiments for both ddes sst and urans in contrast the free decay and current drag tests are shown to be less sensitive to turbulence model and to an extent mesh refinement therefore computationally less expensive urans can be used to accurately predict the natural frequency and drag forces in these cases finally the computational model described in section 3 was implemented with ansys fluent 15 0 and solved in a 16 node cluster each node has eight dual socket intel xeon 5500 processors 2 66 ghz 4 core nehalem and 24 gb of ram with these resources a typical calculation time is 7 5 days to obtain up to 15 full cross flow cycles between 4 and 5 min of simulated time 5 summary and concluding remarks in this study a 1 54 scale model of a paired column semisubmersible pc semi was used to conduct tow tank experiments at the marin tow tank facility over a range of reduced velocity u r from 3 to 12 and for several different headings characteristic length d 0 36 m diameter of the outer column was fixed in all calculations for anom and ur substantial periodic cross flow motion has been observed for headings 0 11 25 and 22 5 in the u r range between 5 and 10 while the 45 heading showed small cross flow amplitudes across the u r range considered a subset of these measurements with maximum values of cross flow vim amplitudes is then compared to numerical simulations at the same time we present a strategy for vim simulation as we investigate numerical parameters mesh refinement time step and previously the turbulence model detached eddy simulation shear stress transport formulation was used to numerically replicate the experimental observations under sufficiently fine mesh in the region of interest near wake and sufficiently small time step the simulations followed the experimental response of the model to fluid loads very closely suggesting that this numerical strategy is well suited to predict model scale cross flow vim motion due to fluid structure interactions in semisubmersible applications the results of this parametric study should provide useful guidelines for model scale vim simulation previously kim et al 2015 we showed that a computationally less expensive urans turbulence model would give satisfactory results for the flow around a fixed semisubmersible and in free decay tests however we determined with the present study that the cfd requirements for vim simulation are more stringent than for the simulation of flow around a fixed bluff body further we emphasize that there are many details which would depend on particular geometry flow conditions the way vim problem is set up free surface deforming mesh or rigid body etc ideally the ultimate validation of a particular vim problem will be a comparison with experimental data for specific geometry flow conditions and value of interest in the present case we compared the cross flow component of the platform motion however when the experimental data is not available the present findings could serve as a reasonable starting point we anticipate that this work will be useful in full scale simulations which are not likely to have measurement data available ongoing efforts focus on both conventional and paired column semi submersible platform designs effects of scaling full scale vs model scale and damping as well as looking at different design parameters to serve as vim mitigation finally our ongoing work examines measurement and simulation of forces at individual columns and the pontoon to serve as a set of validation data in addition to the vim motions acknowledgments the present cfd results are part of vortex induced vibration study for deep draft

23669,this study attempts to explore and distinguish the effects of internal flow induced centrifugal force and coriolis force on the parametric instability of deepwater drilling risers the governing equation of a fluid conveying flexible riser subjected to parametric excitations is established at first which is then reduced into a system of first order linear equations by use of the galerkin method with attention to the coriolis related skew symmetric matrix the stability charts of a deepwater drilling riser at different internal flow velocities are plotted by applying the floquet theory and the effects of the centrifugal force and coriolis force on the primary instability have been identified distinguished and exemplified owing to the centrifugal force effect which can reduce the effective tension and decrease the natural frequencies of the riser the simple instability zones are enlarged and shifted in the stability chart and more modes can be triggered in the chosen excitation domain on the other hand the simple resonance zones become narrower ascribed to the coriolis force s damping effect the most notable finding is that the coriolis force creates and or strengthens the coupling effect of excited modes which can make the combination resonance much more profound keywords parametric instability internal flow effect floquet theory deepwater drilling

has driven offshore exploration into deep and ultra deep waters which imposes big challenges to offshore equipment for a marine riser greater depths means longer and slender and the riser starts exhibiting new dynamic features which requires more careful analysis for safe operations for example although the basic mechanism of viv vortex induced vibration is well documented in the literature the mixture of standing and travelling waves occurs in the viv of a flexible riser which is far from being well understood williamson and govardhan 2008 jaiswal 2009 wu et al 2012 teixeira and morooka

witnessed it is noted that the vivs can be depressed when the pipe loses energy to the inner flow for a cantilevered flexible riser for a deepwater drilling riser ife has received great attentions for recoil analysis in an emergency disconnection scenario and it has demonstrated that the discharging flow imposed drag loading can significantly affect the recoil behavior lang et al 2009 grϕnevik 2013 li et al 2016 at normal operation condition the heave motion of the floating platform induces a fluctuation of axial tension in time which can lead to parametric instability of a drilling riser although the parametric stability of marine risers has been widely studied park and jung 2002 brugmans 2005 kuiper et al 2008 tang and shao 2012 yang et al 2013 yang and xiao 2014 the internal flow velocity is always assumed to be sufficiently small and ife has been neglected this study is thus motivated to investigate the ife on the parametric stability of a flexible drilling riser by floquet theory in the plane of the frequency and amplitude of the harmonic heave motion of the platform 2 simulation model 2 1 assumptions and drilling riser model a typical drilling riser system is sketched in fig 1 a a drill string is located in the drilling riser which conveys drilling mud with rock cuttings during drilling operations the top end of the riser is connected to a floating platform by use of a heave compensator which provides a tensile force and compensates for the relative motion with the platform whenever there are waves as commonly done the heave compensator can be modelled as a pretensioned vertical spring with a stiffness k that is much lower than the axial stiffness of the riser the tension exerted by the top tensioner system is assumed to be t 0 which can be expressed as 1 t 0 t a k a sin ω t where t a is a constant pretension a and ω are the amplitude and frequency of the platform heave t is time the bottom end of the riser is connected to the wellhead via the bop blow out preventer the connections of the riser to top tensioner system and the well head can be modelled as hinges the riser model with adopted coordinates is illustrated in fig 1 b the riser is assumed to be initially straight which consists of a pipe of length l with structure mass per unit length m p density ρ r and bending stiffness e i the internal drilling mud has a mass of m i per unit length of the riser with density ρ i and a downward constant velocity u i the surrounding fluid has a mass per unit length of m e with density ρ e the internal and external diameters of the riser are d i and d e respectively which are relatively small compared to l the origin of the adopted coordinates are set at the top end of the riser o 0 an arbitrary material point of the riser can be expressed as x 0 y 0 in lagrangian coordinate and since the initial displacement is zero y 0 x 0 0 0 euler coordinate x y is adopted for the deformed state and g is the gravity acceleration in the x direction in the following a prime stands for x 0 and an overdot denotes t respectively 2 2 research objective ife has been well studied employing variable fluid conveying pipes in the air païdoussis

first term is the centrifugal force the second term is coriolis force and the third term is the inertial force the centrifugal force acts as a tangential follower compressive load which can definitely affect the natural frequencies and the effective tension along the riser the coriolis force can introduce a skew symmetric anti symmetric matrix and therefore it can strength the coupling effect of exited modes inevitably païdoussis 2014 to illustrate ife the argand diagram of a purely elastic pinned pined pipe in the air which describes the complex frequencies ω n n 1 2 versus the dimensionless internal flow velocity u i u i m i e i u i l is plotted in fig 2 where the real part r e ω n are the natural frequencies and the imaginary part im ω n are related to damping researcher can refer meng et al 2017b for detail when u i π ω n are pure real and decreasing with the increase of u i when u i exceeds a critical value π the system loses stability by buckling therefore the internal flow velocity can be divided into subcritical region when u i π and supercritical region when u i π when u i is sufficiently high a couple flutter phenomenon via the first and second mode is observed actually this flutter does not exist since the ife is conservative for a pinned pinned pipe and there is no energy to sustain the oscillation it has demonstrated that the dynamics of the pipe in the supercritical region requires nonlinear analysis sadeghi and païdoussis 2009 païdoussis 2014 it is emphasized that linear analysis is enough for ife investigation in the subcritical region and a buckling flutter coupled instability has been captured in the supercritical region when the riser undergoing viv can gain energy from the external flow meng et al 2017b for the parametric instability of a marine riser kuiper et al 2008 have distinguished two qualitatively different mechanisms the first type of instability is classical parametric resonance that occurs solely due to periodic time variation of the axial tension and the second type occurs if the amplitude of vibration of the platform is large enough to change tension into compression in a segment of the riser which can cause dangerously large dynamic stresses in the riser furthermore researchers have demonstrated that the varying tension along the riser resulting from gravity effect leads to the coupling effect of natural modes and the occurrence of combination resonance brugmans 2005 tang and shao 2012 as the first step of study the goal of this work is to explore and distinguish the effects of the centrifugal force

marine riser is conventionally expressed as a quadratic function of the velocity of structural motion relative to the surrounding water a linearized morison equation which is a function of the maximum displacement of the normal modes and an equivalent viscous damping coefficient can be utilized brugmans 2005 tang and shao 2012 when the riser is immersed in still water kuiper et al 2007 proposed a formula for the fluid drag f d as 3 f d μ a 1 y 1 2 ρ f d e a 2 y y where μ is the dynamic viscosity of seawater around the riser a 1 and a 2 are two dimensionless constants calibrated based on experiments assuming the riser is surrounded by quiescent water the parametric instability of a 2000 m ttr top tensioned riser has been determined using eq 3 assuming a 2 0 by kuiper et al 2008 owing to the low stiffness of the heave compensator the axial deformation of the riser can be neglected brugmans 2005 kuiper et al 2008 and referring to païdoussis 2014 the linear equation of lateral motion of the riser can be proposed as 4 m s y 2 m i u i y m i u i 2 y w s y e i y t 0 w s l x 0 y μ a 1 y 0 where the mass of the riser system is m s m p m i m a the added mass is m a c a m e with added

element of damping matrix c is c i j the element of the stiffness matrix k is k i j and i j 1 2 n when omitting the time varying component eq 8 leads to the standard eigenvalue formula and then the natural frequencies of the riser ω n n 1 at different internal flow velocities can be estimated on the other hand eq 8 can be translated into 9 q a t q where a t b 1 e with the period 2 π ω the floquet theory is adopted to deal with the parametric stability employing the periodic matrix a t a state transition matrix φ t is assumed to be the fundamental matrix to eq 9 which consists of 2 n linearly independent solutions then a matrix differential equation 10 φ t a t φ t is obtained the matrix φ t can be computed numerically by integrating eq 10 over one period assuming φ t is an identity matrix at t 0 the stability criterion is defined as r e λ i 2 i m λ i 2 1 i 1 n where λ i are the eigenvalues of the state transition matrix at the end of one period brugmans 2005 then the stability chart can be plotted in which the dotted domains correspond to unstable behavior of the riser moreover given an initial value e i 1 e i 0 i 1 n eq 8 can be solved numerically by use of runga kutta method and the dynamic response of the riser can be examined in time domain the convergence in the numerical iterations can be confirmed by increasing the mode number n and decreasing the time step size d t a matlab code has been developed based on the algorithm 2 5 validation of the developed code to validate the developed code the ttr in kuiper et al 2008 is introduced here and the system parameters are listed in table 1 the effective tension t e along the riser is obtained as 11 t e w s x 0 f s l k a sin ω t where the dimensionless pretension factor f s 1 3 as it is common in practice to use a pretension that is 1 3 times higher than the submerged weight of the riser in the offshore industry the stiffness of the heave compensator k is typically tuned to compensate for the submerged weight of the riser in case that the platform heaves with a given critical amplitude a c 10 m as 12 k l w s a c the dynamic stability of the ttr in table 1 is determined by use of the developed code good convergence characteristics have been observed and the simulations have been validated after comparing with kuiper et al 2008 the stability charts at a 1 1 35 10 4 and a 1 2 7 10 4 when n 20 d t 0 01 s are shown in fig 3 a and b respectively which compare very well with kuiper et al 2008 3 ife on the parametric stability of a flexible riser 3 1 a deepwater drilling riser system the parameters of the deep sea drilling riser system in grϕnevik 2013 are listed in table 2 it assumes that the density of the drilling mud is ρ i 1600 kg m 3 and the gravity acceleration is g 9 8 m s 2 this flexible drilling riser is employed here for ife investigations the damping coefficient a 1 is assumed to be a 1 2 7 10 4 the effective tension is calculated by eq 11 and the stiffness of the tensioner is calculated by eq 12 3 2 natural frequency versus internal flow velocity the first six natural frequencies of the riser ω n n 1 6 rad s versus internal flow velocity from u i 0 to 60 m s are plotted in fig 4 by use of a twenty mode galerkin approximation the natural frequencies decrease with the increase of u i and the critical internal flow velocity is predicted to be u i 50 7 m s the varying trends of the natural frequencies are in consistent with literature and this study focuses on the ife in the subcritical region when u i 50 7 m s 3 3 ife on the parametric stability of the drilling riser referring to brugmans 2005 the low order instability zones are more important than high order instability zones which can be reduced rapidly if a linear damping term is introduced and higher order instability zones are difficult to be exhibited due to the overlap of instability zones thus this study focus on the first order instability also named as primary instability which occurs for an excitation frequency that equals two times a natural frequency called simple resonance or is a summation of two natural frequencies called combination resonance the stability charts of the riser at u i 0 10 20 30 m s are plotted in fig 5 the excitation frequency ω varies from 0 1 to 3 5 rad s whereas the amplitude a varies from 0 to 7 0 m the stability chart at u i 0 is shown in fig 5 a in which the first order instability zones of the first six modes are excited in the excitation range the combination resonance phenomenon occurs which can be contributed to the fact that the effective tension varies linearly from the top to the bottom due to the effect of gravity compared to the simple resonance the areas of the combination resonance are much smaller and of less importance these observations are in consistent with brugmans 2005 the stability charts at u i 10 20 30 m s are plotted in fig 5 b d respectively the ife on the parametric instability of the drilling riser can be summarized as follows 1 with the increase of internal flow velocity the instability zones are moving towards to the low frequency range in the stability chart and when u i is sufficiently high more natural modes can be triggered in the excitation range for example distinct from fig 5 a the first order instability zone of the sixth mode ω 2 ω 6 is fully displayed at u i 20 m s as shown in fig 5 c and a new instability zone emerges obviously at u i 30 m s in fig 5 d these can be explained by that the centrifugal force can decrease the natural frequencies of the riser system as shown in fig 4 2 as the centrifugal force can decrease the effective tension it increases the instability of the second type in kuiper et al 2008 and definitely enlarge the simple resonance areas meanwhile the areas of instability zones can be reduced by the damping effect of coriolis force after examining fig 5 the simple resonance zones becomes narrower with the increase of u i which means the destabilization effect of the centrifugal force cannot counteract the damping effect of coriolis force on the other hand the combination resonance becomes more remarkable with the increase of u i and the combined resonances become as dominant as the simply resonance at u i 20 and 30 m s this can be contributed to the fact that the coriolis force can strengthen the coupling effect of natural modes and the coupling effect of modes resulting from the gravity force becomes more significant when the effective tension decreases 3 4 ife on the parametric stability of the drilling riser without considering gravity effect to further investigate the effects of centrifugal force and coriolis force the stability of the riser in table 2 is examined neglecting the gravity effect i e g 0 this assumption is also of practical significance as new concepts for the design of offshore risers and pipelines have emerged and a submerged floating pipeline to transfer fluid and gas between ttr and fpso floating production storage and offloading has been proposed as shown in fig 8 fyrileiv et al 2013 zhang and yang 2016 in the following stability charts ω varies from 0 1 to 2 5 rad s and a varies from 0 to 5 0 m the stability chart of the riser at u i 0 is shown in fig 6 a in which the first order instability zones of the first six modes are excited in the excitation range as expected the coupling phenomena of excited modes are not observed when comparing to fig 5 a since there is no coriolis force and gravity force to create the coupling effect of modes the time traces of the modal coordinates at p 1 ω 0 6 rad s a 0 7 m and p 2 ω 0 65 rad s a 0 8 m are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively the riser is stable at p 1 and all the modal coordinates are decaying out with time increase when the riser loses the stability at p 2 only the second mode is excited and the corresponding coordinate e 2 is increasing exponentially with time increase the stability chart of the riser when only accounting for the centrifugal force effect the coriolis force term is omitted in eq 7 at u i 20 m s is shown in fig 6 b when comparing to fig 6 a at u i 0 the instability zones in fig 6 b become much wider which can be explained by that the centrifugal force can decrease the effective tension and increase the instability of the second type in kuiper et al 2008 moreover the instability zones are shifted to the left ascribed to the centrifugal force which can decrease the natural frequencies of the riser system as shown in fig 9 a from fig 6 b it is noted that the combination resonance is not observed and the riser at p 1 ω 0 6 rad s a 0 7 m is destabilized by the centrifugal force the time traces of the modal coordinates at p 1 are shown in fig 9 b where only the second mode is excited and no coupling phenomenon of the modes is observed the stability chart of the riser when only accounting for the coriolis force effect the centrifugal force term is omitted in eq 7 at u i 20 m s is shown in fig 6 c when comparing to fig 6 a at u i 0 the instability zones are not shifted since the coriolis force has almost no effect on the natural frequencies as shown in fig 10 a however it is found that the simple resonance zones becomes narrower owing to the damping effect of coriolis force and the riser at p 2 ω 0 65 rad s a 0 8 m have been stabilized by the coriolis force as shown in fig 6 d the time traces of the modal coordinates at p 2 are shown in fig 10 b the most notable phenomena in fig 6 c is that the combined resonances are exhibited obviously which can only be explained by the coupling effect of natural modes resulting from the coriolis force since the gravity force effect is omitted it is also found that the decay process in fig 10 b becomes less concordant the time traces of the modal coordinates at p 3 ω 0 63 rad s a 1 1 m is shown in fig 10 c where the first three modes have been excited and the second mode is dominant the stability chart of the riser when accounting for the combined effects of the centrifugal force and the coriolis force at u i 20 m s is shown in fig 6 d the riser at p 1 is stable which means that destabilization effect of the centrifugal force cannot counteract the damping effect of coriolis force the riser at p 1 is stable when u i 0 as shown in fig 6 a and destabilized by the centrifugal force as shown in fig 6 b the time traces of the modal coordinates at p 1 are shown in fig 11 a and the coupling of modes in the decay process is also observed the time traces of the first four modal coordinates at p 4 ω 0 73 rad s a 0 9 m are shown in fig 11 b and the first four modes have been excited the ife on the parametric stability of the drilling riser at u i 10 30 40 m s when neglecting the gravity effect are also investigated based on the developed code and same conclusions on the effects of centrifugal force and coriolis force can be drawn 4 conclusions and future study this paper is dedicated to the modelling and simulations of a fluid conveying flexible riser subjected to parametric excitations and the main contribution is an attempt to figure out and distinguish the effects of internal flow induced centrifugal force and coriolis force on the parametric instability of the riser system based on the present study conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 as the internal flow induced centrifugal force acts in the same manner as a compressive load it can decrease the effective tension along the riser thus the centrifugal force can increase the second type of parametric instability in kuiper et al 2008 and enlarges the instability zones in the stability chart as the natural frequencies of the riser system decreases and becomes denser ascribed to the centrifugal force effect the instability domains in the stability chart move towards the lower frequency range and more natural modes can be triggered in a chosen excitation domain moreover for a vertical riser the coupling effect of modes resulting from the gravity force becomes more significant when the effective tension decreases 2 the coriolis force has no effect on the natural frequencies of the riser system and thus cannot shift the instability zones and trigger more modes in a frequency domain however the simple resonances can be reduced by the coriolis forces damping effect and it has demonstrated that the coriolis force creates and or strengthens the coupling effect of the modes which can make the combination resonance much more remarkable the combined resonance can become as dominant as the simple resonance when the internal flow velocity is sufficiently high this conclusion is quite distinct from the results from former studies without considering ife that the combination resonances is quite small and of less importance than the simple resonance brugmans 2005 tang and shao 2012 this finding is of practical significance since the combination resonance can cause more serious damages than the simple one the developed methodology can be employed to predict the stability of flexible marine risers subjected to parametric excitations when operating in extreme water depths however many works remains to be undertaken for example as the heave of the platform is characterized by a random process it is of practical importance to analyze the ife on the parametric instability of a flexible riser subjected to multi frequency parametric excitations with without the combination with incoming flow induced vibrations e g vivs yang et al 2013 yang and xiao 2014 acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge

23669,this study attempts to explore and distinguish the effects of internal flow induced centrifugal force and coriolis force on the parametric instability of deepwater drilling risers the governing equation of a fluid conveying flexible riser subjected to parametric excitations is established at first which is then reduced into a system of first order linear equations by use of the galerkin method with attention to the coriolis related skew symmetric matrix the stability charts of a deepwater drilling riser at different internal flow velocities are plotted by applying the floquet theory and the effects of the centrifugal force and coriolis force on the primary instability have been identified distinguished and exemplified owing to the centrifugal force effect which can reduce the effective tension and decrease the natural frequencies of the riser the simple instability zones are enlarged and shifted in the stability chart and more modes can be triggered in the chosen excitation domain on the other hand the simple resonance zones become narrower ascribed to the coriolis force s damping effect the most notable finding is that the coriolis force creates and or strengthens the coupling effect of excited modes which can make the combination resonance much more profound keywords parametric instability internal flow effect floquet theory deepwater drilling

has driven offshore exploration into deep and ultra deep waters which imposes big challenges to offshore equipment for a marine riser greater depths means longer and slender and the riser starts exhibiting new dynamic features which requires more careful analysis for safe operations for example although the basic mechanism of viv vortex induced vibration is well documented in the literature the mixture of standing and travelling waves occurs in the viv of a flexible riser which is far from being well understood williamson and govardhan 2008 jaiswal 2009 wu et al 2012 teixeira and morooka 2017 with the increase of the flexibility of marine risers ife internal flow effect becomes more remarkably inevitable wu and lou 1991 atadan et al 1997 keber and wiercigroch 2008 chatjigeorgiou 2010 meng and chen 2012 meng et al 2017a b wu and lou 1991 have found that the internal flow can reduce the effect of the effective top tension keber and wiercigroch 2008 have demonstrated that the internal flow can increase the stiffness effect of structural nonlinearity meng et al 2017a b have examined the ife on the vivs of flexible marine risers and the mode switching and sharing are witnessed it is noted that the vivs can be depressed when the pipe loses energy to the inner flow for a cantilevered flexible riser for a deepwater drilling riser ife has received great attentions for recoil analysis in an emergency disconnection scenario and it has demonstrated that the discharging flow imposed drag loading can significantly affect the recoil behavior lang et al 2009 grϕnevik 2013 li et al 2016 at normal operation condition the heave motion of the floating platform induces a fluctuation of axial tension in time which can lead to parametric instability of a drilling riser although the parametric stability of marine risers has been widely studied park and jung 2002 brugmans 2005 kuiper et al 2008 tang and shao 2012 yang et al 2013 yang and xiao 2014 the internal flow velocity is always assumed to be sufficiently small and ife has been neglected this study is thus motivated to investigate the ife on the parametric stability of a flexible drilling riser by floquet theory in the plane of the frequency and amplitude of the harmonic heave motion of the platform 2 simulation model 2 1 assumptions and drilling riser model a typical drilling riser system is sketched in fig 1 a a drill string is located in the drilling riser which conveys drilling mud with rock cuttings during drilling operations the top end of the riser is connected to a floating platform by use of a heave compensator which provides a tensile force and compensates for the relative motion with the platform whenever there are waves as commonly done the heave compensator can be modelled as a pretensioned vertical spring with a stiffness k that is much lower than the axial stiffness of the riser the tension exerted by the top tensioner system is assumed to be t 0 which can be expressed as 1 t 0 t a k a sin ω t where t a is a constant pretension a and ω are the amplitude and frequency of the platform heave t is time the bottom end of the riser is connected to the wellhead via the bop blow out preventer the connections of the riser to top tensioner system and the well head can be modelled as hinges the riser model with adopted coordinates is illustrated in fig 1 b the riser is assumed to be initially straight which consists of a pipe of length l with structure mass per unit length m p density ρ r and bending stiffness e i the internal drilling mud has a mass of m i per unit length of the riser with density ρ i and a downward constant velocity u i the surrounding fluid has a mass per unit length of m e with density ρ e the internal and external diameters of the riser are d i and d e respectively which are relatively small compared to l the origin of the adopted coordinates are set at the top end of the riser o 0 an arbitrary material point of the riser can be expressed as x 0 y 0 in lagrangian coordinate and since the initial displacement is zero y 0 x 0 0 0 euler coordinate x y is adopted for the deformed state and g is the gravity acceleration in the x direction in the following a prime stands for x 0 and an overdot denotes t respectively 2 2 research objective ife has been well studied employing variable fluid conveying pipes in the air païdoussis 2014 and from the linear viewpoint the internal flow induced forces can be obtained as 2 m i t u i x 0 y t u i y x 0 m i u i 2 2 y x 0 2 2 m i u i 2 y x 0 t m i 2 y t 2 in the right hand of eq 2 the first term is the centrifugal force the second term is coriolis force and the third term is the inertial force the centrifugal force acts as a tangential follower compressive load which can definitely affect the natural frequencies and the effective tension along the riser the coriolis force can introduce a skew symmetric anti symmetric matrix and therefore it can strength the coupling effect of exited modes inevitably païdoussis 2014 to illustrate ife the argand diagram of a purely elastic pinned pined pipe in the air which describes the complex frequencies ω n n 1 2 versus the dimensionless internal flow velocity u i u i m i e i u i l is plotted in fig 2 where the real part r e ω n are the natural frequencies and the imaginary part im ω n are related to damping researcher can refer meng et al 2017b for detail when u i π ω n are pure real and decreasing with the increase of u i when u i exceeds a critical value π the system loses stability by buckling therefore the internal flow velocity can be divided into subcritical region when u i π and supercritical region when u i π when u i is sufficiently high a couple flutter phenomenon via the first and second mode is observed actually this flutter does not exist since the ife is conservative for a pinned pinned pipe and there is no energy to sustain the oscillation it has demonstrated that the dynamics of the pipe in the supercritical region requires nonlinear analysis sadeghi and païdoussis 2009 païdoussis 2014 it is emphasized that linear analysis is enough for ife investigation in the subcritical region and a

higher order instability zones are difficult to be exhibited due to the overlap of instability zones thus this study focus on the first order instability also named as primary instability which occurs for an excitation frequency that equals two times a natural frequency called simple resonance or is a summation of two natural frequencies called combination resonance the stability charts of the riser at u i 0 10 20 30 m s are plotted in fig 5 the excitation frequency ω varies from 0 1 to 3 5 rad s whereas the amplitude a varies from 0 to 7 0 m the stability chart at u i 0 is shown in fig 5 a in which the first order instability zones of the first six modes are excited in the excitation range the combination resonance phenomenon occurs which can be contributed to the fact that the effective tension varies linearly from the top to the bottom due to the effect of gravity compared to the simple resonance the areas of the combination resonance are much smaller and of less importance these observations are in consistent with brugmans 2005 the stability charts at u i 10 20 30 m s are plotted in fig 5 b d respectively the ife on the parametric instability of the drilling riser can be summarized as follows 1 with the increase of internal flow velocity the instability zones are moving towards to the low frequency range in the stability chart and when u i is sufficiently high more natural modes can be triggered in the excitation range for example distinct from fig 5 a the first order instability zone of the sixth mode ω 2 ω 6 is fully displayed at u i 20 m s as shown in fig 5 c and a new instability zone emerges obviously at u i 30 m s in fig 5 d these can be explained by that the centrifugal force can decrease the natural frequencies of the riser system as shown in fig 4 2 as the centrifugal force can decrease the effective tension it increases the instability of the second type in kuiper et al 2008 and definitely enlarge the simple resonance areas meanwhile the areas of instability zones can be reduced by the damping effect of coriolis force after examining fig 5 the simple resonance zones becomes narrower with the increase of u i which means the destabilization effect of the centrifugal force cannot counteract the damping effect of coriolis force on the other hand the combination resonance becomes more remarkable with the increase of u i and the combined resonances become as dominant as the simply resonance at u i 20 and 30 m s this can be contributed to the fact that the coriolis force can strengthen the coupling effect of natural modes and the coupling effect of modes resulting from the gravity force becomes more significant when the effective tension decreases 3 4 ife on the parametric stability of the drilling riser without considering gravity effect to further investigate the effects of centrifugal force and coriolis force the stability of the riser in table 2 is examined neglecting the gravity effect i e g 0 this assumption is also of practical significance as new concepts for the design of offshore risers and pipelines have emerged and a submerged floating pipeline to transfer fluid and gas between ttr and fpso floating production storage and offloading has been proposed as shown in fig 8 fyrileiv et al 2013 zhang and yang 2016 in the following stability charts ω varies from 0 1 to 2 5 rad s and a varies from 0 to 5 0 m the stability chart of the riser at u i 0 is shown in fig 6 a in which the first order instability zones of the first six modes are excited in the excitation range as expected the coupling phenomena of excited modes are not observed when comparing to fig 5 a since there is no coriolis force and gravity force to create the coupling effect of modes the time traces of the modal coordinates at p 1 ω 0 6 rad s a 0 7 m and p 2 ω 0 65 rad s a 0 8 m are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively the riser is stable at p 1 and all the modal coordinates are decaying out with time increase when the riser loses the stability at p 2 only the second mode is excited and the corresponding coordinate e 2 is increasing exponentially with time increase the stability chart of the riser when only accounting for the centrifugal force effect the coriolis force term is omitted in eq 7 at u i 20 m s is shown in fig 6 b when comparing to fig 6 a at u i 0 the instability zones in fig 6 b become much wider which can be explained by that the centrifugal force can decrease the effective tension and increase the instability of the second type in kuiper et al 2008 moreover the instability zones are shifted to the left ascribed to the centrifugal force which can decrease the natural frequencies of the riser system as shown in fig 9 a from fig 6 b it is noted that the combination resonance is not observed and the riser at p 1 ω 0 6 rad s a 0 7 m is destabilized by the centrifugal force the time traces of the modal coordinates at p 1 are shown in fig 9 b where only the second mode is excited and no coupling phenomenon of the modes is observed the stability chart of the riser when only accounting for the coriolis force effect the centrifugal force term is omitted in eq 7 at u i 20 m s is shown in fig 6 c when comparing to fig 6 a at u i 0 the instability zones are not shifted since the coriolis force has almost no effect on the natural frequencies as shown in fig 10 a however it is found that the simple resonance zones becomes narrower owing to the damping effect of coriolis force and the riser at p 2 ω 0 65 rad s a 0 8 m have been stabilized by the coriolis force as shown in fig 6 d the time traces of the modal coordinates at p 2 are shown in fig 10 b the most notable phenomena in fig 6 c is that the combined resonances are exhibited obviously which can only be explained by the coupling effect of natural modes resulting from the coriolis force since the gravity force effect is omitted it is also found that the decay process in fig 10 b becomes less concordant the time traces of the modal coordinates at p 3 ω 0 63 rad s a 1 1 m is shown in fig 10 c where the first three modes have been excited and the second mode is dominant the stability chart of the riser when accounting for the combined effects of the centrifugal force and the coriolis force at u i 20 m s is shown in fig 6 d the riser at p 1 is stable which means that destabilization effect of the centrifugal force cannot counteract the damping effect of coriolis force the riser at p 1 is stable when u i 0 as shown in fig 6 a and destabilized by the centrifugal force as shown in fig 6 b the time traces of the modal coordinates at p 1 are shown in fig 11 a and the coupling of modes in the decay process is also observed the time traces of the first four modal coordinates at p 4 ω 0 73 rad s a 0 9 m are shown in fig 11 b and the first four modes have been excited the ife on the parametric stability of the drilling riser at u i 10 30 40 m s when neglecting the gravity effect are also investigated based on the developed code and same conclusions on the effects of centrifugal force and coriolis force can be drawn 4 conclusions and future study this paper is dedicated to the modelling and simulations of a fluid conveying flexible riser subjected to parametric excitations and the main contribution is an attempt to figure out and distinguish the effects of internal flow induced centrifugal force and coriolis force on the parametric instability of the riser system based on the present study conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 as the internal flow induced centrifugal force acts in the same manner as a compressive load it can decrease the effective tension along the riser thus the centrifugal force can increase the second type of parametric instability in kuiper et al 2008 and enlarges the instability zones in the stability chart as the natural frequencies of the riser system decreases and becomes denser ascribed to the centrifugal force effect the instability domains in the stability chart move towards the lower frequency range and more natural modes can be triggered in a chosen excitation domain moreover for a vertical riser the coupling effect of modes resulting from the gravity force becomes more significant when the effective tension decreases 2 the coriolis force has no effect on the natural frequencies of the riser system and thus cannot shift the instability zones and trigger more modes in a frequency domain however the simple resonances can be reduced by the coriolis forces damping effect and it has demonstrated that the coriolis force creates and or strengthens the coupling effect of the modes which can make the combination resonance much more remarkable the combined resonance can become as dominant as the simple resonance when the internal flow velocity is sufficiently high this conclusion is quite distinct from the results from former studies without considering ife that the combination resonances is quite small and of less importance than the simple resonance brugmans 2005 tang and shao 2012 this finding is of practical significance since the combination resonance can cause more serious damages than the simple one the developed methodology can be employed to predict the stability of flexible marine risers subjected to parametric excitations when operating in extreme water depths however many works remains to be undertaken for example as the heave of the platform is characterized by a random process it is of practical importance to analyze the ife on the parametric instability of a flexible riser subjected to multi frequency parametric excitations with without the combination with incoming flow induced vibrations e g vivs yang et al 2013 yang and xiao 2014 acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge
