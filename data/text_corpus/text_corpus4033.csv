literature discussing the phenomenon in coastal aquifers 9 and inland waters in arid and semi arid regions 8 16 18 theemerging threat and disastrous consequences of salinization are also increasingly recognized in diverse ecosystems such as estuaries 19 inland waters 8 freshwater wetlands 3 small islands 20 deltas 21 23 and low lying coastal regions 9 14 24 25 in particular the issue is emerging as a major social ecological concern in global river deltas which are home to over 500 million people with more than seven times the global mean population density 23 26 27 as unique naturally dynamic coastal social ecological systems 26 28 deltas provide important ecosystem services worth trillions of dollars 23 including rich biological diversity fertile alluvial soils and aquatic habitat for fisheries 11 29 many deltas are also challenged by rapid population and economic growth 30 31 environmental degradation 32 and climate change 22 33 34 the threat of climate change is particularly concerning for deltas 35 36 most of which were formed in the early holocene when sea level rise resulting from de glaciation decelerated enough for delta initiation to take place 37 with relative sea level rise actual sea level plus subsidence and diversion of fluvial sediment now increasing rapidly in the emerging anthropocene many deltas are literally sinking 26 32 38 many of the climate related threats to deltas including storm surges flooding and coastal erosion have been abundantly studied 23 26 32 while the study of delta salinization is emerging within specific deltas and ecosystems we

demonstrate various ways in which salinization emerges section 2 reviews recent literature on the impact of salinization on food and water security with a particular focus on the ganges brahmaputra

undeniable societal implications in terms of lost ecosystem services e g fisheries decreased resilience to storm surges 23 29 47 however in densely populated and cultivated deltas these effects are often dwarfed by the sweeping consequences of salinization on food security livelihoods and health fig 2 the effects on food security and livelihood including well being are wide ranging and include declining material resources and income mental health concerns including emotional stress and identity crisis due to deprivation of a sense of place and loss of livelihood viability and migration 4 12 44 2 1 food security and livelihood a agricultural productivity salinization reduces agricultural productivity when salts accumulate in the root zone interfering with plant growth when concentrations exceed the tolerance limits of the crop 11 55 salt in the root zone decreases the germination rate shoot length and root length of certain plants and ultimately lowers crop yield salinity conditions in soils have more recently been reported to influence crop yields through their effect on soil microorganisms with a marked negative effect on respiration 56 decreased respiration affects bacterial decomposition activities and their ability to cycle nutrients which in turn reduces crop yield while declining crop yields associated with salinization are common in low lying deltas 57 58 the issue is particularly urgent in bangladesh a middle income country of 157 million people lying almost exclusively in the gbm delta and vulnerable to the effects of climate change rice production decreased by 15 31 in a salinity affected coastal area of south west bangladesh over a period of about 15 years 59 a trend which is expected to persist as salinization progresses a world bank study suggests that increased salinity alone from a 0 3 m sea level rise will cause a net reduction of 0 5 million metric tons of rice production 60 salinization has forced many small scale farmers to cease rice cultivation and transition to brackish water shrimp farming or to lease or sell their land to larger farmers in some cases resulting in local conflict and violence 61 the seasonal nature of salinity in bangladesh due to monsoon related seasonal freshwater inflows also affects traditional planting practices winter crops in the coastal area which depend on now brackish ground water for irrigation in critical maturity stages are particularly affected 62 although important it is worth noting that reduced crop yields are not the only effect of salinization on food availability in the indus delta salinization has resulted in considerable loss of arable land livestock and freshwater fish all of which are important components of the local diet and resulted in the migration of tens of thousands of people 44 63 b food insecurity when studying the great bengal famine sen 64 famously showed that food insecurity rarely arises from absolute food shortage alone and that food accessibility plays a key role he identified four economic pathways to procure food including own cultivation purchase aid and labor work for food all of which with the exception of aid are affected by salinization across bangladesh in 2011 nearly 50 of low income ever married women skipped at least one meal due to lack of food 65 and the problem is often worse in rural areas with high salinization nearly 60 million people are smallholder subsistence farmers whose food security is threatened by the aforementioned processes 66 although household wealth and education are the most important predictors of food security salinization does play a role in food insecurity especially among poorest and least educated households 12 relative to other households these households generally obtain a higher portion of income from crop production spend a higher portion of their income on food and are most likely to face the greatest consequences of salinization both in terms of lost income and food security over 60 of households in areas with saline soils faced a food crisis between 2009 and 2013 due to decreasing rice production 59 the effects of salinization and decreasing crop yield trickle down to affect various sectors of the rural economy in coastal bangladesh including fishermen wage laborers and others relying on ecosystem services for food 40 67 68 these effects on rural livelihoods coincide with substantial migration to urban slums particularly to dhaka and chittagong with detrimental effects on health and food security households who previously relied on own cultivation now must purchase food with precarious income and cope with global food price fluctuations 69 while the causal nature of the relation between salinization and rural urban migration in bangladesh is still disputed 67 the evidence basis is growing 68 migration caused by salinization has also been reported in other parts of the world for instance in pakistan people are leaving the lower indus delta because soil salinization interferes with crop growth and productive agriculture 23 2 2 water security and health increased salinity in drinking water is an emerging concern for water quality in several global deltas e g mekong niger gbm orinoco rhine and sacramento san joaquin river deltas along with potential long term health consequences of consuming saline water 70 77 the world health organization recommends consuming less than 2 g of sodium 5 g of salt per day 78 and although it has no official salinity guideline for drinking water suggests drinking water contain less than 1000 mg l of total dissolved solids tds a proxy for salinity 7 79 chloride is the more prevalent ion in many coastal aquifers 80 but the who has not proposed any health guideline for chloride in drinking water 81 high sodium consumption increases blood pressure and risk of hypertension which are associated with a number of health risks including cardiovascular disease heart attacks and stroke 49 74 76 78 elevated salt intake has also been associated with skin diseases acute respiratory infection diarrheal disease kidney disease gastric cancer transmission of mosquito borne disease 75 76 82 and increased protein excretion a potentially useful marker for progressive kidney disease 83 research into the manifestation of these health concerns within delta populations affected by salinization is nascent and emerging hypertension affects almost one in three women in bangladesh nearly twice as much as men and many people have never been tested or are unable to reverse the condition 83 in coastal bangladesh salt intake through drinking water compounds an already high baseline consumption of salt that arises for geographical and socio cultural reasons e g taste adaptation and food conservation in these regions data show higher rates of hypertension and pre eclampsia among pregnant women hospitalized during dry season higher salinity compared with wet season lower salinity 48 a follow up population based study using measured salinity in drinking water ranging from 300 to 900 mg l found statistically significant correlations between pre eclampsia prevalence and salt concentrations in drinking water population of approximately 143 000 people 49 another study of young adults age 19 25 n 253 found significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure in those consuming drinking water with higher salinity greater than 600 mg l than lower salinity less than 600 mg l 84 further research is needed to replicate these findings and study the consequences of salinization on health on broader segments of the population 76 salinization results in additional health related consequences such as households in bangladesh avoiding salinity in the shallow aquifer by switching domestic supply to deeper arsenic contaminated groundwater 85 salinity also plays an important role in determining the composition of microbial communities in aquatic environments 86 including coastal lagoons 87 for instance vibrio cholera associated with cholera disease thrives in brackish waters in the gbm delta while vibrio parahemolyticus seafood associated acute gastroenteritis thrives in marine waters this association indicates the possibility of changes in the distribution of pathogenic species across freshwater systems as they are affected by salinization this in turn may lead to corresponding changes in the pattern of waterborne diseases necessitating better monitoring and appropriate adaptation measures 88 in the gbm delta improved data collection and data synthesis is important to determine the full public health effects of salinization currently the bangladesh water development board records weekly salinity measurements at high and low tides within distributaries the soil resource development institute srdi has generated spatial datasets of salinity by conducting national soil salinity surveys with the latest being in 2009 89 despite the fact that these data sets highlight the natural variability in water quality national water assessments to evaluate household drinking water quality do not consider spatial variability of contaminants e g salinity arsenic nor temporal differences in salinity 90 3 drivers of salinization across scales river deltas are naturally exposed to a range of salinity drivers that fluctuate in response to environmental processes including freshwater inflow from the upstream watershed tidal oscillations historic marine transgression dissolution of evaporative layers excessive evaporation of surface water or shallow groundwater storm surges and groundwater fluxes 7 91 92 salinization of river deltas occurs by disrupting the processes that sustain these natural balances resulting in increased salinity within the delta channel network soils and aquifers for instance reduced freshwater inflow and rising seas can force salt wedges further upstream into the delta channel network 38 while groundwater abstraction and lateral seepage can bring saline water into aquifers 93 94 salinization of delta soils can occur with increased tidal inundation due to land subsidence and climate change as well as seepage through embankments capillary rise or reduced precipitation 36 95 these mechanisms of salinization are often interconnected because salinization in one domain channel network soils or aquifer of the delta can lead to salinization within another one via natural e g hydraulics or anthropogenic e g irrigation means using examples from the deltas shown in fig 1 we illustrate how multiple drivers at local within the delta regional within the upstream watershed and global scales interact and contribute to salinization fig 3 the relative importance of each driver in inducing salinization varies widely across deltas and is determined by the local social and environmental context 3 1 local drivers local water and land use decisions within the delta often play an important role in salinization groundwater abstraction in many deltas allows saline water to intrude into the aquifer and land subsidence resulting from the excessive extraction compounds the problem in many deltas including the niger mekong and gbm groundwater is the primary source of domestic drinking water 97 99 and salinization is greatest in the shallow aquifer where water is extracted for domestic use 7 in the huanghe delta annual groundwater abstraction reached 100 million m3 by 2001 both for irrigation and aquaculture 100 some deltas have sought to circumvent this problem by irrigating with upstream freshwater sources such as in the mississippi delta 96 where salinization of agriculture has largely been avoided in the mekong delta numerous canals and dikes were built to provide freshwater irrigation to farmers but the canal network has allowed greater salinity intrusion during storm surges when saltwater propagates through the network 58 improper maintenance of sea defense infrastructure can lead to significant overtopping of seawater and increase salinity locally 11 land use within the delta can also play a role in salinization brackish irrigation can lead to accumulation in soil of salts left behind and concentrate as water evapotranspires or in groundwater after salts are leached from surface soils 101 saline aquaculture e g brackish water shrimp cultivation in the huanghe 100 mekong 58 and gbm 11 have also intensified salinization of soils and aquifers 3 2 regional drivers salinization is subject to an upstream downstream dynamic because inflow of freshwater into the delta depends on upstream water and land management reduced inflow to deltas and their distributaries is ubiquitous across the world fig 1 in many cases driven by upstream dams e g gbm mekong rhine and meuse 11 6 102 diversions e g mississippi 103 and consumptive agricultural water use in river basins with extensive irrigation the reductions of inflow can be severe average annual inflow to the indus delta has been reduced by 60 or more 52 and by 71 in the huanghe delta 100 diversions within deltas can also be problematic such as in the orinoco delta in venezuela where a distributary was dammed to divert water for hydroelectricity production 53 104 in the gbm delta water is diverted at farakka barrage directly upstream of the bangladeshi border for navigability and drinking water in kolkata india located adjacent to a distributary of the delta 105 dams and diversions also trap sediment altering the natural deposition accretion and avulsion of deltas in the mississippi and other deltas loss of sediment influx has resulted in subsidence of wetlands resulting in greater flooding during storm surges and saline intrusion into groundwater 38 with regards to upstream downstream dynamics the sacramento san joaquin delta in california is an interesting case the sacramento river north of the delta provides the majority of inflow into the delta where water is then pumped from the delta for agricultural irrigation and water supply to urban centers south of the delta 106 in this sense the delta is situated both downstream and upstream of water users in california numerous reservoirs within this watershed divert considerable water for consumptive use but reservoir releases are managed to ensure sufficient inflow to the delta which to date has sufficiently inhibited salinity intrusion into the delta 106 lastly the role played by hydro politics in the salinization of deltas should also be noted in many cases the influence of agriculture in upstream regions overpowers the concern for salinization in the delta especially in basins where agriculture plays a major role in the economy such as the indus and huanghe deltas 100 107 108 this hydro strategic imbalance often has greater consequences in international basins such as the mekong and gbm where transboundary water negotiations are conducted at the state level with little influence of those who live in the delta and will be most affected by salinization 109 111 3 3 global drivers local and regional changes are compounded by the effects of climate change including sea level rise and an increase in both the frequency and magnitude of storm surges 112 relative sea level rise results from the combined effect of eustatic sea level rise and land subsidence driven by natural settling of land and reduced sediment accretion within the delta due to declining upstream flow 38 113 in some cases subsidence can lead to relative sea level rise up to 10 mm per year in the gbm 114 many times greater than historical eustatic sea level rise approximately 2 mm per year 38 115 although the rate of eustatic sea level rise will likely grow and the increase will depend on specifics of the climate scenario that emerges 115 in the gbm for example salinity intrusion in the delta channel network as measured by the 15 ppt isohaline could penetrate 11 28 km further inland by the end of the century under a scenario of 4 1 c temperature increase and a sea level rise of 54 cm 116 accompanying effects will include even higher soil salinity in the coastal region due to changes in rainfall and temperature induced evapotranspiration 45 on top of this inundation by cyclonic storm surges not only causes problems in the year the cyclone arrives but substantially affects groundwater on a longer term 9 changing precipitation patterns will also likely affect the water balance of deltas especially in regions that are subject to increasing drought 117 reduced precipitation in the upstream watershed will result in reduced inflow to the delta and less precipitation within the delta itself will slow the leaching of salt from soil in wet season 4 adaptation and socio hydrological feedbacks humans are often particularly creative when it comes to adapting to emerging salinization and in many deltas adaptation to salinity is a central coastal development goal in the gbm delta over 85 types of adaptation have been identified 118 ranging from soft socioeconomic policies such as allocating financial resources and incentivizing land use practices to hard engineering measures such as rainwater harvesting salt tolerant crop varieties solar desalination community managed ponds and managed aquifer recharge implicit in the drivers discussed in section 3 is the notion that salinization can be exacerbated by adaptations designed to mitigate the consequences of salinity creating an undesirable feedback of salinization these feedbacks suggest that deltas are fully coupled human water systems where decisions have complex far reaching and often unintended consequences unforeseen feedbacks often emerge from uncertainty and or inadequate consideration of the long term consequences of adaptation actions for instance approaches aimed at reducing apparent flood risks and related salinization often make use of costly engineering solutions that inhibit natural depositional processes responsible for delta formation 113 leading to a long term increase in flood hazards 119 furthermore flood protection infrastructure also increases the tendency of communities to build in flood prone areas the so called levee effect 51 with the consequence of increasing both their exposure and vulnerability to increasing flood hazard 119 another example of undesirable adaptation feedback relates to coastal land use transitions from freshwater irrigated agriculture e g paddy to saltwater shrimp aquaculture the process which has been heralded as an economically successful strategy to adapt to salinization in deltas 121 122 comes at the cost of several long term consequences first the progressive replacement of freshwater irrigation by standing saltwater for shrimp cultivation exacerbates soil salinity 41 123 second shrimp farming has been associated to issues related to land tenure economic equity and conflict for entitlement to natural resources as revenues are concentrated towards a small number of land owners and smallholder farmers are driven off their land 120 124 third shrimp farm operations are also subject to environmental variability sea level rise and tidal surge lead to frequent inundation of coastal land that can change the availability and quality of brackish water environments leading to losses of shrimp stock 125 these three effects tend to compound leading to irreversible losses in the long term in the mekong delta the government provided subsidies for shrimp farming as a way for farmers to adapt to salinization yet many farmers shifted back to rice paddy farms despite increasingly saline conditions after many shrimp farms encountered persistent problems with disease and pollution 126 a third example of adaptation arises as farmers resort to groundwater as an easily accessible source of freshwater to substitute increasingly brackish surface waters this transition mitigates immediate monetary losses for individual farmers but accelerates salinization e g through subsidence and saline intrusions into aquifers which ultimately increases long term communal exposure to salinity 52 these characteristics individual private benefits at the expense of communal public costs are the hallmark of common pool resources ostrom 127 famously showed that tragedies of the commons over such resources can be avoided through effective institutional mechanisms that typically emerge from centuries of successful collective action furthermore effective regulation requires proper socio hydrologic understanding of the linkage between human decisions and environmental feedback particularly in the context of shared groundwater 128 nevertheless it is important to keep in mind that a prevailing form of adaptation is often acceptance for example many people in the gbm delta increasingly consider salinity processes to be normal natural phenomena and adjust their livelihoods by enduring its consequences however soil and water salinity will soon reach levels where coping is not a viable choice 129 and sustainable adaptation options are urgently needed 5 conclusion salinization is an emerging existential threat in many deltas affecting not only the livelihood and food security of large populations but also having direct human health impacts through drinking water contamination however deltas are complex and coupled socio hydrologic systems with the impacts of salinization disproportionately affecting the poor secondary outcomes such as salinization induced migration from rural areas to cities are also increasingly being recognized the synthesis presented in this review provides a foundation for future socio hydrologic research regarding salinization in deltas salinization occurs as the result of overlapping drivers of change at multiple scales figs 1 and 3 and the consequences are mediated by the combination of socioeconomic status fig 2 and adaptation options understanding the complexity of the system is necessary to avoid undesirable feedbacks where short term successful adaptation actions actually worsen the phenomenon in the long term this requires i urgent and targeted transdisciplinary research that tackles the emergence of salinization in key deltas embracing the full complexity and strongly coupled nature of the socio hydrologic system and ii a concerted effort to synthesize context specific knowledge into transferable and generalizable insights this review is a first step in that direction and we highlight that the prevalence and impacts of salinization can be amplified by ongoing climate change population pressure economic development and transboundary water policies for many river deltas straightforward solutions to maintain water security and public health remain elusive given the complexity and highly coupled nature of this environmental challenge the scale and significance of key drivers of salinization are widespread but they operate at different spatial scales agricultural impacts and water consumption act locally the availability and delivery of freshwater acts regionally and is often a transboundary issue in contrast global changes in sea levels temperature and precipitation patterns strongly influence large scale hydrologic and environmental balances these effects are uncertain and challenging to predict but they disrupt key socio hydrologic equilibria around which modern societies have been built in summary the interactions between environmental change and human action result in complex feedbacks and as such effective adaptation mitigation and supportive policy design will be an ongoing challenge future solutions will depend on innovations that maintain freshwater availability and security given the likelihood that climate induced salinization will become a geographically widespread challenge salinization is an invisible rapidly unfolding phenomenon that requires urgent action despite the complexity synthesis of knowledge about the drivers must be more robust necessitating transdisciplinary research in order to provide policymakers and stakeholders with adequate knowledge for informed decision making

protein excretion a potentially useful marker for progressive kidney disease 83 research into the manifestation of these health concerns within delta populations affected by salinization is nascent and emerging hypertension affects almost one in three women in bangladesh nearly twice as much as men and many people have never been tested or are unable to reverse the condition 83 in coastal bangladesh salt intake through drinking water compounds an already high baseline consumption of salt that arises for geographical and socio cultural reasons e g taste adaptation and food conservation in these regions data show higher rates of hypertension and pre eclampsia among pregnant women hospitalized during dry season higher salinity compared with wet season lower salinity 48 a follow up population based study using measured salinity in drinking water ranging from 300 to 900 mg l found statistically significant correlations between pre eclampsia prevalence and salt concentrations in drinking water population of approximately 143 000 people 49 another study of young adults age 19 25 n 253 found significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure in those consuming drinking water with higher salinity greater than 600 mg l than lower salinity less than 600 mg l 84 further research is needed to replicate these findings and study the consequences of salinization on health on broader segments of the population 76 salinization results in additional health related consequences such as households in bangladesh avoiding salinity in the shallow aquifer by switching domestic supply to deeper arsenic contaminated groundwater 85 salinity also plays an important role in determining the composition of microbial communities in aquatic environments 86 including coastal lagoons 87 for instance vibrio cholera associated with cholera disease thrives in brackish waters in the gbm delta while vibrio parahemolyticus seafood associated acute gastroenteritis thrives in marine waters this association indicates the possibility of changes in the distribution of pathogenic species across freshwater systems as they are affected by salinization this in turn may lead to corresponding changes in the pattern of waterborne diseases necessitating better monitoring and appropriate adaptation measures 88 in the gbm delta improved data collection and data synthesis is important to determine the full public health effects of salinization currently the bangladesh water development board records weekly salinity measurements at high and low tides within distributaries the soil resource development institute srdi has generated spatial datasets of salinity by conducting national soil salinity surveys with the latest being in 2009 89 despite the fact that these data sets highlight the natural variability in water quality national water assessments to evaluate household drinking water quality do not consider spatial variability of contaminants e g salinity arsenic nor temporal differences in salinity 90 3 drivers of salinization across scales river deltas are naturally exposed to a range of salinity drivers that fluctuate in response to environmental processes including freshwater inflow from the upstream watershed tidal oscillations historic marine transgression dissolution of evaporative layers excessive evaporation of surface water or shallow groundwater storm surges and groundwater fluxes 7 91 92 salinization of river deltas occurs by disrupting the processes that sustain these natural balances resulting in increased salinity within the delta channel network soils and aquifers for instance reduced freshwater inflow and rising seas can force salt wedges further upstream into the delta channel network 38 while groundwater abstraction and lateral seepage can bring saline water into aquifers 93 94 salinization of delta soils can occur with increased tidal inundation due to land subsidence and climate change as well as seepage through embankments capillary rise or reduced precipitation 36 95 these mechanisms of salinization are often interconnected because salinization in one domain channel network soils or aquifer of the delta can lead to salinization within another one via natural e g hydraulics or anthropogenic e g irrigation means using examples from the deltas shown in fig 1 we illustrate how multiple drivers at local within the delta regional within the upstream watershed and global scales interact and contribute to salinization fig 3 the relative importance of each driver in inducing salinization varies widely across deltas and is determined by the local social and environmental context 3 1 local drivers local water and land use decisions within the delta often play an important role in salinization groundwater abstraction in many deltas allows saline water to intrude into the aquifer and land subsidence resulting from the excessive extraction compounds the problem in many deltas including the niger mekong and gbm groundwater is the primary source of domestic drinking water 97 99 and salinization is greatest in the shallow aquifer where water is extracted for domestic use 7 in the huanghe delta annual groundwater abstraction reached 100 million m3 by 2001 both for irrigation and aquaculture 100 some deltas have sought to circumvent this problem by irrigating with upstream freshwater sources such as in the mississippi delta 96 where salinization of agriculture has largely been avoided in the mekong delta numerous canals and dikes were built to provide freshwater irrigation to farmers but the canal network has allowed greater salinity intrusion during storm surges when saltwater propagates through the network 58 improper maintenance of sea defense infrastructure can lead to significant overtopping of seawater and increase salinity locally 11 land use within the delta can also play a role in salinization brackish irrigation can lead to accumulation in soil of salts left behind and concentrate as water evapotranspires or in groundwater after salts are leached from surface soils 101 saline aquaculture e g brackish water shrimp cultivation in the huanghe 100 mekong 58 and gbm 11 have also intensified salinization of soils and aquifers 3 2 regional drivers salinization is subject to an upstream downstream dynamic because inflow of freshwater into the delta depends on upstream water and land management reduced inflow to deltas and their distributaries is ubiquitous across the world fig 1 in many cases driven by upstream dams e g gbm mekong rhine and meuse 11 6 102 diversions e g mississippi 103 and consumptive agricultural water use in river basins with extensive irrigation the reductions of inflow can be severe average annual inflow to the indus delta has been reduced by 60 or more 52 and by 71 in the huanghe delta 100 diversions within deltas can also be problematic such as in the orinoco delta in venezuela where a distributary was dammed to divert water for hydroelectricity production 53 104 in the gbm delta water is diverted at farakka barrage directly upstream of the bangladeshi border for navigability and drinking water in kolkata india located adjacent to a distributary of the delta 105 dams and diversions also trap sediment altering the natural deposition accretion and avulsion of deltas in the mississippi and other deltas loss of sediment influx has resulted in subsidence of wetlands resulting in greater flooding during storm surges and saline intrusion into groundwater 38 with regards to upstream downstream dynamics the sacramento san joaquin delta in california is an interesting case the sacramento river north of the delta provides the majority of inflow into the delta where water is then pumped from the delta for agricultural irrigation and water supply to urban centers south of the delta 106 in this sense the delta is situated both downstream and upstream of water users in california numerous reservoirs within this watershed divert considerable water for consumptive use but reservoir releases are managed to ensure sufficient inflow to the delta which to date has sufficiently inhibited salinity intrusion into the delta 106 lastly the role played by hydro politics in the salinization of deltas should also be noted in many cases the influence of agriculture in upstream regions overpowers the concern for salinization in the delta especially in basins where agriculture plays a major role in the economy such as the indus and huanghe deltas 100 107 108 this hydro strategic imbalance often has greater consequences in international basins such as the mekong and gbm where transboundary water negotiations are conducted at the state level with little influence of those who live in the delta and will be most affected by salinization 109 111 3 3 global drivers local and regional changes are compounded by the effects of climate change including sea level rise and an increase in both the frequency and magnitude of storm surges 112 relative sea level rise results from the combined effect of eustatic sea level rise and land subsidence driven by natural settling of land and reduced sediment accretion within the delta due to declining upstream flow 38 113 in some cases subsidence can lead to relative sea level rise up to 10 mm per year in the gbm 114 many times greater than historical eustatic sea level rise approximately 2 mm per year 38 115 although the rate of eustatic sea level rise will likely grow and the increase will depend on specifics of the climate scenario that emerges 115 in the gbm for example salinity intrusion in the delta channel network as measured by the 15 ppt isohaline could penetrate 11 28 km further inland by the end of the century under a scenario of 4 1 c temperature increase and a sea level rise of 54 cm 116 accompanying effects will include even higher soil salinity in the coastal region due to changes in rainfall and temperature induced evapotranspiration 45 on top of this inundation by cyclonic storm surges not only causes problems in the year the cyclone arrives but substantially affects groundwater on a longer term 9 changing precipitation patterns will also likely affect the water balance of deltas especially in regions that are subject to increasing drought 117 reduced precipitation in the upstream watershed will result in reduced inflow to the delta and less precipitation within the delta itself will slow the leaching of salt from soil in wet season 4 adaptation and socio hydrological feedbacks humans are often particularly creative when it comes to adapting to emerging salinization and in many deltas adaptation to salinity is a central coastal development goal in the gbm delta over 85 types of adaptation have been identified 118 ranging from soft socioeconomic policies such as allocating financial resources and incentivizing land use practices to hard engineering measures such as rainwater harvesting salt tolerant crop varieties solar desalination community managed ponds and managed aquifer recharge implicit in the drivers discussed in section 3 is the notion that salinization can be exacerbated by adaptations designed to mitigate the consequences of salinity creating an undesirable feedback of salinization these feedbacks suggest that deltas are fully coupled human water systems where decisions have complex far reaching and often unintended consequences unforeseen feedbacks often emerge from uncertainty and or inadequate consideration of the long term consequences of adaptation actions for instance approaches aimed at reducing apparent flood risks and related salinization often make use of costly engineering solutions that inhibit natural depositional processes responsible for delta formation 113 leading to a long term increase in flood hazards 119 furthermore flood protection infrastructure also increases the tendency of communities to build in flood prone areas the so called levee effect 51 with the consequence of increasing both their exposure and vulnerability to increasing flood hazard 119 another example of undesirable adaptation feedback relates to coastal land use transitions from freshwater irrigated agriculture e g paddy to saltwater shrimp aquaculture the process which has been heralded as an economically successful strategy to adapt to salinization in deltas 121 122 comes at the cost of several long term consequences first the progressive replacement of freshwater irrigation by standing saltwater for shrimp cultivation exacerbates soil salinity 41 123 second shrimp farming has been associated to issues related to land tenure economic equity and conflict for entitlement to natural resources as revenues are concentrated towards a small number of land owners and smallholder farmers are driven off their land 120 124 third shrimp farm operations are also subject to environmental variability sea level rise and tidal surge lead to frequent inundation of coastal land that can change the availability and quality of brackish water environments leading to losses of shrimp stock 125 these three effects tend to compound leading to irreversible losses in the long term in the mekong delta the government provided subsidies for shrimp farming as a way for farmers to adapt to salinization yet many farmers shifted back to rice paddy farms despite increasingly saline conditions after many shrimp farms encountered persistent problems with disease and pollution 126 a third example of adaptation arises as farmers resort to groundwater as an easily accessible source of freshwater to substitute increasingly brackish surface waters this transition mitigates immediate monetary losses for individual farmers but accelerates salinization e g through subsidence and saline intrusions into aquifers which ultimately increases long term communal exposure to salinity 52 these characteristics individual private benefits at the expense of communal public costs are the hallmark of common pool resources ostrom 127 famously showed that tragedies of the commons over such resources can be avoided through effective institutional mechanisms that typically emerge from centuries of successful collective action furthermore effective regulation requires proper socio hydrologic understanding of the linkage between human decisions and environmental feedback particularly in the context of shared groundwater 128 nevertheless it is important to keep in mind that a prevailing form of adaptation is often acceptance for example many people in the gbm delta increasingly consider salinity processes to be normal natural phenomena and adjust their livelihoods by enduring its consequences however soil and water salinity will soon reach levels where coping is not a viable choice 129 and sustainable adaptation options are urgently needed 5 conclusion salinization is an emerging existential threat in many deltas affecting not only the livelihood and food security of large populations but also having direct human health impacts through drinking water contamination however deltas are complex and coupled socio hydrologic systems with the impacts of salinization disproportionately affecting the poor secondary outcomes such as salinization induced migration from rural areas to cities are also increasingly being recognized the synthesis presented in this review provides a foundation for future socio hydrologic research regarding salinization in deltas salinization occurs as the result of overlapping drivers of change at multiple scales figs 1 and 3 and the consequences are mediated by the combination of socioeconomic status fig 2 and adaptation options understanding the complexity of the system is necessary to avoid undesirable feedbacks where short term successful adaptation actions actually worsen the phenomenon in the long term this requires i urgent and targeted transdisciplinary research that tackles the emergence of salinization in key deltas embracing the full complexity and strongly coupled nature of the socio hydrologic system and ii a concerted effort to synthesize context specific knowledge into transferable and generalizable insights this review is a first step in that direction and we highlight that the prevalence and impacts of salinization can be amplified by ongoing climate change population pressure economic development and transboundary water policies for many river deltas straightforward solutions to maintain water security and public health remain elusive given the complexity and highly coupled nature of this environmental challenge the scale and significance of key drivers of salinization are widespread but they operate at different spatial scales agricultural impacts and water consumption act locally the availability and delivery of freshwater acts regionally and is often a transboundary issue in contrast global changes in sea levels temperature and precipitation patterns strongly influence large scale hydrologic and environmental balances these effects are uncertain and challenging to predict but they disrupt key socio hydrologic equilibria around which modern societies have been built in summary the interactions between environmental change and human action result in complex feedbacks and as such effective adaptation mitigation and supportive policy design will be an ongoing challenge future solutions will depend on innovations that maintain freshwater availability and security given the likelihood that climate induced salinization will become a geographically widespread challenge salinization is an invisible rapidly unfolding phenomenon that requires urgent action despite the complexity synthesis of knowledge about the drivers must be more robust necessitating transdisciplinary research in order to provide policymakers and stakeholders with adequate knowledge for informed decision making

20166,water resources in la paz and el alto bolivia strongly depend on runoff from mountain catchments in the cordillera real andes the balance between the water available from the source catchments and the demand of the cities has become precarious during recent years because of an increasing population and the runoff variability caused by climate change in this study a first order estimate of the future water supply and demand for the el alto system the most rapidly growing area in la paz and el alto was obtained for the first time based on a demographic analysis and runoff projection and effective measures for adapting to water shortage were examined the water demand in 2036 is expected to increase by 15 53 compared to that of 2011 depending on the scenario for the water loss in the supply system and population estimates while the projected water supply shows frequent reductions because of the climate variability and decreasing glacial meltwater thus the water transfer from a neighboring system the achachicala system will be indispensable to sustain the supply that cannot be covered by releases from tuni lake nevertheless the el alto system will likely face a serious water shortage after the mid 2020s for the most conservative scenario of demand increase while large uncertainty was found for the balance of supply and demand depending on the scenarios for population growth improvement of water loss and climate variability and trend for supply side management the extended diversion of runoff into tuni lake water transfer from the achachicala system and transfer of runoff from the taypichaca catchment will be effective in securing the water supply under various uncertain conditions keywords water scarcity climate change population growth water supply and demand la paz and el alto andes 1 introduction water resources are a significant element in human settlement and social and economic development at a regional scale and are becoming globally important because of the strong global linkage with food and energy security e g 46 47 10 it is projected that water scarcity will progress globally particularly in regions where large populations occur and or there is a shift to drier climatic conditions with decreased precipitation as predicted e g 1 4 among the regions where water scarcity is already acute the pacific coastal plains and western slopes along the andes in bolivia chile ecuador and peru where a majority of the population and economic activity occur are susceptible to climate change and the resultant impacts on water resources 3 it is recognized that the region depends partly on water resources resulting from the melting of a large number of glaciers distributed at high altitudes in the andes 42 39 however glaciers in high altitudinal tropical regions are thought to be strongly affected by global warming 3 thus they are expected to undergo remarkable retreats 44 21 31 decreasing total volume of streamflow 14 and intensifying streamflow seasonality 17 18 it is recognized that much of the future water scarcity may be caused primarily by the demand side 45 buytaert and de bievre 6 analyzed future per capita water availability for major cities in the tropical andes and showed that the expected demographic changes are very likely to outpace the impact of climate change on water availability because the region will experience a high rate of population growth and the accompanying increase in water demand e g 1 it is also likely that the influence of a changing climate will be more serious for water security throughout the region carey et al 8 emphasized the necessity of a holistic hydro social framework via integrated analysis of both water availability and water use through a case study of the santa river peru drenkhan et al 11 reviewed hydroclimatic and socioeconomic drivers of water resources in two major catchments in the peruvian andes suggesting the need to better link water supply with demand research among areas considered as water scarce in the andean region we attempted to analyze the influence of climate change and population growth on the water security of the administrative capital of bolivia la paz and the rapidly developing adjacent city el alto located on the altiplano the cities are dependent for most of their water use on streamflow from catchments in the cordillera real andes however the area has experienced a strong increase in drought severity during the period 1985 2012 because of a higher reference evapotranspiration 43 furthermore as the demand has been increasing during recent years ministry of environment and water bolivia mmaya 24 particularly in the fast growing city of el alto temporary water rationing has been enacted because the el niño southern oscillation plays a significant role in precipitation over the bolivian andes 43 in addition to the influence of the amazon the area experienced its worst drought in 25 years because of an el niño episode during 2015 and 2016 bolivia s government declared a state of emergency in november 2016 because of the significant water shortage this climatic and social evidence and pressure on future water resources in la paz and el alto necessitate a detailed analysis of future water supply and demand to prepare for water scarcity under a changing climate and growing population as the increase in population is likely to continue and more water resources will be required for la paz and el alto a study of the demand side projection and adaptation to the deficit of water supply for these cities is urgently needed therefore reliable future growth projections based on more detailed population dynamic models need to be pursued to evaluate the impact on water resources 6 on the supply side glaciers annually contribute 15 of the water resources for la paz and more during the dry season 39 because glaciers in bolivia as well as in peru and ecuador have been rapidly retreating 32 12 38 21 36 45 and continuous retreat is anticipated 45 the future water availability for la paz and el alto needs to be projected with more focus on the non glacier origin of streamflow however compared to studies reported for the cordillera blanc peru e g 17 9 22 limited papers have been published on catchment scale water resources in the bolivian andes considering glacial and non glacial runoff components e g 7 39 despite the imminent threat of water scarcity in la paz and el alto therefore this study attempted for the first time to provide a first order estimate of the future water supply and demand for la paz and el alto and suggests adaptive measures to secure water resources by analyzing future demographic changes and the glacio hydrological response of source catchments under a changing climate considering the actual water supply systems in these cities 2 study area and methodology 2 1 study area the water supply for la paz and el alto is dependent on four drinking water systems fig 1 the el alto achachicala and pampahasi systems are based on surface water diverted from reservoirs in the cordillera mountain range and the tilata water system is based on groundwater withdrawal 5 24 the el alto system has the largest volume of treated water and supplies the rapidly expanding areas of el alto and a portion of la paz the achachicala and pampahasi systems cover the remainder of la paz the tilata system serves the part of el alto not covered by the el alto system its supply volume being relatively small during 2011 the total volume of water sent to these four treatment plants was 74 1 106 m3 among which the share of the el alto system was 42 2 the tilata system 7 5 and the achachicala and pampahasi systems were nearly equal 25 4 and 24 9 respectively the catchments linked to each of the supply systems are illustrated in fig 1 the main source catchment of the el alto system is the tuni lake catchment which includes the condoriri huayna potosi and tuni catchments fig 2 because of the growing water demand for the el alto system a part of the supply to the system has been supplemented by the water transferred from milluni lake in the milluni catchment since 2008 the line from milluni lake bifurcates to the el alto system before connecting with the achachicala system as shown in fig 1 the achachicala system is supplied water from the milluni catchment and the choqueyapu catchment the choqueyapu river has no reservoirs linked with the treatment plant but the seasonal streamflow from the river has been used in the system the pampahasi system is connected to the incachaca lake and hampaturi lake reservoirs these four catchments milluni choqueyapu incachaca and hampaturi have limited or no substantial glacial cover fig 1 the taypichaca river catchment is included in the figure because we examined the availability of water from this catchment to adapt for the anticipated future water scarcity in la paz and el alto although it is not currently serving any supply systems in la paz and el alto supplementary fig s1 1 in this study we specifically focused on the water supply and demand for the el alto system because it is the most rapidly growing area in la paz and el alto in the el alto system the runoff from partially glacier covered upstream catchments i e the condoriri tuni and huayna potosi catchments table 1 fig 2 is diverted and stored in tuni lake supplementary fig s1 2 the land surface of each catchment is largely covered by un vegetated soil and gravel figs 1 and 2 show the distribution of glacier covered areas obtained from landsat thematic mapper images obtained during 2010 with the band ratio method verified by liu et al 21 in these catchments lakes and wetlands occur along the stream and or on the hillslopes and contribute to retardation of the runoff from glacial melt and snowmelt gradually supplying the water the runoff from the tuni catchment flows into tuni lake throughout the year without control while the runoff from the condoriri and huayna potosi catchments is diverted to the lake through a channel connected to the stream running in each catchment fig 2 and supplementary fig s1 3 from november to april currently a constant volume of water nominal volume is 1 m3 s is released from tuni lake to the el alto system the excess volume of storage in the lake is discharged to the condoriri river from the spillway the capacity of tuni lake is summarized in supplementary table s1 1 the achachicala system covers the urban center of la paz and the system is supported by water from milluni lake storing runoff from the milluni catchment fig 1 the glacier contribution to the total runoff from the milluni catchment is relatively small compared to that of the tuni lake catchment 39 to adapt to increasing water demand in the el alto system the marginal part of the water storage has been transferred from milluni lake to the el alto system since 2008 2 2 estimation of future water demand the future water demand for the el alto and achachicala systems for domestic use was estimated based on the future population predicted by the cohort component method and provided values of supply coverage unit water consumption and non revenue water rate supplementary table 1 2 following the procedure shown in supplementary fig s1 4 the cohort component method is among the most commonly used methods for population projection and it considers fertility mortality and migration of each age and sex specific group because of the lack of statistics for fertility and mortality for each city we alternatively used the data for fertility and mortality for the la paz department obtained from the instituto nacional de estadística bolivia ine http www ine gob bo and the demographic health survey or dhs encuesta nacional de demografía y salud conducted by the ministry of health and sports and national institute of statistics ministerio de salud y deportes instituto nacional de estadística 26 and who bolivia http www who int countries bol en the net migration rate was calculated based on the population by age and sex 15 16 the birth rate obtained from dhs 2003 2008 and the fertility obtained from ine http www ine gob bo the method used for the projection was verified by comparing the population from the national census in 2012 and the estimated population by age and sex population pyramid for 2012 with the base population provided by the 2001 census data 15 16 we assumed that the changing water availability does not affect the fertility mortality and migration 34 although the water availability is considered as a driver for migration and resulting regional and ethnic tension 33 given the base population from the 2012 census the population in la paz and el alto was projected until 2036 which corresponds to the target year set in the master plan for portable water and sanitation developed by the mmaya 24 the total population in each city was allocated to each supply system including the el alto and achachicala systems based on the current ratio of population served by each system compared to the total population in each city then the future water demand for domestic use in each system was calculated from the total population served by each system using parameters provided in supplementary table 1 2 which were set based on mmaya 24 the total demand for commercial industrial and other uses was estimated for the el alto and achachicala systems as a percentage of the total demand 10 3 and 41 2 respectively based on zuleta 48 and the information provided by the empresa pública social del agua y saneamiento epsas the municipal utility that operates the supply system among demand side options for sustainable water use such as reducing consumption and repairing leaks an improvement in water loss in the whole system was considered to consider the effect of an improvement in non revenue water rate nrw we assumed that the nrw linearly improves from the actual rate in 2011 to the target rate for 2036 set in the master plan 24 2 3 estimation of available water resources we applied the semi distributed conceptual model developed by kinouchi et al 18 and improved in this study see supplementary information to the huayna potosi condoriri and tuni catchments fig 2 table 1 to quantify the inflow from these catchments into tuni lake under current and future climatic conditions the model parameters were updated from those used by kinouchi et al 18 supplementary tables s3 1 and s3 2 based on calibration with daily streamflow observed at gauging stations hh1 ht1 and hc1 fig 2 and supplementary fig s3 6 the albedo on the glacier surface of the huayna potosi glacier mhg and condoriri glacier mcg supplementary fig s3 7 and the water level in chiarcota lake supplementary fig s3 8 the daily lapse rate was provided from the air temperature observed at two automated weather stations awss the vertical gradient in precipitation was considered based on the monthly total precipitation observed at eight locations with an altitude ranging from 4490 m a s l to 4870 m a s l not shown in fig 2 the inflow to tuni lake was calculated based on a given operational rule of diversion of streamflow from the condoriri and huayna potosi catchments under the current rule the full diversion of streamflow is assumed to start on november 1 and end on april 15 the impact of climate change on the runoff from the three catchments and the release from tuni lake was quantified assuming several cases for the trend in air temperature and precipitation into the future the volume of release from tuni lake the glacier condition and the countermeasure table 2 the release from tuni lake was assumed constant throughout the projection period unless the water storage was below the dead capacity in case 5 the release rate was adjusted to maximize the constant release while maintaining the storage volume in the lake greater than that of the dead capacity in case 2 we assumed that there is no glacier in the tuni lake catchment to highlight the effect of glacial meltwater on modulating the drought situation while actual glacier conditions were used for other cases fig 2 as the initial condition and the glacierized area decreases depending on the volume of melted and sublimated glacier ice see supplementary information the no glacier scenario was used by baraer et al 2 and soruco et al 39 for the same purpose the latter being the application to la paz and el alto in cases 5 and 7 the full diversion is assumed during the extended period to examine the effect of this immediate countermeasure in cases 6 and 7 we used downscaled global climate model gcm outputs mri agcm with the spatial resolution of 20 km 19 the output of mri agcm was used because of its high performance in reproducing the present weather conditions over south america and the high spatial resolution to well resolve the andes mountains 19 mri agcm outputs for the sres a1b scenario nakicenovic and swart 30 were statistically bias corrected and downscaled for the period between 2020 and 2039 using the data from the awss fig 2 in the tuni lake catchment see supplementary information the trends for cases 1 through 5 as shown in table 2 were determined considering the long term trend found in the selected gcm outputs and an analysis of historical data over the same region based on the following overview the results of seiler et al 2013 show a median change in annual mean air temperature from 1961 to 90 to 2070 99 between 2 7 c for sres b1 scenario nakicenovic and swart 30 and 5 7 c for rcp 8 5 scenario moss et al 2010 among the five emission scenarios used in cmip3 and cmip5 which is equivalent to 0 25 c decade 1 and 0 52 c decade 1 respectively for annual precipitation the projections of the individual gcms varied so much that changes in the weighted ensembles were not statistically significant seiler et al 2013 similarly no significant change in annual total precipitation was obtained by thibeault et al 40 urrutia and vuille 41 indicated using a regional climate model with the a2 scenario that precipitation will decrease approximately 10 along the western slopes of the tropical andes above 4000 m a s l by the end of this century minvielle and garreaud 27 suggested a significant reduction 10 30 in altiplano precipitation by the end of this century our analysis of gcm outputs for the rcp8 5 scenario 29 in nine models gfdl cm3 csiro mk3 6 0 cmcc cm hadgem2 ao miroc5 mpi esm mr mri cgcm3 cnrm cm5 and ccsm4 indicated an increasing trend in air temperature between 0 32 c decade 1 and 0 6 c decade 1 with an average of 0 4 c decade 1 the relative change in annual precipitation in these outputs ranged from 0 42 year to 0 4 year with an average near 0 and the standard deviation equal to 0 27 year indicating no clear increasing or decreasing trend we also analyzed the annual precipitation and mean air temperature measured at the el alto airport 16 30 37 68 11 55 and obtained from the era interim dataset 291 22 30 292 7 30 s16 7 30 s16 52 30 between 1985 and 2014 the measured and reanalyzed data showed a trend of 0 14 c decade 1 and 0 29 c decade 1 respectively but there was no significant trend in annual precipitation in both datasets a comprehensive review by rabatel et al 2013 concluded that precipitation has not displayed a significant spatially coherent trend in the tropical andes since the middle of the 20th century based on these reviews and analyses we assumed that the air temperature will change in the future at a rate of 0 4 c decade 1 which is the average of the nine gcm outputs and near the average for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios as shown by seiler et al 37 for cases 1 through 5 the trend in precipitation was set to 0 with an uncertainty range of 0 2 year which is considered in cases 3 trend 0 2 year and 4 trend 0 2 year reflecting a variety of trends found in different sources of current and future precipitation the downscaled mri agcm data used for cases 6 and 7 shows a trend of annual mean air temperature and annual precipitation at each aws ranging between 0 19 c and 0 28 c decade 1 and between 0 65 year and 0 43 year respectively supplementary fig s2 8 although the underlying scenarios used to run mri agcm sres scenarios are different from those in cmip5 knutti and sedláček 20 indicated that the projected global temperature change from cmip5 models is remarkably similar to that from those used in cmip3 and the similarity of the projected precipitation change in cmip3 and cmip5 is reassuring therefore we considered that the output from mri agcm can be used as one of the scenarios to compare with other scenarios defined by cmip5 gcm outputs the water available from tuni lake to release into the el alto system was evaluated by analyzing the temporal variation in water storage based on the water balance in the lake under a given condition of release table 2 considering inflow from three catchments overflow from the spillway and precipitation and evaporation over the lake surface the evaporation was estimated using the bulk transfer method with measured and projected wind velocity air temperature and relative humidity at mt1 near the lake see supplementary information we assume that no water is released if the water storage in tuni lake is less than the dead capacity the variation in water storage in tuni lake was verified under the current operational rule of intake and release the future water supply was evaluated using the total volume of water released from tuni lake and transferred from milluni lake to meet the future increase in water demand for the el alto system we considered three options to increase the water supply i e the transfer of marginal water from milluni lake the extension of the period to divert streamflow from the condoriri and huayna potosi catchments into tuni lake and the use of stream water from the neighboring taypichaca catchment the transfer from milluni lake was assumed to increase considering the decrease in demand for the achachicala system as explained in the subsequent section the extended diversion from the current source areas could be the most practical option the runoff from the taypichaca catchment is considered as one of the new water resources 5 because of the advantage of a nearer location to la paz and el alto and the larger catchment size with a potentially large volume of glaciers however the water availability from the catchment has never been analyzed or reported here we apply the semi distributed model to the taypichaca catchment to quantify the water resources potentially available from the catchment under future climate conditions the simulation period covers from 2011 when our weather monitoring started to 2036 the target year of the master plan 24 all of the future scenarios in table 2 utilize the weather data obtained from june 2011 to july 2017 under cases 1 through 5 meteorological forcing for the simulation was generated based on the observed weather conditions between 2011 and 2017 with the trend in air temperature and precipitation in each case added for the following period from august 2017 until august 2037 for cases 6 and 7 the observed weather data were spliced on the downscaled gcm output covering the period between 2020 and 2039 see supplementary information the annual water availability was calculated for each hydrological year which was defined as starting in september and ending in august 35 3 results 3 1 change in population and water demand in the future the result of the population projection using the cohort component method is shown in fig 3 the total population in la paz is estimated to decrease from 0 77 million in 2012 to 0 69 0 75 million in 2036 while the population in el alto significantly increases from 0 85 million in 2012 to 1 17 1 28 million in 2036 our result shows a reasonable trend for each city compared to the future population reported by mmaya 25 fig 3 which was obtained from the exponential growth model considering the population changes only until 2001 the mean growth rate of the total population during 2012 2036 was calculated and ranged between 0 46 year and 0 07 year for la paz and 1 33 year and 1 74 year for el alto as a result the total population in la paz and el alto in 2036 is estimated to increase by 14 6 and 26 2 for low and high estimates respectively relative to the total population in 2012 the mean growth rate of the total population during 2012 2036 is calculated to be between 0 57 year and 0 98 year which is less than that obtained from the future population reported by the mmaya 2 2 year the decreasing trend in population in la paz is a result mainly of a decreasing birth rate and net outbound migration the decreasing population growth rate in el alto is mainly a result of the decreasing birth rate in addition we found that the population pyramid is projected to shift from a current expanding shape to a contracting la paz or stationary el alto shape supplementary fig s1 5 the result of the population served by the el alto and achachicala systems which was allocated from the projected population in la paz and el alto is shown in supplementary table s1 3 for selected years the corresponding result of water demand is shown in table 3 indicating that the water demand for the el alto system will increase by 15 25 in 2036 compared to the demand in 2011 with the range depending on the population estimate table 3 includes the water demand obtained with the assumption that the current condition of water loss nrw continues into 2036 without improvement resulting in an increase of 40 53 the water demand for the achachicala system in 2036 will decrease by 23 or slightly increase by 3 compared to that in 2011 depending on the population estimate the effect of improving water loss a comparison between the cases of improved nrw and current nrw increases towards the end of the projection period resulting in a water saving of 8 3 106 m3 and 9 0 106 m3 for the low and high population estimates respectively table 3 if the current water losses were not improved in accordance with the master plan a serious increase in water demand due to population growth would be expected the uncertainty range of the water demand for the el alto system resulting from population projection increases from approximately 2022 as can be seen in fig 5 3 2 current and future runoff and water storage the performance of the model in reproducing the current flow regime was confirmed by comparing the simulated monthly flow depths monthly total streamflow volume divided by the catchment area with those observed at three gauging stations supplementary fig s3 6 the performance was judged to be very good or good using three metrics i e nash sutcliffe efficiency nse ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr and percent bias pbias moriasi et al 28 see supplementary table s3 3 the streamflow is greater during the wet season between november and april for the tuni and huayna potosi catchments while for the condoriri catchment limited streamflow was observed during november and more flow was apparent during may because of the temporary storage of runoff in the relatively large natural lakes in the catchment this characteristic suggests that more water can be diverted into tuni lake by extending the period for diversion particularly from the condoriri river the simulated inflow to tuni lake was verified using the water storage volume converted from the water level observed by the epsas and prof m umeda from tohoku university japan personal communication for the period between 2011 and 2017 fig 4 a in the simulation the water volume released from the lake nominal volume 1 m3 s was adjusted to 0 97 m3 s for better agreement with the observed storage volume the storage volume shows a periodic variation with its annual minimum occurring during november or december while a certain volume of water 7 6 9 6 106 m3 remained even during the serious drought year from 2015 to 2016 the simulated water balance in tuni lake indicates that a nearly constant release has been attained and the overflow of excess storage was simulated in each hydrological year between 2012 and 2015 fig 4 b the simulated volume of water supply during august 2011 and july 2017 release from tuni lake transfer from milluni lake 33 4 106 m3 year is nearly the same as the water demand quantified by mmaya 24 for 2011 32 4 106 m3 year table 4 fig 4 shows the projected results of water storage and water balance in the lake for case 1 and case 6 indicating the periods that the storage empties and the release is reduced or even 0 for a certain period the maximum reduction occurs in october the reason for the decreasing trend in storage found for case 1 is the decreasing runoff from glacier covered areas including glacier melt snowmelt and subsurface runoff which coincide with the stage of negative runoff change for retreating glaciers in the same region 2 14 similarly for case 6 the influence of decreasing glacial meltwater combined with the larger variability in precipitation fig 4 h resulted in a greater reduction in the release as time passed fig 4 f the effect of glacial melt can be approximately estimated as the difference in the inflow to tuni lake between case 1 and case 2 which indicates an approximately 6 1 contribution of glacial meltwater to the annual inflow during 2011 and 2038 and a 10 2 contribution during 2011 and 2016 soruco et al 39 indicated that more than 20 of the discharge could be lost with complete disappearance of all glaciers in the tuni lake catchment the different estimates may be mainly because of the difference in the period of analysis less contribution is likely during recent periods because of shrinking glaciers and the limited period of streamflow diversion from the condoriri and huayna potosi catchments the contribution increases to 10 6 during 2011 and 2016 if the annual total runoff is used from isotope analysis guido et al 13 estimated a higher percentage of glacial meltwater contribution for the storage in tuni lake possibly because glacial meltwater contains some fraction of melted old ice in addition to melted recent snow 3 3 projected water supply for the el alto system and a comparison to the water demand fig 5 shows the projected water supply for the el alto system which is the sum of release from tuni lake and the transfer from milluni lake the maximum volume in table 3 was used under different scenarios of climate change glacier cover and adaptation measures as can be seen in the figure the annual water demand for the system for different population estimates and nrw improvement scenarios was also included the difference in water supply among the cases is mainly because of the different volumes of inflow to tuni lake and the influence of precipitation and evaporation over the lake s surface is relatively small table 4 the increasing trend in supply is clearer for cases 3 and 5 because of the sufficient inflow to tuni lake to sustain the constant release 0 97 m3 s throughout the year and the increasing volume of transfer from milluni lake the same condition applies for all cases which is a result of the decreasing demand on the achachicala system other cases show a decrease in supply during some periods because of insufficient storage to release the specified volume of water 0 97 m3 s from tuni lake the results for cases 3 and 4 indicate a possible range of impacts caused by the uncertainty in the trend in precipitation the result of case 4 shows three periods of decreased supply which were not found in case 3 caused by the periodically lower precipitation with a superposed decreasing trend during the 20 years from 2017 to 2036 as a result the water supply for case 4 decrease to much less than the demand even for the case of improved nrw with low population estimates the contribution of meltwater for modulating the drought situation was found by comparing the results for case 1 and case 2 as shown in fig 5 the result for case 2 shows a frequent failure in supplying the specified volume of water due to the lack of glacial meltwater runoff which would typically occur during the early wet season from october to early december although the contribution of glacial meltwater runoff to the storage in tuni lake was estimated to be approximately 10 during the period 2011 2016 although the percentage is not so high on average a significant influence on supply could be caused by the lack of glacial meltwater during some years this is mainly because of the reduced runoff during the period when the glacial meltwater mostly contributes to the streamflow i e from september to november depending on the weather conditions in each melting season the result for case 6 shows a greater decrease in supply in 2027 and 2033 because of a prolonged period of failure in keeping the storage above the dead capacity fig 4 f the reason for the serious failure is the lesser amount of precipitation during 2027 and 2031 2033 and the decreasing contribution from glacial meltwater as glacial retreat progresses the projected water supply for the different future scenarios cases 1 3 4 and 6 are nearly in a critical balance with the demand until approximately 2023 even though a serious decrease in supply was found for case 6 after 2023 the supply deficit continues to increase even against the case of the lowest demand estimate a low population and improved nrw if the projected demand follows the high estimate for improved nrw the supply deficit is expected to be more serious for these cases and an extremely large shortage was found for some years for case 6 the results of cases 5 and 7 show the effect of an extended period of streamflow diversion from the condoriri and the huayna potosi rivers for case 5 a greater constant release becomes possible 1 023 m3 s without emptying the storage and the balance between the demand for the low population estimate with improved nrw is maintained throughout the simulation period while the demand for the high population estimate is not satisfied after 2027 similarly for case 7 the extension of the diversion period resulted in more years of constant release 0 97 m3 s without failure and an increase in the mean annual supply compared to that for case 6 the extension of the diversion period requires no additional cost in terms of infrastructure supplementary fig s1 3 thus it can be an immediate and effective measure to prepare for the expected decrease in the lake storage however the coordination of existing water rights among local people and compensation and support for downstream stakeholders is necessary particularly for smallholder farmers that especially vulnerable to climate change and water shortages 23 3 4 balancing the water supply and demand under climate extremes and uncertain socio economical situations the uncertainty of water supply and demand related to the projection of climate change population estimates and implementation of countermeasures needs to be considered to secure water for this rapidly growing region for example the water shortage in the el alto system is predicted to become more serious if the water losses in the supply system are not reduced as planned in the master plan 24 as shown in fig 5 gray dashed lines although a serious shortage in water supply has not chronically occurred thus far implying continuous progress in nrw improvement temporary water rationing has sometimes been enacted therefore future progress in nrw improvement is still uncertain and will be affected by economic and political situations in previous sections we assumed an increase in transfer from milluni lake because of the projected decrease in demand for the achachicala system the effect of the transfer was considered while each scenario in table 2 was examined fig 5 however this component of supply also depends on the climatic conditions and a certain range of uncertainty exists for the water available from milluni lake therefore a more sophisticated method will be necessary in a future work to better quantify the marginal water from the achachicala system the extension of the diversion period is likely to be among the most promising measures to increase the natural water storage as shown in fig 5 cases 5 and 7 although it must be carefully implemented considering the existing water rights and the effect on stakeholders in downstream areas the results shown in fig 5 clearly indicate a prolonged period of failure in supplying water under the extreme climatic conditions of the future therefore other options are examined here for securing water under uncertain and extreme situations of climate supply and demand by quantifying the water resources available from the neighboring undeveloped taypichaca catchment fig 1 fig 6 shows the runoff from the taypichaca catchment simulated using the same glacio hydrological model used in this study because the hydro meteorological conditions over the taypichaca catchment are not available we applied the same meteorological conditions used for the hydrological simulation for each sub catchment of tuni lake to predict the runoff from the taypichaca catchment for cases 3 and 6 in both cases fig 6 a and b the projected annual runoff shows a certain range of uncertainty mainly caused by the difference in the total amount of precipitation measured in each sub catchment table 1 providing a low estimate when the data of the huayna potosi catchment were used among the cases simulated the lowest annual runoff was estimated to be 24 4 106 m3 year which is greater than the shortage estimated from the results shown in figs 5 and 7 fig 7 summarizes the gap between the projected water supply and demand for the el alto system for each case examined in the previous section to compare to the annual runoff available from the taypichaca catchment as shown in fig 7 a the water shortage is small or not serious until approximately 2023 for the cases with the demand of improved nrw except for case 6 and the supply exceeds the demand for case 5 until 2029 if the nrw is not improved as planned a continuous increased water shortage was calculated with an additional water deficit caused by the extreme climatic conditions assumed in the hydrological simulations fig 7 b considering the range of possible annual runoff from the taypichaca catchment fig 6 it was found that the deficit is supplemented for both cases of nrw improvement if the minimum amount of the runoff from the taypichaca catchment is assumed to be fully available 24 4 106 m3 year for the projected water shortage under the improved nrw situation fig 7 a it is expected that only a small portion of runoff from the taypichaca catchment is necessary to compensate for the deficit if the extended diversion from the condoriri and huayna potosi catchments is combined less than 2 106 m3 year and 10 106 m3 year for cases 5 and 7 respectively for the case of an unimproved nrw with the mean population estimate fig 7 b a disastrous drought would be avoided if a relatively large amount of runoff 10 20 106 m3 year can be transferred from the taypichaca catchment to the el alto system the expansion of the taypichaca lake reservoir supplementary fig s1 1 is expected to increase its capacity to 18 07 106 m3 5 in which the supply deficit under a less improved nrw condition is likely to be supplemented however because the inflow to the taypichaca lake reservoir is variable the storage can be insufficient as seen in the case of tuni lake under extreme weather conditions fig 4 regarding this new water source area there may be conflicting issues between local stakeholders and authorities mmaya and epsas regarding the existing water rights and the compensation for any losses and damages incurred resulting from the water transfer for better preparation in addressing a serious water shortage in la paz and el alto while minimizing the effect on current water users a well designed allocation of storage in taypichaca lake is very much required for adapting to serious drought throughout the region under extreme and variable climatic conditions that could occur in the foreseeable future 4 conclusions the future water supply and demand for the el alto system the most rapidly growing area of la paz and el alto bolivia was estimated for the first time based on population projections and the glacio hydrological simulations of runoff from source catchments and measures for adapting to future water scarcity were examined the population in la paz is projected to slightly decrease while the population in el alto is expected to increase by 2036 accordingly the water demand for the el alto system is projected to increase by 15 53 compared to the demand of 2011 depending on the scenario for the water loss in the supply system and population estimates a first order prediction of the supply for the el alto system from tuni lake was done under climatic conditions dictated by given trends and the downscaled gcm output with a detailed operational practice of the supply system we found that even for the lowest demand estimate the water deficit is likely to increase beginning in the mid 2020 s particularly for a case based on the downscaled gcm output that includes larger variability and a decreasing trend for precipitation thus water transfer from the neighboring achachicala system through milluni lake is indispensable to sustain the supply that cannot be covered by releases from tuni lake although it is not sufficient an extended period of diversion of runoff to tuni lake was found to be effective in increasing the supply to the el alto system resulting in a sustained water balance until 2027 even for the high estimates of population under an improved nrw because large uncertainty was found for the balance between the water supply and demand depending on the scenarios for population growth nrw improvement and climate variability and trend we examined the water availability from the taypichaca catchment to prepare for serious drought we showed that the transfer of runoff from the taypichaca catchment would greatly aid in

20166,water resources in la paz and el alto bolivia strongly depend on runoff from mountain catchments in the cordillera real andes the balance between the water available from the source catchments and the demand of the cities has become precarious during recent years because of an increasing population and the runoff variability caused by climate change in this study a first order estimate of the future water supply and demand for the el alto system the most rapidly growing area in la paz and el alto was obtained for the first time based on a demographic analysis and runoff projection and effective measures for adapting to water shortage were examined the water demand in 2036 is expected to increase by 15 53 compared to that of 2011 depending on the scenario for the water loss in the supply system and population estimates while the projected water supply shows frequent reductions because of the climate variability and decreasing glacial meltwater thus the water transfer from a neighboring system the achachicala system will be indispensable to sustain the supply that cannot be covered by releases from tuni lake nevertheless the el alto system will likely face a serious water shortage after the mid 2020s for the most conservative scenario of demand increase while large uncertainty was found for the balance of supply and demand depending on the scenarios for population growth improvement of water loss and climate variability and trend for supply side management the extended diversion of runoff into tuni lake water transfer from the achachicala system and transfer of runoff from the taypichaca catchment will be effective in securing the water supply under various uncertain conditions keywords water scarcity climate change population growth water supply and demand la paz and el alto andes 1 introduction water resources are a significant element in human settlement and social and economic development at a regional scale and are becoming globally important because of the strong global linkage with food and energy security e g 46 47 10 it is projected that water scarcity will progress globally particularly in regions where large populations occur and or there is a shift to drier climatic conditions with decreased precipitation as predicted e g 1 4 among the regions where water scarcity is already acute the pacific coastal plains and western slopes along the andes in bolivia chile ecuador and peru where a majority of the population and economic activity occur are susceptible to climate change and the resultant impacts on water resources 3 it is recognized that the region depends partly on water resources resulting from the melting of a large number of glaciers distributed at high altitudes in the andes 42 39 however glaciers in high altitudinal tropical regions are thought to be strongly affected by global warming 3 thus they are expected to undergo remarkable retreats 44 21 31 decreasing total volume of streamflow 14 and intensifying streamflow seasonality 17 18 it is recognized that much of the future water scarcity may be caused primarily by the demand side 45 buytaert and de bievre 6 analyzed future per capita water availability for major cities in the tropical andes and showed that the expected demographic changes are very likely to outpace the impact of climate change on water availability because the region will experience a high rate of population growth and the accompanying increase in water demand e g 1 it is also likely that the influence of a changing climate will be more serious for water security throughout the region carey et al 8 emphasized the necessity of a holistic hydro social framework via integrated analysis of both water availability and water use through a case study of the santa river peru drenkhan et al 11 reviewed hydroclimatic and socioeconomic drivers of water resources in two major catchments in the peruvian andes suggesting the need to better link water supply with demand research among areas considered as water scarce in the andean region we attempted to analyze the influence of climate change and population growth on the water security of the administrative capital of bolivia la paz and the rapidly developing adjacent city el alto located on the altiplano the cities are dependent for most of their water use on streamflow from catchments in the cordillera real andes however the area has experienced a strong increase in drought severity during the period 1985 2012 because of a higher reference evapotranspiration 43 furthermore as the demand has been increasing during recent years ministry of environment and water bolivia mmaya 24 particularly in the fast growing city of el alto temporary water rationing has been enacted because the el niño southern oscillation plays a significant role in precipitation over the bolivian andes 43 in addition to the influence of the amazon the area experienced its worst drought in 25 years because of an el niño episode during 2015 and 2016 bolivia s government declared a state of emergency in november 2016 because of the significant water shortage this climatic and social evidence and pressure on future water resources in la paz and el alto necessitate a detailed analysis of future water supply and demand to prepare for water scarcity under a changing climate and growing population as the increase in population is likely to continue and more water resources will be required for la paz and el alto a study of the demand side projection and adaptation to the deficit of water supply for these cities is urgently needed therefore reliable future growth projections based on more detailed population dynamic models need to be pursued to evaluate the impact on water resources 6 on the supply side glaciers annually contribute 15 of the water resources for la paz and more during the dry season 39 because glaciers in bolivia as well as in peru and ecuador have been rapidly retreating 32 12 38 21 36 45 and continuous retreat is anticipated 45 the future water availability for la paz and el alto needs to be projected with more focus on the non glacier origin of streamflow however compared to studies reported for the cordillera blanc peru e g 17 9 22 limited papers have been published on catchment scale water resources in the bolivian andes considering glacial and non glacial runoff components e g 7 39 despite the imminent threat of water scarcity in la paz and el alto therefore this study attempted for the first time to provide a first order estimate of the future water supply and demand for la paz and el alto and suggests adaptive measures to secure water resources by analyzing future demographic changes and the glacio hydrological response of source catchments under a changing climate considering the actual water supply systems in these cities 2 study area and methodology 2 1 study area the water supply for la paz and el alto is dependent on four drinking water systems fig 1 the el alto achachicala and pampahasi systems are based on surface water diverted from reservoirs in the cordillera mountain range and the tilata water system is based on groundwater withdrawal 5 24 the el alto system has the largest volume of treated water and supplies the rapidly expanding areas of el alto and a portion of la paz the achachicala and pampahasi systems cover the remainder of la paz the tilata system serves the part of el alto not covered by the el alto system its supply volume being relatively small during 2011 the total volume of water sent to these four treatment plants was 74 1 106 m3 among which the share of the el alto system was 42 2 the tilata system 7 5 and the achachicala and pampahasi systems were nearly equal 25 4 and 24 9 respectively the catchments linked to each of the supply systems are illustrated in fig 1 the main source catchment of the el alto system is the tuni lake catchment which includes the condoriri huayna potosi and tuni catchments fig 2 because of the growing water demand for the el alto system a part of the supply to the system has been supplemented by the water transferred from milluni lake in the milluni catchment since 2008 the line from milluni lake bifurcates to the el alto system before connecting with the achachicala system as shown in fig 1 the achachicala system is supplied water from the milluni catchment and the choqueyapu catchment the choqueyapu river has no reservoirs linked with the treatment plant but the seasonal streamflow from the river has been used in the system the pampahasi system is connected to the incachaca lake and hampaturi lake reservoirs these four catchments milluni choqueyapu incachaca and hampaturi have limited or no substantial glacial cover fig 1 the taypichaca river catchment is included in the figure because we examined the availability of water from this catchment to adapt for the anticipated future water scarcity in la paz and el alto although it is not currently serving any supply systems in la paz and el alto supplementary fig s1 1 in this study we specifically focused on the water supply and demand for the el alto system because it is the most rapidly growing area in la paz and el alto in the el alto system the runoff from partially glacier covered upstream catchments i e the condoriri tuni and huayna potosi catchments table 1 fig 2 is diverted and stored in tuni lake supplementary fig s1 2 the land surface of each catchment is largely covered by un vegetated soil and gravel figs 1 and 2 show the distribution of glacier covered areas obtained from landsat thematic mapper images obtained during 2010 with the band ratio method verified by liu et al 21 in these catchments lakes and wetlands occur along the stream and or on the hillslopes and contribute to retardation of the runoff from glacial melt and snowmelt gradually supplying the water the runoff from the tuni catchment flows into tuni lake throughout the year without control while the runoff from the condoriri and huayna potosi catchments is diverted to the lake through a channel connected to the stream running in each catchment fig 2 and supplementary fig s1 3 from november to april currently a constant volume of water nominal volume is 1 m3 s is released from tuni lake to the el alto system the excess volume of storage in the lake is discharged to the condoriri river from the spillway the capacity of tuni lake is summarized in supplementary table s1 1 the achachicala system covers the urban center of la paz and the system is supported by water from milluni lake storing runoff from the milluni catchment fig 1 the glacier contribution to the total runoff from the milluni catchment is relatively small compared to that of the tuni lake catchment 39 to adapt to increasing water demand in the el alto system the marginal part of the water storage has been transferred from milluni lake to the el alto system since 2008 2 2 estimation of future water demand the future water demand for the el alto and achachicala systems for domestic use was estimated based on the future population predicted by the cohort component method and provided values of supply coverage unit water consumption and non revenue water rate supplementary table 1 2 following the procedure shown in supplementary fig s1 4 the cohort component method is among the most commonly used methods for population projection and it considers fertility mortality and migration of each age and sex specific group because of the lack of statistics for fertility and mortality for each city we alternatively used the data for fertility and mortality for the la paz department obtained from the instituto nacional de estadística bolivia ine http www ine gob bo and the demographic health survey or dhs encuesta nacional de demografía y salud conducted by the ministry of health and sports and national institute of statistics ministerio de salud y deportes instituto nacional de estadística 26 and who bolivia http www who int countries bol en the net migration rate was calculated based on the population by age and sex 15 16 the birth rate obtained from dhs 2003 2008 and the fertility obtained from ine http www ine gob bo the method used for the projection was verified by comparing the population from the national census in 2012 and the estimated population by age and sex population pyramid for 2012 with the base population provided by the 2001 census data 15 16 we assumed that the changing water availability does not affect the fertility mortality and migration 34 although the water availability is considered as a driver for migration and resulting regional and ethnic tension 33 given the base population from the 2012 census the population in la paz and el alto was projected until 2036 which corresponds to the target year set in the master plan for portable water and sanitation developed by the mmaya 24 the total population in each city was allocated to each supply system including the el alto and achachicala systems based on the current ratio of population served by each system compared to the total population in each city then the future water demand for domestic use in each system was calculated from the total population served by each system using parameters provided in supplementary table 1 2 which were set based on mmaya 24 the total demand for commercial industrial and other uses was estimated for the el alto and achachicala systems as a percentage of the total demand 10 3 and 41 2 respectively based on zuleta 48 and the information provided by the empresa pública social del agua y saneamiento epsas the municipal utility that operates the supply system among demand side options for sustainable water use such as reducing consumption and repairing leaks an improvement in water loss in the whole system was considered to consider the effect of an improvement in non revenue water rate nrw we assumed that the nrw linearly improves from the actual rate in 2011 to the target rate for 2036 set in the master plan 24 2 3 estimation of available water resources we applied the semi distributed conceptual model developed by kinouchi et al 18 and improved in this study see supplementary information to the huayna potosi condoriri and tuni catchments fig 2 table 1 to quantify the inflow from these catchments into tuni lake under current and future climatic conditions the model parameters were updated from those used by kinouchi et al 18 supplementary tables s3 1 and s3 2 based on calibration with daily streamflow observed at gauging stations hh1 ht1 and hc1 fig 2 and supplementary fig s3 6 the albedo on the glacier surface of the huayna potosi glacier mhg and condoriri glacier mcg supplementary fig s3 7 and the water level in chiarcota lake supplementary fig s3 8 the daily lapse rate was provided from the air temperature observed at two automated weather stations awss the vertical gradient in precipitation was considered based on the monthly total precipitation observed at eight locations with an altitude ranging from 4490 m a s l to 4870 m a s l not shown in fig 2 the inflow to tuni lake was calculated based on a given operational rule of diversion of streamflow from the condoriri and huayna potosi catchments under the current rule the full diversion of streamflow is assumed to start on november 1 and end on april 15 the impact of climate change on the runoff from the three catchments and the release from tuni lake was quantified assuming several cases for the trend in air temperature and precipitation into the future the volume of release from tuni lake the glacier condition and the countermeasure table 2 the release from tuni lake was assumed constant throughout the projection period unless the water storage was below the dead capacity in case 5 the release rate was adjusted to maximize the constant release while maintaining the storage volume in the lake greater than that of the dead capacity in case 2 we assumed that there is no glacier in the tuni lake catchment to highlight the effect of glacial meltwater on modulating the drought situation while actual glacier conditions were used for other cases fig 2 as the initial condition and the glacierized area decreases depending on the volume of melted and sublimated glacier ice see supplementary information the no glacier scenario was used by baraer et al 2 and soruco et al 39 for the same purpose the latter being the application to la paz and el alto in cases 5 and 7 the full diversion is assumed during the extended period to examine the effect of this immediate countermeasure in cases 6 and 7 we used downscaled global climate model gcm outputs mri agcm with the spatial resolution of 20 km 19 the output of mri agcm was used because of its high performance in reproducing the present weather conditions over south america and the high spatial resolution to well resolve the andes mountains 19 mri agcm outputs for the sres a1b scenario nakicenovic and swart 30 were statistically bias corrected and downscaled for the period between 2020 and 2039 using the data from the awss fig 2 in the tuni lake catchment see supplementary information the trends for cases 1 through 5 as shown in table 2 were determined considering the long term trend found in the selected gcm outputs and an analysis of historical data over the same region based on the following overview the results of seiler et al 2013 show a median change in annual mean air temperature from 1961 to 90 to 2070 99 between 2 7 c for sres b1 scenario nakicenovic and swart 30 and 5 7 c for rcp 8 5 scenario moss et al 2010 among the five emission scenarios used in cmip3 and cmip5 which is equivalent to 0 25 c decade 1 and 0 52 c decade 1 respectively for annual precipitation the projections of the individual gcms varied so much that changes in the weighted ensembles were not statistically significant seiler et al 2013 similarly no significant change in annual total precipitation was obtained by thibeault et al 40 urrutia and vuille 41 indicated using a regional climate model with the a2 scenario that precipitation will decrease approximately 10 along the western slopes of the tropical andes above 4000 m a s l by the end of this century minvielle and garreaud 27 suggested a significant reduction 10 30 in altiplano precipitation by the end of this century our analysis of gcm outputs for the rcp8 5 scenario 29 in nine models gfdl cm3 csiro mk3 6 0 cmcc cm hadgem2 ao miroc5 mpi esm mr mri cgcm3 cnrm cm5 and ccsm4 indicated an increasing trend in air temperature between 0 32 c decade 1 and 0 6 c decade 1 with an average of 0 4 c decade 1 the relative change in annual precipitation in these outputs ranged from 0 42 year to 0 4 year with an average near 0 and the standard deviation equal to 0 27 year indicating no clear increasing or decreasing trend we also analyzed the annual precipitation and mean air temperature measured at the el alto airport 16 30 37 68 11 55 and obtained from the era interim dataset 291 22 30 292 7 30 s16 7 30 s16 52 30 between 1985 and 2014 the measured and reanalyzed data showed a trend of 0 14 c decade 1 and 0 29 c decade 1 respectively but there was no significant trend in annual precipitation in both datasets a comprehensive review by rabatel et al 2013 concluded that precipitation has not displayed a significant spatially coherent trend in the tropical andes since the middle of the 20th century based on these reviews and analyses we assumed that the air temperature will change in the future at a rate of 0 4 c decade 1 which is the average of the nine gcm outputs and near the average for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios as shown by seiler et al 37 for cases 1 through 5 the trend in precipitation was set to 0 with an uncertainty range of 0 2 year which is considered in cases 3 trend 0 2 year and 4 trend 0 2 year reflecting a variety of trends found in different sources of current and future precipitation the downscaled mri agcm data used for cases 6 and 7 shows a trend of annual mean air temperature and annual precipitation at each aws ranging between 0 19 c and 0 28 c decade 1 and between 0 65 year and 0 43 year respectively supplementary fig s2 8 although the underlying scenarios used to run mri agcm sres scenarios are different from those in cmip5 knutti and sedláček 20 indicated that the projected global temperature change from cmip5 models is remarkably similar to that from those used in cmip3 and the similarity of the projected precipitation change in cmip3 and cmip5 is reassuring therefore we considered that the output from mri agcm can be used as one of the scenarios to compare with other scenarios defined by cmip5 gcm outputs the water available from tuni lake to release into the el alto system was evaluated by analyzing the temporal variation in water storage based on the water balance in the lake under a given condition of release table 2 considering inflow from three catchments overflow from the spillway and precipitation and evaporation over the lake surface the evaporation was estimated using the bulk transfer method with measured and projected wind velocity air temperature and relative humidity at mt1 near the lake see supplementary information we assume that no water is released if the water storage in tuni lake is less than the dead capacity the variation in water storage in tuni lake was verified under the current operational rule of intake and release the future water supply was evaluated using the total volume of water released from tuni lake and transferred from milluni lake to meet the future increase in water demand for the el alto system we considered three options to increase the water supply i e the transfer of marginal water from milluni lake the extension of the period to divert streamflow from the condoriri and huayna potosi catchments into tuni lake and the use of stream water from the neighboring taypichaca catchment the transfer from milluni lake was assumed to increase considering the decrease in demand for the achachicala system as explained in the subsequent section the extended diversion from the current source areas could be the most practical option the runoff from the taypichaca catchment is considered as one of the new water resources 5 because of the advantage of a nearer location to la paz and el alto and the larger catchment size with a potentially large volume of glaciers however the water availability from the catchment has never been analyzed or reported here we apply the semi distributed model to the taypichaca catchment to quantify the water resources potentially available from the catchment under future climate conditions the simulation period covers from 2011 when our weather monitoring started to 2036 the target year of the master plan 24 all of the future scenarios in table 2 utilize the weather data obtained from june 2011 to july 2017 under cases 1 through 5 meteorological forcing for the simulation was generated based on the observed weather conditions between 2011 and 2017 with the trend in air temperature and precipitation in each case added for the following period from august 2017 until august 2037 for cases 6 and 7 the observed weather data were spliced on the downscaled gcm output covering the period between 2020 and 2039 see supplementary information the annual water availability was calculated for each hydrological year which was defined as starting in september and ending in august 35 3 results 3 1 change in population and water demand in the future the result of the population projection using the cohort component method is shown in fig 3 the total population in la paz is estimated to decrease from 0 77 million in 2012 to 0 69 0 75 million in 2036 while the population in el alto significantly increases from 0 85 million in 2012 to 1 17 1 28 million in 2036 our result shows a reasonable trend for each city compared to the future population reported by mmaya 25 fig 3 which was obtained from the exponential growth model considering the population changes only until 2001 the mean growth rate of the total population during 2012 2036 was calculated and ranged between 0 46 year and 0 07 year for la paz and 1 33 year and 1 74 year for el alto as a result the total population in la paz and el alto in 2036 is estimated to increase by 14 6 and 26 2 for low and high estimates respectively relative to the total population in 2012 the mean growth rate of the total population during 2012 2036 is calculated to be between 0 57 year and 0 98 year which is less than that obtained from the future population reported by the mmaya 2 2 year the decreasing trend in population in la paz is a result mainly of a decreasing birth rate and net outbound migration the decreasing population growth rate in el alto is mainly a result of the decreasing birth rate in addition we found that the population pyramid is projected to shift from a current expanding shape to a contracting la paz or stationary el alto shape supplementary fig s1 5 the result of the population served by the el alto and achachicala systems which was allocated from the projected population in la paz and el alto is shown in supplementary table s1 3 for selected years the corresponding result of water demand is shown in table 3 indicating that the water demand for the el alto system will increase by 15 25 in 2036 compared to the demand in 2011 with the range depending on the population estimate table 3 includes the water demand obtained with the assumption that the current condition of water loss nrw continues into 2036 without improvement resulting in an increase of 40 53 the water demand for the achachicala system in 2036 will decrease by 23 or slightly increase by 3 compared to that in 2011 depending on the population estimate the effect of improving water loss a comparison between the cases of improved nrw and current nrw increases towards the end of the projection period resulting in a water saving of 8 3 106 m3 and 9 0 106 m3 for the low and high population estimates respectively table 3 if the current water losses were not improved in accordance with the master plan a serious increase in water demand due to population growth would be expected the uncertainty range of the water demand for the el alto system resulting from population projection increases from approximately 2022 as can be seen in fig 5 3 2 current and future runoff and water storage the performance of the model in reproducing the current flow regime was confirmed by comparing the simulated monthly flow depths monthly total streamflow volume divided by the catchment area with those observed at three gauging stations supplementary fig s3 6 the performance was judged to be very good or good using three metrics i e nash sutcliffe efficiency nse ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr and percent bias pbias moriasi et al 28 see supplementary table s3 3 the streamflow is greater during the wet season between november and april for the tuni and huayna potosi catchments while for the condoriri catchment limited streamflow was observed during november and more flow was apparent during may because of the temporary storage of runoff in the relatively large natural lakes in the catchment this characteristic suggests that more water can be diverted into tuni lake by extending the period for diversion particularly from the condoriri river the simulated inflow to tuni lake was verified using the water storage volume converted from the water level observed by the epsas and prof m umeda from tohoku university japan personal communication for the period between 2011 and 2017 fig 4 a in the simulation the water volume released from the lake nominal volume 1 m3 s was adjusted to 0 97 m3 s for better agreement with the observed storage volume the storage volume shows a periodic variation with its annual minimum occurring during november or december while a certain volume of water 7 6 9 6 106 m3 remained even during the serious drought year from 2015 to 2016 the simulated water balance in tuni lake indicates that a nearly constant release has been attained and the overflow of excess storage was simulated in each hydrological year between 2012 and 2015 fig 4 b the simulated volume of water supply during august 2011 and july 2017 release from tuni lake transfer from milluni lake 33 4 106 m3 year is nearly the same as the water demand quantified by mmaya 24 for 2011 32 4 106 m3 year table 4 fig 4 shows the projected results of water storage and water balance in the lake for case 1 and case 6 indicating the periods that the storage empties and the release is reduced or even 0 for a certain period the maximum reduction occurs in october the reason for the decreasing trend in storage found for case 1 is the decreasing runoff from glacier covered areas including glacier melt snowmelt and subsurface runoff which coincide with the stage of negative runoff change for retreating glaciers in the same region 2 14 similarly for case 6 the influence of decreasing glacial meltwater combined with the larger variability in precipitation fig 4 h resulted in a greater reduction in the release as time passed fig 4 f the effect of glacial melt can be approximately estimated as the difference in the inflow to tuni lake between case 1 and case 2 which indicates an approximately 6 1 contribution of glacial meltwater to the annual inflow during 2011 and 2038 and a 10 2 contribution during 2011 and 2016 soruco et al 39 indicated that more than 20 of the discharge could be lost with complete disappearance of all glaciers in the tuni lake catchment the different estimates may be mainly because of the difference in the period of analysis less contribution is likely during recent periods because of shrinking glaciers and the limited period of streamflow diversion from the condoriri and huayna potosi catchments the contribution increases to 10 6 during 2011 and 2016 if the annual total runoff is used from isotope analysis guido et al 13 estimated a higher percentage of glacial meltwater contribution for the storage in tuni lake possibly because glacial meltwater contains some fraction of melted old ice in addition to melted recent snow 3 3 projected water supply for the el alto system and a comparison to the water demand fig 5 shows the projected water supply for the el alto system which is the sum of release from tuni lake and the transfer from milluni lake the maximum volume in table 3 was used under different scenarios of climate change glacier cover and adaptation measures as can be seen in the figure the annual water demand for the system for different population estimates and nrw improvement scenarios was also included the difference in water supply among the cases is mainly because of the different volumes of inflow to tuni lake and the influence of precipitation and evaporation over the lake s surface is relatively small table 4 the increasing trend in supply is clearer for cases 3 and 5 because of the sufficient inflow to tuni lake to sustain the constant release 0 97 m3 s throughout the year and the increasing volume of transfer from milluni lake the same condition applies for all cases which is a result of the decreasing demand on the achachicala system other cases show a decrease in supply during some periods because of insufficient storage to release the specified volume of water 0 97 m3 s from tuni lake the results for cases 3 and 4 indicate a possible range of impacts caused by the uncertainty in the trend in precipitation the result of case 4 shows three periods of decreased supply which were not found in case 3 caused by the periodically lower precipitation with a superposed decreasing trend during the 20 years from 2017 to 2036 as a result the water supply for case 4 decrease to much less than the demand even for the case of improved nrw with low population estimates the contribution of meltwater for modulating the drought situation was found by comparing the results for case 1 and case 2 as shown in fig 5 the result for case 2 shows a frequent failure in supplying the specified volume of water due to the lack of glacial meltwater runoff which would typically occur during the early wet season from october to early december although the contribution of glacial meltwater runoff to the storage in tuni lake was estimated to be approximately 10 during the period 2011 2016 although the percentage is not so high on average a significant influence on supply could be caused by the lack of glacial meltwater during some years this is mainly because of the reduced runoff during the period when the glacial meltwater mostly contributes to the streamflow i e from september to november depending on the weather conditions in each melting season the result for case 6 shows a greater decrease in supply in 2027 and 2033 because of a prolonged period of failure in keeping the storage above the dead capacity fig 4 f the reason for the serious failure is the lesser amount of precipitation during 2027 and 2031 2033 and the decreasing contribution from glacial meltwater as glacial retreat progresses the projected water supply for the different future scenarios cases 1 3 4 and 6 are nearly in a critical balance with the demand until approximately 2023 even though a serious decrease in supply was found for case 6 after 2023 the supply deficit continues to increase even against the case of the lowest demand estimate a low population and improved nrw if the projected demand follows the high estimate for improved nrw the supply deficit is expected to be more serious for these cases and an extremely large shortage was found for some years for case 6 the results of cases 5 and 7 show the effect of an extended period of streamflow diversion from the condoriri and the huayna potosi rivers for case 5 a greater constant release becomes possible 1 023 m3 s without emptying the storage and the balance between the demand for the low population estimate with improved nrw is maintained throughout the simulation period while the demand for the high population estimate is not satisfied after 2027 similarly for case 7 the extension of the diversion period resulted in more years of constant release 0 97 m3 s without failure and an increase in the mean annual supply compared to that for case 6 the extension of the diversion period requires no additional cost in terms of infrastructure supplementary fig s1 3 thus it can be an immediate and effective measure to prepare for the expected decrease in the lake storage however the coordination of existing water rights among local people and compensation and support for downstream stakeholders is necessary particularly for smallholder farmers that especially vulnerable to climate change and water shortages 23 3 4 balancing the water supply and demand under climate extremes and uncertain socio economical situations the uncertainty of water supply and demand related to the projection of climate change population estimates and implementation of countermeasures needs to be considered to secure water for this rapidly growing region for example the water shortage in the el alto system is predicted to become more serious if the water losses in the supply system are not reduced as planned in the master plan 24 as shown in fig 5 gray dashed lines although a serious shortage in water supply has not chronically occurred thus far implying continuous progress in nrw improvement temporary water rationing has sometimes been enacted therefore future progress in nrw improvement is still uncertain and will be affected by economic and political situations in previous sections we assumed an increase in transfer from milluni lake because of the projected decrease in demand for the achachicala system the effect of the transfer was considered while each scenario in table 2 was examined fig 5 however this component of supply also depends on the climatic conditions and a certain range of uncertainty exists for the water available from milluni lake therefore a more sophisticated method will be necessary in a future work to better quantify the marginal water from the achachicala system the extension of the diversion period is likely to be among the most promising measures to increase the natural water storage as shown in fig 5 cases 5 and 7 although it must be carefully implemented considering the existing water rights and the effect on stakeholders in downstream areas the results shown in fig 5 clearly indicate a prolonged period of failure in supplying water under the extreme climatic conditions of the future therefore other options are examined here for securing water under uncertain and extreme situations of climate supply and demand by quantifying the water resources available from the neighboring undeveloped taypichaca catchment fig 1 fig 6 shows the runoff from the taypichaca catchment simulated using the same glacio hydrological model used in this study because the hydro meteorological conditions over the taypichaca catchment are not available we applied the same meteorological conditions used for the hydrological simulation for each sub catchment of tuni lake to predict the runoff from the taypichaca catchment for cases 3 and 6 in both cases fig 6 a and b the projected annual runoff shows a certain range of uncertainty mainly caused by the difference in the total amount of precipitation measured in each sub catchment table 1 providing a low estimate when the data of the huayna potosi catchment were used among the cases simulated the lowest annual runoff was estimated to be 24 4 106 m3 year which is greater than the shortage estimated from the results shown in figs 5 and 7 fig 7 summarizes the gap between the projected water supply and demand for the el alto system for each case examined in the previous section to compare to the annual runoff available from the taypichaca catchment as shown in fig 7 a the water shortage is small or not serious until approximately 2023 for the cases with the demand of improved nrw except for case 6 and the supply exceeds the demand for case 5 until 2029 if the nrw is not improved as planned a continuous increased water shortage was calculated with an additional water deficit caused by the extreme climatic conditions assumed in the hydrological simulations fig 7 b considering the range of possible annual runoff from the taypichaca catchment fig 6 it was found that the deficit is supplemented for both cases of nrw improvement if the minimum amount of the runoff from the taypichaca catchment is assumed to be fully available 24 4 106 m3 year for the projected water shortage under the improved nrw situation fig 7 a it is expected that only a small portion of runoff from the taypichaca catchment is necessary to compensate for the deficit if the extended diversion from the condoriri and huayna potosi catchments is combined less than 2 106 m3 year and 10 106 m3 year for cases 5 and 7 respectively for the case of an unimproved nrw with the mean population estimate fig 7 b a disastrous drought would be avoided if a relatively large amount of runoff 10 20 106 m3 year can be transferred from the taypichaca catchment to the el alto system the expansion of the taypichaca lake reservoir supplementary fig s1 1 is expected to increase its capacity to 18 07 106 m3 5 in which the supply deficit under a less improved nrw condition is likely to be supplemented however because the inflow to the taypichaca lake reservoir is variable the storage can be insufficient as seen in the case of tuni lake under extreme weather conditions fig 4 regarding this new water source area there may be conflicting issues between local stakeholders and authorities mmaya and epsas regarding the existing water rights and the compensation for any losses and damages incurred resulting from the water transfer for better preparation in addressing a serious water shortage in la paz and el alto while minimizing the effect on current water users a well designed allocation of storage in taypichaca lake is very much required for adapting to serious drought throughout the region under extreme and variable climatic conditions that could occur in the foreseeable future 4 conclusions the future water supply and demand for the el alto system the most rapidly growing area of la paz and el alto bolivia was estimated for the first time based on population projections and the glacio hydrological simulations of runoff from source catchments and measures for adapting to future water scarcity were examined the population in la paz is projected to slightly decrease while the population in el alto is expected to increase by 2036 accordingly the water demand for the el alto system is projected to increase by 15 53 compared to the demand of 2011 depending on the scenario for the water loss in the supply system and population estimates a first order prediction of the supply for the el alto system from tuni lake was done under climatic conditions dictated by given trends and the downscaled gcm output with a detailed operational practice of the supply system we found that even for the lowest demand estimate the water deficit is likely to increase beginning in the mid 2020 s particularly for a case based on the downscaled gcm output that includes larger variability and a decreasing trend for precipitation thus water transfer from the neighboring achachicala system through milluni lake is indispensable to sustain the supply that cannot be covered by releases from tuni lake although it is not sufficient an extended period of diversion of runoff to tuni lake was found to be effective in increasing the supply to the el alto system resulting in a sustained water balance until 2027 even for the high estimates of population under an improved nrw because large uncertainty was found for the balance between the water supply and demand depending on the scenarios for population growth nrw improvement and climate variability and trend we examined the water availability from the taypichaca catchment to prepare for serious drought we showed that the transfer of runoff from the taypichaca catchment would greatly aid in

20167,this article focuses on the emerging landscape for alternative transfer methods atms in colorado usa atms are developing within a legal landscape of water rights governed by prior appropriation law growing demand for water in urban centers driven by population growth and an aging rural farm population whose most valuable asset may include senior water rights rural urban water transfers in the past have been linked to the collapse of rural economies if pursued to the extreme extent of buy and dry where water rights were purchased outright and permanently removed from agricultural land e g crowley county this article focuses on the emerging innovations of atms which seek to accomplish the same purpose of providing additional water to growing cities but through more flexible mechanisms such as rotational fallowing interruptible supplies and water banks that aim to preserve rural economies as well we review the history and context for water allocation in colorado the history of rural urban transfers and focus on atms and their pros and cons we conclude with implications of atms for water governance and providing flexibility and sustainability in a changing climate 1 introduction competition for water in the arid western united states including the state of colorado has been a fact of life for over a century as a state that has adjudicated water rights for well over 100 years and one that has been at the leading edge of experiments with water markets colorado s experience is relevant not only across the western u s but perhaps internationally as well for other arid and semi arid regions hoping to improve resiliency in the face of climate change and drought located at the intersection of the rocky mountains and the eastern plains colorado is known as a headwaters state because the majority of its rivers originate within the state s borders this includes major regional national and international rivers such as the colorado river rio grande and south platte settlers to this region from the east coast of the u s in the 1860s developed a system of legally based water rights allocation known as prior appropriation that has persisted to this day prior appropriation recognizes the right to use water as a matter of priority date specifically users that put water to beneficial use at an earlier date have seniority over users whose first use came later in time in addition to priority another fundamental component to prior appropriation is that users must continue to beneficially use their entire water right because the right is for use of water not actual ownership of water or they may risk forfeiting that right through what is known as abandonment in the western u s and colorado specifically numerous challenges face water managers as they attempt to balance supplies and demands with a range of stakeholders sectors and ecosystems in addition to having some of the fastest growing urban centers in the country colorado s urban front range is projected to grow by 45 by 2050 state demographer s office and an overall trend from rural to urban economies the region has experienced climate and hydrologic changes which threaten available supplies 22 as temperatures in the region continue to increase water managers can expect increased demands earlier snowmelt and runoff and an overall decrease in water availability 31 accordingly effective water governance will become increasingly important to mitigate the challenges of climate change and population growth and ultimately help societies grapple with fundamental supply and demand imbalances against this backdrop water allocated to agriculture is a seemingly easy target to help meet the needs of growing urban populations because many of the settlers in the 1800s were agricultural land owners the most senior water rights in the west are generally owned by farmers and ranchers with some but not all municipalities often being latecomers to the table to obtain rights for their residents as the population of western urban centers burgeons the pressure to reexamine this allocation pattern has intensified while agricultural landowners hold senior rights and individuals are free to sell their water rights subject to court approval cities exert significant economic and political pressure to ensure they are able to supply their populations with sufficient water out into the future in purely volumetric terms the vast majority of water is allocated still to agricultural uses whether for food crops or animal feed in addition a decline in natural flows due to human uses has had adverse effects on ecological systems in some cases drying up entire reaches during peak summer months as populations have grown and the drying of the western u s is anticipated from climate change economists have argued that water needs to be allocated more efficiently through the functioning of a water market rather than relying on centralized bureaucratic control pg 439 howe et al 25 water markets have grown substantially since the 1980s in the semi arid west prices were higher for agriculture to urban trades than for agriculture to agriculture trades and ag urban trades are rising more rapidly than the latter 4 the value of water traded in western u s water markets ranges from year to year but was as high as 800 million in 2015 driven by a drought in california causing buyers to seek more reliable water rights portfolios 41 a comparison of water markets across five countries found considerable variability in water markets as evidenced by institutional foundations economic efficiency and environmental sustainability 21 garrick et al 17 have examined water markets in large basins in the u s and australia to garner insights into how transaction costs interact with efficient water market institutions the authors discuss the importance of avoiding institutional arrangements that create lock in or path dependency as they limit flexibility as conditions change further investments in institutional transition costs such as conflict resolution reform or establishing water users associations can prove effective in reducing transaction costs water markets howe et al 25 argued need to have flexibility in allocation security of tenure information on true opportunity cost predictable outcomes perception of a fair and equitable process and the incorporation of public values beyond individual water user interests water markets have been controversial and critiqued for their inability to fully capture and express public values such as ecological and cultural values 25 26 29 water transfers have resulted in impacts on rural areas such as erosion of the local tax base degradation of the formerly irrigated land and threats to the economic health and lifestyle of rural areas 28 36 the economic disparity between the selling area where the water rights originate and the buying area often result in a tradeoff not only between the level of agricultural activities and alternatives made possible by the proceeds from water sales but between lifestyles and culture page 362 howe 26 in a court case over water rights in an acequia system dating from the 1800s in new mexico usa a judge rejected the inherent assumption that greater economic benefits are more desirable than the preservation of cultural identity ibid however the experience of the murray darling basin in australia suggests that with an appropriate institutional framework and planning water markets can function well to deliver both environmental outcomes and social goals 20 although the program is now being revisited as criticism mounts that outcomes have not met these expectations 19 water markets and transfers have been growing but remain controversial leading to a desire in some regions to try other mechanisms of transferring the right to use water that might be able to preserve social and environmental values while still meeting the growing demands of urban areas in this article we develop a case study of the state of colorado examining how alternate transfer methods atms are being developed and whether they work to offer the flexibility and economic efficiency of water markets while preserving social cultural and environmental values flexibility is a key element of building adaptive capacity for water management under a changing climate 15 public perception of the procedural equity and fairness of what might seem like otherwise rational adaptation policies put forward by state and local governments is likely to be another critical and contentious area in the future 1 while the programs discussed here should still very much be considered experiments we argue that much can be learned about ways forward for addressing supply and demand imbalances climate change adaptation and more sustainable governance by examining the experience of atms in colorado 2 a tale of two water markets in colorado in 2015 the total value of water transfers in colorado was 79 million representing about 73 000 acre feet one acre foot is equal to the volume of water covering one acre of land one foot deep or 1233 5 m3 of water traded 41 as discussed below the experience with water markets in colorado has been mixed 28 2 1 flexibility and northern colorado water conservancy district s water market one water market in colorado that has been viewed as relatively successful in terms of efficient water governance and low transaction costs is within the northern colorado water conservancy district northern in northeast colorado northern is a public irrigation district that was created to help manage the colorado big thompson cbt project which is one of the major transbasin diversions discussed earlier somewhat unique in colorado northern established a formal water market allowing users within the district s boundaries to voluntarily buy and sell water shares each year 27 28 a share is not a specific quantity of water but rather a proportion of what is available each year depending on that year s snowpack and available surface runoff proportional allocation schemes as opposed to fixed allocation schemes have been suggested as providing greater institutional adaptability 35 in the northern context this type of scheme provides resilience for water availability and for users of the system because it ensures that the amount of water delivered to users is scaled to what is available allowing for automatic flexibility and responsiveness to environmental changes and access to at least some water by everyone on the system the alternative prior appropriation model that some users are prioritized to receive their full amount of water over others means that some users would go without shares entirely in a drought year the price of water in northern s market depends on numerous factors including the type of use time of year and the quota prescribed by northern which all means the price can fluctuate substantially inter and intra annually for example during the 2013 water year the price of one share fluctuated between 9500 and 18 500 demonstrating the volatility of the market 23 despite short term fluctuations however the price of shares has continued to increase in the long term as municipalities compete to purchase the often cheaper agricultural supplies within the district additional features of northern s market further distinguish it from other regions in the state for example the market within northern s district does not require review by the state s water court something that is required for most other water rights transactions and can often lead to a long drawn out process for transferring water rights this feature imparts flexibility and therefore resilience as the system can respond more quickly to changing needs of users however while these features allow for a robust water market to operate within the district s boundaries it is difficult to make direct comparisons to other regions throughout the state 2 2 lower arkansas valley water transfers buy and dry in crowley county a cautionary tale crowley county is in the southeastern part of colorado just east of pueblo along the arkansas river formed in 1911 and farmed heavily over the next several decades the area thrived mid century with irrigation provided by a network of ditches that move water from the west slope via twin lakes reservoir and canal company and the colorado canal company onto fields in the eastern plains 18 where farmers grew sugar beets tomatoes onions and later melons but chronic droughts like the dust bowl in the 1930s combined with economic stressors such as ongoing debt low commodity prices and the loss of the sugar city beet plant in 1967 left some producers questioning their solvency 38 until 1972 the colorado canal company which fed crowley farms had in its documents a requirement that water and land be sold together water speculators from the crowley land and development company who purchased a majority of shares went to court and had the two severed 34 they sold their water rights to growing cities and municipalities like pueblo aurora and colorado springs through what is now called buy and dry as farms dried up from water sales cascading effects devastated the community buy and dry led to loss of tax revenue decreased land values and businesses and schools closing leaving the county today with 3000 residents half of the population at its height in the 1920s more telling the number of acres irrigated has declined from 56 000 in 1968 just as water sales started to 2000 today 13 33 buy and dry can unintentionally externalize the costs of growth in urban centers to rural communities who have less diverse economic options 13 28 36 moreover this case reinforces the point that water markets are not panaceas for fragile economies with few economic options and suggests that other under large scale climate change other types of reforms may be needed still today crowley county is widely cited by state and local communities as a parable of worst case outcomes should buy and dry practices continue and thus has become motivation for new experiments in water management 3 experiments with alternative transfer methods atms in colorado 3 1 the basics of atms while it is true that the voluntary transactions of water markets serve the interests of both buyers and sellers as is the case with northern s water market the resulting loss of water and agricultural production can bring a host of hardships for affected communities including remaining irrigators those in agricultural support industries rural governments and the general public dependent upon schools law enforcement and other social services funded by tax revenues as was the case in crowley county such transfers may also adversely affect the environment and may be viewed as predatory in nature with wealthy cities and industries taking advantage of a financially stressed farmers and small rural communities with limited resources as shown in the earlier case studies the degree to which such characterizations are supportable vary from case to case and are subject to interpretation but the fact remains that there is widespread interest amongst potential buyers and sellers policymakers and other interested parties in moving toward a better model of water management that better model may be alternative transfer methods atms the atm terminology is used broadly to describe a host of newer types of approaches to facilitate additional water transfers from rural areas but in a way that minimizes local impacts or in some cases even produces local economic and or environmental benefits cwcb 9 table 1 from colorado water plan 2015 atms typically differ from buy and dry approaches in three ways transfers are temporary land is not permanently taken out of production and the irrigator at least in part retains ownership of the water right central to this calculus is that some water remains in use for irrigation at all times while a component of that water is transferred minimizing the pain in these arrangements relies on incentivizing cost effective ways for farmers to reduce use with this conserved water being the subject of the transfer conserved water is usually produced in one of three ways the simplest of these is fallowing which entails taking a given parcel of land out of production for a given period typically a year or entire growing season often this is done on a rotational basis e g one section of every ten is fallowed each year while other forms entail taking lands out of production only in drought years or only in that part of the summer irrigation season where water consumption is highest relative to plant productivity e g split season fallowing the other two techniques keep all lands in production but save water either by crop switching i e replacing water thirsty crops with those using less water or some form of deficit irrigation in which crops are given a reduced amount of water on the premise that yields are likely to decrease in a proportion less than the amount by which water deliveries were reduced once conserved water is then transferred to urban or industrial users who compensate the farmer for expenses associated with equipment transaction costs and or lost revenues presumably this becomes a stable new revenue stream that supports rather than undercuts the rural agricultural economy while allowing cities and industries to meet new growth pressures without looking to already overtapped rivers in some cases atms are also seen as a vehicle for augmenting instream flows addressing drought emergencies and dealing with potential inter and intra state curtailments associated with priority based river administration all these applications are predicated on two frequently occurring conditions agricultural water uses that are less sensitive to periodic water shortages than other uses and situations in which there are higher economic returns possible for water used for municipal and industrial waters than the same amount of water used in agriculture with proper arrangements these conditions can be a source of flexibility that can be creatively exploited for mutual benefit in practice however a host of barriers have impeded the widespread application of atms in colorado 3 2 the use of atms in colorado while atms are in use in colorado it is still easier for municipalities to gain new water supplies through permanently fallowing agricultural land 6 as a result through pressures of growth both within and without the state it has been estimated that colorado could lose between 500 000 and 700 000 acres of currently irrigated farmland 10 the state has articulated a goal of maintaining agricultural viability while supporting agricultural conservation and efficiency 11 in addition agricultural communities are not only experiencing pressure on their water supply from municipal and environmental needs but are also experiencing demographic changes in their communities that threaten the workforce available for maintaining agricultural in the state as a result colorado s water plan not only seeks to find creative ways of sharing agricultural water with urban areas but also seeks to implement programs to enable coloradans to enter the agriculture industry 11 the state has set a goal of sharing at least 50 000 acre feet of agricultural water using voluntary atms by 2030 11 the colorado water plan 2015 highlights a number of examples of atms underway in colorado including an arrangement between the morgan ditch company and xcel energy the major utility in the state to lease water for xcel energy s pawnee power station in dry years some of the farmland is fallowed to provide water for xcel and the rest is irrigated with sufficient senior water rights the city of thornton has also agreed to provide emergency water to another power company the platte river power authority a water banking working group is exploring water banking on a larger scale within the colorado river basin the city of aurora has partnered with farmers to help purchase more efficient watering systems farmers have reduced consumptive use and aurora has access to some of the conserved water the city of aurora has also entered into an interruptible supply agreement with the rocky ford highline canal group of farmers these types of interruptible supplies allow for more flexible drought relief and recovery of water supplies following drought ducks unlimited is a non profit interested in preserving wildlife and partnered with aurora water and colorado corn growers to implement wildlife habitat of interest in the lower arkansas valley water conservancy district irrigators organized into the lower arkansas valley super ditch company which allows for collective leasing of agricultural water and acts as a negotiating entity they are engaged in a pilot program to temporarily transfer water from agricultural lands in the catlin canal system to municipal communities the state hopes to learn from this experimental atm implementation in the arkansas basin castle et al 6 summarize some of the discussion among different participants with an interest in atms in colorado and find there are still many open questions but there is strong interest in the state continuing its leadership role in facilitating progress on discussion on atms the state has also provided over 1 5 million to study or pilot atms these mechanisms providing emergency water linking delivery of water to a different use depending on the climate conditions providing financing for upgrading efficiency while allowing use by cities creating interruptible supplies governing water in a negotiating entity instead of as single owners all provide new ways of introducing flexibility and therefore potentially produce adaptive capacity and resilience in an otherwise legally rigid system atms are not without tensions however municipalities value the permanence of water availability in the end 12 the cost effectiveness of atms is also important rate payers willingness to support the costs of creative arrangements and new irrigation infrastructure for example may be limited on the agricultural side some farmers have expressed doubt that atms will really become a viable alternative to permanent fallowing of agricultural lands and are skeptical of participating as they fear atms may not be able to protect farmers water rights in the end 37 atms may provide stability in farm revenue but some producers worry that they may miss out on years of high commodity value by participating in some of these programs 6 the question also remains about whether atms are scalable enough to be able to reverse the trend of permanent fallowing of agricultural land finally as tools that work within the framework of prior appropriation water rights atms do little to resolve some of the doctrines fundamental shortcomings such as environmental protection interruptible supplies may be acceptable in some cases for balancing needs of farms and cities but unacceptable for preserving fish and wildlife who depend on river flows every year for survival ultimately whether or not mechanisms such as atms confer resilience to climate change over the long term remains to be seen 3 3 challenges associated with atms in colorado a variety of barriers impede the development of well functioning western usa water markets including those based on atms some of these barriers are unique to the institutional and physical setting of colorado whereas others are more widely applicable the major barriers to atms in colorado are summarized below 9 3 3 1 changes in consumptive use under colorado law when water is sold and transferred to a new user the amount actually moved is limited to the historical consumptive use and not the diversion amount this is done to ensure that other rights holders on the stream where water is diverted will experience no injury i e no reduction in water availability due to the transaction legally quantifying consumptive use occurs as part of a change case in water court or in a state engineer approved substitute supply plan typically supported by studies provided by water resource engineers and past records documenting diversions and irrigation practices one of the reasons traditional and permanent water transfers can be a lengthy process the challenge is two fold establishing consumptive use before and after the proposed transfer in both settings a simple water balance is usually applied amount diverted return flows consumptive use for many irrigation rights the diversion amount is often measured using a weir or other technology however the other two values can only be estimated often this entails the application of models and tables calibrated with data such as acreage soil conditions crop types local climate conditions and so on all tailored to showing how changes to the irrigation regime affect evapotranspiration et getting agreement on these values can be very difficult lurking beneath this technical challenge is a legal conundrum often referred to the use it or lose it doctrine the doctrine is based on the premise that the size of a water right is determined by actual past usage and if a rights holder for some reason decreases their amount of consumption then the size of a water right can be reduced accordingly the farming practices employed to conserve water for the atm by design reduce consumptive use which means that participation in an atm may make the irrigator vulnerable to a water right reduction thereby negating any incentive to participate see 39 such risks are common in the western states where only a few states e g california montana washington and oregon provide any means for a water right owner to retain some ownership of conserved water 14 in colorado the assumption is that conserved waters are to be returned to the stream and made subject to call by prior appropriators see colorado water conservancy district v shelton farms inc 529 p 2d 1321 1325 colo 1974 the colorado legislature has taken steps to alleviate these concerns and provide needed certainty to both buyers and sellers in atms but doubts linger about how these issues might actually play out in the legal system given some negative experiences with previous buy and dry arrangements such as crowley county public perception of atms is an important consideration 3 3 2 infrastructure considerations the range of possible water transactions is dependent on the infrastructure available to physically move water from one place to another in some situations this is not a serious impediment for example transferring an upstream water right to a downstream user can be as simple as letting the water flow downhill in the natural streamcourse however if the seller is downstream of the purchaser then the water either needs to be physically transferred upstream or it has to be exchanged upstream with another water source in some settings such as colorado s south platte basin very little exchange potential remains which suggests that new infrastructure namely storage and pipelines may be necessary to execute atms that otherwise are financially and legally viable 8 part of the appeal as well as the physical mechanism of atms is that they presumably would draw small percentages of water out of an agricultural region s water portfolio leaving sufficient water in place to maintain crop production pulling 5 of water from all agricultural regions rather than 100 of water from 5 of those regions has dramatically better socioeconomic implications for rural areas but doing so requires highly distributed infrastructure lacking such disastrous buy and dry situations emerge again as was the case with crowley county which was facilitated in part by the presence of existing storage and delivery infrastructure 13 3 3 3 the costs of doing business much of the promise of water markets hinges on the observation that the economic value of water used in municipal and industrial m i is often dramatically greater than its value in agriculture 2 m i users often have the financial resources to make such transactions beneficial to participating farmers however cities do not wish to overpay and farmers do not wish to undersell lacking information about what constitutes an appropriate price can deter participation in the market especially for farmers who feel at a strategic disadvantage to cities with the expertise and resources to research the market with a few exceptions most notably for water from the colorado big thompson project discussed earlier relevant transaction prices are rarely available for comparison while determining appropriate pricing is a challenge to all water transfers including traditional buy and dry transactions atms raise two special complications first given the partial farming operations associated with atms and the frequent market driven changes in crop and livestock profitability estimating the economic merits of leasing arrangements can be particularly challenging for farmers in recent years several tools have been developed to aid in these calculations 7 5 30 39 presumably more experimentation with atms along with efforts to better compile and publicly disseminate information about market activity will help establish appropriate pricing structures and could overcome some reluctance to participation the other cost related challenge is more fundamental and challenging and it speaks directly to some of the issues noted below a significant financial impediment to all water transfers is the transaction costs namely the legal and engineering fees associated with pursuing the change case in water court given that atms can modify diversion amounts consumptive use levels and return flow volumes in ways that are much more difficult to estimate than in a simple buy and dry arrangement the transactions costs of atms are generally assumed to be equivalent or higher as a permanent buy and dry cwcb 9 9 citing research from ccga et al 7 for cities that might already be reluctant to pursue temporary rather than permanent exchanges the specter of added transactions costs is a significant additional barrier 3 4 atm experiences in the lower arkansas valley a recent analysis of the dynamics of drought decisions across different sectors along the arkansas river demonstrates that crowley county has become an example of creeping resilience in the region 24 a term that points to the fact that communities that have become highly vulnerable to stressors can become an example over time of decisions that might be avoided in the future it is a slow resilience for some outside the system built upon the unintended consequences the arise from the vulnerability of others namely buy and dry atms are an important example of alternative or adaptive measures however experimental they might be given the amount of water being bought by municipalities throughout the 1980s and 1990s efforts to end buy and dry practices increased the lower arkansas valley water conservation district formed in 2002 through a ballot initiative began a program to keep water in the valley through conservation easements in 2005 others began to explore experimental leases including rotational fallowing programs creating agreements between municipalities to lease water from farmers who fallow fields for three of ten years at a specified amount of money per share in otero county an area adjacent to crowley one pilot program the super ditch includes a collective of seven canal companies that hope to demonstrate how such alternatives might work on a larger scale 13 still an important consideration in the success of atms is the perceptions of success and value by those in the agricultural community attitudes about atms along the arkansas river are mixed henderson et al 24 find that some agricultural producers express enthusiasm about the possibility that atms affords both as a continuation of a way of life valued by agricultural producers and as a benefit to their individual businesses during times of drought these people see atms as a positive option for both the farmer who gets financial reimbursement and the municipality who gets supplemental water during times of drought some have gone so far as to suggest that the super ditch has been popular among producers and has garnered widespread interest across the state in part this willingness centers on how experiments shift practices from buying to leasing which means producers can share water instead of selling it thus keeping it in agriculture it is an effort that further emphasizes the agricultural producers desires to keep control of the water right and keep water on farms while still being able to work with water utilities to fulfill their obligation to communities municipalities on the other hand are less enthusiastic about leases because of potential costs for transfers and risk tolerance related to securing permanent water versus short term supplies 16 still there is potential for atms to benefit both sectors as one local arkansas basin farmer noted of atm s potential as an alternative to buy and dry if we can make these experiments work it will be a win win situation for everyone involved the farmers will have something they can lease every year and cities get guaranteed water supplies 32 but agricultural producers optimism is not simply about controlling individual rights to water it also potentially indicates an attitudinal shift in the broader producer community a desire to sustain agriculture as part of the future of colorado henderson et al note that there is a shift to a responsible community attitude which is as much about the heritage of agriculture as it is about the importance of considering impacts of water sales on one s neighbors who depend on collaborative solutions in an interconnected system atms may have also shifted values from those that emphasize self interest and self reliance of individuals to a collective community of agriculture that requires compromise and self sacrifice this finding substantiates other literatures that suggest crowley county proved a tragic but useful lesson for all along the arkansas about how bad it can get 3 40 42 attitudinal shifts may also permit flexibility in approaching how water arrangements might be made in the future as climates change as well thus atms potentially encourage a more holistic thinking about the kinds of consequences and interconnections that exist in water transfers for those who are skeptical of atms the reasons span a scale of micro to macro one problem with the lease fallowing programs for example is the effect on the land especially the soil and its ability to recover the ground may not recover after lying fallow for a year or more with changes to the microbial health and other organic matter another potential concern is the loss of clients for some farmers should they sacrifice one crop as part of their lease agreements and still others worry about farm laborers finding new places to work and not returning to those areas where atms could disrupt their seasonal jobs 24 in these instances then an experiment that might generate compromises in water use is not worth risks to an individual farmer s productivity and finances in this way decisions about water use in the west may be seen as proxies for competing societal goals around continued growth changing cultural values and the survival of particular ways of life and livelihoods 4 conclusion despite all the promise of atms the fact remains that their application in colorado has been slow and isolated atms bring out deep divisions among various water constituencies with some parties arguing that streamlined transfers and a broader adoption of atms is key to avoiding buy and dry and protecting rural economies while others argue that atm reforms only make it easier to accelerate the dry up of agricultural lands in part this is a question of differing philosophies but in part it is also a question of trust particularly among some residents of rural colorado some irrigators are fearful that atm reforms will be unduly shaped by urban and environmental interests and by senior water rights holders who feel that efforts to build flexibility and administrative ease into transfers do so by removing the substantive and procedural protections currently afforded to them in water court some also fear that a focus on atms may do nothing to quell the trend of transfer activity being concentrated in areas that have the misfortune of being in regions that due to geography economics and the presence of infrastructure are most desirable for front range urban customers given this reality it is critical to acknowledge an important overarching impediment that is not often captured in the literature namely the political reality that atms are rarely anyone s preferred option their plan a while those in the agricultural community generally view atms as preferable to buy and dry it is still less desirable than having no ag to urban water transfers at all cities are generally eager to avoid the bad publicity of buy and dry but the fact remains that atms are often not seen as offering the same level of reliability and predictability as outright purchases and can entail proportionally larger transactions costs environmentalists and public interest advocates are often more focused on managing urban demands for both environmental and financial reasons than promoting atms that expand urban consumption and sprawl and create a need for new infrastructure political leaders are also torn attempting to facilitate atms on one hand while also working to maintain existing protections for other rights holders and establishing new protections to those third parties historically impacted by transfers given this it is not unusual for the legislature to simultaneously consider competing bills that both streamline and further regulate water transfers the future of atms in colorado is uncertain while there is clearly a willingness to experiment with these mechanisms and the state of colorado is showing strong leadership in setting a goal for 50 000 acre feet to be shared through atms by 2030 some remain skeptical and the ability to scale widely is uncertain it may be difficult to protect the value of preserving agricultural and rural landscapes in colorado in the face of economic pressures to sell water to growing cities experimentation with atms is being watched closely while traditional water transfers also continue apace the colorado state water plan and the willingness of some agriculturalists and municipalities to engage the experiment suggests a broad desire to preserve the state s agricultural heritage there is no doubt that some are going to great lengths to demonstrate that the water transfer mechanism can be made to work to support social and cultural values this period of experimentation is providing valuable information on options for adapting to climate change in the future in colorado still at this point the answer of how widespread a role atms may play in colorado s water landscape or indeed nationally or internationally is incomplete as garrick et al 17 note there is much to learn about the tradeoffs path dependencies and institutional tradeoffs of water markets in the future water markets are only one possible mechanism to confer resilience on systems managing water scarcity under a changing climate the experience of colorado suggests that the political social and historical context matter for designing effective water markets and that we should not necessarily expect to find a one size fits all design that can be applied in the same way everywhere furthermore we should not see these mechanisms as remaining static over time but as learning opportunities that we revisit revise and update as experience with their impacts and effectiveness is gained acknowledgements this research has been

20167,this article focuses on the emerging landscape for alternative transfer methods atms in colorado usa atms are developing within a legal landscape of water rights governed by prior appropriation law growing demand for water in urban centers driven by population growth and an aging rural farm population whose most valuable asset may include senior water rights rural urban water transfers in the past have been linked to the collapse of rural economies if pursued to the extreme extent of buy and dry where water rights were purchased outright and permanently removed from agricultural land e g crowley county this article focuses on the emerging innovations of atms which seek to accomplish the same purpose of providing additional water to growing cities but through more flexible mechanisms such as rotational fallowing interruptible supplies and water banks that aim to preserve rural economies as well we review the history and context for water allocation in colorado the history of rural urban transfers and focus on atms and their pros and cons we conclude with implications of atms for water governance and providing flexibility and sustainability in a changing climate 1 introduction competition for water in the arid western united states including the state of colorado has been a fact of life for over a century as a state that has adjudicated water rights for well over 100 years and one that has been at the leading edge of experiments with water markets colorado s experience is relevant not only across the western u s but perhaps internationally as well for other arid and semi arid regions hoping to improve resiliency in the face of climate change and drought located at the intersection of the rocky mountains and the eastern plains colorado is known as a headwaters state because the majority of its rivers originate within the state s borders this includes major regional national and international rivers such as the colorado river rio grande and south platte settlers to this region from the east coast of the u s in the 1860s developed a system of legally based water rights allocation known as prior appropriation that has persisted to this day prior appropriation recognizes the right to use water as a matter of priority date specifically users that put water to beneficial use at an earlier date have seniority over users whose first use came later in time in addition to priority another fundamental component to prior appropriation is that users must continue to beneficially use their entire water right because the right is for use of water not actual ownership of water or they may risk forfeiting that right through what is known as abandonment in the western u s and colorado specifically numerous challenges face water managers as they attempt to balance supplies and demands with a range of stakeholders sectors and ecosystems in addition to having some of the fastest growing urban centers in the country colorado s urban front range is projected to grow by 45 by 2050 state demographer s office and an overall trend from rural to urban economies the region has experienced climate and hydrologic changes which threaten available supplies 22 as temperatures in the region continue to increase water managers can expect increased demands earlier snowmelt and runoff and an overall decrease in water availability 31 accordingly effective water governance will become increasingly important to mitigate the challenges of climate change and population growth and ultimately help societies grapple with fundamental supply and demand imbalances against this backdrop water allocated to agriculture is a seemingly easy target to help meet the needs of growing urban populations because many of the settlers in the 1800s were agricultural land owners the most senior water rights in the west are generally owned by farmers and ranchers with some but not all municipalities often being latecomers to the table to obtain rights for their residents as the population of western urban centers burgeons the pressure to reexamine this allocation pattern has intensified while agricultural landowners hold senior rights and individuals are free to sell their water rights subject to court approval cities exert significant economic and political pressure to ensure they are able to supply their populations with sufficient water out into the future in purely volumetric terms the vast majority of water is allocated still to agricultural uses whether for food crops or animal feed in addition a decline in natural flows due to human uses has had adverse effects on ecological systems in some cases drying up entire reaches during peak summer months as populations have grown and the drying of the western u s is anticipated from climate change economists have argued that water needs to be allocated more efficiently through the functioning of a water market rather than relying on centralized bureaucratic control pg 439 howe et al 25 water markets have grown substantially since the 1980s in the semi arid west prices were higher for agriculture to urban trades than for agriculture to agriculture trades and ag urban trades are rising more rapidly than the latter 4 the value of water traded in western u s water markets ranges from year to year but was as high as 800 million in 2015 driven by a drought in california causing buyers to seek more reliable water rights portfolios 41 a comparison of water markets across five countries found considerable variability in water markets as evidenced by institutional foundations economic efficiency and environmental sustainability 21 garrick et al 17 have examined water markets in large basins in the u s and australia to garner insights into how transaction costs interact with efficient water market institutions the authors discuss the importance of avoiding institutional arrangements that create lock in or path dependency as they limit flexibility as conditions change further investments in institutional transition costs such as conflict resolution reform or establishing water users associations can prove effective in reducing transaction costs water markets howe et al 25 argued need to have flexibility in allocation security of tenure information on true opportunity cost predictable outcomes perception of a fair and equitable process and the incorporation of public values beyond individual water user interests water markets have been controversial and critiqued for their inability to fully capture and express public values such as ecological and cultural values 25 26 29 water transfers have resulted in impacts on rural areas such as erosion of the local tax base degradation of the formerly irrigated land and threats to the economic health and lifestyle of rural areas 28 36 the economic disparity between the selling area where the water rights originate and the buying area often result in a tradeoff not only between the level of agricultural activities and alternatives made possible by the proceeds from water sales but between lifestyles and culture page 362 howe 26 in a court case over water rights in an acequia system dating from the 1800s in new mexico usa a judge rejected the inherent assumption that greater economic benefits are more desirable than the preservation of cultural identity ibid however the experience of the murray darling basin in australia suggests that with an appropriate institutional framework and planning water markets can function well to deliver both environmental outcomes and social goals 20 although the program is now being revisited as criticism mounts that outcomes have not met these expectations 19 water markets and transfers have been growing but remain controversial leading to a desire in some regions to try other mechanisms of transferring the right to use water that might be able to preserve social and environmental values while still meeting the growing demands of urban areas in this article we develop a case study of the state of colorado examining how alternate transfer methods atms are being developed and whether they work to offer the flexibility and economic efficiency of water markets while preserving social cultural and environmental values flexibility is a key element of building adaptive capacity for water management under a changing climate 15 public perception of the procedural equity and fairness of what might seem like otherwise rational adaptation policies put forward by state and local governments is likely to be another critical and contentious area in the future 1 while the programs discussed here should still very much be considered experiments we argue that much can be learned about ways forward for addressing supply and demand imbalances climate change adaptation and more sustainable governance by examining the experience of atms in colorado 2 a tale of two water markets in colorado in 2015 the total value of water transfers in colorado was 79 million representing about 73 000 acre feet one acre foot is equal to the volume of water covering one acre of land one foot deep or 1233 5 m3 of water traded 41 as discussed below the experience with water markets in colorado has been mixed 28 2 1 flexibility and northern colorado water conservancy district s water market one water market in colorado that has been viewed as relatively successful in terms of efficient water governance and low transaction costs is within the northern colorado water conservancy district northern in northeast colorado northern is a public irrigation district that was created to help manage the colorado big thompson cbt project which is one of the major transbasin diversions discussed earlier somewhat unique in colorado northern established a formal water market allowing users within the district s boundaries to voluntarily buy and sell water shares each year 27 28 a share is not a specific quantity of water but rather a proportion of what is available each year depending on that year s snowpack and available surface runoff proportional allocation schemes as opposed to fixed allocation schemes have been suggested as providing greater institutional adaptability 35 in the northern context this type of scheme provides resilience for water availability and for users of the system because it ensures that the amount of water delivered to users is scaled to what is available allowing for automatic flexibility and responsiveness to environmental changes and access to at least some water by everyone on the system the alternative prior appropriation model that some users are prioritized to receive their full amount of water over others means that some users would go without shares entirely in a drought year the price of water in northern s market depends on numerous factors including the type of use time of year and the quota prescribed by northern which all means the price can fluctuate substantially inter and intra annually for example during the 2013 water year the price of one share fluctuated between 9500 and 18 500 demonstrating the volatility of the market 23 despite short term fluctuations however the price of shares has continued to increase in the long term as municipalities compete to purchase the often cheaper agricultural supplies within the district additional features of northern s market further distinguish it from other regions in the state for example the market within northern s district does not require review by the state s water court something that is required for most other water rights transactions and can often lead to a long drawn out process for transferring water rights this feature imparts flexibility and therefore resilience as the system can respond more quickly to changing needs of users however while these features allow for a robust water market to operate within the district s boundaries it is difficult to make direct comparisons to other regions throughout the state 2 2 lower arkansas valley water transfers buy and dry in crowley county a cautionary tale crowley county is in the southeastern part of colorado just east of pueblo along the arkansas river formed in 1911 and farmed heavily over the next several decades the area thrived mid century with irrigation provided by a network of ditches that move water from the west slope via twin lakes reservoir and canal company and the colorado canal company onto fields in the eastern plains 18 where farmers grew sugar beets tomatoes onions and later melons but chronic droughts like the dust bowl in the 1930s combined with economic stressors such as ongoing debt low commodity prices and the loss of the sugar city beet plant in 1967 left some producers questioning their solvency 38 until 1972 the colorado canal company which fed crowley farms had in its documents a requirement that water and land be sold together water speculators from the crowley land and development company who purchased a majority of shares went to court and had the two severed 34 they sold their water rights to growing cities and municipalities like pueblo aurora and colorado springs through what is now called buy and dry as farms dried up from water sales cascading effects devastated the community buy and dry led to loss of tax revenue decreased land values and businesses and schools closing leaving the county today with 3000 residents half of the population at its height in the 1920s more telling the number of acres irrigated has declined from 56 000 in 1968 just as water sales started to 2000 today 13 33 buy and dry can unintentionally externalize the costs of growth in urban centers to rural communities who have less diverse economic options 13 28 36 moreover this case reinforces the point that water markets are not panaceas for fragile economies with few economic options and suggests that other under large scale climate change other types of reforms may be needed still today crowley county is widely cited by state and local communities as a parable of worst case outcomes should buy and dry practices continue and thus has become motivation for new experiments in water management 3 experiments with alternative transfer methods atms in colorado 3 1 the basics of atms while it is true that the voluntary transactions of water markets serve the interests of both buyers and sellers as is the case with northern s water market the resulting loss of water and agricultural production can bring a host of hardships for affected communities including remaining irrigators those in agricultural support industries rural governments and the general public dependent upon schools law enforcement and other social services funded by tax revenues as was the case in crowley county such transfers may also adversely affect the environment and may be viewed as predatory in nature with wealthy cities and industries taking advantage of a financially stressed farmers and small rural communities with limited resources as shown in the earlier case studies the degree to which such characterizations are supportable vary from case to case and are subject to interpretation but the fact remains that there is widespread interest amongst potential buyers and sellers policymakers and other interested parties in moving toward a better model of water management that better model may be alternative transfer methods atms the atm terminology is used broadly to describe a host of newer types of approaches to facilitate additional water transfers from rural areas but in a way that minimizes local impacts or in some cases even produces local economic and or environmental benefits cwcb 9 table 1 from colorado water plan 2015 atms typically differ from buy and dry approaches in three ways transfers are temporary land is not permanently taken out of production and the irrigator at least in part retains ownership of the water right central to this calculus is that some water remains in use for irrigation at all times while a component of that water is transferred minimizing the pain in these arrangements relies on incentivizing cost effective ways for farmers to reduce use with this conserved water being the subject of the transfer conserved water is usually produced in one of three ways the simplest of these is fallowing which entails taking a given parcel of land out of production for a given period typically a year or entire growing season often this is done on a rotational basis e g one section of every ten is fallowed each year while other forms entail taking lands out of production only in drought years or only in that part of the summer irrigation season where water consumption is highest relative to plant productivity e g split season fallowing the other two techniques keep all lands in production but save water either by crop switching i e replacing water thirsty crops with those using less water or some form of deficit irrigation in which crops are given a reduced amount of water on the premise that yields are likely to decrease in a proportion less than the amount by which water deliveries were reduced once conserved water is then transferred to urban or industrial users who compensate the farmer for expenses associated with equipment transaction costs and or lost revenues presumably this becomes a stable new revenue stream that supports rather than undercuts the rural agricultural economy while allowing cities and industries to meet new growth pressures without looking to already overtapped rivers in some cases atms are also seen as a vehicle for augmenting instream flows addressing drought emergencies and dealing with potential inter and intra state curtailments associated with priority based river administration all these applications are predicated on two frequently occurring conditions agricultural water uses that are less sensitive to periodic water shortages than other uses and situations in which there are higher economic returns possible for water used for municipal and industrial waters than the same amount of water used in agriculture with proper arrangements these conditions can be a source of flexibility that can be creatively exploited for mutual benefit in practice however a host of barriers have impeded the widespread application of atms in colorado 3 2 the use of atms in colorado while atms are in use in colorado it is still easier for municipalities to gain new water supplies through permanently fallowing agricultural land 6 as a result through pressures of growth both within and without the state it has been estimated that colorado could lose between 500 000 and 700 000 acres of currently irrigated farmland 10 the state has articulated a goal of maintaining agricultural viability while supporting agricultural conservation and efficiency 11 in addition agricultural communities are not only experiencing pressure on their water supply from municipal and environmental needs but are also experiencing demographic changes in their communities that threaten the workforce available for maintaining agricultural in the state as a result colorado s water plan not only seeks to find creative ways of sharing agricultural water with urban areas but also seeks to implement programs to enable coloradans to enter the agriculture industry 11 the state has set a goal of sharing at least 50 000 acre feet of agricultural water using voluntary atms by 2030 11 the colorado water plan 2015 highlights a number of examples of atms underway in colorado including an arrangement between the morgan ditch company and xcel energy the major utility in the state to lease water for xcel energy s pawnee power station in dry years some of the farmland is fallowed to provide water for xcel and the rest is irrigated with sufficient senior water rights the city of thornton has also agreed to provide emergency water to another power company the platte river power authority a water banking working group is exploring water banking on a larger scale within the colorado river basin the city of aurora has partnered with farmers to help purchase more efficient watering systems farmers have reduced consumptive use and aurora has access to some of the conserved water the city of aurora has also entered into an interruptible supply agreement with the rocky ford highline canal group of farmers these types of interruptible supplies allow for more flexible drought relief and recovery of water supplies following drought ducks unlimited is a non profit interested in preserving wildlife and partnered with aurora water and colorado corn growers to implement wildlife habitat of interest in the lower arkansas valley water conservancy district irrigators organized into the lower arkansas valley super ditch company which allows for collective leasing of agricultural water and acts as a negotiating entity they are engaged in a pilot program to temporarily transfer water from agricultural lands in the catlin canal system to municipal communities the state hopes to learn from this experimental atm implementation in the arkansas basin castle et al 6 summarize some of the discussion among different participants with an interest in atms in colorado and find there are still many open questions but there is strong interest in the state continuing its leadership role in facilitating progress on discussion on atms the state has also provided over 1 5 million to study or pilot atms these mechanisms providing emergency water linking delivery of water to a different use depending on the climate conditions providing financing for upgrading efficiency while allowing use by cities creating interruptible supplies governing water in a negotiating entity instead of as single owners all provide new ways of introducing flexibility and therefore potentially produce adaptive capacity and resilience in an otherwise legally rigid system atms are not without tensions however municipalities value the permanence of water availability in the end 12 the cost effectiveness of atms is also important rate payers willingness to support the costs of creative arrangements and new irrigation infrastructure for example may be limited on the agricultural side some farmers have expressed doubt that atms will really become a viable alternative to permanent fallowing of agricultural lands and are skeptical of participating as they fear atms may not be able to protect farmers water rights in the end 37 atms may provide stability in farm revenue but some producers worry that they may miss out on years of high commodity value by participating in some of these programs 6 the question also remains about whether atms are scalable enough to be able to reverse the trend of permanent fallowing of agricultural land finally as tools that work within the framework of prior appropriation water rights atms do little to resolve some of the doctrines fundamental shortcomings such as environmental protection interruptible supplies may be acceptable in some cases for balancing needs of farms and cities but unacceptable for preserving fish and wildlife who depend on river flows every year for survival ultimately whether or not mechanisms such as atms confer resilience to climate change over the long term remains to be seen 3 3 challenges associated with atms in colorado a variety of barriers impede the development of well functioning western usa water markets including those based on atms some of these barriers are unique to the institutional and physical setting of colorado whereas others are more widely applicable the major barriers to atms in colorado are summarized below 9 3 3 1 changes in consumptive use under colorado law when water is sold and transferred to a new user the amount actually moved is limited to the historical consumptive use and not the diversion amount this is done to ensure that other rights holders on the stream where water is diverted will experience no injury i e no reduction in water availability due to the transaction legally quantifying consumptive use occurs as part of a change case in water court or in a state engineer approved substitute supply plan typically supported by studies provided by water resource engineers and past records documenting diversions and irrigation practices one of the reasons traditional and permanent water transfers can be a lengthy process the challenge is two fold establishing consumptive use before and after the proposed transfer in both settings a simple water balance is usually applied amount diverted return flows consumptive use for many irrigation rights the diversion amount is often measured using a weir or other technology however the other two values can only be estimated often this entails the application of models and tables calibrated with data such as acreage soil conditions crop types local climate conditions and so on all tailored to showing how changes to the irrigation regime affect evapotranspiration et getting agreement on these values can be very difficult lurking beneath this technical challenge is a legal conundrum often referred to the use it or lose it doctrine the doctrine is based on the premise that the size of a water right is determined by actual past usage and if a rights holder for some reason decreases their amount of consumption then the size of a water right can be reduced accordingly the farming practices employed to conserve water for the atm by design reduce consumptive use which means that participation in an atm may make the irrigator vulnerable to a water right reduction thereby negating any incentive to participate see 39 such risks are common in the western states where only a few states e g california montana washington and oregon provide any means for a water right owner to retain some ownership of conserved water 14 in colorado the assumption is that conserved waters are to be returned to the stream and made subject to call by prior appropriators see colorado water conservancy district v shelton farms inc 529 p 2d 1321 1325 colo 1974 the colorado legislature has taken steps to alleviate these concerns and provide needed certainty to both buyers and sellers in atms but doubts linger about how these issues might actually play out in the legal system given some negative experiences with previous buy and dry arrangements such as crowley county public perception of atms is an important consideration 3 3 2 infrastructure considerations the range of possible water transactions is dependent on the infrastructure available to physically move water from one place to another in some situations this is not a serious impediment for example transferring an upstream water right to a downstream user can be as simple as letting the water flow downhill in the natural streamcourse however if the seller is downstream of the purchaser then the water either needs to be physically transferred upstream or it has to be exchanged upstream with another water source in some settings such as colorado s south platte basin very little exchange potential remains which suggests that new infrastructure namely storage and pipelines may be necessary to execute atms that otherwise are financially and legally viable 8 part of the appeal as well as the physical mechanism of atms is that they presumably would draw small percentages of water out of an agricultural region s water portfolio leaving sufficient water in place to maintain crop production pulling 5 of water from all agricultural regions rather than 100 of water from 5 of those regions has dramatically better socioeconomic implications for rural areas but doing so requires highly distributed infrastructure lacking such disastrous buy and dry situations emerge again as was the case with crowley county which was facilitated in part by the presence of existing storage and delivery infrastructure 13 3 3 3 the costs of doing business much of the promise of water markets hinges on the observation that the economic value of water used in municipal and industrial m i is often dramatically greater than its value in agriculture 2 m i users often have the financial resources to make such transactions beneficial to participating farmers however cities do not wish to overpay and farmers do not wish to undersell lacking information about what constitutes an appropriate price can deter participation in the market especially for farmers who feel at a strategic disadvantage to cities with the expertise and resources to research the market with a few exceptions most notably for water from the colorado big thompson project discussed earlier relevant transaction prices are rarely available for comparison while determining appropriate pricing is a challenge to all water transfers including traditional buy and dry transactions atms raise two special complications first given the partial farming operations associated with atms and the frequent market driven changes in crop and livestock profitability estimating the economic merits of leasing arrangements can be particularly challenging for farmers in recent years several tools have been developed to aid in these calculations 7 5 30 39 presumably more experimentation with atms along with efforts to better compile and publicly disseminate information about market activity will help establish appropriate pricing structures and could overcome some reluctance to participation the other cost related challenge is more fundamental and challenging and it speaks directly to some of the issues noted below a significant financial impediment to all water transfers is the transaction costs namely the legal and engineering fees associated with pursuing the change case in water court given that atms can modify diversion amounts consumptive use levels and return flow volumes in ways that are much more difficult to estimate than in a simple buy and dry arrangement the transactions costs of atms are generally assumed to be equivalent or higher as a permanent buy and dry cwcb 9 9 citing research from ccga et al 7 for cities that might already be reluctant to pursue temporary rather than permanent exchanges the specter of added transactions costs is a significant additional barrier 3 4 atm experiences in the lower arkansas valley a recent analysis of the dynamics of drought decisions across different sectors along the arkansas river demonstrates that crowley county has become an example of creeping resilience in the region 24 a term that points to the fact that communities that have become highly vulnerable to stressors can become an example over time of decisions that might be avoided in the future it is a slow resilience for some outside the system built upon the unintended consequences the arise from the vulnerability of others namely buy and dry atms are an important example of alternative or adaptive measures however experimental they might be given the amount of water being bought by municipalities throughout the 1980s and 1990s efforts to end buy and dry practices increased the lower arkansas valley water conservation district formed in 2002 through a ballot initiative began a program to keep water in the valley through conservation easements in 2005 others began to explore experimental leases including rotational fallowing programs creating agreements between municipalities to lease water from farmers who fallow fields for three of ten years at a specified amount of money per share in otero county an area adjacent to crowley one pilot program the super ditch includes a collective of seven canal companies that hope to demonstrate how such alternatives might work on a larger scale 13 still an important consideration in the success of atms is the perceptions of success and value by those in the agricultural community attitudes about atms along the arkansas river are mixed henderson et al 24 find that some agricultural producers express enthusiasm about the possibility that atms affords both as a continuation of a way of life valued by agricultural producers and as a benefit to their individual businesses during times of drought these people see atms as a positive option for both the farmer who gets financial reimbursement and the municipality who gets supplemental water during times of drought some have gone so far as to suggest that the super ditch has been popular among producers and has garnered widespread interest across the state in part this willingness centers on how experiments shift practices from buying to leasing which means producers can share water instead of selling it thus keeping it in agriculture it is an effort that further emphasizes the agricultural producers desires to keep control of the water right and keep water on farms while still being able to work with water utilities to fulfill their obligation to communities municipalities on the other hand are less enthusiastic about leases because of potential costs for transfers and risk tolerance related to securing permanent water versus short term supplies 16 still there is potential for atms to benefit both sectors as one local arkansas basin farmer noted of atm s potential as an alternative to buy and dry if we can make these experiments work it will be a win win situation for everyone involved the farmers will have something they can lease every year and cities get guaranteed water supplies 32 but agricultural producers optimism is not simply about controlling individual rights to water it also potentially indicates an attitudinal shift in the broader producer community a desire to sustain agriculture as part of the future of colorado henderson et al note that there is a shift to a responsible community attitude which is as much about the heritage of agriculture as it is about the importance of considering impacts of water sales on one s neighbors who depend on collaborative solutions in an interconnected system atms may have also shifted values from those that emphasize self interest and self reliance of individuals to a collective community of agriculture that requires compromise and self sacrifice this finding substantiates other literatures that suggest crowley county proved a tragic but useful lesson for all along the arkansas about how bad it can get 3 40 42 attitudinal shifts may also permit flexibility in approaching how water arrangements might be made in the future as climates change as well thus atms potentially encourage a more holistic thinking about the kinds of consequences and interconnections that exist in water transfers for those who are skeptical of atms the reasons span a scale of micro to macro one problem with the lease fallowing programs for example is the effect on the land especially the soil and its ability to recover the ground may not recover after lying fallow for a year or more with changes to the microbial health and other organic matter another potential concern is the loss of clients for some farmers should they sacrifice one crop as part of their lease agreements and still others worry about farm laborers finding new places to work and not returning to those areas where atms could disrupt their seasonal jobs 24 in these instances then an experiment that might generate compromises in water use is not worth risks to an individual farmer s productivity and finances in this way decisions about water use in the west may be seen as proxies for competing societal goals around continued growth changing cultural values and the survival of particular ways of life and livelihoods 4 conclusion despite all the promise of atms the fact remains that their application in colorado has been slow and isolated atms bring out deep divisions among various water constituencies with some parties arguing that streamlined transfers and a broader adoption of atms is key to avoiding buy and dry and protecting rural economies while others argue that atm reforms only make it easier to accelerate the dry up of agricultural lands in part this is a question of differing philosophies but in part it is also a question of trust particularly among some residents of rural colorado some irrigators are fearful that atm reforms will be unduly shaped by urban and environmental interests and by senior water rights holders who feel that efforts to build flexibility and administrative ease into transfers do so by removing the substantive and procedural protections currently afforded to them in water court some also fear that a focus on atms may do nothing to quell the trend of transfer activity being concentrated in areas that have the misfortune of being in regions that due to geography economics and the presence of infrastructure are most desirable for front range urban customers given this reality it is critical to acknowledge an important overarching impediment that is not often captured in the literature namely the political reality that atms are rarely anyone s preferred option their plan a while those in the agricultural community generally view atms as preferable to buy and dry it is still less desirable than having no ag to urban water transfers at all cities are generally eager to avoid the bad publicity of buy and dry but the fact remains that atms are often not seen as offering the same level of reliability and predictability as outright purchases and can entail proportionally larger transactions costs environmentalists and public interest advocates are often more focused on managing urban demands for both environmental and financial reasons than promoting atms that expand urban consumption and sprawl and create a need for new infrastructure political leaders are also torn attempting to facilitate atms on one hand while also working to maintain existing protections for other rights holders and establishing new protections to those third parties historically impacted by transfers given this it is not unusual for the legislature to simultaneously consider competing bills that both streamline and further regulate water transfers the future of atms in colorado is uncertain while there is clearly a willingness to experiment with these mechanisms and the state of colorado is showing strong leadership in setting a goal for 50 000 acre feet to be shared through atms by 2030 some remain skeptical and the ability to scale widely is uncertain it may be difficult to protect the value of preserving agricultural and rural landscapes in colorado in the face of economic pressures to sell water to growing cities experimentation with atms is being watched closely while traditional water transfers also continue apace the colorado state water plan and the willingness of some agriculturalists and municipalities to engage the experiment suggests a broad desire to preserve the state s agricultural heritage there is no doubt that some are going to great lengths to demonstrate that the water transfer mechanism can be made to work to support social and cultural values this period of experimentation is providing valuable information on options for adapting to climate change in the future in colorado still at this point the answer of how widespread a role atms may play in colorado s water landscape or indeed nationally or internationally is incomplete as garrick et al 17 note there is much to learn about the tradeoffs path dependencies and institutional tradeoffs of water markets in the future water markets are only one possible mechanism to confer resilience on systems managing water scarcity under a changing climate the experience of colorado suggests that the political social and historical context matter for designing effective water markets and that we should not necessarily expect to find a one size fits all design that can be applied in the same way everywhere furthermore we should not see these mechanisms as remaining static over time but as learning opportunities that we revisit revise and update as experience with their impacts and effectiveness is gained acknowledgements this research has been

20168,the multiphase flow characteristics of the oblique water entry of semi closed cylinders is investigated experimentally the results from the experiment are used to analyze the flow mechanism and to validate the numerical simulations in the experimental setup a high speed photography technique is used to capture the process of water entry based on digital video images it can be observed that the cavity is formed in three 3 flow modes namely the fluctuation cavity the transition cavity and the blurry rippling cavity the transparency of the cavity surface decreases while the fragmentary and blurry rippling increases with an increasing inclined angle of the cylinder owing to the instability of internal flow structure and the degree of cavity closure the cavities of three 3 flow modes occur in sequential order from clear fluctuant cavity rippling fluctuant cavity to continuous blurry and fragmentary ripples the cavity evolution is also found to affect the structure of multiphase flow field and the dynamic characteristics of semi closed cylinder keywords oblique water entry semi closed cylinder cavity perturbation cavity evolution multiphase flow characteristics 1 introduction water entry is a process of a structure entering the water through a free surface from the air the mechanism of water entry is relevant to many engineering applications such as the vertical water entry of missiles may 1952 the seaplane landing and ship slamming zhao and faltinsen 1993 piro and maki 2013 and xie et al 2021 the skipping stones rosellini et al 2005 and the vertical water entry of disks at low froude numbers glasheen and mcmahon 1996 the technical challenges associated with the water entry of objects had been studied for more than a century most research in the past was conducted through a series of experimental investigations the work of worthington and cole 1897 utilized a single spark photography technique to discuss the initial image of cavity and splash of water entry of the sphere this research work was further extended by mallock 1918 to study the sounds produced by falling objects on water as the experimental technology advances the data obtained from the water entry of objects become more comprehensive and accurate entry objects of various shapes and their cavity evolutions and dynamic characteristics in water can also be studied in detail research on water entry of cylinders spheres wedges autonomous underwater vehicles and other projectiles had recently been conducted quite intensively at various research institutions wei and hu 2014 2015 2015 liu et al 2020 aristoff and bush 2009 zhou et al 2020 shams et al 2015 duan et al 2020 yan et al 2018 2019 wang et al 2020 surface wettability cavity evolution and dynamic characteristics of spherical and cylindrical objects had also been investigated experimentally ueda and iguchi 2012 korkmaz and guzel 2017 li et al 2019 and truscott and techet 2009a water impact in the process of water entry is another research area that has been examined in detail the research work of tassin et al 2012 studied the water impact based on the entry objects of elliptic paraboloid shape wedge of conical ends and square pyramid the experimental investigation by panciroli et al 2015 showed that the flexibility of cylindrical shell structure played a significant role in water impact dynamics overall shell deformation of the structure was identified as the first mode shape of free ring vibration further the principal outcomes from the past research on water entry of spheres under various conditions showed that splashes and cavities could have lop sided features due to entry orientation the experimental investigation on the water entry of the spinning sphere by truscott and techet 2009b revealed that the spinning motion that induced a lift force could result in a significant curvature trajectory the splash curtain and cavity were formed and collapsed asymmetrically as the spin rate of the sphere increased the study of water entry of the sphere into water surfactant mixture by speirs et al 2018 demonstrated that the bubble layer that wetted the sphere with existing droplets and bubbles and with nonuniform droplet coatings created cavity asymmetries on the other hand the experimental study of splash and cavity of hydrophilic spheres that strike fabrics resting atop the fluid surface by watson et al 2020 showed that the flow separation tripped at low speeds punctured fabrics suppressed splash crowns could be observed in the process of cavity producing impacts the intact fabrics generated deeper cavities higher worthington jets and pronounced splash crowns the water entry dynamics of spheres with heterogeneous wetting properties carried out by watson et al 2021 presented the mechanism of wetting properties on cavity dynamics their results showed that spheres of having partially hydrophilic and partially hydrophobic surfaces which entered the fluid simultaneously could experience asymmetric cavities and horizontal forces that resulted in lateral migration from straight line trajectories one of the most popular research is the study of water entry of semi closed cylinders with opening hollow cells the configuration of this object has a wide range of engineering applications such as to simulate the water entry process of space shuttle solid rocket boosters runkle and wolf 1995 and sonobuoy liu and wang 2011 the concept of concave body a moving object with opening hollow cell proposed by takagi and dobashi 2003 discovered the importance of bound gas in the process of water entry for this object configuration the flow field and dynamic characteristics of water entry of semi closed cylinders had been studied in detail by lu et al 2016 the results from the numerical analysis revealed that the compressed air due to expansion motion of opening hollow cell in the process of water entry generated periodic perturbation of flow field and fluid dynamics that could reduce water impact and thus enhancing the stability of cavity and motion of semi closed cylinder the numerical simulation to study the cavity dynamics and multiphase flow field evolution of water entry of vertical cylindrical shell by zhou et al 2021 concluded that the closure of cavity could be in three 3 flow modes namely the deep closure the semi closed and the non cavity closure the inner diameter of the vertical cylindrical shell was found to have a significant effect on cavity closure research on cavity dynamics of water entry of closed structures has been conducted extensively in recent years however the study of multiphase flow characteristics of water entry of semi closed structures is still quite limited in this paper the multiphase flow characteristics and the physical mechanism of oblique water entry of semi closed cylinder hereafter as cylinder are investigated experimentally with the objective to determine the cavity flow modes to assess the impact of oblique cylinder in water 2 experimental setup a schematic illustration of the experimental system of the water entry of a semi closed cylinder is shown in fig 1 it consists of a water tank supporting bracket a slide structure for launching semi closed cylinder a lighting system a high speed camera for capturing motion of cylinder and a computer for serving as a control system the water tank 1 5 m l e n g t h 0 8 m w i d t h 1 0 m h e i g h t is made of tempered glass with wall thickness of 1 5 cm the water depth in the tank is set at 0 6 m the bracket is equipped with six wheels to allow for movement of the experimental system the slider is used to place and release the semi closed cylinder to ensure the impact of structure on free surface at required inclined angle and velocity the motion and cavity dynamics of the cylinder are recorded using a high speed camera phantom v12 1 at a rate of 4000 frames per second and an image resolution of 1280 800 pixels the exposure time of the camera is set at 1 4000 s the phantom camera control pcc software 2 8 761 0 is used to record the test results for data processing a set of led lights two starison ce 1500ws is installed next to the tank to ensure adequate illumination intensity and image quality the configuration of the semi closed cylinder is of hollow cell barrel structure with end opening fig 2 it is made of polypropylene with density ratio of ρ ρ w 0 88 the parameters ρ and ρ w are the density of semi closed cylinder and water respectively the parameters and the fixed o xyz and motion o x y z coordinate systems used in the water entry experiment of the semi closed cylinder are showed in table 1 and fig 2 in the experiment the fluid in the water tank is characterized by reynolds number r e ρ w v d μ 2 18 10 5 and froude number f r v d g 6 28 the parameters v 4 4 m s and μ are the entry velocity and kinematic viscosity respectively the water temperature is maintained at 24 c to minimize the impact on physical properties due to temperature variation 3 experimental results and discussions the multiphase flow characteristics of oblique water entry of semi closed cylinder under various inclined angles 50 60 70 and 80 at entry velocity of v 4 4 m s are investigated the evolution and flow mechanism of cavity as well as the influence of inclined angle on motion characteristics in the entire entry process of semi closed cylinders are discussed the impact of the semi closed cylinder on the free surface results in the formation of cavity due to flow separation owing to the effect of pressure difference between inside and outside of the cylinder the air inside the hollow cell compresses and expands while the cross sectional area of the cavity decreases and increases in a periodic manner as the water enters and exits the opening end the interaction of internal and external flow fields creates a series of complex and typical flow phenomena generating three 3 different forms of cavities namely the fluctuation cavity transition cavity and blurry rippling cavity it can be commented based on multiphase flow characteristics that the water entry of the semi closed cylinder is far more complicated than closed end structures 3 1 cavity evolution the cavity of water entry is formed due to the flow separation caused by the impact on the free surface the shape and stability of the cavity are extremely sensitive to the flow environment generally speaking the evolution process of water entry of solid structures can be divided into five 5 distinct stages namely the moment of contact the flow forming stage the open cavity and splash growth stage the closed cavity and pinch off stage and the collapsing cavity stage may 1975 truscott and techet 2009b from the experimental results the cavity of the oblique water entry of semi closed cylinder demonstrates three 3 different evolution modes with increasing angle inclination namely the fluctuation the transition and the blurry rippling cavity it is also observed that the difference of wetting area in inner and outer wall of semi closed cylinder causes a significant change of multiphase flow characteristics 3 1 1 fluctuation cavity the cavity evolutions of water entry of semi closed cylinder at angle of 50 and 60 are presented in figs 3 and 4 respectively the moment of impact is defined as t 0 m s the research work of truscott and techet 2009b concluded that the water entry process of semi closed cylinder can be divided into six stages namely the moment of contact the flow forming the open and fluctuant cavity and splash growth the upward movement of cavity lower wall necking off the closed cavity and upward movement of closure position and the collapsing cavity and bubbles evolution at the initial stage t 0 m s the impact of semi closed cylinder on free surface transfers the potential energy to kinetic energy the flow separation starts to form and the air inside the hollow cell compresses due to force impact at t 31 57 m s entry angle of 50 and 34 57 m s entry angle of 60 the water enters and exits the hollow cell under the action of pressure difference between internal and external flow field of semi closed cylinder at the position of flow separation the cross sectional area of the cavity changes periodically the cavity at the opening end begins to fluctuate and then propagate along its axial direction the cavity fluctuation at both sides of the cylinder is found to be different at t 74 112 m s entry angle of 50 and t 81 108 m s entry angle of 60 the cylinder moves downwards and wraps inside the cavity at t 95 m s and 96 m s respectively after completely submerged in water the lower face of the cavity moves upward and passes around the cylinder the degree of cavity fluctuation is found to be reduced at this stage at t 112 153 m s entry angle of 50 and t 108 147 m s entry angle of 60 the closure position of cavity moves up the cylindrical wall until it is separated thereafter the jet forms and develops upwards with multi scale bubbles evolving at opening end as shown in fig 3 t 272 m s and fig 4 and at t 282 m s during the entire entry process the splash above free surface evolves upward until it merges with the jet at this stage a clear fluctuate surface of cavity wall can be observed in this paper the cavity evolution above mentioned is termed as fluctuation cavity the splash evolution above free surface and the bubbles evolution at opening end during the process of water entry of cylinder at entry angle of 50 are presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively at t 13 m s the ripples at the opening end are formed due to expansion of air inside the hollow cell fig 5 thereafter at t 26 m s these ripples evolve upward along the cavity face to the free surface at this stage the transparency of the rippling surface decreases and the entire cavity wall is formed the ripples occur for a short time and diminish after t 31 m s fig 3 further splashes form on the free surface start to develop and evolve obliquely upward throughout the entire process the flow mechanism of the multiphase flow field is extremely complicated the occurrence of lop sided splashes and cavities evolve asymmetrically and this flow behavior is also observed in the study of water entry of various object configurations by other researchers truscott and techet 2009b speirs et al 2018 watson et al 2020 2021 at t 153 m s the air inside cylinder begins to discharge a series of bubbles of various sizes at the opening end of the cylinder is formed the formation of multi scale bubbles continuously shedding evolving and eventually collapsing the complex bubble evolution plays a significant role on multiphase flow structure and kinematic characteristics 3 1 1 1 fluctuation mechanism a localized high pressure is formed at the opening end as the cylinder impacts the free surface the surrounding fluid acquires kinetic energy after impact and begins to flow at this stage the cavity is formed due to flow separation the air inside the cylinder begins to compress after the water impacts the air water interface inside the hollow cell rises and the internal pressure gradually increases until it exceeds the external pressure thereafter it gradually decreases and thus the internal pressure as the fluid flows out from the cylinder due to internal air expansion the cavity forms and fluctuates in a periodic manner in response to cylinder motion from the principle of cavity expansion any cross section of cavity will expand independently the air water interface inside the hollow cell rises and falls as the water enters and exits in a periodic manner the cavity at flow separation also compresses and expands periodically and eventually it fluctuates and propagates along its axial direction fig 7 the degree of cavity expansion is found to be related to the energy generated from the cylinder impact on the free surface 3 1 2 blurry rippling cavity the cavity evolution of water entry of semi closed cylinder at angle of 80 is presented in fig 8 the moment of impact is defined as t 0 m s the process of water entry of the cylinder can be divided into five 5 stages namely the moment of contact the flow forming the open and blurry rippling cavity the closed cavity and the collapsing cavity and multi scale bubbles evolution in the early stage of water entry the cavity evolution possesses fluctuant characteristics the occurrence of multi scale bubbles continues to evolve after the cavity gradually collapses at t 0 28 m s the cavity evolution behaves as fluctuation cavity the cavity at the free surface is closed at t 47 m s the transparency and clarity of the cavity decreases as the ripples are formed on the cavity face under the action of internal flow at t 47 87 m s the cavity is found to develop and evolve upward along the cylinder however the shape of cavity becomes irregular with increasing instability and fragmentation at t 87 123 m s bubbles of large and irregular shape are formed at the opening end as the cavity lower wall moves up around the cylinder a small cavity that is connected to the free surface occurs at this stage the cylinder is completely submerged in water at t 123 310 m s a jet forms and evolves upward after large bubbles collapse the flow field characteristics become complex multi scale bubbles can be seen to evolve near the cylinder some large bubbles float up with motion of cylinder further the splash above free surface which only forms at initial water entry collapses immediately after impact in this paper the cavity evolution above mentioned is termed as blurry rippling cavity a small cavity evolution and large bubbles can be seen at cylinder end at entry angle of 80 fig 9 at t 91 m s a small cavity at the cylinder end is formed at t 91 106 m s it elongates and evolves downward therefore at t 113 121 m s the cavity necking off and collapses at the final stage a small cavity merges with nearby bubbles and develops upward for the evolution of bubbles at t 126 m s the cavity moves upwards and evolves into a large bubble in irregular form a t t 126 141 m s the large bubble moves upwards along the cylinder side but its volume gradually decreases eventually at t 148 163 m s the bubble collapses after the jet occurs 3 1 2 1 blurry rippling mechanism the mechanism of blurry rippling cavity is shown in fig 10 in this paper there are three 3 modes to describe cavity flow formation namely the fluctuation cavity the transition cavity and the blurry rippling cavity these cavities are related to instability of internal flow structure and degree of cavity closure in the initial water entry of the cylinder the internal flow develops upward along the cavity wall until the free surface owing to different directions the internal flow developed under various entry angles the cavity expansion undergoes complete opening partial closure and complete closure the fluctuation cavity is formed after the air inside the cavity is completely discharged above the free surface clear fluctuant cavity wall faces can be observed however for the transition cavity the internal air is partially discharged and partly flows in reverse direction rippling fluctuant cavity wall faces are specifically noted after the cavity free surface is closed the internal air evolves upward in reverse direction resulting in a form of strong turbulent flow the strength of reverse flow decreases with dissipation of energy at this stage blurry ripples occur at the cavity with decreasing transparency and stability on its wall face the shape of the rippling cavity depends upon the velocity of reverse flow this flow mechanism in the process of water entry of the cylinder can be defined as blurry rippling cavity 3 1 3 transition cavity the cavity evolution of water entry of semi closed cylinder at angle of 70 is presented in fig 11 the moment of impact is defined as t 0 m s the multiphase flow characteristics can be described as a combined fluctuation cavity and blurry rippling cavity in cavity flow mode the cavity occurs because of the rippling fluctuant surface the transparency and stability of the cavity in this flow mode is the interaction effect of the fluctuation cavity and the blurry rippling cavity the flow mechanism of cavity evolution above mentioned is termed as the transition cavity 3 2 effect of inclined angle on multiphase flow the difference of multiphase flow characteristics among the fluctuation cavity transition cavity and blurry rippling cavity is presented in this section 3 2 1 splash above free surface the splash evolution of oblique water entry of semi closed cylinders at various entry angles is presented in fig 12 for the fluctuation cavity a high and transparent splash is formed and is evolved with a smooth surface on the other hand for the transition cavity a medium and slightly transparent splash is formed and is evolved with ripples on wall surfaces however for the blurry rippling cavity the splash is basically diminished it can be commented from experimental observation that the direction the splash develops changes in the process of water entry and its height and transparency decrease with increasing inclined entry angle 3 2 2 cavity expansion mechanism the evolution features of cavity and splash are examined with reference to the contours extracted from image enhancement and edge detection algorithm in matlab software a comparative analysis in relation to various moments and inclined angles is presented in figs 13 and 14 respectively it is observed that localized high pressures occur at the structure opening end after the cylinder impacts the free surface at this stage the outside air flowing into the cylinder creates a flow separation causing the cavity to form the air inside the hollow cell expands and compresses periodically due to the transfer of kinetic energy between internal and external flow fields of the cylinder the cavity wall surfaces exhibit a form of alternating crest and trough that leads to fluctuation characteristics as can be seen in fig 14 the cavity shape is in the form of a wide top and narrow bottom the cavity expansion distance in the horizontal plane exceeds the cylinder diameter further the inclined angle of cavity is related to water entry angle θ of cylinder in the entire process of water entry the cavity is first elongated and expanded then closed and finally collapsed the splash on the free surface develops upward and continues to evolve after merging with the jet the transparency of cavity surface decreases while blurry rippling increases with increasing water entry angle θ the analysis of cavity contours at various inclined angles revealed that the cavity shape changes with time and a mechanism of fluctuation forms on the cavity surface this section presents the cavity evolution of various flow modes which includes the division of evolution stages elongation characteristics and closure position the study is to analyze the cavity dynamics to establish a theoretical mathematical model of cavity evolution with the objective to examine in detail the physical flow mechanism of the water entry of semi closed cylinders 3 2 3 fluctuation of cavity evolution the fluctuation and expansion of cavity of oblique water entry of cylinder at various entry angles is assessed based on fluctuation coefficient ε i as follows ε i 1 n n a n i b n i a n i b n i where a and b are the height of the crest and trough of cavity fluctuation respectively the larger the a and b the stronger the expansion degree of cavity i 1 and i 2 represent the upper and lower surface of cavity respectively n 1 and n 2 are the cavity fluctuation numbers 0 ε i 1 is the range of fluctuation coefficient the larger the ε i the stronger the cavity fluctuation the fluctuation and expansion degree at three 3 typical moments of t 1 t 2 and t 3 are analyzed t 1 is the moment when the water entry depth of the cylinder is 4d t 2 is the moment when the lower side of the cavity moves to that of the cylinder t 3 is the moment when the cavity on the upper side of the cylinder is closed it can be seen from figs 15 18 that the fluctuation and expansion of the cavity at various typical moments is significantly affected by the inclined angles of the cylinder since the semi closed cylinder enters the water at a specific inclined angle of θ the upper and lower sides of cavity evolve asymmetrically due to the change of angle and velocity of outside air entering the cavity at t 1 the fluctuation on upper and lower surfaces of the cavity occurs due to the air expansion and compression inside the hollow cell the air entry on upper and lower sides of cylinder decreases and increases respectively with increasing θ this air flow mechanism resulting in the expansion of crests a 1 and troughs b 1 on the upper and lower sides of cavity figs 15 a and 16 the upper ε 1 and lower side ε 2 cavity fluctuation coefficients also found to increase and decrease respectively in response to the air entry on upper and lower sides of cylinder fig 18 however the expansion height of the cavity is shorter than the cylinder diameter d at t 2 the lower side of the cavity moves to that of the cylinder the second cavity fluctuation is formed after the air inside the hollow cell expands and compresses periodically the kinetic energy is transformed into potential energy as the cylinder impacts the free surface as a result a cavity is formed due to flow separation in the process of cavity evolution the potential energy and kinetic energy are constantly interacted based on the principle of cavity expansion any cross section of cavity expands independently and the degree of expansion depends on the flow energy the kinetic energy decreases after the first cavity fluctuation the expansion of crests and troughs in second cavity fluctuation is found less than that in first cavity fluctuation figs 15 b and 17 the air entry on upper side of cylinder decreases with increasing θ resulting in the decreasing expansion of crests a 1 and troughs b 1 on the upper side of the cavity figs 15 b and 17 the fluctuation coefficient on the upper side of the cavity ε 1 increases and thus the flow mode of fluctuation cavity fig 18 a comparison with t 1 showed that the crests and troughs of first cavity fluctuation at t 2 continue to consume energy from water impacts and expand further fig 15 a and b 16 and 17 at t 3 the cavity on the upper side of the cylinder is closed at this stage of flow modes fluctuation cavity and transition cavity the fluctuation characteristics ε 1 of the cavity surface diminish figs 15 c and 18 3 3 effect of entry angle on dynamic characteristics a parametric study is conducted to investigate the influence of inclined angle on dynamic characteristics of water entry of the cylinder in the study an average value based on six 6 cases of cylinder in the same position at each entry angle is considered the time histories of displacement velocity inclined angle angular velocity as well as trajectory are presented in fig 19 a comparison with the water entry of a closed structure showed that the dynamic characteristics of the water entry of the semi closed cylinder is far more complicated additional forces are generated as the air inside the hollow cell is periodically compressed and expanded this flow mechanism and behavior is not seen in the process of water entry of fully closed cylinders in the process of water entry of semi closed cylinders the initial entry velocity can be decomposed into horizontal and vertical velocity components the horizontal velocity and displacement decrease while the vertical velocity and displacement increase with increasing inclined angle of the cylinder since the density of the cylinder is less than that of water the vertical velocity first decreases and then increases in the opposite direction while the vertical displacement increases and then decreases as the cylinder enters the water note that the horizontal velocity decreases with fluctuation while the horizontal displacement increases with time in the entire water entry process the occurrence of fluctuation can be attributed to the unsteady cavity evolution based on the results obtained from the parametric study the trajectory of the mass center of semi closed cylinders is plotted it showed that the vertical displacement of the cylinder in floating position increases with its inclined angle fig 19g the wetted area inside the hollow cell changes constantly generating a fluctuating resultant moment that causes the cylinder to rotate further a large angular velocity fluctuation induced as the periodic expansion and compression of air inside the hollow cell changes the multiphase flow characteristics and cavity evolution 4 conclusions the multiphase flow characteristics of oblique water entry of semi closed cylinders have been investigated experimentally it can be concluded based on the evolution mechanism of cavities and splashes captured from the image sequences obtained in the experiment that a the cavity is formed in three 3 flow modes namely the fluctuation the transition and the blurry rippling cavity the transparency of the cavity surface decreases while the fragmentary and blurry rippling cavity increases with an increasing inclined angle of the cylinder the cavity of the three 3 flow modes occurs in sequential manner with characteristics of clear fluctuant rippling fluctuant and continuous blurry and fragmentary ripples these cavity flows are related to the instability of internal flow structure and the degree of cavity closure further the height and transparency of splash above free surface decreases with increasing inclined angle of cylinder b on the flow mechanism of cavity fluctuation the air water interface inside the hollow cell rises and falls periodically as the water enters and exits the opening end of the cylinder owing to compression and expansion of cavity at position of flow separation the cavity fluctuation is formed and propagated along its axial direction c the upper and lower sides of the cavity evolve asymmetrically because of fluctuation and expansion at moment t 1 when the water entry depth of cylinder is 4d the expansion of upper and lower sides of cavity decreases and increases respectively with increasing inclined angle of cylinder the fluctuation coefficients are opposite of cavity fluctuation at moment t 2 when the lower side of the cavity moves to that of the cylinder the expansion and fluctuation coefficients on the upper side of cavity decrease and increase respectively the expansion of the second fluctuation is found less than the first fluctuation at moment t 3 when the cavity on the upper side of the cylinder is closed the fluctuation characteristics diminish d from the parametric study the dynamic characteristics of cavity evolution of the water entry of semi closed cylinders is far more complicated than that of the water entry of closed cylinders due to the periodic compression and expansion of internal air in the hollow cell of the cylinder the horizontal velocity and displacement decrease while the vertical velocity and displacement increase with increasing inclined angle of cylinder in descending path credit

20168,the multiphase flow characteristics of the oblique water entry of semi closed cylinders is investigated experimentally the results from the experiment are used to analyze the flow mechanism and to validate the numerical simulations in the experimental setup a high speed photography technique is used to capture the process of water entry based on digital video images it can be observed that the cavity is formed in three 3 flow modes namely the fluctuation cavity the transition cavity and the blurry rippling cavity the transparency of the cavity surface decreases while the fragmentary and blurry rippling increases with an increasing inclined angle of the cylinder owing to the instability of internal flow structure and the degree of cavity closure the cavities of three 3 flow modes occur in sequential order from clear fluctuant cavity rippling fluctuant cavity to continuous blurry and fragmentary ripples the cavity evolution is also found to affect the structure of multiphase flow field and the dynamic characteristics of semi closed cylinder keywords oblique water entry semi closed cylinder cavity perturbation cavity evolution multiphase flow characteristics 1 introduction water entry is a process of a structure entering the water through a free surface from the air the mechanism of water entry is relevant to many engineering applications such as the vertical water entry of missiles may 1952 the seaplane landing and ship slamming zhao and faltinsen 1993 piro and maki 2013 and xie et al 2021 the skipping stones rosellini et al 2005 and the vertical water entry of disks at low froude numbers glasheen and mcmahon 1996 the technical challenges associated with the water entry of objects had been studied for more than a century most research in the past was conducted through a series of experimental investigations the work of worthington and cole 1897 utilized a single spark photography technique to discuss the initial image of cavity and splash of water entry of the sphere this research work was further extended by mallock 1918 to study the sounds produced by falling objects on water as the experimental technology advances the data obtained from the water entry of objects become more comprehensive and accurate entry objects of various shapes and their cavity evolutions and dynamic characteristics in water can also be studied in detail research on water entry of cylinders spheres wedges autonomous underwater vehicles and other projectiles had recently been conducted quite intensively at various research institutions wei and hu 2014 2015 2015 liu et al 2020 aristoff and bush 2009 zhou et al 2020 shams et al 2015 duan et al 2020 yan et al 2018 2019 wang et al 2020 surface wettability cavity evolution and dynamic characteristics of spherical and cylindrical objects had also been investigated experimentally ueda and iguchi 2012 korkmaz and guzel 2017 li et al 2019 and truscott and techet 2009a water impact in the process of water entry is another research area that has been examined in detail the research work of tassin et al 2012 studied the water impact based on the entry objects of elliptic paraboloid shape wedge of conical ends and square pyramid the experimental investigation by panciroli et al 2015 showed that the flexibility of cylindrical shell structure played a significant role in water impact dynamics overall shell deformation of the structure was identified as the first mode shape of free ring vibration further the principal outcomes from the past research on water entry of spheres under various conditions showed that splashes and cavities could have lop sided features due to entry orientation the experimental investigation on the water entry of the spinning sphere by truscott and techet 2009b revealed that the spinning motion that induced a lift force could result in a significant curvature trajectory the splash curtain and cavity were formed and collapsed asymmetrically as the spin rate of the sphere increased the study of water entry of the sphere into water surfactant mixture by speirs et al 2018 demonstrated that the bubble layer that wetted the sphere with existing droplets and bubbles and with nonuniform droplet coatings created cavity asymmetries on the other hand the experimental study of splash and cavity of hydrophilic spheres that strike fabrics resting atop the fluid surface by watson et al 2020 showed that the flow separation tripped at low speeds punctured fabrics suppressed splash crowns could be observed in the process of cavity producing impacts the intact fabrics generated deeper cavities higher worthington jets and pronounced splash crowns the water entry dynamics of spheres with heterogeneous wetting properties carried out by watson et al 2021 presented the mechanism of wetting properties on cavity dynamics their results showed that spheres of having partially hydrophilic and partially hydrophobic surfaces which entered the fluid simultaneously could experience asymmetric cavities and horizontal forces that resulted in lateral migration from straight line trajectories one of the most popular research is the study of water entry of semi closed cylinders with opening hollow cells the configuration of this object has a wide range of engineering applications such as to simulate the water entry process of space shuttle solid rocket boosters runkle and wolf 1995 and sonobuoy liu and wang 2011 the concept of concave body a moving object with opening hollow cell proposed by takagi and dobashi 2003 discovered the importance of bound gas in the process of water entry for this object configuration the flow field and dynamic characteristics of water entry of semi closed cylinders had been studied in detail by lu et al 2016 the results from the numerical analysis revealed that the compressed air due to expansion motion of opening hollow cell in the process of water entry generated periodic perturbation of flow field and fluid dynamics that could reduce water impact and thus enhancing the stability of cavity and motion of semi closed cylinder the numerical simulation to study the cavity dynamics and multiphase flow field evolution of water entry of vertical cylindrical shell by zhou et al 2021 concluded that the closure of cavity could be in three 3 flow modes namely the deep closure the semi closed and the non cavity closure the inner diameter of the vertical cylindrical shell was found to have a significant effect on cavity closure research on cavity dynamics of water entry of closed structures has been conducted extensively in recent years however the study of multiphase flow characteristics of water entry of semi closed structures is still quite limited in this paper the multiphase flow characteristics and the physical mechanism of oblique water entry of semi closed cylinder hereafter as cylinder are investigated experimentally with the objective to determine the cavity flow modes to assess the impact of oblique cylinder in water 2 experimental setup a schematic illustration of the experimental system of the water entry of a semi closed cylinder is shown in fig 1 it consists of a water tank supporting bracket a slide structure for launching semi closed cylinder a lighting system a high speed camera for capturing motion of cylinder and a computer for serving as a control system the water tank 1 5 m l e n g t h 0 8 m w i d t h 1 0 m h e i g h t is made of tempered glass with wall thickness of 1 5 cm the water depth in the tank is set at 0 6 m the bracket is equipped with six wheels to allow for movement of the experimental system the slider is used to place and release the semi closed cylinder to ensure the impact of structure on free surface at required inclined angle and velocity the motion and cavity dynamics of the cylinder are recorded using a high speed camera phantom v12 1 at a rate of 4000 frames per second and an image resolution of 1280 800 pixels the exposure time of the camera is set at 1 4000 s the phantom camera control pcc software 2 8 761 0 is used to record the test results for data processing a set of led lights two starison ce 1500ws is installed next to the tank to ensure adequate illumination intensity and image quality the configuration of the semi closed cylinder is of hollow cell barrel structure with end opening fig 2 it is made of polypropylene with density ratio of ρ ρ w 0 88 the parameters ρ and ρ w are the density of semi closed cylinder and water respectively the parameters and the fixed o xyz and motion o x y z coordinate systems used in the water entry experiment of the semi closed cylinder are showed in table 1 and fig 2 in the experiment the fluid in the water tank is characterized by reynolds number r e ρ w v d μ 2 18 10 5 and froude number f r v d g 6 28 the parameters v 4 4 m s and μ are the entry velocity and kinematic viscosity respectively the water temperature is maintained at 24 c to minimize the impact on physical properties due to temperature variation 3 experimental results and discussions the multiphase flow characteristics of oblique water entry of semi closed cylinder under various inclined angles 50 60 70 and 80 at entry velocity of v 4 4 m s are investigated the evolution and flow mechanism of cavity as well as the influence of inclined angle on motion characteristics in the entire entry process of semi closed cylinders are discussed the impact of the semi closed cylinder on the free surface results in the formation of cavity due to flow separation owing to the effect of pressure difference between inside and outside of the cylinder the air inside the hollow cell compresses and expands while the cross sectional area of the cavity decreases and increases in a periodic manner as the water enters and exits the opening end the interaction of internal and external flow fields creates a series of complex and typical flow phenomena generating three 3 different forms of cavities namely the fluctuation cavity transition cavity and blurry rippling cavity it can be commented based on multiphase flow characteristics that the water entry of the semi closed cylinder is far more complicated than closed end structures 3 1 cavity evolution the cavity of water entry is formed due to the flow separation caused by the impact on the free surface the shape and stability of the cavity are extremely sensitive to the flow environment generally speaking the evolution process of water entry of solid structures can be divided into five 5 distinct stages namely the moment of contact the flow forming stage the open cavity and splash growth stage the closed cavity and pinch off stage and the collapsing cavity stage may 1975 truscott and techet 2009b from the experimental results the cavity of the oblique water entry of semi closed cylinder demonstrates three 3 different evolution modes with increasing angle inclination namely the fluctuation the transition and the blurry rippling cavity it is also observed that the difference of wetting area in inner and outer wall of semi closed cylinder causes a significant change of multiphase flow characteristics 3 1 1 fluctuation cavity the cavity evolutions of water entry of semi closed cylinder at angle of 50 and 60 are presented in figs 3 and 4 respectively the moment of impact is defined as t 0 m s the research work of truscott and techet 2009b concluded that the water entry process of semi closed cylinder can be divided into six stages namely the moment of contact the flow forming the open and fluctuant cavity and splash growth the upward movement of cavity lower wall necking off the closed cavity and upward movement of closure position and the collapsing cavity and bubbles evolution at the initial stage t 0 m s the impact of semi closed cylinder on free surface transfers the potential energy to kinetic energy the flow separation starts to form and the air inside the hollow cell compresses due to force impact at t 31 57 m s entry angle of 50 and 34 57 m s entry angle of 60 the water enters and exits the hollow cell under the action of pressure difference between internal and external flow field of semi closed cylinder at the position of flow separation the cross sectional area of the cavity changes periodically the cavity at the opening end begins to fluctuate and then propagate along its axial direction the cavity fluctuation at both sides of the cylinder is found to be different at t 74 112 m s entry angle of 50 and t 81 108 m s entry angle of 60 the cylinder moves downwards and wraps inside the cavity at t 95 m s and 96 m s respectively after completely submerged in water the lower face of the cavity moves upward and passes around the cylinder the degree of cavity fluctuation is found to be reduced at this stage at t 112 153 m s entry angle of 50 and t 108 147 m s entry angle of 60 the closure position of cavity moves up the cylindrical wall until it is separated thereafter the jet forms and develops upwards with multi scale bubbles evolving at opening end as shown in fig 3 t 272 m s and fig 4 and at t 282 m s during the entire entry process the splash above free surface evolves upward until it merges with the jet at this stage a clear fluctuate surface of cavity wall can be observed in this paper the cavity evolution above mentioned is termed as fluctuation cavity the splash evolution above free surface and the bubbles evolution at opening end during the process of water entry of cylinder at entry angle of 50 are presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively at t 13 m s the ripples at the opening end are formed due to expansion of air inside the hollow cell fig 5 thereafter at t 26 m s these ripples evolve upward along the cavity face to the free surface at this stage the transparency of the rippling surface decreases and the entire cavity wall is formed the ripples occur for a short time and diminish after t 31 m s fig 3 further splashes form on the free surface start to develop and evolve obliquely upward throughout the entire process the flow mechanism of the multiphase flow field is extremely complicated the occurrence of lop sided splashes and cavities evolve asymmetrically and this flow behavior is also observed in the study of water entry of various object configurations by other researchers truscott and techet 2009b speirs et al 2018 watson et al 2020 2021 at t 153 m s the air inside cylinder begins to discharge a series of bubbles of various sizes at the opening end of the cylinder is formed the formation of multi scale bubbles continuously shedding evolving and eventually collapsing the complex bubble evolution plays a significant role on multiphase flow structure and kinematic characteristics 3 1 1 1 fluctuation mechanism a localized high pressure is formed at the opening end as the cylinder impacts the free surface the surrounding fluid acquires kinetic energy after impact and begins to flow at this stage the cavity is formed due to flow separation the air inside the cylinder begins to compress after the water impacts the air water interface inside the hollow cell rises and the internal pressure gradually increases until it exceeds the external pressure thereafter it gradually decreases and thus the internal pressure as the fluid flows out from the cylinder due to internal air expansion the cavity forms and fluctuates in a periodic manner in response to cylinder motion from the principle of cavity expansion any cross section of cavity will expand independently the air water interface inside the hollow cell rises and falls as the water enters and exits in a periodic manner the cavity at flow separation also compresses and expands periodically and eventually it fluctuates and propagates along its axial direction fig 7 the degree of cavity expansion is found to be related to the energy generated from the cylinder impact on the free surface 3 1 2 blurry rippling cavity the cavity evolution of water entry of semi closed cylinder at angle of 80 is presented in fig 8 the moment of impact is defined as t 0 m s the process of water entry of the cylinder can be divided into five 5 stages namely the moment of contact the flow forming the open and blurry rippling cavity the closed cavity and the collapsing cavity and multi scale bubbles evolution in the early stage of water entry the cavity evolution possesses fluctuant characteristics the occurrence of multi scale bubbles continues to evolve after the cavity gradually collapses at t 0 28 m s the cavity evolution behaves as fluctuation cavity the cavity at the free surface is closed at t 47 m s the transparency and clarity of the cavity decreases as the ripples are formed on the cavity face under the action of internal flow at t 47 87 m s the cavity is found to develop and evolve upward along the cylinder however the shape of cavity becomes irregular with increasing instability and fragmentation at t 87 123 m s bubbles of large and irregular shape are formed at the opening end as the cavity lower wall moves up around the cylinder a small cavity that is connected to the free surface occurs at this stage the cylinder is completely submerged in water at t 123 310 m s a jet forms and evolves upward after large bubbles collapse the flow field characteristics become complex multi scale bubbles can be seen to evolve near the cylinder some large bubbles float up with motion of cylinder further the splash above free surface which only forms at initial water entry collapses immediately after impact in this paper the cavity evolution above mentioned is termed as blurry rippling cavity a small cavity evolution and large bubbles can be seen at cylinder end at entry angle of 80 fig 9 at t 91 m s a small cavity at the cylinder end is formed at t 91 106 m s it elongates and evolves downward therefore at t 113 121 m s the cavity necking off and collapses at the final stage a small cavity merges with nearby bubbles and develops upward for the evolution of bubbles at t 126 m s the cavity moves upwards and evolves into a large bubble in irregular form a t t 126 141 m s the large bubble moves upwards along the cylinder side but its volume gradually decreases eventually at t 148 163 m s the bubble collapses after the jet occurs 3 1 2 1 blurry rippling mechanism the mechanism of blurry rippling cavity is shown in fig 10 in this paper there are three 3 modes to describe cavity flow formation namely the fluctuation cavity the transition cavity and the blurry rippling cavity these cavities are related to instability of internal flow structure and degree of cavity closure in the initial water entry of the cylinder the internal flow develops upward along the cavity wall until the free surface owing to different directions the internal flow developed under various entry angles the cavity expansion undergoes complete opening partial closure and complete closure the fluctuation cavity is formed after the air inside the cavity is completely discharged above the free surface clear fluctuant cavity wall faces can be observed however for the transition cavity the internal air is partially discharged and partly flows in reverse direction rippling fluctuant cavity wall faces are specifically noted after the cavity free surface is closed the internal air evolves upward in reverse direction resulting in a form of strong turbulent flow the strength of reverse flow decreases with dissipation of energy at this stage blurry ripples occur at the cavity with decreasing transparency and stability on its wall face the shape of the rippling cavity depends upon the velocity of reverse flow this flow mechanism in the process of water entry of the cylinder can be defined as blurry rippling cavity 3 1 3 transition cavity the cavity evolution of water entry of semi closed cylinder at angle of 70 is presented in fig 11 the moment of impact is defined as t 0 m s the multiphase flow characteristics can be described as a combined fluctuation cavity and blurry rippling cavity in cavity flow mode the cavity occurs because of the rippling fluctuant surface the transparency and stability of the cavity in this flow mode is the interaction effect of the fluctuation cavity and the blurry rippling cavity the flow mechanism of cavity evolution above mentioned is termed as the transition cavity 3 2 effect of inclined angle on multiphase flow the difference of multiphase flow characteristics among the fluctuation cavity transition cavity and blurry rippling cavity is presented in this section 3 2 1 splash above free surface the splash evolution of oblique water entry of semi closed cylinders at various entry angles is presented in fig 12 for the fluctuation cavity a high and transparent splash is formed and is evolved with a smooth surface on the other hand for the transition cavity a medium and slightly transparent splash is formed and is evolved with ripples on wall surfaces however for the blurry rippling cavity the splash is basically diminished it can be commented from experimental observation that the direction the splash develops changes in the process of water entry and its height and transparency decrease with increasing inclined entry angle 3 2 2 cavity expansion mechanism the evolution features of cavity and splash are examined with reference to the contours extracted from image enhancement and edge detection algorithm in matlab software a comparative analysis in relation to various moments and inclined angles is presented in figs 13 and 14 respectively it is observed that localized high pressures occur at the structure opening end after the cylinder impacts the free surface at this stage the outside air flowing into the cylinder creates a flow separation causing the cavity to form the air inside the hollow cell expands and compresses periodically due to the transfer of kinetic energy between internal and external flow fields of the cylinder the cavity wall surfaces exhibit a form of alternating crest and trough that leads to fluctuation characteristics as can be seen in fig 14 the cavity shape is in the form of a wide top and narrow bottom the cavity expansion distance in the horizontal plane exceeds the cylinder diameter further the inclined angle of cavity is related to water entry angle θ of cylinder in the entire process of water entry the cavity is first elongated and expanded then closed and finally collapsed the splash on the free surface develops upward and continues to evolve after merging with the jet the transparency of cavity surface decreases while blurry rippling increases with increasing water entry angle θ the analysis of cavity contours at various inclined angles revealed that the cavity shape changes with time and a mechanism of fluctuation forms on the cavity surface this section presents the cavity evolution of various flow modes which includes the division of evolution stages elongation characteristics and closure position the study is to analyze the cavity dynamics to establish a theoretical mathematical model of cavity evolution with the objective to examine in detail the physical flow mechanism of the water entry of semi closed cylinders 3 2 3 fluctuation of cavity evolution the fluctuation and expansion of cavity of oblique water entry of cylinder at various entry angles is assessed based on fluctuation coefficient ε i as follows ε i 1 n n a n i b n i a n i b n i where a and b are the height of the crest and trough of cavity fluctuation respectively the larger the a and b the stronger the expansion degree of cavity i 1 and i 2 represent the upper and lower surface of cavity respectively n 1 and n 2 are the cavity fluctuation numbers 0 ε i 1 is the range of fluctuation coefficient the larger the ε i the stronger the cavity fluctuation the fluctuation and expansion degree at three 3 typical moments of t 1 t 2 and t 3 are analyzed t 1 is the moment when the water entry depth of the cylinder is 4d t 2 is the moment when the lower side of the cavity moves to that of the cylinder t 3 is the moment when the cavity on the upper side of the cylinder is closed it can be seen from figs 15 18 that the fluctuation and expansion of the cavity at various typical moments is significantly affected by the inclined angles of the cylinder since the semi closed cylinder enters the water at a specific inclined angle of θ the upper and lower sides of cavity evolve asymmetrically due to the change of angle and velocity of outside air entering the cavity at t 1 the fluctuation on upper and lower surfaces of the cavity occurs due to the air expansion and compression inside the hollow cell the air entry on upper and lower sides of cylinder decreases and increases respectively with increasing θ this air flow mechanism resulting in the expansion of crests a 1 and troughs b 1 on the upper and lower sides of cavity figs 15 a and 16 the upper ε 1 and lower side ε 2 cavity fluctuation coefficients also found to increase and decrease respectively in response to the air entry on upper and lower sides of cylinder fig 18 however the expansion height of the cavity is shorter than the cylinder diameter d at t 2 the lower side of the cavity moves to that of the cylinder the second cavity fluctuation is formed after the air inside the hollow cell expands and compresses periodically the kinetic energy is transformed into potential energy as the cylinder impacts the free surface as a result a cavity is formed due to flow separation in the process of cavity evolution the potential energy and kinetic energy are constantly interacted based on the principle of cavity expansion any cross section of cavity expands independently and the degree of expansion depends on the flow energy the kinetic energy decreases after the first cavity fluctuation the expansion of crests and troughs in second cavity fluctuation is found less than that in first cavity fluctuation figs 15 b and 17 the air entry on upper side of cylinder decreases with increasing θ resulting in the decreasing expansion of crests a 1 and troughs b 1 on the upper side of the cavity figs 15 b and 17 the fluctuation coefficient on the upper side of the cavity ε 1 increases and thus the flow mode of fluctuation cavity fig 18 a comparison with t 1 showed that the crests and troughs of first cavity fluctuation at t 2 continue to consume energy from water impacts and expand further fig 15 a and b 16 and 17 at t 3 the cavity on the upper side of the cylinder is closed at this stage of flow modes fluctuation cavity and transition cavity the fluctuation characteristics ε 1 of the cavity surface diminish figs 15 c and 18 3 3 effect of entry angle on dynamic characteristics a parametric study is conducted to investigate the influence of inclined angle on dynamic characteristics of water entry of the cylinder in the study an average value based on six 6 cases of cylinder in the same position at each entry angle is considered the time histories of displacement velocity inclined angle angular velocity as well as trajectory are presented in fig 19 a comparison with the water entry of a closed structure showed that the dynamic characteristics of the water entry of the semi closed cylinder is far more complicated additional forces are generated as the air inside the hollow cell is periodically compressed and expanded this flow mechanism and behavior is not seen in the process of water entry of fully closed cylinders in the process of water entry of semi closed cylinders the initial entry velocity can be decomposed into horizontal and vertical velocity components the horizontal velocity and displacement decrease while the vertical velocity and displacement increase with increasing inclined angle of the cylinder since the density of the cylinder is less than that of water the vertical velocity first decreases and then increases in the opposite direction while the vertical displacement increases and then decreases as the cylinder enters the water note that the horizontal velocity decreases with fluctuation while the horizontal displacement increases with time in the entire water entry process the occurrence of fluctuation can be attributed to the unsteady cavity evolution based on the results obtained from the parametric study the trajectory of the mass center of semi closed cylinders is plotted it showed that the vertical displacement of the cylinder in floating position increases with its inclined angle fig 19g the wetted area inside the hollow cell changes constantly generating a fluctuating resultant moment that causes the cylinder to rotate further a large angular velocity fluctuation induced as the periodic expansion and compression of air inside the hollow cell changes the multiphase flow characteristics and cavity evolution 4 conclusions the multiphase flow characteristics of oblique water entry of semi closed cylinders have been investigated experimentally it can be concluded based on the evolution mechanism of cavities and splashes captured from the image sequences obtained in the experiment that a the cavity is formed in three 3 flow modes namely the fluctuation the transition and the blurry rippling cavity the transparency of the cavity surface decreases while the fragmentary and blurry rippling cavity increases with an increasing inclined angle of the cylinder the cavity of the three 3 flow modes occurs in sequential manner with characteristics of clear fluctuant rippling fluctuant and continuous blurry and fragmentary ripples these cavity flows are related to the instability of internal flow structure and the degree of cavity closure further the height and transparency of splash above free surface decreases with increasing inclined angle of cylinder b on the flow mechanism of cavity fluctuation the air water interface inside the hollow cell rises and falls periodically as the water enters and exits the opening end of the cylinder owing to compression and expansion of cavity at position of flow separation the cavity fluctuation is formed and propagated along its axial direction c the upper and lower sides of the cavity evolve asymmetrically because of fluctuation and expansion at moment t 1 when the water entry depth of cylinder is 4d the expansion of upper and lower sides of cavity decreases and increases respectively with increasing inclined angle of cylinder the fluctuation coefficients are opposite of cavity fluctuation at moment t 2 when the lower side of the cavity moves to that of the cylinder the expansion and fluctuation coefficients on the upper side of cavity decrease and increase respectively the expansion of the second fluctuation is found less than the first fluctuation at moment t 3 when the cavity on the upper side of the cylinder is closed the fluctuation characteristics diminish d from the parametric study the dynamic characteristics of cavity evolution of the water entry of semi closed cylinders is far more complicated than that of the water entry of closed cylinders due to the periodic compression and expansion of internal air in the hollow cell of the cylinder the horizontal velocity and displacement decrease while the vertical velocity and displacement increase with increasing inclined angle of cylinder in descending path credit

20169,attributed to the processes of wave focusing extreme waves often occur unexpectedly with huge wave height in both deep and shallow water regions which can cause serious damages to the coastal infrastructures and threaten the intactness of coastal communities field observations after extreme weather events have revealed that as a type of natural barrier coastal vegetations can effectively attenuate the intensity of extreme surges and waves and thus play a good role in naturally protecting the coast usually focused wave is used as a typical extreme wave model to study the great impact

introduction attributed to the processes of wave focusing extreme waves often occur unexpectedly with huge wave height which have high potential for damaging the coastal infrastructures and threatens the intactness of the coastal communities stansell 2004 by analyzing the extreme wave events during years of 2006 2010 nikolkina and didenkulova 2011 found that the extreme waves don t only occur in deep ocean water but also can be observed in the coastal shallow waters to prevent the coastal region from extreme surges and waves many artificial infrastructures such as seawall and submerged breakwater zhao et al 2019 wu and hsiao 2013 cho et al 2017 have been constructed in the past few decades although these measures can protect the coastal regions to some extent their own safety is also vulnerable to extreme surges and waves yu et al 2017 syamsidik et al 2019 therefore more effective and environmentally friendly measures are urgently needed to protect coastal regions field observations after extreme weather events have revealed that coastal vegetations as a natural barrier can effectively attenuate the intensity of extreme surges and waves and thus play a good role in naturally protecting coast kathiresan and rajendran 2005 bao 2011 lee et al 2021 in recent years many studies have been conducted to systematically investigate the wave attenuation efficiencies of mangroves maza et al 2015 seagrasses manca et al 2012 twomey et al 2020 and saltmarshes möller 2006 in protecting the coastal regions from extreme surges and waves meanwhile coastal vegetation can not only reduce waves but also have positive impacts on ecosystem such as providing natural habitat nordstrom 2014 and mitigating coastal erosion furukawa et al 1997 besides comparing to artificial protection measures although coastal vegetations can protect the coast as natural buffers it needs little maintenance and usually can recover after some damages on their own with time to systematically assess the wave attenuations of different types of vegetations under the impacts of various types of waves many field observations manca et al 2012 theoretical analysis larson 1995 experiment works maza et al 2015 and numerical simulations huang et al 2011 have been conducted in recent years numerical simulation has become an important means to study the mechanism of wave attenuation by the vegetation various types of numerical modes have been applied to study the complex flow fields in the vegetation region under the impact of solitary waves huang et al 2011 iimura and tanaka 2012 regular waves veelen et al 2021 wang et al 2021 and irregular waves zhan et al 2014 these numerical models usually can be classified into two main groups energy conservation models and momentum conservation models suzuki et al 2019 energy conservation models account for vegetation effects using an energy attenuation term dalrymple et al 1984 tang et al 2015 momentum conservation models account for vegetation in terms of momentum loss huang et al 2011 iimura et al 2012 momentum conservation models can directly evaluate the wave attenuation effects of vegetations based on the flow fields predicted by the numerical models kobayashi et al 1993 for instance augustin et al 2009 and huang et al 2011 applied an improved boussunesq model to investigate the performance of flexible and rigid vegetation patches in attenuating tsunami waves respectively zou et al 2019 used a two phase flow model to investigate the wave attenuation of breaking and broken waves by a vegetated sloped beach although the previous research works have contributed to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which vegetation protects the coast little research has been done on the complex interactions between the extreme waves and coastal vegetations in recent years wave focusing has been widely applied to generate the extreme waves kharif and pelinovsky 2003 based on the wave focusing method many theoretical analysis sun and zhang 2017 experiment works li et al 2012 2014 and numerical simulations bihs et al 2017 have been carried out to study the propagation deformation breaking processes of the extreme waves abroug et al 2020 and their interactions with coastal infrastructures qu et al 2021a as early as the 1990s baldock et al 1996 and rapp et al 1990 had carried out a series of laboratory experiments to investigate the propagations of focused waves in a wave flume with uniform depth the runup processes of focused waves onto a sloped beach were studied by whittaker et al 2017 in a wave flume the complex interactions between vertical cylinders and the unidirectional and multi directional focused waves have been experimentally investigated by ning et al 2009 and li et al 2012 respectively in the past few decades different types of numerical models have been developed based on potential flow theory bai et al 2007 boussinesq equations sun et al 2012 nonhydrostatic ai et al 2014 and two phase flow methods zhao et al 2014 these numerical models have been widely applied to study the generations and propagations of focused waves and interactions with coastal infrastructures such as vertical cylinders li et al 2012 seawall whittaker et al 2018 and coastal bridges qu et al 2021a etc the nonhydrostatic wave model solves the three dimensional incompressible viscous navier stokes equations in terrain and surface following σ coordinates it has similar computation accuracy as two phase flow model but higher efficiency there is no need to add empirical parameters as boussinesq wave models to judge wave breaking processes in this paper as a preliminary attempt the complex interactions between the crest and trough focused wave and emergent rigid vegetation patch have been numerically investigated by applying a nonhydrostatic wave model named nhwave the wave attenuation of focused wave by the vegetation patch has been well evaluated by considering five prominent factors namely significant wave height peak wave period water depth vegetation density and width the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the

wave components are implemented using second order irregular wave theory schaffer 1996 as formulated by ning et al 2009 besides the total number of the wave components are set as n 30 for all of the following computations based on carefully numerical experiments 4 parameters for wave attenuation evaluation as we know energy is to be lost and transferred during the wave propagation especially when the damping effects of vegetation patch are considered similar as in qu et al 2019 2021b this paper analyzes the wave energy dissipation of the wave propagation over a vegetated channel by calculating the kinetic energy k e potential energy p e and total energy t e as 21 k e ρ u 2 w 2 2 d z d x 22 p e ρ g z d z d x ρ g z d z d x t 0 23 t e k e p e to quantitively evaluate the wave attenuation of vegetation patch the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitudes of a focused wave at a specified location can defined as 24 d a a n o n v e g a v e g a n o n v e g where a v e g is the maximum wave amplitude at specified location when the vegetation exists a n o n v e g is the maximum wave amplitude at the same location when the vegetation path doesn t exist to assess the total wave energy dissipated by the vegetation patch the following total wave energy dissipation coefficients are defined as 25 d e e t i e t o e t i where e t i represents the maximum total wave energy entering the vegetation region e t o the maximum total wave energy leaving the vegetation region 5 model validation 5 1 focused wave propagation in straight channel in this section propagations of both crest and trough focused waves in a straight channel are numerically simulated and the predicted time series of water surface elevation and horizontal velocity have been compared with the corresponding experiment data collected in ning et al 2009 the experiment work was conducted in a 69 m 3 m 1 5 m wave tank located at dalian university of technology in the experiment 35 wave gauges are arranged along the whole wave flume to accurately capture the actual focused location of the input wave groups the still water depth h was kept as 0 5 m the actual focusing location x f always occurred at x 11 4 m downstream of the wave maker by gradually adjusting the input value of x p which is the distance from the focusing location based on linear dispersion to the wave maker in addition an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv was located at the actual focusing location of the input wave groups and 0 15 m below the still water level to measure the horizontal particle velocity the whole computational domain l is 15 m in length the mesh resolution in the horizontal direction is d x 0 02 m and 20 σ mesh layers are applied in vertical direction similar as the experimental setup the actual focusing location was fixed at x 7 2 m in the computation to save computational domain table 1 lists the values of the parameter setups for the four different input focused wave groups the predicted time series of water surface elevation recorded at actual focusing location are compared with experiment data for both crest and trough focused waves as shown in fig 1 it is observed that the predicted temporal evolutions of the water elevations are in good agreement with experiment data for both time history and peak values under different wave slopes fig 2 compares the time series of horizontal particle velocity between predictions and measurements it clearly seen that the predicted horizontal velocity match well with the experiment data although there are some discrepancies at some moments as demonstrated above the computational capability of our numerical model of this paper in predicting the propagation of focused wave and its induced velocity has been well verified 5 2 regular wave propagation over rigid vegetation patch currently there is no experiment data available for interactions between emergent rigid vegetation and focused waves since focused wave groups consist of a series of regular waves complex interactions between regular waves and emergent rigid vegetation patch are numerically calculated and compared with the corresponding experiment data in this section wu et al 2015 the corresponding experiment work was conducted in a 20 6 m long 0 69 m wide and 1 22 m high wave flume at the usda ars national sedimentation laboratory nsl in oxford mississippi the experimental layout is depicted in fig 3 in the experiment the vegetation patch was placed at 11 5 m downstream from the wave maker the width of vegetation patch is 3 66 m the rigid vegetation was made of wooden cylinders with a diameter of 9 5 mm four wave gauges are placed along the vegetation patch to measure the temporal evolutions of water surface elevations to evaluate the wave attenuation six different cases with different still water depth incident wave height and period and vegetation density are selected to calibrate our numerical model as shown in table 2 the computational domain is 20 m long the mesh resolution in the horizontal direction is d x 0 01 m and 20 σ mesh layers are applied in the vertical direction similar as that in zhu and chen 2017 the drag coefficient c d is kept as 1 2 this treatment is also validated in jiang et al 2019 fig 4 shows a snapshots of velocity contour of the water body it is seen that the incident wave height and velocity magnitude can be greatly dissipated by the existence of vegetation patch the predicted distributions of averaged wave height in vegetation patch region are compared with experiment data in fig 5 it is seen the predicted wave height are in good agreement with the corresponding measurements although there are some slight discrepancies for case 5 and 6 the reasons for these discrepancies can be attributed to complex nature of turbulence generation by the existence of the vegetation patch overall the computational capability of our numerical model in predicting wave attenuation in emergent rigid vegetation patch has been well verified meanwhile it is also proved that drag coefficient can be selected as a constant value under similar incident wave conditions and vegetation arrangements 6 results and discussion in the following sections complex interactions between emergent rigid vegetation patch and crest or trough focused waves are numerically simulated the computational layout is plotted in fig 6 the whole computational domain is 20 m in length the mesh resolution in horizontal direction is d x 0 01 m and 20 σ mesh layers are applied in the vertical direction the relaxion zone is set as 2 m to damp out the reflected waves from the end of the computational domain eleven wave gauges are arranged along the numerical wave flume as depicted in fig 6 for all computation runs in the following sections drag coefficient c d is set as a constant value of 1 2 as suggested by jiang et al 2019 to simplify the computation procedures the actual focusing location x f is fixed at the frontal edge of vegetation patch by adjusting the input value of x p 6 1 hydrodynamic phenomena in this section the complicated flow phenomena of crest and trough focused waves propagating through emergent rigid vegetation patch are discussed in the computation the still water depth h is set as 0 5 m the incident significant wave height h s is 0 1 m peak wave period t p is 1 2 s and the vegetation width w and density n v are 3 m and 350 stem m2 respectively snapshots of velocity contours of water body are plotted in fig 7 for both crest and trough focused waves as waves enter the computational domain the water surface starts to evolve and the largest wave crest and trough are to gradually form as depicted in fig 7a as the largest wave crest and trough approach at the front of the rigid vegetation patch it reaches its maximum value and the high velocity region is observed in the vicinity region of crest and trough of the wave groups fig 7b once the largest wave crest or trough enters the vegetation region the wave amplitudes can be greatly attenuated along with the decreasing in velocity magnitude of the water body in the vegetation region fig 7c and d fig 8 shows the time series of water surface elevations recorded at the front and rear sides wg4 and wg10 of the vegetation patch due to the existence of the vegetation patch the wave amplitudes of both crest and trough focused waves can be greatly reduced as shown in fig 8 reduction rates in the large wave amplitudes of crest and trough focused waves at frontal and rear sides of vegetation patch are 0 4 and 0 36 fig 9 plots the variations of the largest wave amplitudes of crest and trough focused waves along the vegetation patch when wave groups propagate through the vegetation patch it is seen that wave amplitudes of both crest and trough focused waves can be greatly decreased due to the dissipation of the vegetation patch meanwhile it is also observed that the largest wave amplitude of crest focused wave group is always greater than trough focused wave group fig 10 shows the time series of potential kinetic total wave energies of the whole water body in the computational domain as wave groups enter the computational domain both potential and kinetic energies of the whole water body gradually increase and so does the total wave energy after the wave groups enter the vegetation patch the magnitude of the potential kinetic and total wave energies tend to decrease in a high rate finally the total wave energy dissipation rates caused by vegetation patch are 0 448 and 0 453 for crest and trough focused waves respectively for the comparison purpose temporal evolutions of the wave energies of the water body in the computational domain are also plotted in fig 10 it clearly shows that the kinetic potential and total wave energy dissipate at a very low rate after reaching their maximum values indicating that the energy loss caused by the bottom friction is much smaller compared to the energy dissipated by the vegetation patch hence the wave energy loss caused by the bottom friction can be ignored 6 2 effects of significant wave height in this section effects of the incident significant wave height h s on the wave attenuation of crest and focused waves by the emergent rigid vegetation patch are numerically investigated four different significant wave height are selected h s 0 05 0 075 0 1 and 0 125 m the peak wave period t p is set as 1 2 s the still water depth h is kept as 0 5 m the vegetation width w v and density n v are 3 m and 350 stem m2 respectively fig 11 shows the snapshots of velocity contour of water body at the moments when the largest wave crest enters and leaves the vegetation patch under different significant wave heights where the dash lines represent the boundary is of the vegetation patch it is observed that velocity magnitude of the water body near the crest of the focused wave tends to increase with significant wave height and so does the area size of high velocity region meanwhile both wave amplitude and the velocity magnitude of the water body has been greatly reduced by the existence of the vegetation patch the similar flow phenomena can be also observed for trough focused wave fig 12 shows the variations of the largest wave amplitudes of the crest and trough focused waves along the vegetation patch under different significant wave heights due to the dissipation of the vegetation patch the largest wave amplitudes of both crest and trough focused waves tend to decrease comparing to the same flow condition without vegetation patch however the decreasing rate in the largest wave amplitude is to decrease with distance after wave groups enter the vegetation region besides the largest wave amplitude of crest focused wave is always greater than that of trough focused wave along the vegetation patch this is due to the characteristics of the wave profile where there are steeper peaks and flatter troughs given the same significant wave height and peak wave period although crest and trough focused waves have same wave spectrum the wave attenuation in wave amplitude by the vegetation patch can be different due to their different wave profiles variations of the attenuation coefficient of the largest wave amplitude by the vegetation patch for both the crest and trough focused waves are plotted in fig 13 it is seen that attenuation coefficient in the largest wave amplitude is to increase with the significant wave height the attenuation coefficient in the largest wave amplitude for crest focused wave is always greater than that of trough focused wave the attenuation coefficient in the largest wave amplitude for crest and trough focused waves ranges from 0 172 to 0 361 and 0 169 to 0 326 respectively however the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy of the crest and trough focused waves are very close to each other fig 14 which indicates that the vegetation patch has the same energy dissipation efficiency for the two kinds of focused waves the attenuation rate in total wave energy ranges from 0 35 to 0 50 for the two kinds of focused waves 6 3 effects of water depth and peak period effects of the still water depth and peak period of the incident waves have been numerically investigated in this section when the effects of the still water depth are considered four different still water depths are selected h 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 7 m in the computation the width of the vegetation patch is set as 3 m and the diameter of the rigid pile d v is 0 0094 m the density of the vegetation patch is set as n v 350 stem m2 the incident significant wave height h s is set as 0 1 m and the peak wave period t p is 1 2 s fig 15 shows the spatial distributions of the maximum wave amplitudes under different water depths without the vegetation patch the spatial evolution of the maximum amplitudes of these two kinds of focused waves exhibit a nonlinear behavior and a trend of deceasing but the maximum wave amplitudes of both crest and trough focused waves can be greatly decreased in a monotonical mode under different water depths due to the attenuating effects of the vegetation patch fig 16 plots the variations of the attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitude with the water depth it shows that the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitude of the trough focused wave monotonically decreases with the water depth when the water depth h is smaller than 0 6 m the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitude of the crest focused wave also monotonically decreases with water depth once h 0 6 m the attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitude of the crest focused wave slightly increases with the water depth the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitude ranges from 0 34 to 0 28 and 0 30 to 0 24 for the crest and trough focused waves respectively as depicted in fig 17 it is seen that the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy tends to decrease especially when h is greater than 0 6 m given the same incident significant wave height the averaged velocity along water depth tends to decrease with the still water depth the variations in the depth averaged velocity with the still water depth finally decrease the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy of these two kinds of focused wave under different water depths the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy ranges from 0 48 to 0 37 for both crest and trough focused waves four different peak wave periods are selected to study the effects of peak wave periods on the wave attenuation of the focused wave namely t p 1 2 1 5 1 8 and 2 1 s in the computation the width of the vegetation patch is set as 3 m and the diameter of the rigid pile d v is 0 0094 m the density of the vegetation patch is set as n v 350 stem m2 the incident significant wave height h s is set as 0 1 m and the still water depth h is set as 0 5 m fig 18 shows the spatial distributions of the maximum wave amplitudes under different peak wave periods under different peak wave periods the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitudes range 0 25 0 3 and 0 21 to 0 28 for the crest and trough focused waves respectively fig 19 shows the variations of the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitude under different peak wave periods it shows that the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitude of these two kinds of focused waves monotonically decrease with the water depth when the peak wave period is greater than 1 8 s the attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitude significantly increase fig 20 plots the variations of the dissipation coefficient of the total wave energy under different peak wave periods as the peak wave period increases the averaged wave length of the wave groups tends to increase which causes the decreasing in the magnitude of the flow velocity hence as the peak wave period increases the amount of the wave energy which can be dissipated by the vegetation can be greatly decreases according to eq 3 under different peak wave periods the dissipation coefficient of the total wave energy ranges 0 24 to 0 45 for both crest and trough focused waves 6 4 effects of vegetation density and width in this section effects of the vegetation density and width on the wave attenuation of both crest and trough focused waves by the rigid vegetation patch are discussed when the effects of the vegetation density are considered four different vegetation densities are selected n v 350 450 550 and 650 stem m2 the width of the vegetation patch is set as 3 m and the diameter of the rigid pile d v is 0 0094 m in the computation the still water depth h is kept as 0 5 m the incident significant wave height h s is set as 0 1 m and the peak wave period t p is 1 2 s fig 21 depicts the spatial distributions of the maximum wave amplitudes of the crest and trough focused waves in vegetation patch under different vegetation densities without the vegetation patch it shows that the maximum wave amplitudes of both crest and trough focused waves exhibit nonlinear variations along the wave flume however due to the existence of the vegetation patch the maximum wave amplitudes of both crest and trough focused waves monotonically decrease implying the significance of the dissipation effects of the vegetation patch meanwhile attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitudes of two kinds of focused wave by the vegetation patch increase monotonically as shown in fig 22 it is also seen that the attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitude of crest focused wave by the vegetation patch is averagely 7 greater than the trough focused wave the attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitudes ranges from 0 3 to 0 49 and 0 28 to 0 46 for the crest and trough focused waves respectively besides the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy of two kinds of focused wave also increases monotonically with the vegetation density as shown in fig 23 the dissipation coefficient ranges 0 45 to 0 68 and 0 45 to 0 69 for the crest and trough focused waves respectively obviously the dissipation coefficients in total wave energy of these two kinds of focused wave are very close to each other when the effects of the vegetation width are considered four different vegetation widths are selected w v 2 3 4 and 5 m the density of the vegetation patch is set as n v 350 stem m2 and the diameter of the rigid pile d v is 0 0094 m in the computation the still water depth h is kept as 0 5 m the incident significant wave height h s is set as 0 1 m and the peak wave period t p is 1 2 s due to the friction effects at the bottom and the complex evolution processes of the focused waves the maximum wave amplitudes of two kinds of focused wave tend to decrease without the vegetation patch as shown in fig 24 due to the existence of the vegetation patch the maximum wave amplitudes of two kinds of focused wave decrease monotonically although the maximum wave amplitude of the crest focused wave is always greater than the trough focused wave apparently the attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitudes of two kinds of focused wave is to increase with the vegetation width as shown in fig 25 which ranges from 0 25 to 0 40 and 0 22 to 0 38 for the crest and trough focused waves respectively it also shows that the effects of the vegetation density on the wave attenuation efficiency is stronger than the vegetation width as depicted in figs 22 and 25 similar to the effects of the vegetation density the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy also increases with the vegetation width fig 26 which ranges 0 34 to 0 6 and 0 36 to 0 61 for the crest and trough focused waves respectively 7 conclusions in this paper a high resolution numerical wave tank is established based on a nonhydrostatic wave model nhwave to study the complex interactions between emergent rigid vegetation patch with the extreme waves by considering the effects of five prominent factors such as significant wave height peak wave period water depth vegetation density and width the extreme wave condition is represented by using the 2nd order crest and trough focused wave by considering the wave wave interactions the main conclusions are listed as follows 1 the wave amplitudes of both crest and trough focused waves can be greatly decreased due to the dissipation effects of the vegetation patch after the wave groups enter the vegetation patch the magnitude of the potential kinetic and total wave energies tend to decrease in a high rate in addition the kinetic potential and total wave energy can be dissipated at a very low rate by the bottom friction after reaching their maximum values indicating that the energy loss caused the bottom friction is much smaller compared to the energy dissipated by the vegetation patch hence can be ignored 2 all of the five prominent factors i e significant wave height peak wave period water depth vegetation density and width can have significant influences on the wave attenuation of both crest and trough focused waves by the emergent rigid vegetation patch the attenuation coefficient in the largest wave amplitude and the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy is to increase with the significant wave height the attenuation coefficient in the largest wave amplitude for crest focused wave is always greater than that of trough focused wave however the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy of the crest and trough focused waves are very close to each other under different significant wave height 3 generally the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitude and the dissipation coefficient of the total wave energy for the trough focused wave decrease with the water depth and wave peak period given the same incident significant wave height the averaged velocity along water depth tends to decrease with the still water depth and wave peak period causing the decreasing in the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy of these two kinds of focused wave 4 the vegetation density and width all have positive influences on the wave attenuation of both crest and trough focused waves by the emergent rigid vegetation patch the attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitude and the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy both tend to increase with the vegetation density and width however the effects of the vegetation density on the wave attenuation efficiency is stronger than the vegetation width 5 the results indicate that the emergent rigid vegetation patch can effectively reduce the maximum wave amplitude of focused wave by averagely 31 and the total wave energy by averagely 45 thus showing that coastal vegetation can effectively protect the coast from extreme waves it is hoped that the research findings

introduction attributed to the processes of wave focusing extreme waves often occur unexpectedly with huge wave height which have high potential for damaging the coastal infrastructures and threatens the intactness of the coastal communities stansell 2004 by analyzing the extreme wave events during years of 2006 2010 nikolkina and didenkulova 2011 found that the extreme waves don t only occur in deep ocean water but also can be observed in the coastal shallow waters to prevent the coastal region from extreme surges and waves many artificial infrastructures such as seawall and submerged breakwater zhao et al 2019 wu and hsiao 2013 cho et al 2017 have been constructed in the past few decades although these measures can protect the coastal regions to some extent their own safety is also vulnerable to extreme surges and waves yu et al 2017 syamsidik et al 2019 therefore more effective and environmentally friendly measures are urgently needed to protect coastal regions field observations after extreme weather events have revealed that coastal vegetations as a natural barrier can effectively attenuate the intensity of extreme surges and waves and thus play a good role in naturally protecting coast kathiresan and rajendran 2005 bao 2011 lee et al 2021 in recent years many studies have been conducted to systematically investigate the wave attenuation efficiencies of mangroves maza et al 2015 seagrasses manca et al 2012 twomey et al 2020 and saltmarshes möller 2006 in protecting the coastal regions from extreme surges and waves meanwhile coastal vegetation can not only reduce waves but also have positive impacts on ecosystem such as providing natural habitat nordstrom 2014 and mitigating coastal erosion furukawa et al 1997 besides comparing to artificial protection measures although coastal vegetations can protect the coast as natural buffers it needs little maintenance and usually can recover after some damages on their own with time to systematically assess the wave attenuations of different types of vegetations under the impacts of various types of waves many field observations manca et al 2012 theoretical analysis larson 1995 experiment works maza et al 2015 and numerical simulations huang et al 2011 have been conducted in recent years numerical simulation has become an important means to study the mechanism of wave attenuation by the vegetation various types of numerical modes have been applied to study the complex flow fields in the vegetation region under the impact of solitary waves huang et al 2011 iimura and tanaka 2012 regular waves veelen et al 2021 wang et al 2021 and irregular waves zhan et al 2014 these numerical models usually can be classified into two main groups energy conservation models and momentum conservation models suzuki et al 2019 energy conservation models account for vegetation effects using an energy attenuation term dalrymple et al 1984 tang et al 2015 momentum conservation models account for vegetation in terms of momentum loss huang et al 2011 iimura et al 2012 momentum conservation models can directly evaluate the wave attenuation effects of vegetations based on the flow fields predicted by the numerical models kobayashi et al 1993 for instance augustin et al 2009 and huang et al 2011 applied an improved boussunesq model to investigate the performance of flexible and rigid vegetation patches in attenuating tsunami waves respectively zou et al 2019 used a two phase flow model to investigate the wave attenuation of breaking and broken waves by a vegetated sloped beach although the previous research works have contributed to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which vegetation protects the coast little research has been done on the complex interactions between the extreme waves and coastal vegetations in recent years wave focusing has been widely applied to generate the extreme waves kharif and pelinovsky 2003 based on the wave focusing method many theoretical analysis sun and zhang 2017 experiment works li et al 2012 2014 and numerical simulations bihs et al 2017 have been carried out to study the propagation deformation breaking processes of the extreme waves abroug et al 2020 and their interactions with coastal infrastructures qu et al 2021a as early as the 1990s baldock et al 1996 and rapp et al 1990 had carried out a series of laboratory experiments to investigate the propagations of focused waves in a wave flume with uniform depth the runup processes of focused waves onto a sloped beach were studied by whittaker et al 2017 in a wave flume the complex interactions between vertical cylinders and the unidirectional and multi directional focused waves have been experimentally investigated by ning et al 2009 and li et al 2012 respectively in the past few decades different types of numerical models have been developed based on potential flow theory bai et al 2007 boussinesq equations sun et al 2012 nonhydrostatic ai et al 2014 and two phase flow methods zhao et al 2014 these numerical models have been widely applied to study the generations and propagations of focused waves and interactions with coastal infrastructures such as vertical cylinders li et al 2012 seawall whittaker et al 2018 and coastal bridges qu et al 2021a etc the nonhydrostatic wave model solves the three dimensional incompressible viscous navier stokes equations in terrain and surface following σ coordinates it has similar computation accuracy as two phase flow model but higher efficiency there is no need to add empirical parameters as boussinesq wave models to judge wave breaking processes in this paper as a preliminary attempt the complex interactions between the crest and trough focused wave and emergent rigid vegetation patch have been numerically investigated by applying a nonhydrostatic wave model named nhwave the wave attenuation of focused wave by the vegetation patch has been well evaluated by considering five prominent factors namely significant wave height peak wave period water depth vegetation density and width the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the

wave components are implemented using second order irregular wave theory schaffer 1996 as formulated by ning et al 2009 besides the total number of the wave components are set as n 30 for all of the following computations based on carefully numerical experiments 4 parameters for wave attenuation evaluation as we know energy is to be lost and transferred during the wave propagation especially when the damping effects of vegetation patch are considered similar as in qu et al 2019 2021b this paper analyzes the wave energy dissipation of the wave propagation over a vegetated channel by calculating the kinetic energy k e potential energy p e and total energy t e as 21 k e ρ u 2 w 2 2 d z d x 22 p e ρ g z d z d x ρ g z d z d x t 0 23 t e k e p e to quantitively evaluate the wave attenuation of vegetation patch the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitudes of a focused wave at a specified location can defined as 24 d a a n o n v e g a v e g a n o n v e g where a v e g is the maximum wave amplitude at specified location when the vegetation exists a n o n v e g is the maximum wave amplitude at the same location when the vegetation path doesn t exist to assess the total wave energy dissipated by the vegetation patch the following total wave energy dissipation coefficients are defined as 25 d e e t i e t o e t i where e t i represents the maximum total wave energy entering the vegetation region e t o the maximum total wave energy leaving the vegetation region 5 model validation 5 1 focused wave propagation in straight channel in this section propagations of both crest and trough focused waves in a straight channel are numerically simulated and the predicted time series of water surface elevation and horizontal velocity have been compared with the corresponding experiment data collected in ning et al 2009 the experiment work was conducted in a 69 m 3 m 1 5 m wave tank located at dalian university of technology in the experiment 35 wave gauges are arranged along the whole wave flume to accurately capture the actual focused location of the input wave groups the still water depth h was kept as 0 5 m the actual focusing location x f always occurred at x 11 4 m downstream of the wave maker by gradually adjusting the input value of x p which is the distance from the focusing location based on linear dispersion to the wave maker in addition an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv was located at the actual focusing location of the input wave groups and 0 15 m below the still water level to measure the horizontal particle velocity the whole computational domain l is 15 m in length the mesh resolution in the horizontal direction is d x 0 02 m and 20 σ mesh layers are applied in vertical direction similar as the experimental setup the actual focusing location was fixed at x 7 2 m in the computation to save computational domain table 1 lists the values of the parameter setups for the four different input focused wave groups the predicted time series of water surface elevation recorded at actual focusing location are compared with experiment data for both crest and trough focused waves as shown in fig 1 it is observed that the predicted temporal evolutions of the water elevations are in good agreement with experiment data for both time history and peak values under different wave slopes fig 2 compares the time series of horizontal particle velocity between predictions and measurements it clearly seen that the predicted horizontal velocity match well with the experiment data although there are some discrepancies at some moments as demonstrated above the computational capability of our numerical model of this paper in predicting the propagation of focused wave and its induced velocity has been well verified 5 2 regular wave propagation over rigid vegetation patch currently there is no experiment data available for interactions between emergent rigid vegetation and focused waves since focused wave groups consist of a series of regular waves complex interactions between regular waves and emergent rigid vegetation patch are numerically calculated and compared with the corresponding experiment data in this section wu et al 2015 the corresponding experiment work was conducted in a 20 6 m long 0 69 m wide and 1 22 m high wave flume at the usda ars national sedimentation laboratory nsl in oxford mississippi the experimental layout is depicted in fig 3 in the experiment the vegetation patch was placed at 11 5 m downstream from the wave maker the width of vegetation patch is 3 66 m the rigid vegetation was made of wooden cylinders with a diameter of 9 5 mm four wave gauges are placed along the vegetation patch to measure the temporal evolutions of water surface elevations to evaluate the wave attenuation six different cases with different still water depth incident wave height and period and vegetation density are selected to calibrate our numerical model as shown in table 2 the computational domain is 20 m long the mesh resolution in the horizontal direction is d x 0 01 m and 20 σ mesh layers are applied in the vertical direction similar as that in zhu and chen 2017 the drag coefficient c d is kept as 1 2 this treatment is also validated in jiang et al 2019 fig 4 shows a snapshots of velocity contour of the water body it is seen that the incident wave height and velocity magnitude can be greatly dissipated by the existence of vegetation patch the predicted distributions of averaged wave height in vegetation patch region are compared with experiment data in fig 5 it is seen the predicted wave height are in good agreement with the corresponding measurements although there are some slight discrepancies for case 5 and 6 the reasons for these discrepancies can be attributed to complex nature of turbulence generation by the existence of the vegetation patch overall the computational capability of our numerical model in predicting wave attenuation in emergent rigid vegetation patch has been well verified meanwhile it is also proved that drag coefficient can be selected as a constant value under similar incident wave conditions and vegetation arrangements 6 results and discussion in the following sections complex interactions between emergent rigid vegetation patch and crest or trough focused waves are numerically simulated the computational layout is plotted in fig 6 the whole computational domain is 20 m in length the mesh resolution in horizontal direction is d x 0 01 m and 20 σ mesh layers are applied in the vertical direction the relaxion zone is set as 2 m to damp out the reflected waves from the end of the computational domain eleven wave gauges are arranged along the numerical wave flume as depicted in fig 6 for all computation runs in the following sections drag coefficient c d is set as a constant value of 1 2 as suggested by jiang et al 2019 to simplify the computation procedures the actual focusing location x f is fixed at the frontal edge of vegetation patch by adjusting the input value of x p 6 1 hydrodynamic phenomena in this section the complicated flow phenomena of crest and trough focused waves propagating through emergent rigid vegetation patch are discussed in the computation the still water depth h is set as 0 5 m the incident significant wave height h s is 0 1 m peak wave period t p is 1 2 s and the vegetation width w and density n v are 3 m and 350 stem m2 respectively snapshots of velocity contours of water body are plotted in fig 7 for both crest and trough focused waves as waves enter the computational domain the water surface starts to evolve and the largest wave crest and trough are to gradually form as depicted in fig 7a as the largest wave crest and trough approach at the front of the rigid vegetation patch it reaches its maximum value and the high velocity region is observed in the vicinity region of crest and trough of the wave groups fig 7b once the largest wave crest or trough enters the vegetation region the wave amplitudes can be greatly attenuated along with the decreasing in velocity magnitude of the water body in the vegetation region fig 7c and d fig 8 shows the time series of water surface elevations recorded at the front and rear sides wg4 and wg10 of the vegetation patch due to the existence of the vegetation patch the wave amplitudes of both crest and trough focused waves can be greatly reduced as shown in fig 8 reduction rates in the large wave amplitudes of crest and trough focused waves at frontal and rear sides of vegetation patch are 0 4 and 0 36 fig 9 plots the variations of the largest wave amplitudes of crest and trough focused waves along the vegetation patch when wave groups propagate through the vegetation patch it is seen that wave amplitudes of both crest and trough focused waves can be greatly decreased due to the dissipation of the vegetation patch meanwhile it is also observed that the largest wave amplitude of crest focused wave group is always greater than trough focused wave group fig 10 shows the time series of potential kinetic total wave energies of the whole water body in the computational domain as wave groups enter the computational domain both potential and kinetic energies of the whole water body gradually increase and so does the total wave energy after the wave groups enter the vegetation patch the magnitude of the potential kinetic and total wave energies tend to decrease in a high rate finally the total wave energy dissipation rates caused by vegetation patch are 0 448 and 0 453 for crest and trough focused waves respectively for the comparison purpose temporal evolutions of the wave energies of the water body in the computational domain are also plotted in fig 10 it clearly shows that the kinetic potential and total wave energy dissipate at a very low rate after reaching their maximum values indicating that the energy loss caused by the bottom friction is much smaller compared to the energy dissipated by the vegetation patch hence the wave energy loss caused by the bottom friction can be ignored 6 2 effects of significant wave height in this section effects of the incident significant wave height h s on the wave attenuation of crest and focused waves by the emergent rigid vegetation patch are numerically investigated four different significant wave height are selected h s 0 05 0 075 0 1 and 0 125 m the peak wave period t p is set as 1 2 s the still water depth h is kept as 0 5 m the vegetation width w v and density n v are 3 m and 350 stem m2 respectively fig 11 shows the snapshots of velocity contour of water body at the moments when the largest wave crest enters and leaves the vegetation patch under different significant wave heights where the dash lines represent the boundary is of the vegetation patch it is observed that velocity magnitude of the water body near the crest of the focused wave tends to increase with significant wave height and so does the area size of high velocity region meanwhile both wave amplitude and the velocity magnitude of the water body has been greatly reduced by the existence of the vegetation patch the similar flow phenomena can be also observed for trough focused wave fig 12 shows the variations of the largest wave amplitudes of the crest and trough focused waves along the vegetation patch under different significant wave heights due to the dissipation of the vegetation patch the largest wave amplitudes of both crest and trough focused waves tend to decrease comparing to the same flow condition without vegetation patch however the decreasing rate in the largest wave amplitude is to decrease with distance after wave groups enter the vegetation region besides the largest wave amplitude of crest focused wave is always greater than that of trough focused wave along the vegetation patch this is due to the characteristics of the wave profile where there are steeper peaks and flatter troughs given the same significant wave height and peak wave period although crest and trough focused waves have same wave spectrum the wave attenuation in wave amplitude by the vegetation patch can be different due to their different wave profiles variations of the attenuation coefficient of the largest wave amplitude by the vegetation patch for both the crest and trough focused waves are plotted in fig 13 it is seen that attenuation coefficient in the largest wave amplitude is to increase with the significant wave height the attenuation coefficient in the largest wave amplitude for crest focused wave is always greater than that of trough focused wave the attenuation coefficient in the largest wave amplitude for crest and trough focused waves ranges from 0 172 to 0 361 and 0 169 to 0 326 respectively however the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy of the crest and trough focused waves are very close to each other fig 14 which indicates that the vegetation patch has the same energy dissipation efficiency for the two kinds of focused waves the attenuation rate in total wave energy ranges from 0 35 to 0 50 for the two kinds of focused waves 6 3 effects of water depth and peak period effects of the still water depth and peak period of the incident waves have been numerically investigated in this section when the effects of the still water depth are considered four different still water depths are selected h 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 7 m in the computation the width of the vegetation patch is set as 3 m and the diameter of the rigid pile d v is 0 0094 m the density of the vegetation patch is set as n v 350 stem m2 the incident significant wave height h s is set as 0 1 m and the peak wave period t p is 1 2 s fig 15 shows the spatial distributions of the maximum wave amplitudes under different water depths without the vegetation patch the spatial evolution of the maximum amplitudes of these two kinds of focused waves exhibit a nonlinear behavior and a trend of deceasing but the maximum wave amplitudes of both crest and trough focused waves can be greatly decreased in a monotonical mode under different water depths due to the attenuating effects of the vegetation patch fig 16 plots the variations of the attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitude with the water depth it shows that the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitude of the trough focused wave monotonically decreases with the water depth when the water depth h is smaller than 0 6 m the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitude of the crest focused wave also monotonically decreases with water depth once h 0 6 m the attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitude of the crest focused wave slightly increases with the water depth the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitude ranges from 0 34 to 0 28 and 0 30 to 0 24 for the crest and trough focused waves respectively as depicted in fig 17 it is seen that the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy tends to decrease especially when h is greater than 0 6 m given the same incident significant wave height the averaged velocity along water depth tends to decrease with the still water depth the variations in the depth averaged velocity with the still water depth finally decrease the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy of these two kinds of focused wave under different water depths the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy ranges from 0 48 to 0 37 for both crest and trough focused waves four different peak wave periods are selected to study the effects of peak wave periods on the wave attenuation of the focused wave namely t p 1 2 1 5 1 8 and 2 1 s in the computation the width of the vegetation patch is set as 3 m and the diameter of the rigid pile d v is 0 0094 m the density of the vegetation patch is set as n v 350 stem m2 the incident significant wave height h s is set as 0 1 m and the still water depth h is set as 0 5 m fig 18 shows the spatial distributions of the maximum wave amplitudes under different peak wave periods under different peak wave periods the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitudes range 0 25 0 3 and 0 21 to 0 28 for the crest and trough focused waves respectively fig 19 shows the variations of the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitude under different peak wave periods it shows that the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitude of these two kinds of focused waves monotonically decrease with the water depth when the peak wave period is greater than 1 8 s the attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitude significantly increase fig 20 plots the variations of the dissipation coefficient of the total wave energy under different peak wave periods as the peak wave period increases the averaged wave length of the wave groups tends to increase which causes the decreasing in the magnitude of the flow velocity hence as the peak wave period increases the amount of the wave energy which can be dissipated by the vegetation can be greatly decreases according to eq 3 under different peak wave periods the dissipation coefficient of the total wave energy ranges 0 24 to 0 45 for both crest and trough focused waves 6 4 effects of vegetation density and width in this section effects of the vegetation density and width on the wave attenuation of both crest and trough focused waves by the rigid vegetation patch are discussed when the effects of the vegetation density are considered four different vegetation densities are selected n v 350 450 550 and 650 stem m2 the width of the vegetation patch is set as 3 m and the diameter of the rigid pile d v is 0 0094 m in the computation the still water depth h is kept as 0 5 m the incident significant wave height h s is set as 0 1 m and the peak wave period t p is 1 2 s fig 21 depicts the spatial distributions of the maximum wave amplitudes of the crest and trough focused waves in vegetation patch under different vegetation densities without the vegetation patch it shows that the maximum wave amplitudes of both crest and trough focused waves exhibit nonlinear variations along the wave flume however due to the existence of the vegetation patch the maximum wave amplitudes of both crest and trough focused waves monotonically decrease implying the significance of the dissipation effects of the vegetation patch meanwhile attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitudes of two kinds of focused wave by the vegetation patch increase monotonically as shown in fig 22 it is also seen that the attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitude of crest focused wave by the vegetation patch is averagely 7 greater than the trough focused wave the attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitudes ranges from 0 3 to 0 49 and 0 28 to 0 46 for the crest and trough focused waves respectively besides the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy of two kinds of focused wave also increases monotonically with the vegetation density as shown in fig 23 the dissipation coefficient ranges 0 45 to 0 68 and 0 45 to 0 69 for the crest and trough focused waves respectively obviously the dissipation coefficients in total wave energy of these two kinds of focused wave are very close to each other when the effects of the vegetation width are considered four different vegetation widths are selected w v 2 3 4 and 5 m the density of the vegetation patch is set as n v 350 stem m2 and the diameter of the rigid pile d v is 0 0094 m in the computation the still water depth h is kept as 0 5 m the incident significant wave height h s is set as 0 1 m and the peak wave period t p is 1 2 s due to the friction effects at the bottom and the complex evolution processes of the focused waves the maximum wave amplitudes of two kinds of focused wave tend to decrease without the vegetation patch as shown in fig 24 due to the existence of the vegetation patch the maximum wave amplitudes of two kinds of focused wave decrease monotonically although the maximum wave amplitude of the crest focused wave is always greater than the trough focused wave apparently the attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitudes of two kinds of focused wave is to increase with the vegetation width as shown in fig 25 which ranges from 0 25 to 0 40 and 0 22 to 0 38 for the crest and trough focused waves respectively it also shows that the effects of the vegetation density on the wave attenuation efficiency is stronger than the vegetation width as depicted in figs 22 and 25 similar to the effects of the vegetation density the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy also increases with the vegetation width fig 26 which ranges 0 34 to 0 6 and 0 36 to 0 61 for the crest and trough focused waves respectively 7 conclusions in this paper a high resolution numerical wave tank is established based on a nonhydrostatic wave model nhwave to study the complex interactions between emergent rigid vegetation patch with the extreme waves by considering the effects of five prominent factors such as significant wave height peak wave period water depth vegetation density and width the extreme wave condition is represented by using the 2nd order crest and trough focused wave by considering the wave wave interactions the main conclusions are listed as follows 1 the wave amplitudes of both crest and trough focused waves can be greatly decreased due to the dissipation effects of the vegetation patch after the wave groups enter the vegetation patch the magnitude of the potential kinetic and total wave energies tend to decrease in a high rate in addition the kinetic potential and total wave energy can be dissipated at a very low rate by the bottom friction after reaching their maximum values indicating that the energy loss caused the bottom friction is much smaller compared to the energy dissipated by the vegetation patch hence can be ignored 2 all of the five prominent factors i e significant wave height peak wave period water depth vegetation density and width can have significant influences on the wave attenuation of both crest and trough focused waves by the emergent rigid vegetation patch the attenuation coefficient in the largest wave amplitude and the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy is to increase with the significant wave height the attenuation coefficient in the largest wave amplitude for crest focused wave is always greater than that of trough focused wave however the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy of the crest and trough focused waves are very close to each other under different significant wave height 3 generally the attenuation coefficient of the maximum wave amplitude and the dissipation coefficient of the total wave energy for the trough focused wave decrease with the water depth and wave peak period given the same incident significant wave height the averaged velocity along water depth tends to decrease with the still water depth and wave peak period causing the decreasing in the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy of these two kinds of focused wave 4 the vegetation density and width all have positive influences on the wave attenuation of both crest and trough focused waves by the emergent rigid vegetation patch the attenuation coefficient in the maximum wave amplitude and the dissipation coefficient in the total wave energy both tend to increase with the vegetation density and width however the effects of the vegetation density on the wave attenuation efficiency is stronger than the vegetation width 5 the results indicate that the emergent rigid vegetation patch can effectively reduce the maximum wave amplitude of focused wave by averagely 31 and the total wave energy by averagely 45 thus showing that coastal vegetation can effectively protect the coast from extreme waves it is hoped that the research findings drawn from this study can further broaden our understanding on the wave attenuation of extreme waves by coastal vegetations credit author contribution statement k qu conceptualization methodology
