waldron model ww model and infinite slope method were adopted to estimate the sensitivity of root reinforcement to the mechanical characteristics and the distributions of roots the results demonstrated that 1 over 80 of root parameters were found in the top 0 3 m soil layer in which the proportions of the densities of root length rld root surface area rsad and root volume rvd were 81 7

schwarz et al 2013 first shear strength enhancement occurs when roots extend across the surface of the slip in the most optimal stabilization mechanism second when only a few roots extend across the surface of the slip the increase in soil stiffness due to the interaction with neighbouring roots is large finally the slope stability may increase when there are sufficient roots crossing the potential cracks defining the perimeter of a surface landslide giadrossich et al 2013 several studies from northern italian apennines investigated that the variety of species could stabilize debris with topographical gradient up to 45 and approximately 150 roots througth 0 6 m soil depths tosi 2007 currently the spatial trait of root reinforcement comes to consideration which is likely essential for understanding mechanisms triggering landslides hales et al 2013 schwarz et al 2012 however estimating the root reinforcement remains problematic due to spatial variances of both the distributions of roots and mechanical characteristics over recent decades several researchers have put forward different models to calculate the impact of root reinforcement on slope stability wu et al 1979 pollen and simon 2005 schwarz et al 2010 the established approach is an assumption that the failure if a slope occurs through shearing and that the roots undergoing deformation provide further shear strength that is often referred to as the apparent cohesion of roots the estimation of this cohesion term is often achieved using two models the wu and waldron model ww model wu 1976 waldron 1977 or the fibre bundle model fbm pollen and simon 2005 the ww model has been adopted widely due to its simplicity relatively and low input data requirements therefore the ww model is likely the most widely used model for the preliminary assessment of root reinforcement and is often applied for species ranking by potential for soil stabilization burylo et al 2011 in recent years the influence of vegetation on the slope stability has been commonly assessed by centrifuge testing and numerical modelling using the finite element method limit equilibrium method or infinite slope method regardless of the model considered root reinforcement is driven by two dominant factors namely root tensile characteristics tensile force and strength and the root spatial distributions root tensile characteristics are usually expressed as power functions of the root diameters de baets et al 2008 leung et al 2015 ye et al 2017 the distributions of roots are characterized by the quantity of roots with change in soil depth tosi 2007 on natural slopes these factors tend to fluctuate widely bischetti et al 2009 hales et al 2009 vergani et al 2012 while there have been many studies addressing the distribution and tensile strength of roots few studies have attempted to estimate the effect of variability in these two factors based on the calculation of root reinforcement moreover the variability within species has not been considered due to the unique force diameter relationship which has been commonly used for each species mao et al 2012 studied indicates that fine roots 2 mm are more effective in soil fixation and improving slope stability than thick roots with fewer laterals as fine roots are commonly associated with herbaceous vegetation mattie et al 2005 de baets et al 2008 loades et al 2010 while a large amount of data on root tensile tests and distributions of roots exists there is no studies on the sensitivity of the ww model to both distributions of roots and mechanical property variations in particular the root reinforcement is not yet considered in detail at different soil depths therefore it is important to analyse the effect of plant roots on the slope stability native artemisia sacrorum a natural restored plant in loess plateau of china was selected to figure out the root reinforcement mechanism of slope stability the objectives of this study were primarily focused on 1 the distributions of roots at different soil depths 2 the tensile characteristics of roots with different root gauge lengths and diameters and 3 slope stability evaluation by using the ww model and the infinite stability of slopes theory 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area artemisia sacrorum was collected at three locations table 1 in the north western area of yanan city 109 17 42 e 36 42 25 n shaanxi province china the centre of the loess plateau a typical hilly and gully region fig 1 this area has a typical temperate semi humid climate zone and a temperate semi arid continental climate transition zone with an annual precipitation of 505 3 mm and an annual mean temperature of 8 8 c the soil is mainly classified as silt loam usda 1999 which is easily disintegrated and broken when exposed to water resulting in serious soil and water losses fu et al 2011 the soil organic matter was 5 45 g kg 1 the soil bulk density was 1 19 g cm3 and the soil water content was 13 so the potential effects of soil factors on the experimental results were minimized in this study area a large amount of natural vegetation is distributed and herbaceous plants are the main vegetation types fu et al 2011 the main species in this area are artemisia sacrorum lespedeza davurica sophora davidii potentilla tanacetifolia bothriochloa ischaemum setaria viridis astragalus melilotoides and heteropappus altaicus in which the proportions of artemisia sacrorum is 55 92 the root systems have been fully developed in the vegetation restoration period of 25 years 2 2 root sampling plants with similar heights and coverage areas were sampled at each slope according to the s shape roots were collected with a root soil complex sampler the length width and depth were 0 15 0 1 and 0 1 m respectively the sampling depth was 0 3 m in three 0 1 m soil layers sampling was started and completed in august 2019 live roots were sampled by digging trenches or pits during excavation care was taken to avoid any damage to roots samples were safely placed separately in sealed bags to avoid any external stress damage or moisture and then were transported to the laboratory for measurements of root characteristic and tensile strength 2 3 root parameters measurement samples of root soil complex were gently rinsed above a 0 5 mm sieve using water to separate roots from soil separated roots were positioned onto a transparent scanning vessel with no overlapping and then were scanned using a scanner epson perfection v700 photo japan with a resolution of 300 dpi the scanned records were analysed by a software regent winrhizo 2009a canada to derive root parameters fig 2 the densities of root volume rvd 10 2 cm3 cm 3 root length rld cm cm 3 and root surface area rsad cm2 cm 3 as well as the root area ratio rar were calculated using the following equations zhou and shangguan et al 2007 de baets et al 2008 1 r l d r l v 2 r s a d r s a v 3 r v d r v v 4 r a r i 1 n a r i a where rl represents the total length of roots cm v is the volume of soil 10 2 cm3 and rsa represents the total root surface area cm2 ari represents the ratio of root area of cross sectional area of root m2 and a represents the cross sectional area of soil m2 it revealed that the roots were mainly concentrated within the diameter class of 0 d 2 0 mm hence the 0 d 2 0 mm roots were selected to test the root mechanical characteristics table 2 33 roots of single artemisia sacrorum could be across in the 0 0 1 m slip surface 16 roots and 7 roots cross in the 0 1 0 2 m and 0 2 0 3 m slip surface respectively 2 4 test for the tensile strength of roots the tensile characteristics of roots are mainly reflected by tensile force tensile strength and deformation a microcomputer controlled electronic universal material testing machine ldm 1 shanghai china was employed to measure these characteristics the roots were placed in the middle part of the chuck with both ends extending into 30 mm of the fixture a constant and linear speed of 50 mm min 1 was applied until root rupture occurred the tests experiencing root slipping or rupture because of root damage at the jaw faces were discarded as invalid and only roots experienced rupture near the middle were succeed as valid fig 2 the tensile strength was calculated by dividing the failure maximum tensile force by the breaking point cross sectional area of the roots zhu et al 2009 5 t r i 4 t f i π d 2 where tri represents the tensile strength of individual root i mpa tf i represents the tensile force n when calculating the maximum tensile strength of individual root and d is the mean diameter of roots mm furthermore tri and tfi are greatly influenced by d a power function is used to express the relationship of this influence bischetti et al 2005 6 t r i d α d β where α and β represent a scale factor and decay rate respectively and both are species dependant 2 5 estimation of root reinforcement the ww model was adopted to estimate the rise in the shear strength of soil due to roots wu 1976 waldron 1977 wu et al 1979 the model facilitates a simple and rapid estimation the effect of soil reinforcement using the tensile strength and distributions of roots as 7 s c s r σ t a n φ where s represents total shear strength of root soil complex kpa c represents soil cohesion kpa sr represents increased shear strength due to roots kpa σ represents normal stress on the shear plane and φ is the angle of internal friction sr can be calculated as follows waldron 1977 wu et al 1979 8 s r c o s θ t a n φ s i n θ t r where θ represents the shear distortion angle of the roots and tr represents the total tensile strength of roots per unit soil area tr can be calculated as follows waldron 1977 wu et al 1979 9 t r i 1 n t ri rar 10 s r k t r where k represents a factor for the decomposition of tri and is randomly orientated with respect to the failure plane the present study applied a k of 1 2 for 20 φ 40 and 40 θ 70 wu et al 1975 consequently sr could be expressed as follows 11 s r 1 2 t r stability of slopes analysis was based on the standard infinite slope method skempton and delory 1984 the safety factor fs was calculated as 12 f s c γ h c o s 2 δ u tan φ s r γ h sin δ cos δ where γ is unit soil weight kn m 3 h is sliding depth m δ is the slope u is the pore pressure at sliding mass base for u γ whw where γw is the unit weight of water kn m 3 and hw is the water height m the effect of the tensile strength of artemisia sacrorum roots on slope stability was studied in different soil depths 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m and topographic gradients of 5 45 3 results 3 1 root parameter characteristics the root parameters rld rsad and rvd all declined with soil depth with significant differences between 0 1 m and other soil depths similar trends in variations of the root parameters were found amongst three different soil depths further confirming the attainment of a steady state by the vertical distributions of the roots the root parameters were mainly concentrated in the 0 0 3 m soil depth where the proportions of rld rsad and rvd were 81 7 89 9 and 92 7 respectively table 3 3 2 root tensile characteristics the root tensile characteristics in each class were showed in fig 3 there was an increase in tensile forces with increasing root diameter while there exhibited a decline in tensile strength tensile force varied between 7 and 12 n for the different diameter classes while the tensile strength varied between 27 and 134 mpa there were significant differences in tensile force between 0 0 7 mm and 1 3 1 6 mm diameter classes and in tensile strength between 0 0 7 mm and the other diameter classes the results revealed that the tensile force of 150 mm roots was higher than all other gauge lengths with no significant differences in contrast the tensile strength of roots of 150 mm roots was lower than other gauge lengths with no significant differences with increasing diameter of roots the tensile force increased and the tensile strength decreased according to power functions at five gauge lengths r2 0 4 table 4 3 3 stress strain analysis to examine the root stretching process two different stress strain behaviours were identified fig 4 when the stress was between 50 and 70 of the tensile strength the curve from the origin to the limit was almost a straight line that could be regarded as the linear elastic stage when the limit point was exceeded the loading level nonlinear root deformation occurred with increasing tensile force the stress strain curve was composed of elastic and plastic parts the elastic part of the root deformation could be eliminated when the tensile force was restored to 0 after root rupture the other part of plastic deformation was remained the stress strain curve exhibited an upward convex reflecting highly nonlinear elastic characteristics there was a similar increased tendency in stress strain curves of 0 0 70 mm and 0 70 1 00 mm of root diameters meanwhile the tendency of stress strain curve of 1 00 1 30 mm of root diameter is basically the same as that of the 1 30 1 60 mm of root diameter finer roots had better elastic characteristics than thicker roots there was no obvious variation of stress strain characteristics in different root gauge lengths amongst which the stress strain of 100 mm behaved best elastic characteristic 3 4 root reinforcement and stability of slopes different tensile strength of roots may affect the stability of slopes table 5 showed the mean diameters and numbers of roots which were used to estimate sr in different soil depths 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m sr decreased with soil depths the influence of tensile strength should be emphasized by estimating the rise in shear strength because of different roots numbers and diameters in each soil depth the effect of soil depth on the slope stability was studied by substituting the following variable values in eq 12 sliding depths of 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m unit soil weight of 12 0 kn m 3 unit water weight of 9 8 kn m 3 slope of 30 c 0 5 kpa and φ 20 fig 5 a showed the fs for root reinforced and root free soil it revealed that the fs of soil without roots were smaller than the root reinforced soil at each depth meaning that the root reinforcement could lead to the increase of slope stability with soil depth increasing the effect of root reinforcement on the slope stability declined fig 5a because the root numbers decreased the root reinforcement provided between 1 49 and 18 49 while fs based on the soil without roots was between 0 61 and 1 25 hence artemisia sacrorum roots were able to stabilize soil in the 0 3 m soil depth and the topographic gradient of 30 the influence of tensile strength on the slope stability was also studied under slopes 45 fig 5b d at surface depth 0 1 m fig 5b fs of the soil without roots was greater than 1 when the slopes were 35 with root reinforcement fs was larger than 1 when the slopes were 45 at the soil depth of 0 2 m slopes without roots were stable only at the slopes 20 if sr was considered the slopes were stable at slopes 45 at 0 3 m soil depth fig 5d the slopes with roots were stable up to slopes of 45 and the slopes without roots were only stable at slopes 15 4 discussion 4 1 distribution of roots there was a high variability in the distributions of artemisia sacrorum roots with increasing soil depth the proportion of all measured root parameters distributed in the upper 0 3 m soil depth of soil exceeded 80 there were significant relationships between root parameters rld rsad and rvd and soil depth p 0 05 similar distributions of roots were found by li et al 2005 in the natural grasslands of the loess plateau of china the results were consistent with those for paspalum notatum roots in previous research ye et al 2017 and the root parameters were mainly concentrated in the upper 0 3 m soil depth bischetti et al 2005 the decline in root parameters with increasing soil depth could be a result of the declining trends in fertility of soil and aeration in addition to a higher number of compacted layers existing in the subsoil bischetti et al 2005 4 2 root tensile property the root tensile property is one of the main mechanical characteristics and it can directly affect the intensity of soil reinforcement there was significant difference in tensile strength for different gauge lengths with increasing gauge length the probability of increased defects was correspondingly rise hence the tensile strength decreased tosi 2007 meanwhile when the roots with small gauge length have large buffer capacity to the external tension at the same of the external loading condition the roots have strong tensile strength the tensile strength decreased with roots diameters as power functions table 4 our results agreed with the results indicated by ye et al 2017 and esmaiili et al 2017 a power function is preferable for interpreting long term data as the application of a linear function would result in considerable underestimation of tensile strength with increasing degradation preti 2012 artemisia sacrorum in the present study has been restored for 25 years in the loess hilly region therefore the choice of a power function fitting is more meaningful for long term monitoring and simulation purposes in the present study the tensile strength were similar to those of grasses with similar diameter from south eastern spain de baets et al 2008 and italian alps comino et al 2010 however the tensile strength of artemisia sacrorum was lower than that of herbaceous species from the french alps burylo et al 2011 and that of grass species of from iran abdi et al 2009 the differences in the above species may be due to the moisture content which could significantly affect the content of cellulose in addition the roots situated in areas of divergent slope with low moisture were stronger than those situated in areas of convergent slope with an elevated moisture content hales et al 2009 overall it indicated that finer roots were more resistant to tensile stress compared to thicker roots de baets et al 2008 burylo et al 2011 the stress strain curves of artemisia sacrorum roots were all single peak curves from the origin which indicated that the roots owned the characteristics of elastic plastic materials the stress strain curves could be used to clearly and intuitively reflect the mechanical index of roots and to explain the whole stretching process from the beginning of the experiment to the breaking of the roots tosi 2007 chen et al 2011 4 3 stability of slopes implications the slope stability could be enhanced by the root reinforcement with increasing soil depth the influence of root reinforcement on fs decreased such computational slope processes could be found in previous works tosi 2007 nguyen et al 2019 tsige et al 2020 at a set slope the effect of root reinforcement on the slope stability was larger in 0 1 m soil depth the overall slope stability depended on the slope steepness however the tensile strength of roots could offset increasing in shearing stress vergani et al 2017 although certain trees and shrubs had strong roots inducing more soil reinforcement than those of other plants tosi 2007 the demand of their growing conditions made it difficult for them to occur on steep slopes in addition the environmental needs of trees including water nutrients and soil conditions are higher than those of artemisia sacrorum therefore the hardwood artemisia sacrorum species is particularly suitable as a pioneer species for the reconstruction of loess slope ecosystems and protecting the slope stability 5 conclusions the variations of root distribution and tensile strength in different soil depths were quantified and the effect of root reinforcement on slope stability was evaluated by the ww model and infinite slope method the results showed that 1 over 80 of the total root parameters root length density root surface area density and root volume density were found in the soil depth 0 3 m and declined significantly with increasing soil depth 2 with increasing diameter of roots d the tensile strength of roots tri decreased and the tensile force tfi increased both according to power functions 3 the increase of shear strength by roots sr declined with increasing soil depth and the effect of root reinforcement on the safety factor fs was obvious in the upper 0 0 3 m depth with increasing soil depth the influence of root reinforcement on the slope fs declined and fs could be notably increased by the restoration of artemisia sacrorum artemisia sacrorum could reinforce loess soil and prevent loess soil from losing and surface landslides declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this study is supported by the national natural

unit weight of water kn m 3 and hw is the water height m the effect of the tensile strength of artemisia sacrorum roots on slope stability was studied in different soil depths 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m and topographic gradients of 5 45 3 results 3 1 root parameter characteristics the root parameters rld rsad and rvd all declined with soil depth with significant differences between 0 1 m and other soil depths similar trends in variations of the root parameters were found amongst three different soil depths further confirming the attainment of a steady state by the vertical distributions of the roots the root parameters were mainly concentrated in the 0 0 3 m soil depth where the proportions of rld rsad and rvd were 81 7 89 9 and 92 7 respectively table 3 3 2 root tensile characteristics the root tensile characteristics in each class were showed in fig 3 there was an increase in tensile forces with increasing root diameter while there exhibited a decline in tensile strength tensile force varied between 7 and 12 n for the different diameter classes while the tensile strength varied between 27 and 134 mpa there were significant differences in tensile force between 0 0 7 mm and 1 3 1 6 mm diameter classes and in tensile strength between 0 0 7 mm and the other diameter classes the results revealed that the tensile force of 150 mm roots was higher than all other gauge lengths with no significant differences in contrast the tensile strength of roots of 150 mm roots was lower than other gauge lengths with no significant differences with increasing diameter of roots the tensile force increased and the tensile strength decreased according to power functions at five gauge lengths r2 0 4 table 4 3 3 stress strain analysis to examine the root stretching process two different stress strain behaviours were identified fig 4 when the stress was between 50 and 70 of the tensile strength the curve from the origin to the limit was almost a straight line that could be regarded as the linear elastic stage when the limit point was exceeded the loading level nonlinear root deformation occurred with increasing tensile force the stress strain curve was composed of elastic and plastic parts the elastic part of the root deformation could be eliminated when the tensile force was restored to 0 after root rupture the other part of plastic deformation was remained the stress strain curve exhibited an upward convex reflecting highly nonlinear elastic characteristics there was a similar increased tendency in stress strain curves of 0 0 70 mm and 0 70 1 00 mm of root diameters meanwhile the tendency of stress strain curve of 1 00 1 30 mm of root diameter is basically the same as that of the 1 30 1 60 mm of root diameter finer roots had better elastic characteristics than thicker roots there was no obvious variation of stress strain characteristics in different root gauge lengths amongst which the stress strain of 100 mm behaved best elastic characteristic 3 4 root reinforcement and stability of slopes different tensile strength of roots may affect the stability of slopes table 5 showed the mean diameters and numbers of roots which were used to estimate sr in different soil depths 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m sr decreased with soil depths the influence of tensile strength should be emphasized by estimating the rise in shear strength because of different roots numbers and diameters in each soil depth the effect of soil depth on the slope stability was studied by substituting the following variable values in eq 12 sliding depths of 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m unit soil weight of 12 0 kn m 3 unit water weight of 9 8 kn m 3 slope of 30 c 0 5 kpa and φ 20 fig 5 a showed the fs for root reinforced and root free soil it revealed that the fs of soil without roots were smaller than the root reinforced soil at each depth meaning that the root reinforcement could lead to the increase of slope stability with soil depth increasing the effect of root reinforcement on the slope stability declined fig 5a because the root numbers decreased the root reinforcement provided between 1 49 and 18 49 while fs based on the soil without roots was between 0 61 and 1 25 hence artemisia sacrorum roots were able to stabilize soil in the 0 3 m soil depth and the topographic gradient of 30 the influence of tensile strength on the slope stability was also studied under slopes 45 fig 5b d at surface depth 0 1 m fig 5b fs of the soil without roots was greater than 1 when the slopes were 35 with root reinforcement fs was larger than 1 when the slopes were 45 at the soil depth of 0 2 m slopes without roots were stable only at the slopes 20 if sr was considered the slopes were stable at slopes 45 at 0 3 m soil depth fig 5d the slopes with roots were stable up to slopes of 45 and the slopes without roots were only stable at slopes 15 4 discussion 4 1 distribution of roots there was a high variability in the distributions of artemisia sacrorum roots with increasing soil depth the proportion of all measured root parameters distributed in the upper 0 3 m soil depth of soil exceeded 80 there were significant relationships between root parameters rld rsad and rvd and soil depth p 0 05 similar distributions of roots were found by li et al 2005 in the natural grasslands of the loess plateau of china the results were consistent with those for paspalum notatum roots in previous research ye et al 2017 and the root parameters were mainly concentrated in the upper 0 3 m soil depth bischetti et al 2005 the decline in root parameters with increasing soil depth could be a result of the declining trends in fertility of soil and aeration in addition to a higher number of compacted layers existing in the subsoil bischetti et al 2005 4 2 root tensile property the root tensile property is one of the main mechanical characteristics and it can directly affect the intensity of soil reinforcement there was significant difference in tensile strength for different gauge lengths with increasing gauge length the probability of increased defects was correspondingly rise hence the tensile strength decreased tosi 2007 meanwhile when the roots with small gauge length have large buffer capacity to the external tension at the same of the external loading condition the roots have strong tensile strength the tensile strength decreased with roots diameters as power functions table 4 our results agreed with the results indicated by ye et al 2017 and esmaiili et al 2017 a power function is preferable for interpreting long term data as the application of a linear function would result in considerable underestimation of tensile strength with increasing degradation preti 2012 artemisia sacrorum in the present study has been restored for 25 years in the loess hilly region therefore the choice of a power function fitting is more meaningful for long term monitoring and simulation purposes in the present study the tensile strength were similar to those of grasses with similar diameter from south eastern spain de baets et al 2008 and italian alps comino et al 2010 however the tensile strength of artemisia sacrorum was lower than that of herbaceous species from the french alps burylo et al 2011 and that of grass species of from iran abdi et al 2009 the differences in the above species may be due to the moisture content which could significantly affect the content of cellulose in addition the roots situated in areas of divergent slope with low moisture were stronger than those situated in areas of convergent slope with an elevated moisture content hales et al 2009 overall it indicated that finer roots were more resistant to tensile stress compared to thicker roots de baets et al 2008 burylo et al 2011 the stress strain curves of artemisia sacrorum roots were all single peak curves from the origin which indicated that the roots owned the characteristics of elastic plastic materials the stress strain curves could be used to clearly and intuitively reflect the mechanical index of roots and to explain the whole stretching process from the beginning of the experiment to the breaking of the roots tosi 2007 chen et al 2011 4 3 stability of slopes implications the slope stability could be enhanced by the root reinforcement with increasing soil depth the influence of root reinforcement on fs decreased such computational slope processes could be found in previous works tosi 2007 nguyen et al 2019 tsige et al 2020 at a set slope the effect of root reinforcement on the slope stability was larger in 0 1 m soil depth the overall slope stability depended on the slope steepness however the tensile strength of roots could offset increasing in shearing stress vergani et al 2017 although certain trees and shrubs had strong roots inducing more soil reinforcement than those of other plants tosi 2007 the demand of their growing conditions made it difficult for them to occur on steep slopes in addition the environmental needs of trees including water nutrients and soil conditions are higher than those of artemisia sacrorum therefore the hardwood artemisia sacrorum species is particularly suitable as a pioneer species for the reconstruction of loess slope ecosystems and protecting the slope stability 5 conclusions the variations of root distribution and tensile strength in different soil depths were quantified and the effect of root reinforcement on slope stability was evaluated by the ww model and infinite slope method the results showed that 1 over 80 of the total root parameters root length density root surface area density and root volume density were found in the soil depth 0 3 m and declined significantly with increasing soil depth 2 with increasing diameter of roots d the tensile strength of roots tri decreased and the tensile force tfi increased both according to power functions 3 the increase of shear strength by roots sr declined with increasing soil depth and the effect of root reinforcement on the safety factor fs was obvious in the upper 0 0 3 m depth with increasing soil depth the influence of root reinforcement on the slope fs declined and fs could be notably increased by the restoration of artemisia sacrorum artemisia sacrorum could reinforce loess soil and prevent loess soil from losing and surface landslides declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

24656,wild bees play a major role in the cultivation of crops for human use in the reproduction of many wild plants and are a key component of biodiversity mainly due to human activities wild bees like other insects face a rapid decline in europe understanding species distribution can help to design efficient conservation measures species distribution can also be used to estimate pollination ecosystem service potential which can benefit the production of crops relying on pollination and the reproduction of wild plant communities the presence of pollinators depends on a combination of environmental and biotic factors each playing a determining role at different spatial scales we therefore developed a model composed as a hierarchical framework for environmental predictors climatic data and land use land cover lulc variables at the european scale and species specific habitat information at the local scale the model combines the advantages of two different existing approaches pollinator species distribution predictions based on their environmental requirements and knowledge on bee species life history traits and habitats this paper presents the predicted distribution of twenty five wild bee species of the andrena genus in an agricultural region in northern germany we used oilseed rape pollinators as a case study and compared the potential pollination services to the potential demand in the case study area the developed framework allows to determine the capacity of landscapes to support pollination ecosystem services from wild bees at the local scale which can support the identification of vulnerable areas and the design of local scale measures for habitat improvement and for conservation the hierarchical approach leaves potential for further adaptations in order to improve the prediction of wild bee species dynamics and factors influencing their spatial distribution keywords species richness ensemble species distribution models wild bee species ecosystem service providers species specific habitat filter 1 introduction pollination is a key ecosystem service vital to both wild plants and cultivated crops klein et al 2007 gallai et al 2009 estimated that 10 of the total economic value of food production in europe depends upon insect pollination there is growing evidence that wild bees play a significant role in crop pollination javorek et al 2002 greenleaf and kremen 2006a klein et al 2007 bommarco et al 2012 garibaldi et al 2013 and that the pollination service delivered by wild pollinators cannot entirely be substituted by honeybees brittain et al 2013 garibaldi et al 2013 an increasing number of insect pollinators are in decline or threatened mainly because of anthropogenic stressors such as environmental pollution land use change and agricultural intensification but also climate change winfree et al 2009 potts et al 2010 cameron et al 2011 ollerton et al 2014 nieto et al 2014 this decline of pollinating species will not only have an impact on agricultural productivity and resilience ipbes 2016 it can also lead to a parallel decline of wild plant species biesmeijer et al 2006 as globally estimated 85 of flowering plants 78 in temperate zones are adapted to animal pollination ollerton et al 2011 mainly to bees potts et al 2010 therefore ongoing declines in pollinator diversity may result in community cascade effects i e the subsequent loss of other species that directly or indirectly rely upon extinct or declining species chapin et al 1997 this in turn can have an impact on wild food fibre and medicine supplies as well as decrease the cultural and aesthetic values of a landscape ipbes 2016 in light of these observations there are increasing calls and efforts to conserve wild pollinator species and their habitats ipbes 2016 an effective biodiversity conservation policy should provide a clear guidance to planning authorities on how to develop targeted species specific conservation options for organisms that contribute to pollination services at relevant scales kremen et al 2007 to this end there is a need for better spatial assessments of pollination understanding spatial patterns of pollinators is also crucial for estimating their availability to pollinate cultivated crops and wild plants kremen et al 2004 to facilitate monitoring and inform on the habitats and vulnerability of local pollinators kremen et al 2007 kremen and chaplin kramer 2007 up to now the main approaches for building pollinator ecosystem service maps are by using invest integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs sharp et al 2016 and estimap ecosystem service mapping tool zulian et al 2013 invest and estimap models are primarily based on expert judgements on the presence and preferences of pollinators essentially nesting places and floral feeding resources the main issues with expert based knowledge are that this knowledge may strongly depend on their selections experience and expertise polce et al 2018 lonsdorf et al 2009 and therefore can be biased towards specific species or species groups fewer studies are based on species distribution models sdms and actual species records polce et al 2013 polce et al 2018 nogué et al 2016 sdms rely on the correlation between environmental variables and geo localized species records to determine the environmental variables that drive species presence and delineate potential species distribution guisan and zimmermann 2000 elith and leathwick 2009 araújo and guisan 2006 contrary to sdms invest and estimap models do not allow to dynamically consider different environmental conditions lonsdorf et al 2009 zulian et al 2013 when mapping pollination ecosystem service potential at national or sub national scales bioclimatic conditions can largely vary and be a major determinant of bee species occurrence conversely existing pollination models based on sdms are at relatively coarse resolution constrained by occurrence data and environmental variables typically available at coarse spatial resolution especially in highly fragmented landscapes this resolution may fail to cover important habitats such as hedgerows small pastures and forests and therefore obtain biased pollinator distribution maps thus to improve our ability to predict pollinator diversity and the associated pollination ecosystem service one possibility could be to combine the advantages of the two different approaches species distribution predictions through sdms and knowledge on bee species life history traits and habitat requirements as implemented in invest and estimap frameworks the aim of this study is to develop a high resolution pollinator species model to predict spatial patterns of pollination ecosystem services potential from wild bees at the local scale hereby we assume that pollinator species richness and landscape suitability are good proxies of pollination service potential this is a common assumption in existing pollination models kremen et al 2007 lonsdorf et al 2009 zulian et al 2013 and is supported by the fact that pollination quantity quality and stability tend to increase in landscapes with a diverse pollinator community klein et al 2007 albrecht et al 2012 dainese et al 2019 the model is used as a tool to provide clear guidance for potential users such as planning authorities on how to optimize conservation measures for wild bee conservation and to inform on how management decisions can affect pollination ecosystem services and therefore pollination dependant crop productivity we apply the model in an agriculture dominated case study area in northern germany to test this approach at the local scale and its applicability for landscape management using selected bee species as an example the approach also allowed us to assess how and which environmental variables affect wild bee species distribution as well as the role of life history traits on their spatial distribution 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study area csa the csa is located in the region of the bornhöved lake district in the federal state of schleswig holstein in northern germany fig 1 the extent of the area is approximately 140 km² agroecosystems dominate the landscape in a catchment area of five glacially formed and consecutively connected lakes the csa shows a suit of habitats with a high proportion of hedges and wall hedges that are characteristic in the province shaping a highly diverse and fragmented landscape see fig 1 and fränzle et al 2008 only small settlements following a north south alignment are located in the csa 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 bees we selected species from the genus andrena also called mining bees as they represent a highly various group including small bees to ones larger than honey bees species that differ in seasonality or soil preference as well as specialists oligolectic and generalist polylectic species this genus of bees is therefore a good representative of a broad range of bee species from the andrena genus we selected species that were identified in the region and documented in the federal red list van der smissen 2001 this step accounts for historical and current dispersal limitations and helps to determine which species in the global source pool could have dispersed to the csa guisan et al 2017 the selected andrena species are listed amongst the most important pollinators for crops in europe particularly of oilseed rape flowers and apple trees klein et al 2007 kleijn et al 2015 or wild flowers westrich 2018 plant families visited by each species are listed in table 1 in the supplementary material we obtained 125 681 presence only records of twenty six wild bees from the global biodiversity information facility 1 1 https www gbif org gbif occurrence records retrieved from gbif were cleaned using the coordinatecleaner v 2 0 14 package zizka et al 2019 occurrences with sea coordinates zero coordinates or without geographic coordinate country mismatches country centroids outlier coordinates and coordinates assigned to biodiversity institutions were excluded we also removed data older than 1950 as old records are more likely to be unreliable maldonado et al 2015 data records with unprecise coordinates and duplicates we also checked for taxonomic errors including spelling mistakes and synonyms to reduce model overfitting derived from spatial autocorrelation and overdominance of specific regions due to sampling bias we then thinned the records using the package spthin v 0 2 0 aiello lammens et al 2015 we only selected species that had more than 50 gbif occurrence records as this is a key criterion for sdm modelling quality guisan et al 2017 after geographic and taxonomic cleaning only 10 928 records of twenty five wild bee species were retained for modelling table 1 in the supplementary material 2 2 2 environmental variables we used bioclimatic and land use land cover lulc data as environmental predictors see table 2 in the supplementary material for a complete list of the environmental variables we first selected the main drivers of species ranges based on knowledge about mechanistic relationship between environmental variables and physiology of the targeted species we further reduced the number of variables as too many variables increase the risk of overfitting and collinearity issues between the variables dormann et al 2013 guisan et al 2017 collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables and can be a problem for parameter estimation as it inflates the variance of regression parameters and potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors therefore reducing the number of environmental variables maximizes the performance of sdms and the accuracy of the predictions araujo and guisan 2006 a principal component analysis pca was used to visualize the correlation between variables to identify the main environmental gradients in the study area and to investigate the distribution of species in the environmental space guisan et al 2017 we conducted our pca using the ade4 v 1 7 16 package from r dray and dufour 2007 we also analysed correlations between environmental variables with a pearson analysis for all bioclimatic and lulc variables only the most relevant uncorrelated variables i e with a pearson s correlation coefficient below 0 7 were finally selected dormann et al 2013 the bioclimatic variables were first selected based on their impact on diurnal foraging activity of bees nesting success and plants availability during active months low temperatures and high precipitation values reduce the number of foraging days and consequently potentially decrease bee fitness westrich 2018 high precipitation values probably impact the nesting success for ground nesters bystriakova et al 2018 extreme temperature and precipitation also indirectly affect bees by impacting the bloom of plants and therefore resource availability nieto et al 2014 climatic data were retrieved from worldclim 2 2 http worldclim org version2 on a 30 second resolution raster grids 1 km2 at the equator from worldclim 2 0 fick and hijmans 2017 from the 19 available climatic variables we first selected the variables expected to be the most causal for the species distribution bio 02 mean diurnal range bio 5 max temperature of warmest month bio 6 min temperature of coldest month bio 7 temperature annual range bio 5 bio 6 bio 8 mean temperature of wettest quarter bio 10 mean temperature of warmest quarter bio 11 mean temperature of coldest quarter bio 14 precipitation of driest month bio 16 precipitation of wettest quarter bio 18 precipitation of warmest quarter and bio 19 precipitation of coldest quarter the results of the pca indicated that from the nine pre selected bioclimatic variables eight were strongly correlated bio 5 bio 6 bio 10 and bio 11 bio 14 and bio 18 as well as bio 19 and bio 16 and one bio 8 did not significantly contribute to the overall environmental variation see fig 1 in the supplementary material we selected bio 19 bio 11 bio 2 bio 7 and bio 14 for the modelling as they are good variables for discriminating between bee species and the rest of the environment in temperate zones wild bee species distribution are influenced by the proportion of heathland woodland grassland and urban areas coverages at the landscape scale senapathi et al 2015 as major threats to wild bees in europe agricultural intensification and expansion pollution and urban sprawl will generally have a negatively impact wild bee species distribution nieto et al 2014 for this study lulc data was derived from the corine coordination of information on the environment land cover 2018 dataset 3 3 https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover clc2018 with a 100 m resolution this dataset is produced by the european environmental agency eea and is composed of 44 different lulc classes belonging to the five main land cover categories artificial surfaces agricultural forest semi natural areas wetlands or water bodies we used the hierarchical level 3 from corine and first aggregated the data in 1 km 1 km grid cells representing the percentage cover of each lulc per 1 km 1 km grid this was a necessary first step to generate a clean data structure for modelling all predictors having the same resolution the resolution of the predicted results is the same as the one of the environmental variables 1 km 1 km we first selected 15 lulc classes based on their ecological relevance continuous urban fabric discontinuous urban fabric road and rail networks and associated land non irrigated arable land pastures complex cultivation patterns broad leaved forest coniferous forest mixed forest natural grasslands moors and heathland transitional woodland shrub sparsely vegetated areas water courses and water bodies we run the complete model a first time to select the most important variables for the select wild bee species distribution this led to the selection of the following lulc variables discontinuous urban fabric non irrigated arable land pastures coniferous forest sparsely vegetated areas water courses and water bodies the selected lulc variables are neither correlated within each other nor with the selected bioclimatic variables see pearson correlation coefficients in table 3 in supplementary material in total five bioclimatic variables and seven lulc classes were selected for modelling the potential distribution of the twenty five bee species 2 2 3 habitat filter variables we used the atkis version 2012 authoritative topographic and cartographic information system the official topographic information system for germany and the invekos version 2010 integrated administration and control system datasets to build our species specific habitat filters the atkis dataset is originally mapped at a scale of 1 25 000 and describes 182 object classes that belong to artificial surfaces traffic vegetated areas mainly agricultural forest and natural areas water bodies and relief such as dams cliffs dunes the invekos dataset was used to obtain landscape elements such as hedgerows and tree rows for the csa for both datasets the spatial resolution depends on the feature classes and has a mmu between 0 1 and 1 hectare bach et al 2006 the atkis invekos datasets was used to map bee species habitat as described by westrich 2018 to our knowledge it is the most appropriate way to map bee species habitat at a high thematical and spatial resolution in our csa though the latest generation of satellite products may allow to map lulc at a high resolution and to describe the presence of landscape elements at european scale this data is not available yet we created a habitat filter for each of the twenty five selected bee species by keeping only the lulc classes described as potential habitats table 4 in the supplementary material 2 3 model calibration and evaluation 2 3 1 conceptual model we aimed at developing a species centred approach based on the ecosystem services providers esp concept i e species functional groups species communities or habitats that produce ecosystem services kremen et al 2007 in our model the esp are wild bees that provide pollination ecosystem services the conceptual framework fig 2 is inspired by the ecological production function framework from kremen et al 2007 key elements for species geographical distribution depend on the spatial scale of the influencing factors pearson and dawson 2003 thuiller 2004 milbau et al 2009 hortal et al 2010 at the global scale species occurrence is governed by bioclimatic and land cover variables fig 2a hegland et al 2009 for bee species distribution drivers at the global scale are not yet well understood bystriakova et al 2018 while local determinants are relatively well known and mainly depend on the presence of nesting places and floral resources at the local scale which define the habitat of a species fig 2b westrich 2018 the analysis of the role of different environmental drivers at their operating scales is required to appropriately predict wild bee occurrences at the local scale we therefore use a hierarchical framework that builds on the work of milbau et al 2009 environmental drivers operating at large scales are used to predict species distribution using sdms and the outputs are combined with a species specific habitat suitability filter to refine the suitability maps at the local scale the pollination efficiency of each species depends on life history traits such as morphology and behaviour willcox et al 2017 one important trait for the pollination of crops is the foraging range fig 2c because it determines the distance over which pollen can be transported and if crop fields or target plants are reachable for the different species the pollination potential is defined as the sum of each predicted species probability of presence combined with foraging distances the pollination ecosystem service potential on crop fields was restricted to the probability of presence of crop pollinators on potential pollination dependant fields fig 2d 2 3 2 species distribution model species distribution modelling was carried out with the biomod2 v 3 4 6 library thuiller et al 2016 implemented in r version 4 0 3 r core team 2017 all maps were created using arcgis version 10 6 1 occurrence data from gbif are typically presence only data with no recorded absence data whereas the algorithms used for modelling need presence absence points so pseudo absence points were generated with the following approach several sets of pseudo absence data were generated to prevent sampling bias and to be able to test the effect of each pseudo absence selection on the predictive ability of the model following phillips et al 2009 we restricted the selection of the background points in a 10 km buffered convex hull around the gbif andrena records to reflect species sampling bias one thousand pseudo absence data points were sampled randomly from the background region and we repeated the random selection ten times to build a ten fold internal cross validation of the models phillips et al 2009 barbet massin et al 2012 we chose to combine different algorithms with ensemble modelling as no statistical tools will per se perform better than any other elith and leathwick 2009 aguirre gutiérrez et al 2013 araújo et al 2019 and as predictions based on an ensemble of several algorithms are often more robust than predictions derived from a single model araújo and new 2007 araújo et al 2019 for each bee species model we used three different algorithms generalized linear model glm a flexible regression model allowing to handle non normally distributed response variables flexible discriminant analysis fda a flexible classification approach derived from linear discriminant analysis methods and random forest a bagging approach to train the sdms and test their predictive performances we used a cross validation with a random subset of 70 of the points to calibrate the model for every single species while the remaining 30 of the points were used for validation each single model was run on the training data and evaluated on the test data using performance evaluation metrics this process was repeated four times with different partitioning of the original dataset into a training and a test set cross validation was used to decrease bias in the predictive performance of the measuring models pearce and ferrier 2000 we used different performance evaluation metrics area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic roc plot true skills statistics tss and the continuous boyce index cbi auc is a threshold independent model evaluation indicator franklin 2010 which continuously discriminates between suitable and unsuitable habitats independently of prevalence of target species elith and burgman 2002 it plots the commission error against omission error and ranges between 0 5 and 1 where 1 represents a perfect discrimination between presence and absence and 0 5 represents a random fit tss is a threshold dependant measure of model accuracy and contrary to auc is based on binary predictions of predicted suitability unsuitability for each species allouche et al 2006 it ranges from 1 to 1 with 1 indicating perfect agreement between predictions and observations and 0 or less indicating an agreement no better than a random classification zhang et al 2015 this metric is negatively related to species prevalence allouche et al 2006 contrary to auc and tss cbi does not require absence data and is therefore considered as more appropriate when working with presence only data the metric measures how observed presences are distributed across the gradient of predicted presences and how this differs from a random distribution it also varies from 1 to 1 where positive values indicate a good agreement between predictions and the distribution of presences in the evaluation dataset values close to zero indicate predictions not different from a random distribution and negative values indicate incorrect models hirzel et al 2006 one of the main challenges in modelling pollination potential is that each pollinator species has its specific potential geographical range and habitat needs so each species needs to be modelled independently for each bee species a total of 120 models was built using three algorithms four cross validations to sample test and training data and ten pseudo absences samplings only models with a tss greater or equal to 0 6 were kept to build the final ensemble landis and koch 1977 ensemble predictions were calculated as weighted averages of single model predictions with weights assigned to each modelling technique using the tss allouche et al 2006 to ensure transparency and reproducibility of our sdms we included an overview data model assessment and prediction odmap protocol from zurell et al 2020 in the supplementary material 2 3 3 habitat filter the next step was to combine the sdm ensemble models with the corresponding habitat filters for each modelled bee species into a unique predicted distribution or environmental suitability map for the csa fig 2b to do so for each species and each grid cell of the csa we multiplied the species distribution prediction and the binary habitat filter values the resulting maps represent the suitability of the area to support the different bee species according to its environmental conditions and the presence of potential habitats for each species 2 3 4 foraging range as bees are central place foragers their foraging ranges determine their capacity to pollinate and to potentially increase the yield of adjacent crop fields the foraging ranges of the species were added to the model to determine the final pollination potential map fig 2c foraging distances are species specific and are a function of the intertegular distance i e the distance between the wing attachment points on either side of the thorax greenleaf et al 2007 kendall et al 2019 implemented the pollimetry v 1 0 1 library which allows to calculate foraging distances based on intertegular measurements of bees and provide the resulting database intertegular measurements of 4035 bee specimens we used this package in r to estimate the average foraging range of the twenty five selected bee species when no data were found we used the average of all foraging ranges over the andrena genus foraging range values are presented in table 5 in the supplementary material using the raster v3 4 5 package hijmans et al 2013 we then implemented a circular moving window with a focal corresponding to the average foraging distance of each bee species for each grid cell of the csa the pollination potentials were computed based on the foraging ranges and the suitability of the area to support the different bee species 2 3 5 relative pollination potential the total pollination potential of the csa was calculated as the sum of the pollination potential of each species determined in the previous step we made the assumption that local species communities are made of species with the same environmental requirements and we neglected macroecological controls on community assembly such as competition and synergies between species guisan and rahbek 2011 we chose to work with occurrence probability maps and not with binary presence absence maps as calabrese et al 2014 and d amen et al 2015 showed that the addition of predictions of occurrence probabilities from individual sdms is preferable to setting arbitrary thresholds to obtain binary predictions and then combining those into a stacked sdm as this tend to be biased and overpredict of species richness the resulting map represents the relative pollination potential of the area i e the potential of the area to sustain pollination from the selected andrena species 2 3 6 comparison with independent field data in the csa flower visiting insects were collected using one yellow pan trap in 12 rapeseed fields between may 4th to june 6th 2018 traps were set up at one border of each field close to a near natural habitat such as hedgerows or forests with their tops approximately even with the surrounding oilseed rape flowers the traps were filled with diluted detergent solution and emptied weekly all bees were identified to species level the trap locations were selected to cover the landscape diversity in the csa from locations surrounded by a landscape with a high proportion of near natural habitats to locations with a low proportion of near natural habitats we used linear regression to assess whether the pollination model outputs reflect the pollinator community abundance and species richness collected in the field we compared the abundance and richness of oilseed rape pollinators from the andrena genus from the collected data with the predicted pollination potential we also compared andrena species richness from the collected data with the predicted richness of andrena species obtained with the model the sum of all the predicted suitability using the sdms and the habitat filters fig 2b in the workflow for this comparison we calculated the mean predicted species richness for all pixels within a radius of 200 300 and 500 m radius of trap locations 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the evaluation scores of all ensemble models were high to very high roc between 0 892 and 0 978 tss between 0 623 and 0 887 and cbi between 0 965 and 1 which means that the predictive accuracies of the models were good to very good an overview of all these performances measures can be found in table 7 in the supplementary material the importance of each predictor for each species model varied with the tested algorithms and modelled species bioclimatic variables indicated a higher percentage of the data variances than lulc variables bio 2 mean diurnal range bio 11 mean temperature of coldest quarter and bio 7 temperature annual range appear to be generally the most important variables followed by bio 19 precipitation of coldest quarter and bio 14 precipitation of driest month lulc variables have a more minor importance for the models and generally only few categories are relevant for each species discontinuous urban fabric is overall the most important lulc variable followed by non irrigated arable land and sparsely vegetated areas table 6 in the supplementary material 3 2 species distribution models figs 3 and 4 illustrate the different results for two species andrena barbilabris and andrena carantonica the predicted presence of each species is determined through a sdm at the european scale figs 3 and 4 b based on occurrence data figs 3 and 4 a even at the local scale of the csa we obtained different distribution predictions for each species for instance the model predicted that overall the area is slightly more suitable for a carantonica than for a barbilabris figs 3 and 4 c habitat filtering was done with a buffer of 2 km around the csa to account for foraging distances and the possibility that bees can nest outside and forage inside the csa figs 3 and 4 d the differences in the final predicted presence of species were also due to habitat preferences of each species for instance a carantonica has a wider range of potential habitats and a broader distribution over the csa than a barbilabris a carantonica has a wider foraging range than a barbilabris 700 m compared to 200 m which also explains the differences in species respective pollination potential in the final maps figs 3 and 4 e 3 3 potential pollination map for the csa the model predicted the csa as suitable for all the target species the predicted pollination service potential sum of the pollination potential of all target wild bee species scores from 0 none of the modelled species is potentially present to 15 highest predicted scores when adding the pollination service potential of the twenty five wild bee species for each grid cell see fig 2 in the supplementary material areas where none of the species is potentially present have no potential pollination ecosystem service performed by the selected and modelled species whereas a high predicted landscape suitability and wild bee species richness increase the pollination service potential of the area fig 5 compares the predicted spatial patterns of oilseed rape pollinators and the potential pollination ecosystem service demand for oilseed rape the main pollination dependant crop in the csa estimated with the atkis invekos arable land lulc class the location of rapeseed fields generally changes annually as a result of crop rotation changing market prices and changes in political schemes and subsidies the demand for pollination ecosystem services will therefore change annually and can potentially occur on all arable fields this is why we did not directly map rapeseed fields and assumed that it could potentially grow on every arable field for this analysis we restricted the pool of modelled wild bee species to oilseed rape flowers visitors as documented in table 1 in the supplementary material our model predicted that most of the fields have a low pollination potential and the mean pollination potential value on arable fields was 1 5 the model predicted low mean pollination ecosystem service potentials particularly the north eastern part of the csa e g in fig 5 c fields with relatively high mean pollination ecosystem service potentials are more evenly distributed over the csa 3 4 comparison with independent field data yellow pan traps captured 801 individual bees from 42 different species from the collected wild bees 681 were from the genus andrena from 19 different species form the genus andrena 576 individuals were known oilseed rape flower visitors from 9 different species abundance and richness of oilseed rape visitors from the genus andrena increased with the predicted pollination service potential r 0 28 d f 10 p 0 07 and r 0 29 d f 10 p 0 07 however not significantly fig 6 a and b oilseed rape visitor richness increased with the mean predicted pollinator richness within a radius of 500 m r 0 28 d f 10 p 0 07 not shown here 300 m r 0 38 d f 10 p 0 03 and 200 m r 0 48 d f 10 p 0 01 fig 6 c and d 4 discussion we have predicted the current potential occurrence of twenty five selected bee species at the local scale in order to estimate the potential pollination ecosystem service supply for pollination dependant crops and wild plants the aim was to develop a model based on peer reviewed knowledge rather than on expert judgement adapted to the region of interest and its bioclimatic conditions and with consideration to the availability of foraging resources and nesting places for which a fine resolution is needed one further novelty of the developed method is that it combines environmental drivers at larger and local spatial scales and thereby goes beyond existing pollination models which typically focus on one scale despite the importance of integrating environmental drivers at multiple geographical scales milbau et al 2009 mateo et al 2019b 4 1 modelling pollination service potential sdms results highlighted the role of bioclimatic factors in bee species occurrence at continental to local scales as previously illustrated by polce et al 2013 nogué et al 2016 polce et al 2018 and bystriakova et al 2018 this is indicated by the predicted suitability maps figs 3b 4b sdms predicted that the suitability for a carantonica and a barbilabris is highly variable across europe countries and we also obtained different predictions at the local scale figs 3c 4c as the estimap and invest models only express the relative suitability for pollinators in terms of availability of floral resources and nesting sites lonsdorf et al 2009 zulian et al 2013 they neglect the variability of bee species distributions due to bioclimatic factors to our knowledge no study has yet assessed these models in regard to the use or non use bioclimatic factors furthermore sdms provide an effective alternative to local expert opinion on species potential occurrence gastón et al 2014 and can be used to discriminate present from absent species in a given location in addition as the modelling framework allows to assess the relative importance of environmental variables on different species it can be also used to analyse the impact of climate and land cover changes on wild bee species and future pollination service potential as they do not account for natural and semi natural areas previous pollination or wild bee species distribution models based on sdms also probably overpredict the distribution of bee species at the local scale polce et al 2013 nogué et al 2016 polce et al 2018 bystriakova et al 2018 these models may therefore significantly overpredict the pollination potential and minimize areas where pollination demand exceeds pollination service potential as only specific areas in croplands provide suitable habitats for wild bee species mainly natural and semi natural habitats westrich 2018 this is particularly problematic when pollination dependant crops are isolated from natural and semi natural habitats ricketts et al 2008 garibaldi et al 2011 the importance of the presence of natural and semi natural areas at small spatial scales within agricultural landscapes for wild pollinator species has been described in many studies gathmann and tscharntke 2002 zurbuchen et al 2010 ricketts et al 2008 kennedy et al 2013 and is also supported by our results this is indicated by the differences between the predicted suitability and pollination potential maps figs 3 4 our results of sdms predict that the whole csa is highly suitable for a carantonica and a barbilabris whereas their final suitable areas are much more restricted when accounting for habitat availability this is consistent with fournier et al 2017 and hattab et al 2014 which also found that adding species specific habitat filters greatly refined habitat suitability for terrestrial and marine species as it integrates information on drivers operating across different scales our multi scale approach should provide more accurate predictions and a better understanding of processes underlying species distribution compared to single scale models pearson et al 2004 mateo et al 2019b mateo et al 2019a bellamy et al 2020 fournier et al 2017 despite the low number of sampling sites and the restricted sampling period during the mass flowering of oilseed rape our model correlated fairly well with the data observed in the field the model was able to predict a significant proportion of the variation in oilseed rape pollinator richness from independent data oilseed rape pollinator richness and abundance from the collected data were also correlated with the predicted pollination service potential however with no significance this analysis can be considered as a first approach to evaluating the model results but not yet a validation of our model due to the small number of sampling sites and the absence of replication 4 2 limitations and uncertainties of the study the presented approach comes with several modelling limitations first the performance of each sdm is constrained by the quantity and quality of the gbif occurrence data in principle the performance of each sdm can be improved by including more species occurrence data for the selected bee species gbif occurrence data are particularly biased towards higher occurrences in northern european countries including great britain sweden belgium and germany which may make the outputs of the sdms less reliable for regions with very different bioclimatic conditions such as southern european countries this is however less problematic in the studied csa located in northern germany second our model might overpredict single species occurrences because there is no limit on the number of species that can occupy a given area i e the carrying capacity of ecosystems is not considered in sdm approaches graham and hijmans 2006 thuiller et al 2015 this is particularly the case when interactions between species competition parasitism mutualism predator prey strongly influence species co occurrences and can exclude species from a community for instance honeybees have been reported to negatively impact the presence of wild bees because of their density and their outstanding foraging capacity thomson 2004 hudewenz and klein 2013 although this is debatable greenleaf and kremen 2006b westrich 2018 one way to account for biotic interactions in sdms is to test models residual for evidence of species interaction using joint species distribution models jsdms pollock et al 2014 using jsdms instead of sdms may increase the explanatory power when modelling pollinator communities however when restricted to relatively few species the present model should not lead to an overprediction of the local pollination potential our habitat filter is based on the work from westrich 2018 which gathered knowledge on wild bees in germany based on more than 3000 scientific publications as habitat preference of wild bee species may be different in other countries the habitat filter should be adapted to local characteristics when using the model in other regions of the world we found that two precipitation variables and three temperature related variables were the most important for predicting the potential distribution of bee species over europe precipitation of the coldest quarter and of the driest month temperature annual range mean temperature of coldest quarter and mean diurnal range these variables all have a direct or indirect ecological implication that can be explained precipitation and temperature extremes affect nesting suitability foraging behaviour and resource availability low temperature and high precipitation values might have a higher impact on the presence of bees during their active season principally spring and early summer by directly reducing their foraging capacity instead of using bioclimatic variables from worldclim sdm predictions might be improved by using temperature and precipitation values restricted to each respective bee active season we found that lulc variables have a much lower impact on species distribution except discontinuous urban fabric non irrigated arable land and sparsely vegetated areas for some species and depending on the algorithm these results on the relative importance of environmental data for predicting bee species distribution are comparable to polce et al 2013 but not bystriakova et al 2018 nor polce et al 2018 this may be due to the selected bee species as the latter two studies were calibrated with bumblebee species or bees of the subfamily colletinae whereas the study from polce et al 2013 was calibrated with species from different genera including some andrena species besides polce et al 2013 found that the use of pesticides plays a significant role in bee distribution as there is growing evidence that pesticides inputs can have a considerable negative impact on wild bee species brittain et al 2010 whitehorn et al 2012 this variable should be used when available to refine the different sdms effective pollination depends on the pollination effectiveness or performance of each species which in turn depends on a broad range of factors e g pollinator morphology and behaviour flower visitation rates pollen deposition but also plant health willcox et al 2017 there is growing evidence that not all species are equally important for the pollination of a given crop kleijn et al 2015 winfree et al 2015 or wild plant species gorenflo et al 2017 empirical data linking yield gain specifically to one pollinator taxon are however still scarce but see rader et al 2009 and jauker et al 2011 so we did not include information about pollination efficiency of each wild bee species in our model furthermore there are a wide range of community level factors that may influence pollination efficiency such as species interactions and niche complementarity willcox et al 2017 instead we assumed that the pollination ecosystem service potential of an area increases with the likelihood of the presence of bees and bee species richness which is supported by klein et al 2009 garibaldi et al 2011 and woodcock et al 2019 accounting for functional diversity and specifically choosing bee species with a high functional divergence characterised by non overlapping traits could however greatly improve the informative value of pollination models and allows to ultimately link crop pollination service potential to service provision and contribution to crop yield seed quality and eventually economic return woodcock et al 2019 gagic et al 2015 building on woodcock et al 2019 the framework could be further improved by adding an extra step converting species probability of presence into a functional divergence index i e a composite index derived from species effect traits that play an important role for the pollination of the considered crops whenever this data is available to do this the function divergence index from woodcock et al 2019 or a similar composite of traits influencing species pollination efficiency could be included in step c fig 2 of the framework along with the foraging range a trait which is already accounted for in the model similarly including information about temporal dynamics particularly about bee flight seasons can further increase the robustness of the model predictions this could be done by adding flighting season filters similar to the habitat filters between step b and c fig 2 of the framework and running the model for each month of the crop flowering season to estimate the monthly pollination service potential throughout the entire crop flowering season this will allow to assess whether the entire crop flowering time is covered by a high pollination potential or if there is a temporal mismatch between es demand and potential lastly the presented pollination potential maps are based on solely one genus andrena and twenty five species whereas around 300 species have been observed in the region of which only 110 species are not threatened by extinction nor are already extinct van der smissen 2001 as we selected species from the genus andrena and only species that are soil nesting and solitary the results certainly do not represent each single bee species occurring in the region for a better wild bee species richness assessment other genera should be included in the model for instance above ground nesting bees and species with different degrees of sociality are not represented in our model including bees with these characteristics could have an impact on the resulting pollination potential maps if sociality and nesting requirements play a major role in species distribution the selected bees are nevertheless suitable for pollination potential modelling as they represent a highly variable group due to their varied size seasonality soil preference for nesting and foraging behaviour and as the vast majority of wild bees are soil nesting and solitary westrich 2018 4 3 applications the pollination potential maps in the studied csa can help to assess the needs for practical conservation measures to promote insect pollinators in agri environmental schemes spatially explicit maps of the pollination potential in comparison to maps of pollination demand will allow the identification of areas where pollination service is deficient the resulting maps can support land management recommendations such as where to prioritize habitat conservation measures in agricultural landscapes to sustain biodiversity ecosystem functions and services that support crop production one advantage of the developed model is the combination of sdms and species specific habitat filters this can help to develop relevant habitats for species for which large scale factors such as climatic parameters are also suitable for example in fig 4 c the dark blue zones indicate a high suitability for a barbilabris however as there are only few potential habitats for this species at these spots the species cannot colonize a large part of these suitable areas these areas could thus be potential targets for a barbilabris conservation measures such as the inclusion of fallow in the crop rotation pattern conservation measures such as hedgerows field margins and flower strips have been shown to have a positive and significant effect on wild bee abundance and diversity m gonigle et al 2015 particularly for bumblebees pywell et al 2005 carvell et al 2011 pywell et al 2012 this demonstrates the importance of these habitats at the small scale for pollinator community conservation furthermore pywell et al 2012 highlighted the importance of using ecological knowledge of targeted species when designing conservation measures and showed that species specific measures are much more efficient and sustain a higher species richness than generalized conventional conservation measures as climatic factors have a significant effect on the distribution of bees climate change will certainly affect bee distribution in the future and disrupt plant pollinator interactions memmott et al 2007 biesmeijer et al 2006 our results show that the consideration of climatic factors and therefore climate change is essential when developing conservation measures for the long term for pollinator biodiversity and to preserve plant pollinator interactions 5 conclusions to our knowledge this is the first work that developed a framework that predicts geographical patterns of pollinators based on sdm and multi scale environmental drivers to predict pollination ecosystem service potential at the local scale the results of the different models show that the framework can be adapted for a local scale assessment this approach allowed us to predict the pollination potential from mining bee species and to identify areas with high or low pollination ecosystem services potential the comparison with independent samples showed good agreement between the model outcomes and species occurrence data collected in the field the developed model can support land use decisions but also help to identify conservation measures and areas for prioritizing species conservation planning this method is transferable to other european regions and other countries in the world provided that they have enough species occurrence data it can also be used to investigate the effect of climate and land use changes on pollinators distribution and pollination potential and help to implement mitigation measures for vulnerable areas and species

24656,wild bees play a major role in the cultivation of crops for human use in the reproduction of many wild plants and are a key component of biodiversity mainly due to human activities wild bees like other insects face a rapid decline in europe understanding species distribution can help to design efficient conservation measures species distribution can also be used to estimate pollination ecosystem service potential which can benefit the production of crops relying on pollination and the reproduction of wild plant communities the presence of pollinators depends on a combination of environmental and biotic factors each playing a determining role at different spatial scales we therefore developed a model composed as a hierarchical framework for environmental predictors climatic data and land use land cover lulc variables at the european scale and species specific habitat information at the local scale the model combines the advantages of two different existing approaches pollinator species distribution predictions based on their environmental requirements and knowledge on bee species life history traits and habitats this paper presents the predicted distribution of twenty five wild bee species of the andrena genus in an agricultural region in northern germany we used oilseed rape pollinators as a case study and compared the potential pollination services to the potential demand in the case study area the developed framework allows to determine the capacity of landscapes to support pollination ecosystem services from wild bees at the local scale which can support the identification of vulnerable areas and the design of local scale measures for habitat improvement and for conservation the hierarchical approach leaves potential for further adaptations in order to improve the prediction of wild bee species dynamics and factors influencing their spatial distribution keywords species richness ensemble species distribution models wild bee species ecosystem service providers species specific habitat filter 1 introduction pollination is a key ecosystem service vital to both wild plants and cultivated crops klein et al 2007 gallai et al 2009 estimated that 10 of the total economic value of food production in europe depends upon insect pollination there is growing evidence that wild bees play a significant role in crop pollination javorek et al 2002 greenleaf and kremen 2006a klein et al 2007 bommarco et al 2012 garibaldi et al 2013 and that the pollination service delivered by wild pollinators cannot entirely be substituted by honeybees brittain et al 2013 garibaldi et al 2013 an increasing number of insect pollinators are in decline or threatened mainly because of anthropogenic stressors such as environmental pollution land use change and agricultural intensification but also climate change winfree et al 2009 potts et al 2010 cameron et al 2011 ollerton et al 2014 nieto et al 2014 this decline of pollinating species will not only have an impact on agricultural productivity and resilience ipbes 2016 it can also lead to a parallel decline of wild plant species biesmeijer et al 2006 as globally estimated 85 of flowering plants 78 in temperate zones are adapted to animal pollination ollerton et al 2011 mainly to bees potts et al 2010 therefore ongoing declines in pollinator diversity may result in community cascade effects i e the subsequent loss of other species that directly or indirectly rely upon extinct or declining species chapin et al 1997 this in turn can have an impact on wild food fibre and medicine supplies as well as decrease the cultural and aesthetic values of a landscape ipbes 2016 in light of these observations there are increasing calls and efforts to conserve wild pollinator species and their habitats ipbes 2016 an effective biodiversity conservation policy should provide a clear guidance to planning authorities on how to develop targeted species specific conservation options for organisms that contribute to pollination services at relevant scales kremen et al 2007 to this end there is a need for better spatial assessments of pollination understanding spatial patterns of pollinators is also crucial for estimating their availability to pollinate cultivated crops and wild plants kremen et al 2004 to facilitate monitoring and inform on the habitats and vulnerability of local pollinators kremen et al 2007 kremen and chaplin kramer 2007 up to now the main approaches for building pollinator ecosystem service maps are by using invest integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs sharp et al 2016 and estimap ecosystem service mapping tool zulian et al 2013 invest and estimap models are primarily based on expert judgements on the presence and preferences of pollinators essentially nesting places and floral feeding resources the main issues with expert based knowledge are that this knowledge may strongly depend on their selections experience and expertise polce et al 2018 lonsdorf et al 2009 and therefore can be biased towards specific species or species groups fewer studies are based on species distribution models sdms and actual species records polce et al 2013 polce et al 2018 nogué et al 2016 sdms rely on the correlation between environmental variables and geo localized species records to determine the environmental variables that drive species presence and delineate potential species distribution guisan and zimmermann 2000 elith and leathwick 2009 araújo and guisan 2006 contrary to sdms invest and estimap models do not allow to dynamically consider different environmental conditions lonsdorf et al 2009 zulian et al 2013 when mapping pollination ecosystem service potential at national or sub national scales bioclimatic conditions can largely vary and be a major determinant of bee species occurrence conversely existing pollination models based on sdms are at relatively coarse resolution constrained by occurrence data and environmental variables typically available at coarse spatial resolution especially in highly fragmented landscapes this resolution may fail to cover important habitats such as hedgerows small pastures and forests and therefore obtain biased pollinator distribution maps thus to improve our ability to predict pollinator diversity and the associated pollination ecosystem service one possibility could be to combine the advantages of the two different approaches species distribution predictions through sdms and knowledge on bee species life history traits and habitat requirements as implemented in invest and estimap frameworks the aim of this study is to develop a high resolution pollinator species model to predict spatial patterns of pollination ecosystem services potential from wild bees at the local scale hereby we assume that pollinator species richness and landscape suitability are good proxies of pollination service potential this is a common assumption in existing pollination models kremen et al 2007 lonsdorf et al 2009 zulian et al 2013 and is supported by the fact that pollination quantity quality and stability tend to increase in landscapes with a diverse pollinator community klein et al 2007 albrecht et al 2012 dainese et al 2019 the model is used as a tool to provide clear guidance for potential users such as planning authorities on how to optimize conservation measures for wild bee conservation and to inform on how management decisions can affect pollination ecosystem services and therefore pollination dependant crop productivity we apply the model in an agriculture dominated case study area in northern germany to test this approach at the local scale and its applicability for landscape management using selected bee species as an example the approach also allowed us to assess how and which environmental variables affect wild bee species distribution as well as the role of life history traits on their spatial distribution 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study area csa the csa is located in the region of the bornhöved lake district in the federal state of schleswig holstein in northern germany fig 1 the extent of the area is approximately 140 km² agroecosystems dominate the landscape in a catchment area of five glacially formed and consecutively connected lakes the csa shows a suit of habitats with a high proportion of hedges and wall hedges that are characteristic in the province shaping a highly diverse and fragmented landscape see fig 1 and fränzle et al 2008 only small settlements following a north south alignment are located in the csa 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 bees we selected species from the genus andrena also called mining bees as they represent a highly various group including small bees to ones larger than honey bees species that differ in seasonality or soil preference as well as specialists oligolectic and generalist polylectic species this genus of bees is therefore a good representative of a broad range of bee species from the andrena genus we selected species that were identified in the region and documented in the federal red list van der smissen 2001 this step accounts for historical and current dispersal limitations and helps to determine which species in the global source pool could have dispersed to the csa guisan et al 2017 the selected andrena species are listed amongst the most important pollinators for crops in europe particularly of oilseed rape flowers and apple trees klein et al 2007 kleijn et al 2015 or wild flowers westrich 2018 plant families visited by each species are listed in table 1 in the supplementary material we obtained 125 681 presence only records of twenty six wild bees from the global biodiversity information facility 1 1 https www gbif org gbif occurrence records retrieved from gbif were cleaned using the coordinatecleaner v 2 0 14 package zizka et al 2019 occurrences with sea coordinates zero coordinates or without geographic coordinate country mismatches country centroids outlier coordinates and coordinates assigned to biodiversity institutions were excluded we also removed data older than 1950 as old records are more likely to be unreliable maldonado et al 2015 data records with unprecise coordinates and duplicates we also checked for taxonomic errors including spelling mistakes and synonyms to reduce model overfitting derived from spatial autocorrelation and overdominance of specific regions due to sampling bias we then thinned the records using the package spthin v 0 2 0 aiello lammens et al 2015 we only selected species that had more than 50 gbif occurrence records as this is a key criterion for sdm modelling quality guisan et al 2017 after geographic and taxonomic cleaning only 10 928 records of twenty five wild bee species were retained for modelling table 1 in the supplementary material 2 2 2 environmental variables we used bioclimatic and land use land cover lulc data as environmental predictors see table 2 in the supplementary material for a complete list of the environmental variables we first selected the main drivers of species ranges based on knowledge about mechanistic relationship between environmental variables and physiology of the targeted species we further reduced the number of variables as too many variables increase the risk of overfitting and collinearity issues between the variables dormann et al 2013 guisan et al 2017 collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables and can be a problem for parameter estimation as it inflates the variance of regression parameters and potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors therefore reducing the number of environmental variables maximizes the performance of sdms and the accuracy of the predictions araujo and guisan 2006 a principal component analysis pca was used to visualize the correlation between variables to identify the main environmental gradients in the study area and to investigate the distribution of species in the environmental space guisan et al 2017 we conducted our pca using the ade4 v 1 7 16 package from r dray and dufour 2007 we also analysed correlations between environmental variables with a pearson analysis for all bioclimatic and lulc variables only the most relevant uncorrelated variables i e with a pearson s correlation coefficient below 0 7 were finally selected dormann et al 2013 the bioclimatic variables were first selected based on their impact on diurnal foraging activity of bees nesting success and plants availability during active months low temperatures and high precipitation values reduce the number of foraging days and consequently potentially decrease bee fitness westrich 2018 high precipitation values probably impact the nesting success for ground nesters bystriakova et al 2018 extreme temperature and precipitation also indirectly affect bees by impacting the bloom of plants and therefore resource availability nieto et al 2014 climatic data were retrieved from worldclim 2 2 http worldclim org version2 on a 30 second resolution raster grids 1 km2 at the equator from worldclim 2 0 fick and hijmans 2017 from the 19 available climatic variables we first selected the variables expected to be the most causal for the species distribution bio 02 mean diurnal range bio 5 max temperature of warmest month bio 6 min temperature of coldest month bio 7 temperature annual range bio 5 bio 6 bio 8 mean temperature of wettest quarter bio 10 mean temperature of warmest quarter bio 11 mean temperature of coldest quarter bio 14 precipitation of driest month bio 16 precipitation of wettest quarter bio 18 precipitation of warmest quarter and bio 19 precipitation of coldest quarter the results of the pca indicated that from the nine pre selected bioclimatic variables eight were strongly correlated bio 5 bio 6 bio 10 and bio 11 bio 14 and bio 18 as well as bio 19 and bio 16 and one bio 8 did not significantly contribute to the overall environmental variation see fig 1 in the supplementary material we selected bio 19 bio 11 bio 2 bio 7 and bio 14 for the modelling as they are good variables for discriminating between bee species and the rest of the environment in temperate zones wild bee species distribution are influenced by the proportion of heathland woodland grassland and urban areas coverages at the landscape scale senapathi et al 2015 as major threats to wild bees in europe agricultural intensification and expansion pollution and urban sprawl will generally have a negatively impact wild bee species distribution nieto et al 2014 for this study lulc data was derived from the corine coordination of information on the environment land cover 2018 dataset 3 3 https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover clc2018 with a 100 m resolution this dataset is produced by the european environmental agency eea and is composed of 44 different lulc classes belonging to the five main land cover categories artificial surfaces agricultural forest semi natural areas wetlands or water bodies we used the hierarchical level 3 from corine and first aggregated the data in 1 km 1 km grid cells representing the percentage cover of each lulc per 1 km 1 km grid this was a necessary first step to generate a clean data structure for modelling all predictors having the same resolution the resolution of the predicted results is the same as the one of the environmental variables 1 km 1 km we first selected 15 lulc classes based on their ecological relevance continuous urban fabric discontinuous urban fabric road and rail networks and associated land non irrigated arable land pastures complex cultivation patterns broad leaved forest coniferous forest mixed forest natural grasslands moors and heathland transitional woodland shrub sparsely vegetated areas water courses and water bodies we run the complete model a first time to select the most important variables for the select wild bee species distribution this led to the selection of the following lulc variables discontinuous urban fabric non irrigated arable land pastures coniferous forest sparsely vegetated areas water courses and water bodies the selected lulc variables are neither correlated within each other nor with the selected bioclimatic variables see pearson correlation coefficients in table 3 in supplementary material in total five bioclimatic variables and seven lulc classes were selected for modelling the potential distribution of the twenty five bee species 2 2 3 habitat filter variables we used the atkis version 2012 authoritative topographic and cartographic information system the official topographic information system for germany and the invekos version 2010 integrated administration and control system datasets to build our species specific habitat filters the atkis dataset is originally mapped at a scale of 1 25 000 and describes 182 object classes that belong to artificial surfaces traffic vegetated areas mainly agricultural forest and natural areas water bodies and relief such as dams cliffs dunes the invekos dataset was used to obtain landscape elements such as hedgerows and tree rows for the csa for both datasets the spatial resolution depends on the feature classes and has a mmu between 0 1 and 1 hectare bach et al 2006 the atkis invekos datasets was used to map bee species habitat as described by westrich 2018 to our knowledge it is the most appropriate way to map bee species habitat at a high thematical and spatial resolution in our csa though the latest generation of satellite products may allow to map lulc at a high resolution and to describe the presence of landscape elements at european scale this data is not available yet we created a habitat filter for each of the twenty five selected bee species by keeping only the lulc classes described as potential habitats table 4 in the supplementary material 2 3 model calibration and evaluation 2 3 1 conceptual model we aimed at developing a species centred approach based on the ecosystem services providers esp concept i e species functional groups species communities or habitats that produce ecosystem services kremen et al 2007 in our model the esp are wild bees that provide pollination ecosystem services the conceptual framework fig 2 is inspired by the ecological production function framework from kremen et al 2007 key elements for species geographical distribution depend on the spatial scale of the influencing factors pearson and dawson 2003 thuiller 2004 milbau et al 2009 hortal et al 2010 at the global scale species occurrence is governed by bioclimatic and land cover variables fig 2a hegland et al 2009 for bee species distribution drivers at the global scale are not yet well understood bystriakova et al 2018 while local determinants are relatively well known and mainly depend on the presence of nesting places and floral resources at the local scale which define the habitat of a species fig 2b westrich 2018 the analysis of the role of different environmental drivers at their operating scales is required to appropriately predict wild bee occurrences at the local scale we therefore use a hierarchical framework that builds on the work of milbau et al 2009 environmental drivers operating at large scales are used to predict species distribution using sdms and the outputs are combined with a species specific habitat suitability filter to refine the suitability maps at the local scale the pollination efficiency of each species depends on life history traits such as morphology and behaviour willcox et al 2017 one important trait for the pollination of crops is the foraging range fig 2c because it determines the distance over which pollen can be transported and if crop fields or target plants are reachable for the different species the pollination potential is defined as the sum of each predicted species probability of presence combined with foraging distances the pollination ecosystem service potential on crop fields was restricted to the probability of presence of crop pollinators on potential pollination dependant fields fig 2d 2 3 2 species distribution model species distribution modelling was carried out with the biomod2 v 3 4 6 library thuiller et al 2016 implemented in r version 4 0 3 r core team 2017 all maps were created using arcgis version 10 6 1 occurrence data from gbif are typically presence only data with no recorded absence data whereas the algorithms used for modelling need presence absence points so pseudo absence points were generated with the following approach several sets of pseudo absence data were generated to prevent sampling bias and to be able to test the effect of each pseudo absence selection on the predictive ability of the model following phillips et al 2009 we restricted the selection of the background points in a 10 km buffered convex hull around the gbif andrena records to reflect species sampling bias one thousand pseudo absence data points were sampled randomly from the background region and we repeated the random selection ten times to build a ten fold internal cross validation of the models phillips et al 2009 barbet massin et al 2012 we chose to combine different algorithms with ensemble modelling as no statistical tools will per se perform better than any other elith and leathwick 2009 aguirre gutiérrez et al 2013 araújo et al 2019 and as predictions based on an ensemble of several algorithms are often more robust than predictions derived from a single model araújo and new 2007 araújo et al 2019 for each bee species model we used three different algorithms generalized linear model glm a flexible regression model allowing to handle non normally distributed response variables flexible discriminant analysis fda a flexible classification approach derived from linear discriminant analysis methods and random forest a bagging approach to train the sdms and test their predictive performances we used a cross validation with a random subset of 70 of the points to calibrate the model for every single species while the remaining 30 of the points were used for validation each single model was run on the training data and evaluated on the test data using performance evaluation metrics this process was repeated four times with different partitioning of the original dataset into a training and a test set cross validation was used to decrease bias in the predictive performance of the measuring models pearce and ferrier 2000 we used different performance evaluation metrics area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic roc plot true skills statistics tss and the continuous boyce index cbi auc is a threshold independent model evaluation indicator franklin 2010 which continuously discriminates between suitable and unsuitable habitats independently of prevalence of target species elith and burgman 2002 it plots the commission error against omission error and ranges between 0 5 and 1 where 1 represents a perfect discrimination between presence and absence and 0 5 represents a random fit tss is a threshold dependant measure of model accuracy and contrary to auc is based on binary predictions of predicted suitability unsuitability for each species allouche et al 2006 it ranges from 1 to 1 with 1 indicating perfect agreement between predictions and observations and 0 or less indicating an agreement no better than a random classification zhang et al 2015 this metric is negatively related to species prevalence allouche et al 2006 contrary to auc and tss cbi does not require absence data and is therefore considered as more appropriate when working with presence only data the metric measures how observed presences are distributed across the gradient of predicted presences and how this differs from a random distribution it also varies from 1 to 1 where positive values indicate a good agreement between predictions and the distribution of presences in the evaluation dataset values close to zero indicate predictions not different from a random distribution and negative values indicate incorrect models hirzel et al 2006 one of the main challenges in modelling pollination potential is that each pollinator species has its specific potential geographical range and habitat needs so each species needs to be modelled independently for each bee species a total of 120 models was built using three algorithms four cross validations to sample test and training data and ten pseudo absences samplings only models with a tss greater or equal to 0 6 were kept to build the final ensemble landis and koch 1977 ensemble predictions were calculated as weighted averages of single model predictions with weights assigned to each modelling technique using the tss allouche et al 2006 to ensure transparency and reproducibility of our sdms we included an overview data model assessment and prediction odmap protocol from zurell et al 2020 in the supplementary material 2 3 3 habitat filter the next step was to combine the sdm ensemble models with the corresponding habitat filters for each modelled bee species into a unique predicted distribution or environmental suitability map for the csa fig 2b to do so for each species and each grid cell of the csa we multiplied the species distribution prediction and the binary habitat filter values the resulting maps represent the suitability of the area to support the different bee species according to its environmental conditions and the presence of potential habitats for each species 2 3 4 foraging range as bees are central place foragers their foraging ranges determine their capacity to pollinate and to potentially increase the yield of adjacent crop fields the foraging ranges of the species were added to the model to determine the final pollination potential map fig 2c foraging distances are species specific and are a function of the intertegular distance i e the distance between the wing attachment points on either side of the thorax greenleaf et al 2007 kendall et al 2019 implemented the pollimetry v 1 0 1 library which allows to calculate foraging distances based on intertegular measurements of bees and provide the resulting database intertegular measurements of 4035 bee specimens we used this package in r to estimate the average foraging range of the twenty five selected bee species when no data were found we used the average of all foraging ranges over the andrena genus foraging range values are presented in table 5 in the supplementary material using the raster v3 4 5 package hijmans et al 2013 we then implemented a circular moving window with a focal corresponding to the average foraging distance of each bee species for each grid cell of the csa the pollination potentials were computed based on the foraging ranges and the suitability of the area to support the different bee species 2 3 5 relative pollination potential the total pollination potential of the csa was calculated as the sum of the pollination potential of each species determined in the previous step we made the assumption that local species communities are made of species with the same environmental requirements and we neglected macroecological controls on community assembly such as competition and synergies between species guisan and rahbek 2011 we chose to work with occurrence probability maps and not with binary presence absence maps as calabrese et al 2014 and d amen et al 2015 showed that the addition of predictions of occurrence probabilities from individual sdms is preferable to setting arbitrary thresholds to obtain binary predictions and then combining those into a stacked sdm as this tend to be biased and overpredict of species richness the resulting map represents the relative pollination potential of the area i e the potential of the area to sustain pollination from the selected andrena species 2 3 6 comparison with independent field data in the csa flower visiting insects were collected using one yellow pan trap in 12 rapeseed fields between may 4th to june 6th 2018 traps were set up at one border of each field close to a near natural habitat such as hedgerows or forests with their tops approximately even with the surrounding oilseed rape flowers the traps were filled with diluted detergent solution and emptied weekly all bees were identified to species level the trap locations were selected to cover the landscape diversity in the csa from locations surrounded by a landscape with a high proportion of near natural habitats to locations with a low proportion of near natural habitats we used linear regression to assess whether the pollination model outputs reflect the pollinator community abundance and species richness collected in the field we compared the abundance and richness of oilseed rape pollinators from the andrena genus from the collected data with the predicted pollination potential we also compared andrena species richness from the collected data with the predicted richness of andrena species obtained with the model the sum of all the predicted suitability using the sdms and the habitat filters fig 2b in the workflow for this comparison we calculated the mean predicted species richness for all pixels within a radius of 200 300 and 500 m radius of trap locations 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the evaluation scores of all ensemble models were high to very high roc between 0 892 and 0 978 tss between 0 623 and 0 887 and cbi between 0 965 and 1 which means that the predictive accuracies of the models were good to very good an overview of all these performances measures can be found in table 7 in the supplementary material the importance of each predictor for each species model varied with the tested algorithms and modelled species bioclimatic variables indicated a higher percentage of the data variances than lulc variables bio 2 mean diurnal range bio 11 mean temperature of coldest quarter and bio 7 temperature annual range appear to be generally the most important variables followed by bio 19 precipitation of coldest quarter and bio 14 precipitation of driest month lulc variables have a more minor importance for the models and generally only few categories are relevant for each species discontinuous urban fabric is overall the most important lulc variable followed by non irrigated arable land and sparsely vegetated areas table 6 in the supplementary material 3 2 species distribution models figs 3 and 4 illustrate the different results for two species andrena barbilabris and andrena carantonica the predicted presence of each species is determined through a sdm at the european scale figs 3 and 4 b based on occurrence data figs 3 and 4 a even at the local scale of the csa we obtained different distribution predictions for each species for instance the model predicted that overall the area is slightly more suitable for a carantonica than for a barbilabris figs 3 and 4 c habitat filtering was done with a buffer of 2 km around the csa to account for foraging distances and the possibility that bees can nest outside and forage inside the csa figs 3 and 4 d the differences in the final predicted presence of species were also due to habitat preferences of each species for instance a carantonica has a wider range of potential habitats and a broader distribution over the csa than a barbilabris a carantonica has a wider foraging range than a barbilabris 700 m compared to 200 m which also explains the differences in species respective pollination potential in the final maps figs 3 and 4 e 3 3 potential pollination map for the csa the model predicted the csa as suitable for all the target species the predicted pollination service potential sum of the pollination potential of all target wild bee species scores from 0 none of the modelled species is potentially present to 15 highest predicted scores when adding the pollination service potential of the twenty five wild bee species for each grid cell see fig 2 in the supplementary material areas where none of the species is potentially present have no potential pollination ecosystem service performed by the selected and modelled species whereas a high predicted landscape suitability and wild bee species richness increase the pollination service potential of the area fig 5 compares the predicted spatial patterns of oilseed rape pollinators and the potential pollination ecosystem service demand for oilseed rape the main pollination dependant crop in the csa estimated with the atkis invekos arable land lulc class the location of rapeseed fields generally changes annually as a result of crop rotation changing market prices and changes in political schemes and subsidies the demand for pollination ecosystem services will therefore change annually and can potentially occur on all arable fields this is why we did not directly map rapeseed fields and assumed that it could potentially grow on every arable field for this analysis we restricted the pool of modelled wild bee species to oilseed rape flowers visitors as documented in table 1 in the supplementary material our model predicted that most of the fields have a low pollination potential and the mean pollination potential value on arable fields was 1 5 the model predicted low mean pollination ecosystem service potentials particularly the north eastern part of the csa e g in fig 5 c fields with relatively high mean pollination ecosystem service potentials are more evenly distributed over the csa 3 4 comparison with independent field data yellow pan traps captured 801 individual bees from 42 different species from the collected wild bees 681 were from the genus andrena from 19 different species form the genus andrena 576 individuals were known oilseed rape flower visitors from 9 different species abundance and richness of oilseed rape visitors from the genus andrena increased with the predicted pollination service potential r 0 28 d f 10 p 0 07 and r 0 29 d f 10 p 0 07 however not significantly fig 6 a and b oilseed rape visitor richness increased with the mean predicted pollinator richness within a radius of 500 m r 0 28 d f 10 p 0 07 not shown here 300 m r 0 38 d f 10 p 0 03 and 200 m r 0 48 d f 10 p 0 01 fig 6 c and d 4 discussion we have predicted the current potential occurrence of twenty five selected bee species at the local scale in order to estimate the potential pollination ecosystem service supply for pollination dependant crops and wild plants the aim was to develop a model based on peer reviewed knowledge rather than on expert judgement adapted to the region of interest and its bioclimatic conditions and with consideration to the availability of foraging resources and nesting places for which a fine resolution is needed one further novelty of the developed method is that it combines environmental drivers at larger and local spatial scales and thereby goes beyond existing pollination models which typically focus on one scale despite the importance of integrating environmental drivers at multiple geographical scales milbau et al 2009 mateo et al 2019b 4 1 modelling pollination service potential sdms results highlighted the role of bioclimatic factors in bee species occurrence at continental to local scales as previously illustrated by polce et al 2013 nogué et al 2016 polce et al 2018 and bystriakova et al 2018 this is indicated by the predicted suitability maps figs 3b 4b sdms predicted that the suitability for a carantonica and a barbilabris is highly variable across europe countries and we also obtained different predictions at the local scale figs 3c 4c as the estimap and invest models only express the relative suitability for pollinators in terms of availability of floral resources and nesting sites lonsdorf et al 2009 zulian et al 2013 they neglect the variability of bee species distributions due to bioclimatic factors to our knowledge no study has yet assessed these models in regard to the use or non use bioclimatic factors furthermore sdms provide an effective alternative to local expert opinion on species potential occurrence gastón et al 2014 and can be used to discriminate present from absent species in a given location in addition as the modelling framework allows to assess the relative importance of environmental variables on different species it can be also used to analyse the impact of climate and land cover changes on wild bee species and future pollination service potential as they do not account for natural and semi natural areas previous pollination or wild bee species distribution models based on sdms also probably overpredict the distribution of bee species at the local scale polce et al 2013 nogué et al 2016 polce et al 2018 bystriakova et al 2018 these models may therefore significantly overpredict the pollination potential and minimize areas where pollination demand exceeds pollination service potential as only specific areas in croplands provide suitable habitats for wild bee species mainly natural and semi natural habitats westrich 2018 this is particularly problematic when pollination dependant crops are isolated from natural and semi natural habitats ricketts et al 2008 garibaldi et al 2011 the importance of the presence of natural and semi natural areas at small spatial scales within agricultural landscapes for wild pollinator species has been described in many studies gathmann and tscharntke 2002 zurbuchen et al 2010 ricketts et al 2008 kennedy et al 2013 and is also supported by our results this is indicated by the differences between the predicted suitability and pollination potential maps figs 3 4 our results of sdms predict that the whole csa is highly suitable for a carantonica and a barbilabris whereas their final suitable areas are much more restricted when accounting for habitat availability this is consistent with fournier et al 2017 and hattab et al 2014 which also found that adding species specific habitat filters greatly refined habitat suitability for terrestrial and marine species as it integrates information on drivers operating across different scales our multi scale approach should provide more accurate predictions and a better understanding of processes underlying species distribution compared to single scale models pearson et al 2004 mateo et al 2019b mateo et al 2019a bellamy et al 2020 fournier et al 2017 despite the low number of sampling sites and the restricted sampling period during the mass flowering of oilseed rape our model correlated fairly well with the data observed in the field the model was able to predict a significant proportion of the variation in oilseed rape pollinator richness from independent data oilseed rape pollinator richness and abundance from the collected data were also correlated with the predicted pollination service potential however with no significance this analysis can be considered as a first approach to evaluating the model results but not yet a validation of our model due to the small number of sampling sites and the absence of replication 4 2 limitations and uncertainties of the study the presented approach comes with several modelling limitations first the performance of each sdm is constrained by the quantity and quality of the gbif occurrence data in principle the performance of each sdm can be improved by including more species occurrence data for the selected bee species gbif occurrence data are particularly biased towards higher occurrences in northern european countries including great britain sweden belgium and germany which may make the outputs of the sdms less reliable for regions with very different bioclimatic conditions such as southern european countries this is however less problematic in the studied csa located in northern germany second our model might overpredict single species occurrences because there is no limit on the number of species that can occupy a given area i e the carrying capacity of ecosystems is not considered in sdm approaches graham and hijmans 2006 thuiller et al 2015 this is particularly the case when interactions between species competition parasitism mutualism predator prey strongly influence species co occurrences and can exclude species from a community for instance honeybees have been reported to negatively impact the presence of wild bees because of their density and their outstanding foraging capacity thomson 2004 hudewenz and klein 2013 although this is debatable greenleaf and kremen 2006b westrich 2018 one way to account for biotic interactions in sdms is to test models residual for evidence of species interaction using joint species distribution models jsdms pollock et al 2014 using jsdms instead of sdms may increase the explanatory power when modelling pollinator communities however when restricted to relatively few species the present model should not lead to an overprediction of the local pollination potential our habitat filter is based on the work from westrich 2018 which gathered knowledge on wild bees in germany based on more than 3000 scientific publications as habitat preference of wild bee species may be different in other countries the habitat filter should be adapted to local characteristics when using the model in other regions of the world we found that two precipitation variables and three temperature related variables were the most important for predicting the potential distribution of bee species over europe precipitation of the coldest quarter and of the driest month temperature annual range mean temperature of coldest quarter and mean diurnal range these variables all have a direct or indirect ecological implication that can be explained precipitation and temperature extremes affect nesting suitability foraging behaviour and resource availability low temperature and high precipitation values might have a higher impact on the presence of bees during their active season principally spring and early summer by directly reducing their foraging capacity instead of using bioclimatic variables from worldclim sdm predictions might be improved by using temperature and precipitation values restricted to each respective bee active season we found that lulc variables have a much lower impact on species distribution except discontinuous urban fabric non irrigated arable land and sparsely vegetated areas for some species and depending on the algorithm these results on the relative importance of environmental data for predicting bee species distribution are comparable to polce et al 2013 but not bystriakova et al 2018 nor polce et al 2018 this may be due to the selected bee species as the latter two studies were calibrated with bumblebee species or bees of the subfamily colletinae whereas the study from polce et al 2013 was calibrated with species from different genera including some andrena species besides polce et al 2013 found that the use of pesticides plays a significant role in bee distribution as there is growing evidence that pesticides inputs can have a considerable negative impact on wild bee species brittain et al 2010 whitehorn et al 2012 this variable should be used when available to refine the different sdms effective pollination depends on the pollination effectiveness or performance of each species which in turn depends on a broad range of factors e g pollinator morphology and behaviour flower visitation rates pollen deposition but also plant health willcox et al 2017 there is growing evidence that not all species are equally important for the pollination of a given crop kleijn et al 2015 winfree et al 2015 or wild plant species gorenflo et al 2017 empirical data linking yield gain specifically to one pollinator taxon are however still scarce but see rader et al 2009 and jauker et al 2011 so we did not include information about pollination efficiency of each wild bee species in our model furthermore there are a wide range of community level factors that may influence pollination efficiency such as species interactions and niche complementarity willcox et al 2017 instead we assumed that the pollination ecosystem service potential of an area increases with the likelihood of the presence of bees and bee species richness which is supported by klein et al 2009 garibaldi et al 2011 and woodcock et al 2019 accounting for functional diversity and specifically choosing bee species with a high functional divergence characterised by non overlapping traits could however greatly improve the informative value of pollination models and allows to ultimately link crop pollination service potential to service provision and contribution to crop yield seed quality and eventually economic return woodcock et al 2019 gagic et al 2015 building on woodcock et al 2019 the framework could be further improved by adding an extra step converting species probability of presence into a functional divergence index i e a composite index derived from species effect traits that play an important role for the pollination of the considered crops whenever this data is available to do this the function divergence index from woodcock et al 2019 or a similar composite of traits influencing species pollination efficiency could be included in step c fig 2 of the framework along with the foraging range a trait which is already accounted for in the model similarly including information about temporal dynamics particularly about bee flight seasons can further increase the robustness of the model predictions this could be done by adding flighting season filters similar to the habitat filters between step b and c fig 2 of the framework and running the model for each month of the crop flowering season to estimate the monthly pollination service potential throughout the entire crop flowering season this will allow to assess whether the entire crop flowering time is covered by a high pollination potential or if there is a temporal mismatch between es demand and potential lastly the presented pollination potential maps are based on solely one genus andrena and twenty five species whereas around 300 species have been observed in the region of which only 110 species are not threatened by extinction nor are already extinct van der smissen 2001 as we selected species from the genus andrena and only species that are soil nesting and solitary the results certainly do not represent each single bee species occurring in the region for a better wild bee species richness assessment other genera should be included in the model for instance above ground nesting bees and species with different degrees of sociality are not represented in our model including bees with these characteristics could have an impact on the resulting pollination potential maps if sociality and nesting requirements play a major role in species distribution the selected bees are nevertheless suitable for pollination potential modelling as they represent a highly variable group due to their varied size seasonality soil preference for nesting and foraging behaviour and as the vast majority of wild bees are soil nesting and solitary westrich 2018 4 3 applications the pollination potential maps in the studied csa can help to assess the needs for practical conservation measures to promote insect pollinators in agri environmental schemes spatially explicit maps of the pollination potential in comparison to maps of pollination demand will allow the identification of areas where pollination service is deficient the resulting maps can support land management recommendations such as where to prioritize habitat conservation measures in agricultural landscapes to sustain biodiversity ecosystem functions and services that support crop production one advantage of the developed model is the combination of sdms and species specific habitat filters this can help to develop relevant habitats for species for which large scale factors such as climatic parameters are also suitable for example in fig 4 c the dark blue zones indicate a high suitability for a barbilabris however as there are only few potential habitats for this species at these spots the species cannot colonize a large part of these suitable areas these areas could thus be potential targets for a barbilabris conservation measures such as the inclusion of fallow in the crop rotation pattern conservation measures such as hedgerows field margins and flower strips have been shown to have a positive and significant effect on wild bee abundance and diversity m gonigle et al 2015 particularly for bumblebees pywell et al 2005 carvell et al 2011 pywell et al 2012 this demonstrates the importance of these habitats at the small scale for pollinator community conservation furthermore pywell et al 2012 highlighted the importance of using ecological knowledge of targeted species when designing conservation measures and showed that species specific measures are much more efficient and sustain a higher species richness than generalized conventional conservation measures as climatic factors have a significant effect on the distribution of bees climate change will certainly affect bee distribution in the future and disrupt plant pollinator interactions memmott et al 2007 biesmeijer et al 2006 our results show that the consideration of climatic factors and therefore climate change is essential when developing conservation measures for the long term for pollinator biodiversity and to preserve plant pollinator interactions 5 conclusions to our knowledge this is the first work that developed a framework that predicts geographical patterns of pollinators based on sdm and multi scale environmental drivers to predict pollination ecosystem service potential at the local scale the results of the different models show that the framework can be adapted for a local scale assessment this approach allowed us to predict the pollination potential from mining bee species and to identify areas with high or low pollination ecosystem services potential the comparison with independent samples showed good agreement between the model outcomes and species occurrence data collected in the field the developed model can support land use decisions but also help to identify conservation measures and areas for prioritizing species conservation planning this method is transferable to other european regions and other countries in the world provided that they have enough species occurrence data it can also be used to investigate the effect of climate and land use changes on pollinators distribution and pollination potential and help to implement mitigation measures for vulnerable areas and species

24657,the development of models to elucidate the transmission pathways and dynamics of wildlife diseases remains challenging sylvatic plague caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis yp is an infectious zoonotic disease that primarily affects wild rodents including prairie dogs cynomys spp in north america proposed transmission pathways for yp include flea bites direct contacts between hosts and environmental reservoirs e g soil carcasses we developed a spatially explicit agent based model of yp transmission to explore the effects of alternative transmission pathways different disease initiation mechanisms host or fleas parameter uncertainty and spatial structure of hosts a particularly novel aspect of our model was the integration of ecological models with traditional disease models specifically we used estimates from spatial capture recapture models to generate data driven spatial distributions densities and contact rates to capture the spatial structure of prairie dogs we simulated 9 million scenarios across a wide range of parameter values and conducted sensitivity analyses to determine the most influential parameters on the number of flea days sum of the mean number of fleas on hosts each day of the simulation number of newly infected hosts per day the time to depopulation 20 prairie dogs remaining and the proportion of the prairie dog population remaining at the end of the simulation after 150 days when including spatial structure we found the probability of transmission via environmental sources of yp i e carcasses had the greatest influence on model results when yp infection was initiated in prairie dog hosts rather than in fleas conversely the mechanism of transmission by fleas to prairie dogs had the greatest influence on model results when yp infection was initiated in fleas i e via introduction by carnivores a migrant prairie dog or other mammalian host uncertainty in parameter estimates particularly those related to the transmission pathways of yp continue to hamper efforts to realistically model plague dynamics in wild rodents our results elucidate the complexity of the flea plague prairie dog system and reiterate the importance of research on yp transmission mechanisms to provide a full understanding of this disease our results also emphasize the importance of realistic estimates of spatial structure for exploring transmission dynamics of wildlife diseases and provide a framework for generating a data driven description of spatial structure keywords cynomys spp disease modeling fleas plague prairie dogs vector borne diseases wildlife 1 introduction modeling infectious diseases of wildlife remains challenging due to difficulties identifying and measuring the relative importance of pathogen reservoirs transmission pathways including host to host reservoirs and vectors huyvaert et al 2018 and infectious contact rates among hosts craft 2015 silk et al 2017 estimating infectious contacts can be extremely resource intensive and accounting for unobserved members of a population are problematic for standard analytical procedures such as social networks perkins et al 2009 silk et al 2017 a potentially novel solution to this problem is to leverage ecological models royle et al 2013 to provide data driven estimates of the spatial structure of host animals as well as other important disease parameters and to integrate these estimates into models of disease transmission in wildlife specifically we estimated both host density and mean spatial range of individuals using spatial capture recapture scr analyses borchers and efford 2008 royle et al 2013 and used these parameters to derive empirical estimates of host contact rates within an agent based model that examines the relative importance of various transmission pathways we apply our modeling approach to the prairie dog plague system which is likely influenced by host spatial structure as are other wildlife disease systems four species of prairie dogs occur in the western united states including white tailed cynomys leucurus black tailed c ludovicianus gunnison s c gunnisoni and utah c parvidens in this manuscript we focus on black tailed prairie dogs which are the most abundant species all prairie dogs live in family groups called coteries within larger colonies indicating that random mixing commonly used in traditional disease modeling does not occur among prairie dogs within a colony coteries occupy a system of burrows within a colony with varying amounts of spatial overlap between coteries hoogland 1995 in addition to susceptibility to plague differing among prairie dog species russell et al 2019 spatial structure may vary both within and between species tileston and lechleitner 1966 travis and slobodchikoff 1993 hoogland 2006 verdolin et al 2014 how spatial structure between individuals pathogen reservoirs and host susceptibility are represented in pathogen transmission models determines the force of infection and can have a substantial effect on model results malagon et al 2020 this may be especially true for diseases for which the causative agent primarily relies on host to host transmission or on between host transfer of fleas and ticks we used an agent based modeling abm framework to simulate the dynamics of vectors and hosts within the plague system in the western united states for complex systems abms are able to capture individual heterogeneity in sex and age classes account for spatial structure of hosts and allow for stochasticity in ecological processes such as the probability an individual acquires an infection judson 1994 grimm and railsback 2005 for example abms have been used to model the transmission dynamics of chagas disease in wildlife populations el saadi et al 2020 and brucella melitensis in alpine ibex capra ibex lambert et al 2020 abms have also previously been used to model plague dynamics laperrière et al 2016 used abms to capture the social dynamics of family living great gerbils rhombomys opimus which may be important for maintaining plague in central asian desert systems similar to our models the gerbil models were able to incorporate burrow locations and limited movements of hosts through the use of abms within the prairie dog plague disease system previous models have attempted to account for the spatial structure of prairie dog colonies in different ways buhnerkempe et al 2011 introduced a spatial correction factor to limit each prairie dog s area of activity and the number of burrows they use as expected their model indicated that outbreaks were more likely to occur with increasing connectivity between hosts salkeld et al 2010 used abms to model plague dynamics explicitly accounting for spatially limited contact between hosts within a colony in these models contact between neighboring coteries occurred after all prairie dogs in a particular coterie died and the neighboring prairie dogs annexed the vacant site despite these previous modeling efforts empirical estimates of prairie dog contact rates within a colony have not been previously estimated or used in plague modeling efforts therefore a particularly novel aspect of our modeling efforts is our ability to link scr analyses borchers and efford 2008 royle et al 2013 with our agent based model to incorporate more representative host contact rates we use these estimates to develop realistic landscapes of prairie dog distributions and thus better understand underlying dynamics of sylvatic plague plague caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis yp circulates primarily in wild rodent hosts with occasional spillover into humans ben ari et al 2011 and other mammals if left untreated it can be fatal to humans craven et al 1993 rosenberg et al 2018 although primarily transmitted via infected fleas the bacterium can also be transmitted by direct contact e g mucosal contact and via aerosoled droplets host to host transmission the combination of infrequent outbreaks in wildlife high human mortality for untreated cases potential host to host spread among humans and limited understanding of sylvatic plague dynamics in wildlife reservoirs presents unique challenges for public health officials wildlife managers and others stenseth et al 2008 holt et al 2009 in the western united states plague primarily affects prairie dogs cynomys spp prairie dogs modify their environment by constructing burrows and clipping vegetation and a wide variety of species occupy this modified environment miller et al 1994 including the endangered black footed ferret mustela nigripes which is highly susceptible to plague and almost entirely reliant on prairie dogs as prey stromberg et al 1983 mortality rates among prairie dogs during plague epizootics vary among species but are generally 80 100 barnes et al 1993 die offs of prairie dogs attributable to plague present a substantial challenge to the recovery of black footed ferrets barnes et al 1993 cully et al 2010 in the face of global climate change vector borne diseases like plague are of particular concern due to the potential for longer season lengths higher ambient temperatures and increased frequency of heavy rainfall events harvell et al 2002 these factors can lead to increased abundance and geographic range expansion of plague vectors as they colonize new habitats made suitable by changes in local weather patterns and find new host populations recent research has demonstrated relationships between local weather factors and host flea abundance indicating yp vectors may be subject to the effects of climate change as well russell et al 2018 poje 2019 despite the importance of sylvatic plague to wildlife and human health a thorough understanding of its transmission pathways and their relative importance to plague dynamics remains elusive early work on flea borne transmission in the rat flea xenopsylla cheopis indicated that yp forms a blockage in the proventriculus of fleas that prevents feeding bacot and martin 1914 these starving blocked fleas increase their biting rate on prairie dog hosts and they regurgitate infected material increasing the likelihood of yp transmission however simulation models of plague dynamics in prairie dogs and their fleas in north america indicated that blocked flea transmission now referred to as biofilm dependent transmission hinnebusch et al 2017a may be insufficient to generate plague epizootics lorange et al 2005 webb et al 2006 laboratory studies on oropsylla hirsuta the primary flea of prairie dogs found that blocking did not occur or occurred only partially leading to alternate hypotheses for flea transmission eisen et al 2006 wilder et al 2008a eisen et al 2006 demonstrated that a related flea species o montana could transmit plague bacteria immediately after infection referred to as early phase or mass transmission hinnebusch et al 2017a previous modeling indicated this mechanism could account for the rapid spread of plague observed in prairie dog colonies buhnerkempe et al 2011 however more recent laboratory experiments with o montana found that early phase transmission occurred at a much lower rate than transmission from fleas in a later stage of infection hinnebusch et al 2017a and that blocking occurred under appropriate laboratory conditions in addition to mechanisms of plague transmission from fleas to hosts uncertainty exists regarding the identification and role of reservoirs in plague epizootics webb et al 2006 used simulation models to examine plague transmission dynamics in prairie dogs and proposed the existence of reservoirs potentially carcasses soil or other mammalian hosts that would allow for plague to generate sustained outbreaks capable of creating local extinctions previous research indicated that resistant rodents such as grasshopper mice onychomys leucogaster may act as reservoirs by carrying infected fleas between prairie dog colonies salkeld et al 2010 kraft and stapp 2013 by extending the models of buhnerkempe et al 2011 richgels et al 2016 determined that a soil reservoir was unlikely to be an important driver of plague epizootics but concluded that transmission due to contact with yp infected carcasses could produce plague outbreaks although previous plague models have explored various aspects of flea borne transmission early phase versus blocking webb et al 2006 buhnerkempe et al 2011 alternative transmission pathways carcass soil reservoir and host to host contact richgels et al 2016 small mammal reservoirs salkeld et al 2010 and climate change snäll et al 2008 substantial gaps remain in our understanding of the epizootiology of sylvatic plague thus our main objectives in developing a spatially explicit agent based model using estimated contact rates from empirical data were to assess sensitivity of our models to parameter uncertainty to explore alternative origins of outbreaks i e the outbreak is initiated in a live host or the outbreak is initiated in fleas and to assess how the spatial distribution of prairie dogs which determines contact rates influences disease dynamics by linking ecological models to our agent based model 2 methods modeling framework 2 1 host dynamics we developed a spatially explicit agent based sic susceptible infected carcass host model to represent the dynamics of plague within a black tailed prairie dog colony figures 1 and 2 previous research has indicated that mortality of prairie dogs from plague is 80 100 therefore we did not include a recovered component in these models cully et al 1997 cully and williams 2001 pauli et al 2006 models were run for a 150 day time period burrow emergence through seasonal torpor to capture a mean summer season for this species we begin the models after the birth pulse therefore no host reproduction occurred during the simulations deaths in the population occur from background host mortality µh hoogland 1995a table 1 described as a bernoulli trial with probability of success survival equal to 1 µh we initiate simulations by distributing animals in space based on prairie dog density and distribution estimates from mark recapture data collected during the summers of 2013 2015 at 18 black tailed prairie dog colonies in south dakota and montana that were not experiencing plague outbreaks rocke et al 2017 the simulated colony covers approximately 20 ha field methods for the mark recapture of prairie dogs are described in detail in previous studies rocke et al 2017 briefly between june july of 2013 2015 traps were placed on 10 prairie dog colonies on the charles m russell wildlife refuge in montana and 8 colonies in south dakota 4 colonies in buffalo gap 2 colonies in lower brule and 2 colonies in wind cave during daylight hours for 3 10 days locations of traps were recorded individuals captured were marked with ear tags in each ear to identify recaptures and the trap in which they were captured was recorded we use scr models to estimate the density and spatial distribution of animals using the oscr package sutherland et al 2016 sutherland et al 2019 in r r core team 2019 this approach estimates the number of animals in a population nt based on the number of observed animals no and the estimated number of unobserved animals we denote each individual s activity center as x i x i y i in the scr literature activity centers are defined as the center of the area of activity an animal uses during the study period an area of activity is the area of use around this center point as characterized by an individual s capture history during the trapping session individuals can share an activity center and have overlapping areas of use we estimate the nt locations x i 1 i nt of each animal s activity center from potential activity center locations s l s 1 l s 2 l 1 l n composed of a grid of n points overlaid on the simulated colony area and referred to as the state space royle et al 2013 for each animal i 1 i nt its activity center location x i is modeled as a random variable taking its values in the state space s l 1 l n according to a categorical distribution or the generalized bernoulli distribution 1 x i c a t p o b s i with p o b s i p 1 i p n i a vector of probabilities of length n that describes the likelihood each location s l in the state space was the activity center of the observed prairie dog i i e p x i s l p l i where 0 p l i 1 for every 1 l n and l 1 n p 1 i 1 in general the distribution of activity centers can be described as a binomial point process y ij bpp k p eij where yij the number of times an animal i is caught in a trap j is based on k the number of trapping occasions and the probability of encounter at trap j p eij described below given the animals activity center is located at s l unobserved animal locations are modeled using the parameters of the binomial point process estimated from the observed animals encounter probabilities the probability of an encounter pe with another prairie dog is calculated using the parameter estimates from scr models eq 3 royle et al 2013 once each individual is assigned an activity center we estimate the daily probability the i th individual encounters the j th prairie dog or its carcass pe i j specifically this probability is a function of the distance d between i th and j th prairie dogs activity centers and σ which controls the rate of decay of the likelihood of interaction as distance between activity centers increase we use the estimates of σ from the spatial capture recapture models to calculate mean area of use as π 3σ 2 royle et al 2013 representing 95 of the estimated area of use which is defined as the area the animal occupies over a specified period of time for prairie dogs this includes burrows for each prairie dog we estimate a utilization distribution worton 1989 using σ and a normal kernel 2 p u d x l y l e d 2 2 σ 2 where p u d is the probability of an individual s use of location l and d is the distance from the individual s activity center to location l finally to estimate the encounter probability p e i j between prairie dogs i and j we use the r function kerneloverlapr fieberg and kochanny 2005 in the package adehabitathr calenge 2006 to approximate the area of overlap between two individual prairie dog s areas of use and calculate their joint probability of interacting with each other once the encounter probabilities are estimated the probability a prairie dog i interacted with each neighboring prairie dog j was a bernoulli trial with probability of success equal to the pe i j for each day of the simulation in sum the above calculation results in animals that are closer to one another having a higher daily probability of interacting with each other the encounter probabilities between a prairie dog and the carcass of a deceased prairie dog follows the same calculation specifically the probability that a carcass was located at l is equal to the probability of an individual using location l within their area of use in other words there is uncertainty regarding where a carcass is located within the area of use and this uncertainty is reflected by having the location of the carcass described by a probability density surface rather than a fixed point infectious animals either die below ground with a probability of ξ or above ground with a probability 1 ξ figure 1 table 2 each day a carcass can be removed from the environment with a probability of νbg for below ground carcasses and νag for above ground carcasses godbey et al 2006 table 2 the daily probability a carcass is removed aboveground is 0 5 and decays belowground is 0 06 resulting in 10 chance the carcass is still aboveground after 4 days and intact belowground after 40 days 2 2 flea dynamics flea populations at the beginning of the simulation the number of fleas on each host fh and in each area of activity fac are randomly generated from separate negative binomial distributions nb ƛ k with shape and scale estimates derived from tripp et al 2009 and russell et al 2018 parameters ƛh and ƛ ac are the mean numbers of fleas per individual host or per area of activity respectively and k is the clustering parameter wilson et al 2002 the mean number of fleas that survive to adulthood per day per reproducing flea i e daily recruitment rate occurs at a rate r table 1 total number of flea recruits into the population at each time step is r fh t r fh t 1 pl where fh t is the total number of fleas on the host at time t pl is the probability of leaving the host and fh t 1 pl is the number of fleas that left the host in the last time step i e fleas in the environment that left the host in the previous time step are assumed to have had a blood meal and are able to reproduce see table 1 for parameter definitions all new fleas begin their lives as susceptible fleas in the environment fleas experience different mortality rates depending on whether they were on hosts µh or in the environment µac fleas finding hosts on a daily time step fleas leave a live prairie dog with a probability of pl table 2 upon the death of a prairie dog all fleas enter the area of activity surrounding the prairie dog fleas that leave a prairie dog move to the environment where they can search for a new host or return to the resident host if the host is still alive the probability a flea finds a new host pt is based on the number of prairie dogs including the resident individual while alive i e the individual the activity center belongs to that interact with that individual s area of use during that day these interactions are based on the same parameters the size of an area of use used to determine encounter probabilities between prairie dogs and carcasses see above thus pt is defined by adding a constant x nr where nr is the number of non resident prairie dogs that interact with the resident s area of activity during that time step and x is 0 1 to the probability of finding a host pf on the probit scale φ 3 φ 1 p t φ 1 p f x nr this results in an increasing probability that a flea finds a new host as more prairie dogs interact with the activity center where the flea is located the total probability of finding a host pt is then weighted between the resident and neighboring prairie dogs with a resident prairie dog receiving a larger proportion of the weight w r than non resident prairie dogs w nr where w r 1 1 x nr and w nr w r nr weights are then scaled to sum to 1 p r w r w r nr w nr and p nr 1 p r nr where p r nr p nr 1 2 3 plague models host to host transmission although rates of direct contact e g kissing which is common among coterie members and aerosol transmission i e airborne transmission between hosts in proximity to each other has not been studied in prairie dogs limited calculations of host to host plague transmission rates have been cited for humans kool 2005 direct contact or aerosol transmission prior to an infected animal s death is consistent with laboratory observations of yp infected black tailed prairie dogs displaying systemic symptoms labored breathing convulsions bloody sputum on the day of death in addition rocke et al 2008 observed the occurrence of plague in an animal not injected with yp during experimental trials of a sylvatic plague vaccine in the absence of fleas this observation indicates that host to host transmission can occur without a flea vector given an encounter with an infected animal the probability of direct contact or aerosol transmission to a susceptible individual considered equivalent in our model and henceforth referred to as host to host is related to the number of days the animal has been infected with plague dpi or days post infection using a logistic equation equation 4 where βd is the maximum probability of infection figure 1 βd m is the slope of the logistic equation set to 12 a value which results in a steep curve and c is set to 2 days before the day of death for the infected animal dday i this results in a probability function where host to host transmission is low when the animal is first infected and increases rapidly a few days prior to the animal s death appendix 1 the day of death assigned to each individual dday i for both pneumonic and flea borne plague is based on the empirical distribution of survival times from prairie dogs that were challenged via subcutaneous injection of yp russell et al 2019 by day 5 50 of black tailed prairie dogs infected with yp have died the relationship between plague infection derived from subcutaneous injection and actual flea bites or pneumonic transmission in prairie dogs is unknown however based on human cases and studies in other animals du and wang 2016 pneumonic infections progress faster and cause higher mortality rates than yp infection via injection or flea bite thus this parameter may be underestimated 4 p β d β d 1 e m d pi c host infection through environmental contact prairie dogs could also become infected by contact with the carcass of an infected animal or yp contaminated soil in the vicinity of carcasses as demonstrated in other rodents mollaret et al 1963 prairie dogs sometimes lick or cannibalize carcasses and or dig in soil contaminated with the remains of plague infected animals potentially becoming infected through this transmission route hoogland et al 1995 given an encounter between a live prairie dog and a carcass of an infected animal c figure 1 the probability of acquiring plague is modeled as a bernoulli trial with probability of success βc table 2 host to flea transmission at the beginning of the simulations fleas are located on the host or in the environment surrounding the host i e within a prairie dog s area of activity for simulations that begin with infection in host populations all fleas begin in the susceptible state for simulations that begin in flea populations a selected number of fleas begin in the early phase of plague infections see below fleas progress from susceptible fsh or fse to early stage infection feh by biting an infected host feh can subsequently leave the host and enter the environment becoming part of the environmental early state class fee the probability of host to flea transmission p β h f increases from

2000 or the late blocked stage βbf lorange et al 2005 eisen et al 2009 burroughs 1947 kartman and prince 1956 hinnebusch et al 2017a figure 2 table 2 3 model simulations 3 1 models without plague we generated a subset of potential values for 9 of the 11 parameters in our model without plague ƛh and k was held constant table 1 to generate a range of values we drew a value at equally spaced intervals across the possible range of the parameter which was determined a priori table 1 figure 1 we then created all combinations of possible parameters resulting in 90 642 unique sets we used an aleatory analysis alden et al 2013 to determine the number of simulations needed per set of parameters to adequately capture the variance in the response variables number of fleas on the host and in the environment using the spartan package alden et al 2018 in r r core team 2019 next we conducted sensitivity analyses using boosted regression tree brt analyses with 5 fold cross validation using the gbm package greenwell et al 2019 in r to find the best predictive model and determine the relative influence of predictor variables on the response elith et al 2008 boosted regression trees can easily encompass non linear effects handle large numbers of variables and automatically account for interaction terms our response variables in the brt were the mean number of flea days in the environment of each host s area of activity hereafter referred to fleas in the environment or fleas on the host the mean number of flea days was calculated by summing across all days of the simulation and then averaging across 100 simulations per parameter set these metrics were chosen because they represented available data that we could use for comparison to previous studies rocke et al 2017 russell et al 2019 tripp et al 2009 3 2 models with plague from the previous 90 642 simulations without plague we eliminated scenarios that generated mean host flea loads of 15 fleas which represents a realistic maximum for the mean number of fleas on hosts in the absence of plague tripp et al 2009 russell et al 2018 at every daily time step leaving us with a working set of parameters we used a latin hypercube design to select values for the 10 additional parameters included in the plague models and not in the original basic model table 2 for each of the working sets of parameters we selected 10 different sets of parameters in the plague model to generate a full parameter set for models that included plague two scenarios were explored 1 plague outbreaks are initiated by infecting a randomly selected prairie dog representing a host infected by consuming an infected carcass or digging infected soil or directly contacting an infected animal from a neighboring colony and 2 plague outbreaks begin by infecting four fleas in a randomly selected activity center for example fleas from a reservoir host or migrant prairie dog russell et al 2020 for these analyses we monitored the number of newly infected animals per infected animal per day the proportion of animals surviving at the end of the simulation and the time to depopulation i e 20 animals remain for use in sensitivity analyses as described above 4 results 4 1 models without plague our aleatory analyses indicated that 100 simulations of each parameter set adequately captured the variance in the response variables number of fleas on the host and in the environment for the non plague models therefore each of the 90 642 parameters sets were run 100 times resulting in 9 million simulations of the 90 642 parameter sets 84 363 produced flea populations that were less than infinity of those 1 827 parameter sets produced realistic 15 per host on host flea loads for each parameter set we ran 100 simulations for a total of 182 700 for on host and off host flea initiation scenarios where 430 scenarios resulted in an infinite number of fleas and were removed from further analyses for a total of 182 270 scenarios the range of the parameters was not reduced during this process except for the starting value of fleas on hosts working sets of parameters included a starting value of four fleas on hosts only the variables influencing both on and off host flea days i e sum of the mean number of fleas per host or in the environment per day over the 150 days of the simulation included the flea recruitment rate r the scaling parameter for the between host distance decay function σ the probability of a flea in the environment finding a host pf the starting host population size n mortality rate of fleas on hosts μh the mortality rate of fleas in the environment μac and the probability of a flea leaving a host pl and entering the environment figure 3 r squared values indicated that the boosted regression tree explained 76 of the variance in flea days on hosts and 66 of the variance for flea days in the environment indicating the boosted regression tree provided an adequate fit to the simulated data the number of flea days on host and in the environment increased as flea recruitment rates and distance moved by prairie dogs increased appendix 2 4 2 models with plague 4 2 1 host initiation of infection for models with infections starting in hosts 95 of the relative influence on the proportion of prairie dogs remaining at the end of the simulation and time to depopulation was explained by the variance in the probability of yp transmission from environmental sources βc and 5 was explained by the variance in the probability of transmission from a live infected host direct contact βd the relative influence on the mean number of newly infected animals per infected animal per day was explained by βd 72 and βc 18 respectively starting host population size accounted for the remaining 9 of the variability in newly infected animals per infected animal per day as transmission rates increased depopulation times decreased proportion of prairie dogs remaining decreased and newly infected animals per infected animal per day increased figure 4 however there was little variance in the results of the simulations with less than 2 of the population surviving on average regardless of the starting population mean depopulation times i e mean time to the number of individuals in the population 20 ranged from 22 days for populations starting with 150 individuals to 25 days for populations starting at 250 individuals similarly 96 99 of the simulations resulted in reduced populations for populations starting at 250 and 150 respectively r squared values indicated that 81 of the variance in the proportion of prairie dogs surviving the simulation and 86 of the variance in the mean number of newly infected animals per infected animal per day was explained by the brt model indicating good fits of predicted to observed values however only 59 of the variance in depopulation times was accounted for by the model 4 2 2 vector initiation of infection for models where infections started in fleas the probability of transmission from a blocked flea βbf was the most influential variable accounting for 68 of the relative influence on the proportion of prairie dogs surviving figure 5 a and 49 of the relative influence on the depopulation time figure 5b as the probability of infection from a blocked flea increased the proportion of prairie dogs surviving the entirety of the 150 day simulations declined and the likelihood of plague induced depopulation i e 20 prairie dogs surviving increased figure 6 a and 6b mean depopulation times for populations that experienced depopulation were 38 days 35 days and 40 days respectively for populations starting at 150 200 or 250 animals however only 9 7 and 2 of scenarios resulted in reduced populations indicating that 90 of the simulations did not result in a depopulation i e 80 of the population survived the simulation though the probability of infection from a late blocked flea accounted for the largest proportion of the relative influence of variables on depopulation times 49 14 was accounted for by the size of the area of use σ figure 5b r squared values indicated that 74 and 67 of the total variance in the proportion of animals surviving and the number of newly infected animals per animal per day respectively was explained by the brt model when plague outbreaks were begun in fleas versus hosts fewer animals were newly infected per infected animal per day and the variance in this number was lower the probability of transmission from a live infected host βd 32 and the probability of infection from an early stage flea βef 20 were the variables that accounted for the largest percentages of the relative influence on the number of newly infected animals per infected animal per day figure 5c as the probability of transmission increased from live infected animals via direct transmission and early stage fleas the number of newly infected animals per infected animal increased figure 6c 5 discussion the results of our model simulations indicate that the process by which plague is initiated affects the dynamics and severity of the outbreak emphasize where knowledge gaps are present in our understanding of pathogen transmission dynamics particularly with regard to the biologically relevant range of parameter estimates and demonstrate the usefulness of including spatial structure in disease modeling plague outbreaks were much more likely to occur when initial infections began in an animal infected by consuming a carcass or digging in contaminated soil or directly infected through contact with an infected host from a neighboring colony i e 95 of simulation resulted in depopulation of colonies plague infections initiated by infectious fleas e g imported into the colony on grasshopper mice migrating prairie dogs or carnivores resulted in depopulation in only 10 of scenarios infected fleas must find and infect a prairie dog host and fleas on that host must become infected or stay infected leave the host and find a new host for the infection to spread this sequence of events reduces the overall probability that new animals will become infected and that the disease will spread within the colony however the frequency of plague initiating events under conditions encountered in the natural world are poorly known and therefore we could not weight our results from different models accordingly flea initiated transmission of yp among prairie dogs is the most accepted paradigm and our scenarios representing this route are likely more reflective of how plague occurs in prairie dog populations the initiation and resulting outcome of plague outbreaks in prairie dogs may be similar to human plague where direct contact or pneumonic plague are more severe than bubonic plague resulting from flea borne transmission but pneumonic outbreaks occur far less frequently andrianaivoarimanana et al 2019 a retrospective analysis of human plague cases in madagascar revealed that 93 of cases were confirmed as bubonic compared to 7 of cases confirmed as pneumonic in origin chanteau et al 1998 in our prairie dog models we found that increasing the number of infected fleas that begin the scenario increases the probability that an outbreak occurs data not shown however we did not explore the effects of alternative spatial distributions of infected fleas on plague initiation dynamics i e in our simulations all infected fleas were in one activity center random seeding of infected fleas could produce different model outcomes for this study we focused on the effects of spatial structure in the host and parameter uncertainty in the initiation and transmission dynamics of plague epizootics finally we did not explore the effects of repeated introductions of infected fleas a scenario that would likely result in increased frequency of colony depopulation further research on the topic of the mechanisms of plague emergence would be useful for clarifying this process the relative influence of each parameter in our models also differed depending on how the outbreak was initiated via host or vector an environmental source of yp infection e g carcass of infected animal was the most influential parameter on both the proportion of animals surviving and number of new infections per day when plague infection was initiated in a prairie dog host variables related to subsequent flea borne transmission were not as influential under this scenario however in scenarios when plague outbreaks were initiated by vectors subsequent environmental exposure to yp influenced only the number of new animals infected per day not depopulation times or proportion of individuals surviving and it was less influential than direct contact with live infected hosts early phase flea transmission range of host movement and flea recruitment rate much uncertainty exists in the parameter estimates in our plague transmission models especially with regard to plague infection of susceptible individuals via contact or consumption of an environmental reservoir plague mortality has been documented in rodent species after consuming yp contaminated food and water in laboratory studies butler et al 1982 and cannibalism has been observed in prairie dogs hoogland 1995 hoogland 2006 however rates of cannibalism of carcasses on prairie dog towns and rates of plague infection as a result are unknown it is possible that the parameter range used in our simulation models includes values that are outside the range occurring in nature based on our model results we suspect that the probability is lower than our maximum value of 0 3 therefore simulations with transmission probabilities in the lower range of values are more likely reflective of natural systems however the relative influence of the parameters remained the same even when model results were subset to host and environmental yp transmission rates less than 0 1 the occurrence of plague in prairie dogs at locations where insecticidal dusting has significantly reduced or nearly eliminated flea populations e g tripp et al 2017 is evidence that host and or environmental yp transmission is feasible and does occur in nature buhnerkempe et al 2011 found that questing efficiency of fleas i e a flea s ability to find a host was positively correlated with enzootic probability but had little effect on depopulation in our models we included both the probability of finding a host as well as the probability of leaving a host to return to the environment after a blood meal in models where yp outbreaks were initiated by infected fleas the probability of leaving was negatively related to depopulation times and contributed 10 of the relative influence and the probability of finding a host 7 5 of the relative influence was positively related to the number of new animals infected furthermore buhnerkempe et al 2011 found increasing transmission efficiency of early stage fleas and increasing transition rates between early and latent stage fleas increased the probability of depopulation transmission rates from early stage fleas were also important in our models with vector initiated outbreaks and composed 2 6 of the relative influence on depopulation time 4 8 of the relative influence on proportion of animals surviving and 21 of the relative influence on the number of newly infected animals as transmission rates increased depopulation times were shorter fewer animals survived and the number of newly infected animals per day increased development rates from early to latent stage fleas influenced 2 6 of the relative influence depopulation times as development rates increased depopulation times decreased similar to buhnerkempe et al 2011 we explored the potential for varying efficiency in both early phase yp transmission by fleas and late phase transmission via blocking associated with increased transmission rates but shorter lifespans of fleas our models indicate that infection rates from blocked fleas influenced depopulation times and the proportion of prairie dogs surviving while early phase transmission influenced all three model results depopulation time proportion of prairie dogs surviving and number of prairie dogs infected per day indicating that these variables are important for determining the outcome of plague introductions to a population yersinia pestis transmission mechanisms and efficiencies of prairie dog fleas and other north american fleas have been debated in the literature eisen et al 2009 and continue to confound efforts to model disease dynamics so far none of the studies on o hirsuta have been conducted using blood from prairie dogs their preferred host instead laboratory studies on flea transmission mechanisms and efficiency relied on commercially available rodent blood as the source of infectious blood meals for fleas eisen et al 2006 which can affect the efficiency of prairie dog fleas as yp vectors bland et al 2018 blocking or biofilm dependent transmission in theory not only makes fleas more infectious by causing them to repeatedly bite and regurgitate it also prevents fleas from feeding thus shortening their lifespan potentially influencing the transmission dynamics of plague gandon et al 2019 hinnebusch et al 2017a and b recently suggested a unified theory of flea transmission dynamics where transmission via both modes early phase and late stage is dependent on biofilm development but in the early phase it is the result of reflux in temporarily blocked fleas though flea recruitment rates were directly related to the total number of flea days in models without plague flea recruitment rate had relatively little influence on plague dynamics compared to other variables in our model our expectation that the probability of outbreaks would be directly related to flea recruitment rates was not supported by model results we suspect that a relatively low threshold number of fleas may be sufficient for plague outbreaks to occur and increasing numbers beyond that threshold is unlikely to result in increased probability of population declines due to plague for our simulations where outbreaks were initiated by vector populations approximately 20 30 more flea days occurred on hosts and in the environment for simulations where 50 of the population survived the outbreak versus simulations where 50 of the population survived the outbreak indicating that the number of flea days was associated with model results but not as strongly as other factors we speculate that high flea recruitment rates may cause outbreaks to burn out more quickly in less connected colonies i e result in high mortalities in a small portion of the colony leaving survivors unaffected in the rest of the colony we integrated estimates of prairie dog spatial structure into our previously published model of plague transmission richgels et al 2016 to assess the effects of spatial structure on simulated results our model results indicated that the simulated density and size of area used by prairie dogs influenced the size of the flea population for models without plague these factors also influenced the number of newly infected animals per day per infected host and the time to prairie dog depopulation for models where plague was initiated in fleas versus hosts similar to tripp et al 2009 as individual prairie dogs in our models ranged more widely and encountered an increasing number of other individuals both flea abundance and the number of infected animals per day increased while time to depopulation decreased buhnerkempe et al 2011 also noted that increased connectivity among hosts led to a greater risk of extinction unfortunately relatively little quantitative data have been collected regarding within colony movements of prairie dogs and how those mean movements may be different across species or change in response to environmental factors including the presence of plague resource availability and or densities of prairie dogs it is also possible that for plague like tuberculosis in meerkats suricata suricatta the type of social contact giving or receiving grooming for example may be equally important for infection risk as the number of contacts drewe 2010 although not possible in all situations scr methods allowed us to estimate the spatial structure of prairie dogs from limited within colony movement data spatial capture recapture is a flexible methodology that can be used with physical traps in fixed locations as well as camera traps royle et al 2011 or capture locations i e animals captured by tracking russell et al 2012 proffitt et al 2015 other useful ways of estimating contact networks include social network analysis sna craft et al 2011 silk et al 2017 robinson et al 2018 however sna is also not possible in all systems and accounting for unobserved individuals remains an unresolved issue perkins et al 2009 silk et al 2017 verdolin et al 2014 assessed the social network structure of a gunnison s prairie dog in arizona by rigorous observation of social interactions however this is not possible on a large scale methods for the analyses of telemetry data that estimate attraction or grouping of individuals including the unobserved individuals see scharf and buderman 2020 would also provide realistic estimates of contact networks for populations in sum estimating contact networks for wildlife is difficult however ecological modeling approaches can be important tools that can be leveraged and integrated with traditional disease models to understand transmission pathways and disease dynamics in conclusion plague transmission dynamics are complex and remain poorly understood the spatial structure of prairie dog populations combined with the complexity and uncertainties associated with the flea borne and direct transmission make modeling and predicting plague outbreaks difficult until more accurate estimates of blocking behavior in o hirsuta can be made models will need to accommodate the uncertainty in the flea borne transmission and the implications for plague dynamics these results also highlight the need for additional research on the mechanisms of flea borne plague transmission in addition to o hirsuta other fleas may be involved in yp transmission previous research has found an abundance of other oropsylla flea species on prairie dog towns particularly at higher elevation sites russell et al 2018 currently species specific yp transmission efficiencies of fleas are poorly understood and therefore the contribution of different species to plague dynamics is also unknown similar uncertainties also exist for direct and environmental transmission of yp in prairie dogs as rates of infection via cannibalism and pneumonic transmission are unknown additionally our models reaffirm that it is essential to account for host spatial structure given its evident importance on the dynamics of plague prairie dogs live in social groups proximity to and contact with infectious animals their carcasses and their fleas is likely to have a major influence on the dynamics of plague epizootics our model results including proportion of prairie dogs surviving time to depopulation and the number of newly infected hosts per day depended on assumptions made regarding prairie dog spatial structure specifically density and overlap between individuals which varies by species vegetation conditions and other environmental factors this variation in spatial structure may contribute to the likelihood of plague outbreaks occurring with denser populations resulting in higher probabilities of plague outbreaks our models do not address dispersal events within the colony the frequency of these events and the effect of dispersal on plague transmission is currently unknown further research on the subject would be useful for understanding the complexities of the plague system finally the mechanisms behind plague maintenance in prairie ecosystems remains elusive there are no clear patterns in the spatial and temporal dynamics of plague in prairie dog ecosystems and it is unclear how plague is maintained between outbreaks we explore two possible mechanisms of plague initiation in our models but other causes of an outbreak may also exist expanding our models to incorporate multiple colonies may help address some of these questions however empirical data are needed to understand inter colony connections and distinguish between different hypotheses regarding plague maintenance in prairie ecosystems our modeling framework integrates ecological and agent based models providing a rigorous means for incorporating empirical data to describe the spatial and host contact properties of the system in disease modeling this framework can be used to evaluate alternative plague mitigation strategies by introducing vaccination or flea control into the models numerous questions remain regarding the best methods for controlling plague in prairie ecosystems including the optimal spatial and temporal distribution of treatments which could be explored using our model

24657,the development of models to elucidate the transmission pathways and dynamics of wildlife diseases remains challenging sylvatic plague caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis yp is an infectious zoonotic disease that primarily affects wild rodents including prairie dogs cynomys spp in north america proposed transmission pathways for yp include flea bites direct contacts between hosts and environmental reservoirs e g soil carcasses we developed a spatially explicit agent based model of yp transmission to explore the effects of alternative transmission pathways different disease initiation mechanisms host or fleas parameter uncertainty and spatial structure of hosts a particularly novel aspect of our model was the integration of ecological models with traditional disease models specifically we used estimates from spatial capture recapture models to generate data driven spatial distributions densities and contact rates to capture the spatial structure of prairie dogs we simulated 9 million scenarios across a wide range of parameter values and conducted sensitivity analyses to determine the most influential parameters on the number of flea days sum of the mean number of fleas on hosts each day of the simulation number of newly infected hosts per day the time to depopulation 20 prairie dogs remaining and the proportion of the prairie dog population remaining at the end of the simulation after 150 days when including spatial structure we found the probability of transmission via environmental sources of yp i e carcasses had the greatest influence on model results when yp infection was initiated in prairie dog hosts rather than in fleas conversely the mechanism of transmission by fleas to prairie dogs had the greatest influence on model results when yp infection was initiated in fleas i e via introduction by carnivores a migrant prairie dog or other mammalian host uncertainty in parameter estimates particularly those related to the transmission pathways of yp continue to hamper efforts to realistically model plague dynamics in wild rodents our results elucidate the complexity of the flea plague prairie dog system and reiterate the importance of research on yp transmission mechanisms to provide a full understanding of this disease our results also emphasize the importance of realistic estimates of spatial structure for exploring transmission dynamics of wildlife diseases and provide a framework for generating a data driven description of spatial structure keywords cynomys spp disease modeling fleas plague prairie dogs vector borne diseases wildlife 1 introduction modeling infectious diseases of wildlife remains challenging due to difficulties identifying and measuring the relative importance of pathogen reservoirs transmission pathways including host to host reservoirs and vectors huyvaert et al 2018 and infectious contact rates among hosts craft 2015 silk et al 2017 estimating infectious contacts can be extremely resource intensive and accounting for unobserved members of a population are problematic for standard analytical procedures such as social networks perkins et al 2009 silk et al 2017 a potentially novel solution to this problem is to leverage ecological models royle et al 2013 to provide data driven estimates of the spatial structure of host animals as well as other important disease parameters and to integrate these estimates into models of disease transmission in wildlife specifically we estimated both host density and mean spatial range of individuals using spatial capture recapture scr analyses borchers and efford 2008 royle et al 2013 and used these parameters to derive empirical estimates of host contact rates within an agent based model that examines the relative importance of various transmission pathways we apply our modeling approach to the prairie dog plague system which is likely influenced by host spatial structure as are other wildlife disease systems four species of prairie dogs occur in the western united states including white tailed cynomys leucurus black tailed c ludovicianus gunnison s c gunnisoni and utah c parvidens in this manuscript we focus on black tailed prairie dogs which are the most abundant species all prairie dogs live in family groups called coteries within larger colonies indicating that random mixing commonly used in traditional disease modeling does not occur among prairie dogs within a colony coteries occupy a system of burrows within a colony with varying amounts of spatial overlap between coteries hoogland 1995 in addition to susceptibility to plague differing among prairie dog species russell et al 2019 spatial structure may vary both within and between species tileston and lechleitner 1966 travis and slobodchikoff 1993 hoogland 2006 verdolin et al 2014 how spatial structure between individuals pathogen reservoirs and host susceptibility are represented in pathogen transmission models determines the force of infection and can have a substantial effect on model results malagon et al 2020 this may be especially true for diseases for which the causative agent primarily relies on host to host transmission or on between host transfer of fleas and ticks we used an agent based modeling abm framework to simulate the dynamics of vectors and hosts within the plague system in the western united states for complex systems abms are able to capture individual heterogeneity in sex and age classes account for spatial structure of hosts and allow for stochasticity in ecological processes such as the probability an individual acquires an infection judson 1994 grimm and railsback 2005 for example abms have been used to model the transmission dynamics of chagas disease in wildlife populations el saadi et al 2020 and brucella melitensis in alpine ibex capra ibex lambert et al 2020 abms have also previously been used to model plague dynamics laperrière et al 2016 used abms to capture the social dynamics of family living great gerbils rhombomys opimus which may be important for maintaining plague in central asian desert systems similar to our models the gerbil models were able to incorporate burrow locations and limited movements of hosts through the use of abms within the prairie dog plague disease system previous models have attempted to account for the spatial structure of prairie dog colonies in different ways buhnerkempe et al 2011 introduced a spatial correction factor to limit each prairie dog s area of activity and the number of burrows they use as expected their model indicated that outbreaks were more likely to occur with increasing connectivity between hosts salkeld et al 2010 used abms to model plague dynamics explicitly accounting for spatially limited contact between hosts within a colony in these models contact between neighboring coteries occurred after all prairie dogs in a particular coterie died and the neighboring prairie dogs annexed the vacant site despite these previous modeling efforts empirical estimates of prairie dog contact rates within a colony have not been previously estimated or used in plague modeling efforts therefore a particularly novel aspect of our modeling efforts is our ability to link scr analyses borchers and efford 2008 royle et al 2013 with our agent based model to incorporate more representative host contact rates we use these estimates to develop realistic landscapes of prairie dog distributions and thus better understand underlying dynamics of sylvatic plague plague caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis yp circulates primarily in wild rodent hosts with occasional spillover into humans ben ari et al 2011 and other mammals if left untreated it can be fatal to humans craven et al 1993 rosenberg et al 2018 although primarily transmitted via infected fleas the bacterium can also be transmitted by direct contact e g mucosal contact and via aerosoled droplets host to host transmission the combination of infrequent outbreaks in wildlife high human mortality for untreated cases potential host to host spread among humans and limited understanding of sylvatic plague dynamics in wildlife reservoirs presents unique challenges for public health officials wildlife managers and others stenseth et al 2008 holt et al 2009 in the western united states plague primarily affects prairie dogs cynomys spp prairie dogs modify their environment by constructing burrows and clipping vegetation and a wide variety of species occupy this modified environment miller et al 1994 including the endangered black footed ferret mustela nigripes which is highly susceptible to plague and almost entirely reliant on prairie dogs as prey stromberg et al 1983 mortality rates among prairie dogs during plague epizootics vary among species but are generally 80 100 barnes et al 1993 die offs of prairie dogs attributable to plague present a substantial challenge to the recovery of black footed ferrets barnes et al 1993 cully et al 2010 in the face of global climate change vector borne diseases like plague are of particular concern due to the potential for longer season lengths higher ambient temperatures and increased frequency of heavy rainfall events harvell et al 2002 these factors can lead to increased abundance and geographic range expansion of plague vectors as they colonize new habitats made suitable by changes in local weather patterns and find new host populations recent research has demonstrated relationships between local weather factors and host flea abundance indicating yp vectors may be subject to the effects of climate change as well russell et al 2018 poje 2019 despite the importance of sylvatic plague to wildlife and human health a thorough understanding of its transmission pathways and their relative importance to plague dynamics remains elusive early work on flea borne transmission in the rat flea xenopsylla cheopis indicated that yp forms a blockage in the proventriculus of fleas that prevents feeding bacot and martin 1914 these starving blocked fleas increase their biting rate on prairie dog hosts and they regurgitate infected material increasing the likelihood of yp transmission however simulation models of plague dynamics in prairie dogs and their fleas in north america indicated that blocked flea transmission now referred to as biofilm dependent transmission hinnebusch et al 2017a may be insufficient to generate plague epizootics lorange et al 2005 webb et al 2006 laboratory studies on oropsylla hirsuta the primary flea of prairie dogs found that blocking did not occur or occurred only partially leading to alternate hypotheses for flea transmission eisen et al 2006 wilder et al 2008a eisen et al 2006 demonstrated that a related flea species o montana could transmit plague bacteria immediately after infection referred to as early phase or mass transmission hinnebusch et al 2017a previous modeling indicated this mechanism could account for the rapid spread of plague observed in prairie dog colonies buhnerkempe et al 2011 however more recent laboratory experiments with o montana found that early phase transmission occurred at a much lower rate than transmission from fleas in a later stage of infection hinnebusch et al 2017a and that blocking occurred under appropriate laboratory conditions in addition to mechanisms of plague transmission from fleas to hosts uncertainty exists regarding the identification and role of reservoirs in plague epizootics webb et al 2006 used simulation models to examine plague transmission dynamics in prairie dogs and proposed the existence of reservoirs potentially carcasses soil or other mammalian hosts that would allow for plague to generate sustained outbreaks capable of creating local extinctions previous research indicated that resistant rodents such as grasshopper mice onychomys leucogaster may act as reservoirs by carrying infected fleas between prairie dog colonies salkeld et al 2010 kraft and stapp 2013 by extending the models of buhnerkempe et al 2011 richgels et al 2016 determined that a soil reservoir was unlikely to be an important driver of plague epizootics but concluded that transmission due to contact with yp infected carcasses could produce plague outbreaks although previous plague models have explored various aspects of flea borne transmission early phase versus blocking webb et al 2006 buhnerkempe et al 2011 alternative transmission pathways carcass soil reservoir and host to host contact richgels et al 2016 small mammal reservoirs salkeld et al 2010 and climate change snäll et al 2008 substantial gaps remain in our understanding of the epizootiology of sylvatic plague thus our main objectives in developing a spatially explicit agent based model using estimated contact rates from empirical data were to assess sensitivity of our models to parameter uncertainty to explore alternative origins of outbreaks i e the outbreak is initiated in a live host or the outbreak is initiated in fleas and to assess how the spatial distribution of prairie dogs which determines contact rates influences disease dynamics by linking ecological models to our agent based model 2 methods modeling framework 2 1 host dynamics we developed a spatially explicit agent based sic susceptible infected carcass host model to represent the dynamics of plague within a black tailed prairie dog colony figures 1 and 2 previous research has indicated that mortality of prairie dogs from plague is 80 100 therefore we did not include a recovered component in these models cully et al 1997 cully and williams 2001 pauli et al 2006 models were run for a 150 day time period burrow emergence through seasonal torpor to capture a mean summer season for this species we begin the models after the birth pulse therefore no host reproduction occurred during the simulations deaths in the population occur from background host mortality µh hoogland 1995a table 1 described as a bernoulli trial with probability of success survival equal to 1 µh we initiate simulations by distributing animals in space based on prairie dog density and distribution estimates from mark recapture data collected during the summers of 2013 2015 at 18 black tailed prairie dog colonies in south dakota and montana that were not experiencing plague outbreaks rocke et al 2017 the simulated colony covers approximately 20 ha field methods for the mark recapture of prairie dogs are described in detail in previous studies rocke et al 2017 briefly between june july of 2013 2015 traps were placed on 10 prairie dog colonies on the charles m russell wildlife refuge in montana and 8 colonies in south dakota 4 colonies in buffalo gap 2 colonies in lower brule and 2 colonies in wind cave during daylight hours for 3 10 days locations of traps were recorded individuals captured were marked with ear tags in each ear to identify recaptures and the trap in which they were captured was recorded we use scr models to estimate the density and spatial distribution of animals using the oscr package sutherland et al 2016 sutherland et al 2019 in r r core team 2019 this approach estimates the number of animals in a population nt based on the number of observed animals no and the estimated number of unobserved animals we denote each individual s activity center as x i x i y i in the scr literature activity centers are defined as the center of the area of activity an animal uses during the study period an area of activity is the area of use around this center point as characterized by an individual s capture history during the trapping session individuals can share an activity center and have overlapping areas of use we estimate the nt locations x i 1 i nt of each animal s activity center from potential activity center locations s l s 1 l s 2 l 1 l n composed of a grid of n points overlaid on the simulated colony area and referred to as the state space royle et al 2013 for each animal i 1 i nt its activity center location x i is modeled as a random variable taking its values in the state space s l 1 l n according to a categorical distribution or the generalized bernoulli distribution 1 x i c a t p o b s i with p o b s i p 1 i p n i a vector of probabilities of length n that describes the likelihood each location s l in the state space was the activity center of the observed prairie dog i i e p x i s l p l i where 0 p l i 1 for every 1 l n and l 1 n p 1 i 1 in general the distribution of activity centers can be described as a binomial point process y ij bpp k p eij where yij the number of times an animal i is caught in a trap j is based on k the number of trapping occasions and the probability of encounter at trap j p eij described below given the animals activity center is located at s l unobserved animal locations are modeled using the parameters of the binomial point process estimated from the observed animals encounter probabilities the probability of an encounter pe with another prairie dog is calculated using the parameter estimates from scr models eq 3 royle et al 2013 once each individual is assigned an activity center we estimate the daily probability the i th individual encounters the j th prairie dog or its carcass pe i j specifically this probability is a function of the distance d between i th and j th prairie dogs activity centers and σ which controls the rate of decay of the likelihood of interaction as distance between activity centers increase we use the estimates of σ from the spatial capture recapture models to calculate mean area of use as π 3σ 2 royle et al 2013 representing 95 of the estimated area of use which is defined as the area the animal occupies over a specified period of time for prairie dogs this includes burrows for each prairie dog we estimate a utilization distribution worton 1989 using σ and a normal kernel 2 p u d x l y l e d 2 2 σ 2 where p u d is the probability of an individual s use of location l and d is the distance from the individual s activity center to location l finally to estimate the encounter probability p e i j between prairie dogs i and j we use the r function kerneloverlapr fieberg and kochanny 2005 in the package adehabitathr calenge 2006 to approximate the area of overlap between two individual prairie dog s areas of use and calculate their joint probability of interacting with each other once the encounter probabilities are estimated the probability a prairie dog i interacted with each neighboring prairie dog j was a bernoulli trial with probability of success equal to the pe i j for each day of the simulation in sum the above calculation results in animals that are closer to one another having a higher daily probability of interacting with each other the encounter probabilities between a prairie dog and the carcass of a deceased prairie dog follows the same calculation specifically the probability that a carcass was located at l is equal to the probability of an individual using location l within their area of use in other words there is uncertainty regarding where a carcass is located within the area of use and this uncertainty is reflected by having the location of the carcass described by a probability density surface rather than a fixed point infectious animals either die below ground with a probability of ξ or above ground with a probability 1 ξ figure 1 table 2 each day a carcass can be removed from the environment with a probability of νbg for below ground carcasses and νag for above ground carcasses godbey et al 2006 table 2 the daily probability a carcass is removed aboveground is 0 5 and decays belowground is 0 06 resulting in 10 chance the carcass is still aboveground after 4 days and intact belowground after 40 days 2 2 flea dynamics flea populations at the beginning of the simulation the number of fleas on each host fh and in each area of activity fac are randomly generated from separate negative binomial distributions nb ƛ k with shape and scale estimates derived from tripp et al 2009 and russell et al 2018 parameters ƛh and ƛ ac are the mean numbers of fleas per individual host or per area of activity respectively and k is the clustering parameter wilson et al 2002 the mean number of fleas that survive to adulthood per day per reproducing flea i e daily recruitment rate occurs at a rate r table 1 total number of flea recruits into the population at each time step is r fh t r fh t 1 pl where fh t is the total number of fleas on the host at time t pl is the probability of leaving the host and fh t 1 pl is the number of fleas that left the host in the last time step i e fleas in the environment that left the host in the previous time step are assumed to have had a blood meal and are able to reproduce see table 1 for parameter definitions all new fleas begin their lives as susceptible fleas in the environment fleas experience different mortality rates depending on whether they were on hosts µh or in the environment µac fleas finding hosts on a daily time step fleas leave a live prairie dog with a probability of pl table 2 upon the death of a prairie dog all fleas enter the area of activity surrounding the prairie dog fleas that leave a prairie dog move to the environment where they can search for a new host or return to the resident host if the host is still alive the probability a flea finds a new host pt is based on the number of prairie dogs including the resident individual while alive i e the individual the activity center belongs to that interact with that individual s area of use during that day these interactions are based on the same parameters the size of an area of use used to determine encounter probabilities between prairie dogs and carcasses see above thus pt is defined by adding a constant x nr where nr is the number of non resident prairie dogs that interact with the resident s area of activity during that time step and x is 0 1 to the probability of finding a host pf on the probit scale φ 3 φ 1 p t φ 1 p f x nr this results in an increasing probability that a flea finds a new host as more prairie dogs interact with the activity center where the flea is located the total probability of finding a host pt is then weighted between the resident and neighboring prairie dogs with a resident prairie dog receiving a larger proportion of the weight w r than non resident prairie dogs w nr where w r 1 1 x nr and w nr w r nr weights are then scaled to sum to 1 p r w r w r nr w nr and p nr 1 p r nr where p r nr p nr 1 2 3 plague models host to host transmission although rates of direct contact e g kissing which is common among coterie members and aerosol transmission i e airborne transmission between hosts in proximity to each other has not been studied in prairie dogs limited calculations of host to host plague transmission rates have been cited for humans kool 2005 direct contact or aerosol transmission prior to an infected animal s death is consistent with laboratory observations of yp infected black tailed prairie dogs displaying systemic symptoms labored breathing convulsions bloody sputum on the day of death in addition rocke et al 2008 observed the occurrence of plague in an animal not injected with yp during experimental trials of a sylvatic plague vaccine in the absence of fleas this observation indicates that host to host transmission can occur without a flea vector given an encounter with an infected animal the probability of direct contact or aerosol transmission to a susceptible individual considered equivalent in our model and henceforth referred to as host to host is related to the number of days the animal has been infected with plague dpi or days post infection using a logistic equation equation 4 where βd is the maximum probability of infection figure 1 βd m is the slope of the logistic equation set to 12 a value which results in a steep curve and c is set to 2 days before the day of death for the infected animal dday i this results in a probability function where host to host transmission is low when the animal is first infected and increases rapidly a few days prior to the animal s death appendix 1 the day of death assigned to each individual dday i for both pneumonic and flea borne plague is based on the empirical distribution of survival times from prairie dogs that were challenged via subcutaneous injection of yp russell et al 2019 by day 5 50 of black tailed prairie dogs infected with yp have died the relationship between plague infection derived from subcutaneous injection and actual flea bites or pneumonic transmission in prairie dogs is unknown however based on human cases and studies in other animals du and wang 2016 pneumonic infections progress faster and cause higher mortality rates than yp infection via injection or flea bite thus this parameter may be underestimated 4 p β d β d 1 e m d pi c host infection through environmental contact prairie dogs could also become infected by contact with the carcass of an infected animal or yp contaminated soil in the vicinity of carcasses as demonstrated in other rodents mollaret et al 1963 prairie dogs sometimes lick or cannibalize carcasses and or dig in soil contaminated with the remains of plague infected animals potentially becoming infected through this transmission route hoogland et al 1995 given an encounter between a live prairie dog and a carcass of an infected animal c figure 1 the probability of acquiring plague is modeled as a bernoulli trial with probability of success βc table 2 host to flea transmission at the beginning of the simulations fleas are located on the host or in the environment surrounding the host i e within a prairie dog s area of activity for simulations that begin with infection in host populations all fleas begin in the susceptible state for simulations that

generated a subset of potential values for 9 of the 11 parameters in our model without plague ƛh and k was held constant table 1 to generate a range of values we drew a value at equally spaced intervals across the possible range of the parameter which was determined a priori table 1 figure 1 we then created all combinations of possible parameters resulting in 90 642 unique sets we used an aleatory analysis alden et al 2013 to determine the number of simulations needed per set of parameters to adequately capture the variance in the response variables number of fleas on the host and in the environment using the spartan package alden et al 2018 in r r core team 2019 next we conducted sensitivity analyses using boosted regression tree brt analyses with 5 fold cross validation using the gbm package greenwell et al 2019 in r to find the best predictive model and determine the relative influence of predictor variables on the response elith et al 2008 boosted regression trees can easily encompass non linear effects handle large numbers of variables and automatically account for interaction terms our response variables in the brt were the mean number of flea days in the environment of each host s area of activity hereafter referred to fleas in the environment or fleas on the host the mean number of flea days was calculated by summing across all days of the simulation and then averaging across 100 simulations per parameter set these metrics were chosen because they represented available data that we could use for comparison to previous studies rocke et al 2017 russell et al 2019 tripp et al 2009 3 2 models with plague from the previous 90 642 simulations without plague we eliminated scenarios that generated mean host flea loads of 15 fleas which represents a realistic maximum for the mean number of fleas on hosts in the absence of plague tripp et al 2009 russell et al 2018 at every daily time step leaving us with a working set of parameters we used a latin hypercube design to select values for the 10 additional parameters included in the plague models and not in the original basic model table 2 for each of the working sets of parameters we selected 10 different sets of parameters in the plague model to generate a full parameter set for models that included plague two scenarios were explored 1 plague outbreaks are initiated by infecting a randomly selected prairie dog representing a host infected by consuming an infected carcass or digging infected soil or directly contacting an infected animal from a neighboring colony and 2 plague outbreaks begin by infecting four fleas in a randomly selected activity center for example fleas from a reservoir host or migrant prairie dog russell et al 2020 for these analyses we monitored the number of newly infected animals per infected animal per day the proportion of animals surviving at the end of the simulation and the time to depopulation i e 20 animals remain for use in sensitivity analyses as described above 4 results 4 1 models without plague our aleatory analyses indicated that 100 simulations of each parameter set adequately captured the variance in the response variables number of fleas on the host and in the environment for the non plague models therefore each of the 90 642 parameters sets were run 100 times resulting in 9 million simulations of the 90 642 parameter sets 84 363 produced flea populations that were less than infinity of those 1 827 parameter sets produced realistic 15 per host on host flea loads for each parameter set we ran 100 simulations for a total of 182 700 for on host and off host flea initiation scenarios where 430 scenarios resulted in an infinite number of fleas and were removed from further analyses for a total of 182 270 scenarios the range of the parameters was not reduced during this process except for the starting value of fleas on hosts working sets of parameters included a starting value of four fleas on hosts only the variables influencing both on and off host flea days i e sum of the mean number of fleas per host or in the environment per day over the 150 days of the simulation included the flea recruitment rate r the scaling parameter for the between host distance decay function σ the probability of a flea in the environment finding a host pf the starting host population size n mortality rate of fleas on hosts μh the mortality rate of fleas in the environment μac and the probability of a flea leaving a host pl and entering the environment figure 3 r squared values indicated that the boosted regression tree explained 76 of the variance in flea days on hosts and 66 of the variance for flea days in the environment indicating the boosted regression tree provided an adequate fit to the simulated data the number of flea days on host and in the environment increased as flea recruitment rates and distance moved by prairie dogs increased appendix 2 4 2 models with plague 4 2 1 host initiation of infection for models with infections starting in hosts 95 of the relative influence on the proportion of prairie dogs remaining at the end of the simulation and time to depopulation was explained by the variance in the probability of yp transmission from environmental sources βc and 5 was explained by the variance in the probability of transmission from a live infected host direct contact βd the relative influence on the mean number of newly infected animals per infected animal per day was explained by βd 72 and βc 18 respectively starting host population size accounted for the remaining 9 of the variability in newly infected animals per infected animal per day as transmission rates increased depopulation times decreased proportion of prairie dogs remaining decreased and newly infected animals per infected animal per day increased figure 4 however there was little variance in the results of the simulations with less than 2 of the population surviving on average regardless of the starting population mean depopulation times i e mean time to the number of individuals in the population 20 ranged from 22 days for populations starting with 150 individuals to 25 days for populations starting at 250 individuals similarly 96 99 of the simulations resulted in reduced populations for populations starting at 250 and 150 respectively r squared values indicated that 81 of the variance in the proportion of prairie dogs surviving the simulation and 86 of the variance in the mean number of newly infected animals per infected animal per day was explained by the brt model indicating good fits of predicted to observed values however only 59 of the variance in depopulation times was accounted for by the model 4 2 2 vector initiation of infection for models where infections started in fleas the probability of transmission from a blocked flea βbf was the most influential variable accounting for 68 of the relative influence on the proportion of prairie dogs surviving figure 5 a and 49 of the relative influence on the depopulation time figure 5b as the probability of infection from a blocked flea increased the proportion of prairie dogs surviving the entirety of the 150 day simulations declined and the likelihood of plague induced depopulation i e 20 prairie dogs surviving increased figure 6 a and 6b mean depopulation times for populations that experienced depopulation were 38 days 35 days and 40 days respectively for populations starting at 150 200 or 250 animals however only 9 7 and 2 of scenarios resulted in reduced populations indicating that 90 of the simulations did not result in a depopulation i e 80 of the population survived the simulation though the probability of infection from a late blocked flea accounted for the largest proportion of the relative influence of variables on depopulation times 49 14 was accounted for by the size of the area of use σ figure 5b r squared values indicated that 74 and 67 of the total variance in the proportion of animals surviving and the number of newly infected animals per animal per day respectively was explained by the brt model when plague outbreaks were begun in fleas versus hosts fewer animals were newly infected per infected animal per day and the variance in this number was lower the probability of transmission from a live infected host βd 32 and the probability of infection from an early stage flea βef 20 were the variables that accounted for the largest percentages of the relative influence on the number of newly infected animals per infected animal per day figure 5c as the probability of transmission increased from live infected animals via direct transmission and early stage fleas the number of newly infected animals per infected animal increased figure 6c 5 discussion the results of our model simulations indicate that the process by which plague is initiated affects the dynamics and severity of the outbreak emphasize where knowledge gaps are present in our understanding of pathogen transmission dynamics particularly with regard to the biologically relevant range of parameter estimates and demonstrate the usefulness of including spatial structure in disease modeling plague outbreaks were much more likely to occur when initial infections began in an animal infected by consuming a carcass or digging in contaminated soil or directly infected through contact with an infected host from a neighboring colony i e 95 of simulation resulted in depopulation of colonies plague infections initiated by infectious fleas e g imported into the colony on grasshopper mice migrating prairie dogs or carnivores resulted in depopulation in only 10 of scenarios infected fleas must find and infect a prairie dog host and fleas on that host must become infected or stay infected leave the host and find a new host for the infection to spread this sequence of events reduces the overall probability that new animals will become infected and that the disease will spread within the colony however the frequency of plague initiating events under conditions encountered in the natural world are poorly known and therefore we could not weight our results from different models accordingly flea initiated transmission of yp among prairie dogs is the most accepted paradigm and our scenarios representing this route are likely more reflective of how plague occurs in prairie dog populations the initiation and resulting outcome of plague outbreaks in prairie dogs may be similar to human plague where direct contact or pneumonic plague are more severe than bubonic plague resulting from flea borne transmission but pneumonic outbreaks occur far less frequently andrianaivoarimanana et al 2019 a retrospective analysis of human plague cases in madagascar revealed that 93 of cases were confirmed as bubonic compared to 7 of cases confirmed as pneumonic in origin chanteau et al 1998 in our prairie dog models we found that increasing the number of infected fleas that begin the scenario increases the probability that an outbreak occurs data not shown however we did not explore the effects of alternative spatial distributions of infected fleas on plague initiation dynamics i e in our simulations all infected fleas were in one activity center random seeding of infected fleas could produce different model outcomes for this study we focused on the effects of spatial structure in the host and parameter uncertainty in the initiation and transmission dynamics of plague epizootics finally we did not explore the effects of repeated introductions of infected fleas a scenario that would likely result in increased frequency of colony depopulation further research on the topic of the mechanisms of plague emergence would be useful for clarifying this process the relative influence of each parameter in our models also differed depending on how the outbreak was initiated via host or vector an environmental source of yp infection e g carcass of infected animal was the most influential parameter on both the proportion of animals surviving and number of new infections per day when plague infection was initiated in a prairie dog host variables related to subsequent flea borne transmission were not as influential under this scenario however in scenarios when plague outbreaks were initiated by vectors subsequent environmental exposure to yp influenced only the number of new animals infected per day not depopulation times or proportion of individuals surviving and it was less influential than direct contact with live infected hosts early phase flea transmission range of host movement and flea recruitment rate much uncertainty exists in the parameter estimates in our plague transmission models especially with regard to plague infection of susceptible individuals via contact or consumption of an environmental reservoir plague mortality has been documented in rodent species after consuming yp contaminated food and water in laboratory studies butler et al 1982 and cannibalism has been observed in prairie dogs hoogland 1995 hoogland 2006 however rates of cannibalism of carcasses on prairie dog towns and rates of plague infection as a result are unknown it is possible that the parameter range used in our simulation models includes values that are outside the range occurring in nature based on our model results we suspect that the probability is lower than our maximum value of 0 3 therefore simulations with transmission probabilities in the lower range of values are more likely reflective of natural systems however the relative influence of the parameters remained the same even when model results were subset to host and environmental yp transmission rates less than 0 1 the occurrence of plague in prairie dogs at locations where insecticidal dusting has significantly reduced or nearly eliminated flea populations e g tripp et al 2017 is evidence that host and or environmental yp transmission is feasible and does occur in nature buhnerkempe et al 2011 found that questing efficiency of fleas i e a flea s ability to find a host was positively correlated with enzootic probability but had little effect on depopulation in our models we included both the probability of finding a host as well as the probability of leaving a host to return to the environment after a blood meal in models where yp outbreaks were initiated by infected fleas the probability of leaving was negatively related to depopulation times and contributed 10 of the relative influence and the probability of finding a host 7 5 of the relative influence was positively related to the number of new animals infected furthermore buhnerkempe et al 2011 found increasing transmission efficiency of early stage fleas and increasing transition rates between early and latent stage fleas increased the probability of depopulation transmission rates from early stage fleas were also important in our models with vector initiated outbreaks and composed 2 6 of the relative influence on depopulation time 4 8 of the relative influence on proportion of animals surviving and 21 of the relative influence on the number of newly infected animals as transmission rates increased depopulation times were shorter fewer animals survived and the number of newly infected animals per day increased development rates from early to latent stage fleas influenced 2 6 of the relative influence depopulation times as development rates increased depopulation times decreased similar to buhnerkempe et al 2011 we explored the potential for varying efficiency in both early phase yp transmission by fleas and late phase transmission via blocking associated with increased transmission rates but shorter lifespans of fleas our models indicate that infection rates from blocked fleas influenced depopulation times and the proportion of prairie dogs surviving while early phase transmission influenced all three model results depopulation time proportion of prairie dogs surviving and number of prairie dogs infected per day indicating that these variables are important for determining the outcome of plague introductions to a population yersinia pestis transmission mechanisms and efficiencies of prairie dog fleas and other north american fleas have been debated in the literature eisen et al 2009 and continue to confound efforts to model disease dynamics so far none of the studies on o hirsuta have been conducted using blood from prairie dogs their preferred host instead laboratory studies on flea transmission mechanisms and efficiency relied on commercially available rodent blood as the source of infectious blood meals for fleas eisen et al 2006 which can affect the efficiency of prairie dog fleas as yp vectors bland et al 2018 blocking or biofilm dependent transmission in theory not only makes fleas more infectious by causing them to repeatedly bite and regurgitate it also prevents fleas from feeding thus shortening their lifespan potentially influencing the transmission dynamics of plague gandon et al 2019 hinnebusch et al 2017a and b recently suggested a unified theory of flea transmission dynamics where transmission via both modes early phase and late stage is dependent on biofilm development but in the early phase it is the result of reflux in temporarily blocked fleas though flea recruitment rates were directly related to the total number of flea days in models without plague flea recruitment rate had relatively little influence on plague dynamics compared to other variables in our model our expectation that the probability of outbreaks would be directly related to flea recruitment rates was not supported by model results we suspect that a relatively low threshold number of fleas may be sufficient for plague outbreaks to occur and increasing numbers beyond that threshold is unlikely to result in increased probability of population declines due to plague for our simulations where outbreaks were initiated by vector populations approximately 20 30 more flea days occurred on hosts and in the environment for simulations where 50 of the population survived the outbreak versus simulations where 50 of the population survived the outbreak indicating that the number of flea days was associated with model results but not as strongly as other factors we speculate that high flea recruitment rates may cause outbreaks to burn out more quickly in less connected colonies i e result in high mortalities in a small portion of the colony leaving survivors unaffected in the rest of the colony we integrated estimates of prairie dog spatial structure into our previously published model of plague transmission richgels et al 2016 to assess the effects of spatial structure on simulated results our model results indicated that the simulated density and size of area used by prairie dogs influenced the size of the flea population for models without plague these factors also influenced the number of newly infected animals per day per infected host and the time to prairie dog depopulation for models where plague was initiated in fleas versus hosts similar to tripp et al 2009 as individual prairie dogs in our models ranged more widely and encountered an increasing number of other individuals both flea abundance and the number of infected animals per day increased while time to depopulation decreased buhnerkempe et al 2011 also noted that increased connectivity among hosts led to a greater risk of extinction unfortunately relatively little quantitative data have been collected regarding within colony movements of prairie dogs and how those mean movements may be different across species or change in response to environmental factors including the presence of plague resource availability and or densities of prairie dogs it is also possible that for plague like tuberculosis in meerkats suricata suricatta the type of social contact giving or receiving grooming for example may be equally important for infection risk as the number of contacts drewe 2010 although not possible in all situations scr methods allowed us to estimate the spatial structure of prairie dogs from limited within colony movement data spatial capture recapture is a flexible methodology that can be used with physical traps in fixed locations as well as camera traps royle et al 2011 or capture locations i e animals captured by tracking russell et al 2012 proffitt et al 2015 other useful ways of estimating contact networks include social network analysis sna craft et al 2011 silk et al 2017 robinson et al 2018 however sna is also not possible in all systems and accounting for unobserved individuals remains an unresolved issue perkins et al 2009 silk et al 2017 verdolin et al 2014 assessed the social network structure of a gunnison s prairie dog in arizona by rigorous observation of social interactions however this is not possible on a large scale methods for the analyses of telemetry data that estimate attraction or grouping of individuals including the unobserved individuals see scharf and buderman 2020 would also provide realistic estimates of contact networks for populations in sum estimating contact networks for wildlife is difficult however ecological modeling approaches can be important tools that can be leveraged and integrated with traditional disease models to understand transmission pathways and disease dynamics in conclusion plague transmission dynamics are complex and remain poorly understood the spatial structure of prairie dog populations combined with the complexity and uncertainties associated with the flea borne and direct transmission make modeling and predicting plague outbreaks difficult until more accurate estimates of blocking behavior in o hirsuta can be made models will need to accommodate the uncertainty in the flea borne transmission and the implications for plague dynamics these results also highlight the need for additional research on the mechanisms of flea borne plague transmission in addition to o hirsuta other fleas may be involved in yp transmission previous research has found an abundance of other oropsylla flea species on prairie dog towns particularly at higher elevation sites russell et al 2018 currently species specific yp transmission efficiencies of fleas are poorly understood and therefore the contribution of different species to plague dynamics is also unknown similar uncertainties also exist for direct and environmental transmission of yp in prairie dogs as rates of infection via cannibalism and pneumonic transmission are unknown additionally our models reaffirm that it is essential to account for host spatial structure given its evident importance on the dynamics of plague prairie dogs live in social groups proximity to and contact with infectious animals their carcasses and their fleas is likely to have a major influence on the dynamics of plague epizootics our model results including proportion of prairie dogs surviving time to depopulation and the number of newly infected hosts per day depended on assumptions made regarding prairie dog spatial structure specifically density and overlap between individuals which varies by species vegetation conditions and other environmental factors this variation in spatial structure may contribute to the likelihood of plague outbreaks occurring with denser populations resulting in higher probabilities of plague outbreaks our models do not address dispersal events within the colony the frequency of these events and the effect of dispersal on plague transmission is currently unknown further research on the subject would be useful for understanding the complexities of the plague system finally the mechanisms behind plague maintenance in prairie ecosystems remains elusive there are no clear patterns in the spatial and temporal dynamics of plague in prairie dog ecosystems and it is unclear how plague is maintained between outbreaks we explore two possible mechanisms of plague initiation in our models but other causes of an outbreak may also exist expanding our models to incorporate multiple colonies may help address some of these questions however empirical data are needed to understand inter colony connections and distinguish between different hypotheses regarding plague maintenance in prairie ecosystems our modeling framework integrates ecological and agent based models providing a rigorous means for incorporating empirical data to describe the spatial and host contact properties of the system in disease modeling this framework can be used to evaluate alternative plague mitigation strategies by introducing vaccination or flea control into the models numerous questions remain regarding the best methods for controlling plague in prairie ecosystems including the optimal spatial and temporal distribution of treatments which could be explored using our model

24658,recruitment of temperate eel species anguilla anguilla a rostrata a japonica has declined over the last few decades due to human activities such as overfishing and construction of migratory barriers e g dams weirs and sluices and hazardous energy infrastructure e g turbines intakes and outfalls numerical models substantiated with data from field and laboratory studies can potentially predict and quantify the relative impacts of such activities thereby assisting in the sustainable management of eel populations here we present an agent based model abm of juvenile eel migration up estuaries the model includes relevant eel behaviours and environmental conditions that according to the literature influence upstream migration crucially by assessing the local salinity gradient and relative flow direction the modelled eels agents self determine whether the tide is flooding or ebbing and orientate themselves for navigation with no top down instructions this allows the agents to decide which particular behaviour to undertake as part of selective tidal stream transport stst the developed abm is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of the thames estuary and the results substantiated by comparison against eel trap data combinations of the various stst behaviours are systematically tested and the influence they have on up estuary migration is assessed in terms of relative energy expenditure the parameterised model is then used predictively at milford haven waterway to investigate potential impacts on the juvenile eel population due to entrainment in a power plant cooling water intake and outfall results from the thames model case study indicate that including bed anchoring behaviour is essential for achieving a good comparison with the eel trap data and the choice of salinity detection threshold is also important if daylight avoidance diel behaviour is not included the most energy efficient migration is achieved using just two stst behaviours ebb tide bed anchoring and upward migration during flood with diel behaviour included energy expenditure is greater but some efficiency is regained by including all of the stst behaviours for the milford haven case study the model predicted a juvenile eel intake and outfall entrainment rate of 2 0 and 4 7 respectively it is concluded that the abm is a valuable tool for assessing potential impacts on the recruitment of eels extendable to other species and could be used to assist in site selection and low impact design of energy infrastructure in tidal environments keywords abm agent based model glass eel elver ibm migration selective tidal stream transport 1 introduction all anguillid eels have a catadromous life cycle in which the juveniles migrate from the ocean into rivers where they mature for several years and then return to the ocean as adult silver eels to spawn tesch 2008 the focus of this study is the swimming behaviour of juvenile european eels anguilla anguilla in the latter stages of their migration as they progress up macro tidal 1 1 where the tidal range is in excess of 4 m estuaries to reach freshwater environments at this stage in their life cycle they are approximately 8 12 cm in length and translucent so referred to as glass eels and become elvers when more pigmented in this study the term juvenile eel will be used to describe both of these stages and for brevity we will usually refer to them as simply eel hereafter unless clarity is needed furthermore numerically modelled eel individuals will generally be referred to as agents the international union for conservation of nature iucn has classified the status of the european eel as critically endangered their decline is thought to be due to various anthropogenic factors dekker 2003 macgregor et al 2008 arai 2014 such as entrainment in power plant intakes and outfalls or impingement on screens piper et al 2015 blockage due to poorly designed fish passes and weirs amaral et al 2002 russon et al 2010 calles et al 2013 vowles et al 2015 population losses due to commercial fishing ices 2014 and impacts on larval stages due to climate change knights 2003 bonhommeau et al 2008 in an attempt to re establish the european eel populations legislation has been passed whereby eu member states must identify suitable eel habitats and manage these in a manner that ensures sufficient escapement of adult eels to the sea european commission 2007 to achieve this annual data on recruitment and commercial or recreational catch data are required ices 2017 currently recruitment estimates and trends are derived from local catch data annually across the western part of europe ices 2017 and this information can further be used to provide larger scale estimates of recruitment via empirical modelling briand et al 2006 bru et al 2009 despite numerous studies into the topic of eel migration current knowledge of how eels migrate from the continental shelf through tidal estuaries and into freshwater environments is limited cresci 2020 this is partly due to the difficulty of monitoring these small semi transparent life stages which tend to migrate during the night to avoid predation often in turbid water i e low underwater light transmission levels caused by suspended sediment most information on their migratory behaviour has therefore been obtained from controlled laboratory experiments and from catch data using fishing nets or eel traps located on weirs or sluices laboratory studies have been used to determine the swimming speeds of juvenile european eel vezza et al 2020 recorded a sustained swim speed 20 200 min duration of approximately 0 05 m s 1 prolonged speeds up to 20 min duration of between 0 2 to 0 4 m s 1 dependent on water temperature and maximum burst speeds of up to about 0 5 m s 1 field studies have also shown that they are unable to progress upstream against currents greater than 0 36 to 0 50 m s 1 creutzberg 1961 mccleave 1980 depth averaged flow speeds in many estuaries often exceed 1 m s 1 during the outbound ebb tide it is therefore necessary that the eels perform decision making and exhibit behavioural strategies that allow them to efficiently make headway to reach the tidal limit a conceptual model that describes how eels navigate up estuaries is called selective tidal stream transport harrison et al 2014 in this model eel individuals follow three key behavioural regimes in response to the time varying state of the tide first during the inbound flood tide the eels are assumed to drift with the flow to conserve energy and are dispersed throughout the water column second after slack high water during the early stages of the following outbound ebb tide the eels are assumed to move towards the edges of the channel where the flows are slower thus allowing them to continue progressing upstream third as the ebb flows increase the eels are assumed to swim to the bed and anchor themselves thus preventing themselves from being carried back downstream one way of quantitatively assessing the advantages or disadvantages of stst behaviour for example in terms of energy expenditure is to use a numerical model key variables such as swim speed can be easily manipulated in a numerical model and assessed in terms of relative sensitivity on the outcomes furthermore a wide variety of conditions can be tested numerical models can also help to bridge gaps in understanding between data collected from field or laboratory studies grimm and railsback 2005 field data such as from net catches or eel traps are crucial for supporting a model or theory but are often sparse or incomplete in both time and space on the other hand data sets from small scale laboratory studies are useful for isolating and quantifying behaviours in a controlled manner e g swim speed light sensitivity or rheotaxis 2 2 the movement of an organism towards or away from an oncoming current of water making them suitable for gathering model calibration data however laboratory experiments cannot incorporate all of the complexity of the physical estuarine environment such as tidal flows river discharge turbidity daylight salinity and temperature which all affect eel behaviour to some degree cresci 2020 and vary continuously in space and time combining the three disciplines i e numerical models in situ data collection and controlled laboratory experiments is therefore crucial for gaining a better understanding of the migratory behaviour of eels and indeed other fish species one form of numerical model that is suitable for simulating fish dynamics and behaviour is an agent based model abms within an abm a collection of autonomous decision making entities called agents are represented and each agent individually assesses its situation and makes decisions on the basis of a set of rules bonabeau 2002 this approach can be applied to simulating the movements and decision making of fish in which individuals use relatively simple behavioural rules that are dependent on their surrounding environment jager and deangelis 2018 abms have been applied successfully in ecological research and are a valuable tool in predicting fish recruitment deangelis and mooij 2005 mclane et al 2011 for example past modelling studies have reproduced annual trends and estimates for species such as atlantic cod gadus morhua and european anchovy engraulis encrasicolus daewel et al 2015 ospina alvarez et al 2015 abms of fish behaviour have also been used successfully at smaller temporal and spatial scales for example goodwin et al 2006 developed an abm using a eulerian lagrangian agent method elam to mimic the swimming behaviour of fish around man made structures such as fish passes and weirs in the present study an abm is developed for simulating the upstream migration of european eel through macro tidal estuaries behavioural rules and abilities of the eels are defined based on an earlier assessment of the literature on this subject cresci 2020 parameterisation and testing of the model is performed using two case studies in the first case study the abm is coupled to a three dimensional hydrodynamic model of the thames estuary uk the aim of this case study is to assess the relative importance of the various stst behaviours on migration efficiency and to verify the model results against eel trap data collected at stoney sluice in brentford where the river brent joins the tidal thames in the second case study the parameterised abm is applied to the milford haven waterway estuarine environment and used to predict entrainment of eels in the cooling water intake and outfall of pembroke power station 2 agent based model description this section describes the abm which consists of a particle tracking model and an eel behaviour model user specified parameter values for the described formulae vary according to calibration and are given in the subsequent case study sections 2 1 particle tracking model the general approach of the abm is to simulate agents in this case eels as a set of discrete points lagrangian framework which move within and are influenced by the three dimensional flow field provided by a gridded hydrodynamic model eulerian framework the underlying model for performing the lagrangian calculations without eel behaviour is called hydroboids which was developed previously at hr wallingford for modelling dispersion of fish larvae wallingford 2016 behaviour of fish species in response to stimuli such as underwater noise benson et al 2016 and assessing collisions of marine species with tidal turbines rossington and benson 2020 the model which is coded in the matlab programming environment www mathworks com was further developed during the current work to include the behaviour of juvenile eel migration up estuaries described in section 2 2 hydroboids requires as input the 3d flow vector field from a eulerian grid hydrodynamic model and then performs the necessary time and space interpolation for obtaining the velocity vector at the centre of each modelled agent using this information the cumulative displacement d x d y d z of each agent located at x x y z is tracked at discrete time intervals d t using a standard particle tracking formula monti and leuzzi 2010 with an additional term for the agent swim velocity components written as 1 d x t d y t d z t u x t v x t w x t u a t v a t w a t 2 k x 0 0 0 2 k y 0 0 0 2 k z γ x γ y γ z d t for each agent the resultant path travelled is a function of the 3d flow velocity vector u v w the agent s swim vector u a v a w a and turbulent diffusion which is calculated using the diagonal components of the eulerian eddy diffusivity tensor k x k y k z and independent random numbers γ x γ y γ z for each axis selected from a normal distribution with mean of zero and variance of one n 0 1 the vertical component of the eddy diffusivity in eq 1 varies with height z above the bed and is modelled using a mixing length model prandtl 1925 as a function of the bed shear velocity u water depth h and a characteristic mixing length κ 0 41 as 2 k z z β κ u z 1 z h the bed shear velocity in eq 2 is in turn dependent on the flow speed water depth and bed friction z 0 as 3 u κ u z ln z z 0 bed friction is prescribed in the model using a nikuradse roughness length which is related to z 0 as k s 30 z 0 nikuradse 1933 β is the prandtl number with a value between 0 and 1 to reduce the turbulent displacement since fish will disperse less quickly than the water for the horizontal diffusion k x and k y a constant eddy diffusivity coefficient is applied everywhere in both the x and y directions at a specified time step interval the 3d positions of all the tracked agents are saved to binary results files for subsequent post processing information on the swim speed heading and elevation angle of the agents is also recorded in the file to allow 3d visualisation of the their movements 2 2 eel behaviour model the abm of upstream migrating eels was developed during this study using the three stst regimes of behaviour which occur at different stages of the tidal cycle flood ebb and early ebb tide importantly the modelled eels or agents are assumed to be able to determine the tidal state and hence which regime they are in by assessing the local salinity gradient and flow velocity field they are therefore self governing agents without any external top down instructions on their movement the dynamics of the model are described below and represented as a flowchart in fig 1 2 2 1 initialisation at the start of the simulation t 0 eel agents are placed into the flow model domain as discrete points in 3d space x y z within a user defined region the swim speed of each agent v s w i m is randomly selected from a gaussian distribution of speeds with a specified mean v s w i m and standard deviation σ s w i m obtained from laboratory experiments performed over a range of temperatures to represent the variability in the population vezza et al 2020 the swim speed for each agent remains constant throughout a simulation except for when they temporarily anchor themselves at the bed section 2 2 4 or drift during the flood tide section 2 2 5 the initial heading θ s w i m of each agent is also randomly selected between 0 and 360 and the elevation angles ϕ s w i m are initialised to zero the behavioural rules then bias subsequent swim angles according to the salinity and tide 2 2 2 position updating and land avoidance before the new agent position is calculated using eq 1 additional random variability in the agent navigation other than turbulence is applied by adding a small angular error or persistence angle in radians to both the agent s heading θ s w i m and vertical elevation angle ϕ s w i m at each time step eq 4 and 5 the persistence angle is selected from a normal distribution which has a mean of zero and separate standard deviations for the horizontal and vertical σ h and σ v then added to the heading and elevation angle of the fish in the polar coordinate system in general a smaller standard deviation for vertical persistence σ v is used since fish tend to navigate more in the horizontal direction 4 θ s w i m θ s w i m n 0 σ h 2 5 ϕ s w i m ϕ s w i m n 0 σ v 2 because the persistence angle is applied to the agent s heading the magnitude of the resultant navigation error at each time step is dependent on the swim speed of the agent becoming zero if the swim speed is zero i e drifting vertical turbulent eddy viscosity k z on the other hand varies according to flow speed and depth becoming zero in still water it is therefore important to model random displacement due to both persistence error and turbulent diffusion using the set of agent swim speeds v s w i m modified headings θ s w i m and elevation angles ϕ s w i m from either the initialisation step or the end of the previous time step in addition to the interpolated flow vectors v f l o w the agents are moved to their new positions according to eq 1 see section 2 1 the moved agents can occasionally encounter land either by crossing a model land boundary or by entering dry areas with zero water depth such as tidal flats in such instances to simulate active avoidance behaviour by an agent an iterative process occurs in the model whereby the agent modifies its previous trajectory heading by 10 degree increments simultaneously both left and right of its current heading and tests to see if the new position is within water the first non dry position is kept and the iterations are finished if the heading increments reach 180 degrees then the agent is assumed to be stranded on a dry model element and its original position at the beginning of the time step is kept stranded agents are assumed to survive in the model and they reattempt navigation during each subsequent model iteration this allows the agents to be re entrained into the water column on a following high tide 2 2 3 assessment of tidal state at the beginning of each time step the eel agents assess the surrounding salinity gradients interpolated from the hydrodynamic model at their body centres for each agent if the salinity is detectable s s t h r e s h and there is also a discernible horizontal salinity gradient s s t h r e s h the agent actively aligns itself with the flow vectors refer to section 3 4 2 for threshold values the direction of alignment with or against the flow vector is chosen to be that closest to the direction of decreasing salinity θ s and in doing so it is assumed to be pointing up the estuary the direction of the flow vector relative to the agent s heading consequently determines whether the agent detects an ebbing or flooding tide and hence determines which behaviour the agent will perform during this model time interval fig 1 if an agent enters a freshwater region or a region where there is no salinity gradient then it is assumed to have no directional cue to follow in this case it continues in the same direction as the previous time interval using a correlated random walk eq 4 and 5 the agent might therefore continue up the estuary even if there are meanders by encountering the banks and consequently following the channel alignment there is also a chance that it will turn around due to the random walk or it may become trapped in an embayment until the salinity returns to higher levels on a subsequent flood tide 2 2 4 ebb tide behaviour when an agent detects that it is an ebb tide if the local flow speed is less than the agent s initialised swim speed v f l o w v s w i m initiation of so called edging behaviour occurs fig 1 edging is most likely to occur close to either high or low water during the early or late ebb but its effect will be greatest during early ebb because of the higher tidal level at this time and hence wider channel cross section a minimum threshold on local water depth h m i n is used to prevent agents from swimming into very shallow water and getting stuck on intertidal areas if either the flow speed or minimum depth criteria are not met edging behaviour is not initiated when activated each affected agent moves towards the channel boundaries whilst also swimming against the flow this is achieved by adjusting the heading of the agent by 45 from its present flow aligned heading towards decreasing flows during stronger ebb tide flows when by default an agent will be heading into the flow 45 if the oncoming current speed exceeds its swim speed v f l o w v s w i m fig 1 then it actively migrates down to the bed at a user specified elevation angle ϕ m i g when within a small distance of the bed z m i n the agent is assumed to hold itself stationary on the substrate referred to as bed anchoring behaviour as soon as the agent is able to make headway against the flow v f l o w v s w i m this behaviour ceases and the agent s speed is returned to its initial speed upwards migration or drifting is then initiated as described in the following section 2 2 5 flood tide behaviour when an agent detects that it is a flood tide if the flow speed is less than the agent s initial swim speed then it swims upwards towards the surface at a user specified elevation angle ϕ m i g if the flow speed is faster then the agent s swim speed is set to zero to simulate drifting behaviour fig 1 thus saving energy during upstream movement during drifting behaviour the eel agents are treated as passive lagrangian particles which are advected and dispersed solely by the 3d modelled currents and turbulence 2 2 6 diel behaviour previous field studies have reported that juvenile eels avoid daylight presumably as an anti predatory behaviour and migrate mainly during hours of darkness de casamajor et al 1999 during daylight hours they stay hidden in the deeper parts of the water column and halt their movements to simulate this diel behaviour the time of day is assessed in the model at each time interval between sunrise and sunset it is assumed the agents are able to detect the sunlight and are programmed to swim to the bed then anchor themselves as described in section 2 2 4 this behaviour is not strictly part of the stst set of behaviours but was included in the model in order to investigate the cost in terms of relative energy expenditure due to this known anti predatory behaviour 3 case study 1 modelling juvenile eel migration in the thames estuary 3 1 overview this case study assesses the relative importance of the various stst behaviours for eel migration the model results are also verified against eel trap data collected at stoney sluice in brentford creek a tributary to the tidal thames 3 2 site description the thames is the second longest river in the united kingdom ranging over 346 km from its source in gloucestershire to the estuary which passes through central london and continues to its mouth at southend on sea essex where it drains into the north sea the thames river basin district rbd covers and area of approximately 16 000 km 2 including the greater london area and parts of oxfordshire and kent defra 2010 fig 2 the tidal limit is at teddington lock approximately 112 km from the mouth 3 3 observations of juvenile eels in the thames historically the river supported eel fisheries but the population severely declined due to anthropogenic actions e g water pollution in the 1980s and flood defence engineering and barrier construction naismith and knights 1988 defra 2010 monitoring of juvenile eel migration has intermittently been conducted in the past between 1985 and 1987 traps were installed at locations near the estuary tidal limit and further upstream and around 9000 individuals were caught mostly glass eels naismith and knights 1988 between 2005 and 2009 three tributaries rivers roding darent and mole were sampled with similar traps and a decrease in recruitment of 99 was reported gollock et al 2011 since 2011 the zoological society of london zsl and the environment agency has been involved in monitoring of numbers of migrating juvenile eels in the thames rbd at several monitoring sites ewcp 2017 the 2014 trap data for one of the sites stoney sluice in brentford lat 51 48424 lon 0 30957 has been used here to parameterise the abm stoney sluice is at the junction between the river brent and brentford creek which adjoins the tidal thames the 2014 stoney sluice eel trap data fig 3 show that eels mainly started passing the sluice in early july and there was a general increase in trapped numbers throughout the measurement period to the end of september the time series consists of a number of peaks separated by periods of a few days up to about 10 days when the number of trapped eels decreased by an order of magnitude according to the survey logs the traps continued to work well during most of the measurement period thus discounting this as the cause of the variability however there is a two week period august 13th to 26th during which no eel trap data were recorded due to pump failure fig 3 eels started to arrive during a period of very low run off and the peaks appear to coincide with short term increases in run off presumably due to rain events fig 3a however it is not clear from this visual comparison how river discharge could explain all of the peaks and troughs in the eel count data another possible cause of the temporal variability in eel counts is temperature field experiments conducted by various researchers in estuaries other than the thames have found a link between temperature and the onset of migration gascuel 1986 moriarty 1986 white and knights 1997a b migration peak white and knights 1997a and the number of migrants hvidsten 1985 vøllestad and jonsson 1988 in general the minimum threshold for migration up estuaries to occur has been reported to be between 10 14 c with increased migration above 14 16 c and peaking at 18 20 c white and knights 1997a b moriarty 1986 naismith and knights 1988 for the present study water temperature data were available at a recording station at kew approximately 1 km from the entrance to brentford creek fig 3b water temperature was greater than 14 c for the whole data period hence temperature is unlikely to be a limiting factor on migration during this period the low numbers of eels trapped during the first three months suggests that another factor must be impeding their migration a better indication of the cause of the time variability can be seen by comparing the trapped eel counts with the modelled salinity at brentford creek fig 3c which shows an inverse relationship but only following periods when there were detectable levels of salinity possible reasons for this relationship will be considered in the discussion 3 4 methods 3 4 1 hydrodynamic model description to provide the flow environment for the abm a 3d numerical model of the thames estuary between teddington lock and southend pier fig 4 was constructed using the telemac mascaret modelling suite telemac mascaret consortium tidal flows and salinity distribution were simulated for the five month period april to september during 2014 for which eel trap data were available the horizontal resolution of the unstructured triangular model mesh was in the range 5 to 500 m with the finer resolution in the narrower upstream sections and around small islands and bridge piers the piers for all of the thames bridges and the tidal barrage at woolwich were included in the model the vertical discretisation of the model consisted of four planes with one at both the bed and surface and the other two spaced at 10 and 50 of the water column height above the bed this vertical discretisation has been found to be sufficient for accurately modelling the hydrodynamics and salinity within the thames wallingford 2018 which is mainly well mixed in the vertical the tidal boundary of the model at southend pier was driven using harmonically synthesised tides for the modelled period no atmospheric surge component was included in the simulated water levels at the upstream boundary of the model at teddington a time varying river discharge was applied using daily gauge data for kingston lock sourced from the environment agency at richmond approximately 5 km downstream from teddington a half tide weir was installed in 1894 the weir is raised during the lower half of each tide to ensure sufficient navigable depth in the channel upstream of the weir between richmond and teddington the weir was included in the model by dynamically raising the bed elevation across the estuary at the weir location when the water level dropped below 1 72 m above ordance datum newlyn and lowering it again when the downstream levels returned to higher values on the following flood tide 3 4 2 eel swim speed and dispersion parameterisation values for each of the input parameters for the eel behaviour model as described in section 2 1 are shown in table 1 swimming speed was derived from laboratory experiments performed by vezza et al 2020 who studied the swimming capabilities of glass eels at water temperatures ranging from 8 18 c which is consistent with the temperature range recorded during the eel trap measurements fig 3b prolonged 1 20 min and sustained 20 200 min swimming speeds were reported as 0 35 and 0 04 m s 1 respectively the long term average speed of the eels is likely to be between these two values and the precise value is dependent on how long it takes for the eels to recover from prolonged swimming in the absence of any information on juvenile eel recovery time in the literature an average swimming speed of 0 20 m s 1 was chosen which was applied in all the model scenarios except one scenario 10 the speed of each eel agent was prescribed randomly from a gaussian distribution with a mean speed of 0 20 m s 1 and standard deviation of 0 05 m s 1 sensitivity to swim speed was assessed separately in scenario 10 see section 3 4 4 in which the mean speed of the agents was set to 0 35 m s 1 equal to the reported prolonged speed of glass eels neither interaction between agents nor time varying temperature dependence on their swim speed was included in the model random error in the eel agent navigation was prescribed with a horizontal and vertical standard deviation of 5 and 0 respectively eqs 4 and 5 to include the effect of turbulence on movement important if the agents were drifting in the model the vertical diffusivity was calculated using eq 2 and the prandtl number was set to 0 5 bed friction in the model was assumed to be equal to a nikuradse roughness length of 0 01 m everywhere which is a typical value used for bed sediment composed of mixtures of mud sand and gravel soulsby 1990 for horizontal dispersion of the eel agents eq 1 a constant eddy viscosity coefficient of 0 1 m 2 s 1 was applied which is a typical value for estuaries fischer et al 1979 3 4 3 salinity detection threshold calibration the choice of threshold for the detection of salinity s t h r e s h was found to be an important calibration parameter for predicting the temporal trends observed in the eel trap catch data fig 3 a suitable value for salinity threshold was determined iteratively by running the abm several times for a range of different values and calculating the number of eels within 500 m distance of the entrance to brentford creek for comparison with the eel trap data in these tests the eel agents were programmed to perform all the stst behaviours but with no diel behaviour i e the same as scenario 9 in the stst sensitivity tests described in the following section an approximate estimate of the threshold value was first obtained by a visual comparison of the time series of salinity and trapped eel numbers at the mouth of brentford creek fig 3c at times when significant numbers of eels were trapped the modelled salinity at the entrance to the creek was generally less than 0 1 ppt assuming that this represented the approximate limit of the eel sensitivity to salinity three abm simulations were run using thresholds of 0 02 0 04 and 0 08 ppt from which a more precise threshold value could be determined the choice of salinity gradient threshold s t h r e s h was found to be less important than the salinity detection threshold s t h r e s h because in general the salinity in the thames estuary model showed strong gradients in places where the salinity was above the absolute salinity threshold it was therefore set to a value close to but slightly greater than zero to ensure a sensible directional cue was provided to the eels for navigation the chosen value for s t h r e s h used in all simulations was 10 7 ppt m 1 3 4 4 stst behaviour scenario testing to understand the relative importance of each of the stst behaviours described in section 2 2 a set of ten scenarios were simulated each with various parts of the behaviour switched off table 2 scenario 1 investigated the eel migration under the assumption of no stst behaviour other than navigation by detection of the salinity gradient the rest of the scenarios were chosen to evaluate the relative efficiency saving of each key behaviour compared to continuous active upstream swimming the first stst behaviour under investigation was downward migration and bed anchoring during the ebb tide because of its importance in migration this was switched on for all of the stst scenarios other than scenario 1 in most of the scenarios bed anchoring also occurred during daylight hours i e diel behaviour but this behaviour was switched off in three scenarios 4 8 and 9 to test its effect on migration also for most of the tests the eel agents were programmed to perform upward migration swimming to the surface during the flood tide where the flow was faster this behaviour was turned off in scenarios 2 and 5 in which case the eels were assumed to have no preference on height three of the scenarios 5 7 and 9 also investigated the effect of passive drifting rather than active swimming during the flood phase of the tide the last five scenarios included edging behaviour to assess its importance on migration the final scenario 10 used the same settings as scenario 6 but with a faster average swim speed of 0 35 m s 1 at the start of each model scenario eel agents were placed at a height of 0 1 m from the seabed in a 1 2 km square grid with a spacing of 5 m in the main channel close to the london gateway port approximately 14 km from the seaward boundary at southend pier fig 4 those initialised in water depths less than 0 1 m were removed since they were deemed to be stuck on intertidal areas i e mudflats resulting in a total of 58 057 placed agents all the model scenarios were run for the same five month 165 days period commencing at midnight on 18th april 2014 when data collection began at brentford with a computational time step of 30 s throughout each simulation batches of 24 agents were randomly selected every 2 h to be released from the start grid thus totalling 47 520 released the position order of the randomly selected agents was made to be the same for each modelled scenario by seeding the random number generator to a pre saved state at the start of each simulation the model output files recorded the agent positions swim speeds and heading at a sample interval of 15 min on completion of each simulation the files were post processed to determine the numbers of agents within a distance of 500 m of the entrance to brentford creek for assessing the efficiency of migration the model scenario data were further processed to determine information on the average through water distance swum the total migration time and the percentage of released agents arriving by the end of the simulation assuming the eels were inactive when their modelled swim speed was zero i e during bed anchoring or drifting the total migration time was further split into the average period of time that the agents were either actively swimming t a c t i v e or inactive t i n a c t i v e using these times an estimate of the relative energy expenditure e r e l of migration was calculated for each model scenario according to the following equation 6 e r e l m r r a t i o t a c t i v e t i n a c t i v e m r r a t i o t r e f e r e n c e in eq 6 the reference time t r e f e r e n c e is the average active migration time for the constant swimming scenario the calculation also requires an approximate value for the ratio m r r a t i o between active metabolic rate amr and inactive or standard metabolic rate smr no measurements of these parameters were found in the literature for juvenile eels however a previous study using 3 year old hatchery anguilla anguilla determined that the oxygen consumption rate a proxy for metabolic rate during swimming was approximately twice that during resting van ginneken et al 2005 assuming this ratio is the same for juvenile eels a value of m r r a t i o 2 was used 3 5 results 3 5 1 spatiotemporal patterns of migration up the estuary differences in spatiotemporal patterns between scenarios were generally small fig 5 in all scenarios the agents tended to congregate at the position of the contour of the salinity detection threshold s t h r e s h 0 04 ppt generally located between about 0 and 40 km from teddington the first subplot in fig 5 shows the results for scenario 1 constant swimming in this scenario the agents were relatively dispersed spatially compared to the other scenarios due to fact that the agents could not easily maintain proximity to the time varying location of the s t h r e s h contour in this scenario there was also some trapping of agents modelled at the entrance to the river derwent the agents in other scenarios that included vertical migration e g scenario 3 6 and 7 were more tightly arranged around the high tide position of the s t h r e s h contour red dashed line in fig 5 which was calculated by applying a peak finding algorithm to the time series of the along estuary distance of the s t h r e s h contour after first smoothing the series using a fourth order low pass butterworth filter with a 3 h cutoff the modelled aggregation of agents near to the high tide position of the s t h r e s h contour resulted in the more defined peaks in numbers of agents at the entrance to brentford creek especially when the s t h r e s h contour position coincided with the entrance at around high water slack for scenario 3 which includes stst behaviour without edging or drifting there is some trapping of agents in deptford creek including edging scenario 6 results in much less trapping of agents with very similar results to the full suite of stst behaviours scenario 7 in the final subplot in fig 5 3 5 2 salinity detection threshold calibration the salinity detection threshold s t h r e s h was calibrated using the results from three abm simulations covering a range of thresholds 0 02 0 04 and 0 08 ppt time series of the number of agents within a distance of 500 m of the entrance to brentford creek were extracted from each simulation and plotted with the measured eel trap data for visual comparison fig 6 to allow a clear comparison the modelled eel numbers were filtered using a 4th order low pass butterworth filter with a 5 h cut off frequency so as to remove the tidal signature in the agent numbers this was due to variability in the number of modelled agents passing the entrance to brentford creek at different stages of the tide thus creating scatter in the time series also the eel trap data were a cumulative measurement of eel numbers over the sample interval approximately 24 h and therefore tidal variability was not present in the data the modelled eel numbers were also arbitrarily scaled by a factor of 0 2 to allow a visual comparison with the eel trap data justifiable since absolute eel numbers entering the estuary and the trap efficiency was not known the timing of the peaks become less comparable to the data using the 0 08 ppt threshold fig 6 the results using the 0 02 and 0 04 ppt thresholds are very similar to each other but a 0 02 ppt threshold shows an early peak occurring in late july which is not in the trap data a threshold of 0 04 ppt was therefore chosen for the stst sensitivity tests 3 5 3 comparison between modelled and measured numbers of eels at brentford creek comparison of the time series of eel numbers near the entrance to brentford creek for all the modelled stst sensitivity tests shows only small differences between almost all of the scenarios fig 7 the exception is scenario 1 constant swimming which has a more gradual increase in arriving numbers with smaller peaks compared to the other scenarios whilst there are discrepancies in the absolute numbers the overall trends indicate that the abm performed well in predicting peak arrival times at brentford creek some differences can be seen between the model and observations for example there are some small early peaks in modelled eel numbers which are not observed in the data this might be due to over simplification in the model for example the arrival rate of the eels at the mouth of the thames in the model is assumed to be constant whereas in reality there is likely to be a gradual increase in numbers over time followed by a decrease due to the hatching rate of the eel larvae temperature dependency as described in section 3 3 and other variability along their journey from the sargasso sea small inaccuracies in the modelled salinity might also lead to relatively large differences since the threshold of salinity detection was found to be a sensitive parameter for controlling the timing of arrival of the eels the arrival rate is also likely to vary with offshore sea conditions the measured peaks in eel numbers tend to rise rapidly followed by a more gradual decrease the modelled peaks in agent numbers also rise in a similar manner but the numbers tend to remain higher for longer than the data followed by a rapid decrease a possible reason for this is that the model does not remove agents during the simulation as they pass stoney sluice differences between the model and observations are also expected because the eel trap measurements were made at stoney sluice at the junction with brent river which is located about 300 m upstream from the entrance to brentford creek the modelled agents on the other hand were counted in a zone centred on the entrance to the creek refer to fig 4 the agents were counted in this way because the creek entrance was not modelled in high detail and the creek did not extend all the way up to stoney sluice the unmodelled portion of the creek is coloured white in fig 4 a future improvement would be to more accurately represent the creek in the model despite all these potential sources of error the timing of the modelled peaks compare well with the trap data the time at which eels first start arriving at brentford creek and the general increase in numbers over time are also reproduced well in the model 3 5 4 relative efficiency of stst behaviours results from each of the model scenarios for assessing the efficiency of the various stst sub behaviours are shown in fig 8 fig 8a and 8b show the average distance swum and migration time sd to reach brentford creek respectively the migration time is split according to the amount of time spent being active i e swimming and inactive i e bed anchoring or drifting fig 8c shows the cumulative percentage of agents out of the total number of released agents that reached brentford creek by the end of each scenario the relative energy expenditure e r e l for each scenario calculated using eq 6 and expressed as percentages are given in table 3 ranked according to minimum energy overall if daylight avoidance diel behaviour was not included the most energy efficient migration was achieved using just two stst behaviours ebb tide bed anchoring and upward migration during flood scenario 4 with diel behaviour a factor likely to improve migration success due to reducing predation the most energy efficient scenario includes all of the stst behaviours scenario 7 the effect of the different tested behaviours on the model results will now be described in more detail constant swimming for scenario 1 which excluded any stst or diel behaviours the average migration time of 14 8 days was the fifth fastest out of the ten scenarios however because the agents spent the whole time actively swimming including during the fast flowing ebb tide which pushed them back seaward the average distance swum 253 km was the furthest out of all the runs with the same swim speed consequently it ranked seventh in terms of relative energy expenditure table 3 furthermore the percentage of released agents that made it to brentford creek by the end of the model run 79 was the second lowest overall diel behaviour in terms of relative energy expenditure scenarios that did not include diel behaviour other than constant swimming were the most efficient scenarios 4 8 and 9 the most energy efficient upstream migration scenario 4 was accomplished simply by implementing both bed anchoring behaviour during the ebb tide used in all scenarios except number 1 and upward migration during the flood tide used in all scenarios except numbers 1 2 and 5 using just these two behaviours scenario 4 resulted in the shortest time taken to reach brentford creek 10 9 days and the equal second shortest distance swum 124 km it also performed best in terms of energy expenditure table 3 using only 62 of the energy compared to constant swimming diel behaviour i e anchoring during daylight was found to reduce the efficiency of migration by increasing both the time of migration and the average distance swum this is shown in fig 8 by comparing scenario 3 with 4 and scenario 7 with 9 for scenario 3 the average distance swum was 176 km reducing to 124 km in scenario 4 which had diel behaviour switched off similarly the distance swum reduced from 124 to 113 km for scenarios 7 and 9 in both cases the agents swam less distance and a higher percentage successfully arrived when they did not perform diel behaviour although scenario 4 performed best overall in terms of energy usage the most optimal strategy in terms of distance swum was scenario 9 which included all of the considered behavioural strategies other than diel behaviour under this treatment the average distance swum to reach brentford creek was 113 km lowest overall the average time taken was 14 3 days fourth lowest and 88 1 second highest of the released agents arrived successfully fig 8c scenario 2 was the only scenario with standard swim speed that was less efficient than constant swimming scenario 1 with a relative energy expenditure of 109 this is because the energy saving due to ebb tide bed anchoring was not enough to overcome the additional energy expenditure due to diel behaviour i e additional time spent anchoring on the bed however by further including upward migration scenario 3 a relatively large increase in efficiency was achieved with the distance swum reducing from 239 km to 176 km and the time of migration reducing from 18 days to 14 2 days the resultant reduction in energy expenditure 26 was the largest efficiency saving due to the addition of any single behaviour drifting passively drifting rather than swimming during the flood tide as in scenarios 5 7 and 9 reduced the average distance the agents had to swim to reach brentford creek but increased the duration of the migration this is seen in fig 8 by comparing scenarios 6 and 7 in the which the modelled distance swum reduced from 159 km to 124 km respectively whereas the average time taken increased from 13 6 to 15 0 days the overall effect in terms of energy expenditure table 3 was beneficial but only for scenarios that included diel behaviour with diel behaviour the effect of including drifting is shown by comparing scenario 6 with 7 in which the relative energy expenditure decreased slightly from 78 and 76 or scenario 2 with 5 which showed a decrease from 109 to 88 without diel behaviour the effect of drifting is seen by comparing scenario 8 with 9 in which the relative energy expenditure rose from 65 to 71 edging including edging behaviour scenarios 6 to 10 had the effect of reducing energy expenditure but again only for scenarios that included diel behaviour comparing scenario 3 with 6 which included diel behaviour the addition of edging behaviour resulted in a slight reduction in average distance swum 176 to 159 km and a decrease in time taken 14 2 to 13 6 days this led to a reduction in the relative energy expenditure from 83 to 78 ranked sixth and fifth in table 3 in contrast comparing scenario 4 and 8 ranked first and second which did not include diel behaviour the addition of edging behaviour resulted in a slight increase in the distance swum 124 to 131 km time taken 10 9 to 11 3 days and relative energy expenditure 62 to 65 edging behaviour also led to a marked increase in the percentage of released agents reaching brentford creek rising from 84 5 to 89 8 for scenario 3 and 6 respectively a similar increase was modelled between scenario 4 86 and 8 89 6 this appears to be due to fewer agents becoming trapped in creeks and on tidal flats in particular deptford creek and mucking flats further downstream fig 5 faster swim speed scenario 10 which used the same parameters as scenario 6 but with a faster average swim speed was by far the least efficient option 135 of the energy expended compared to scenario 1 the total distance swum was 309 km which was almost double the distance swum for scenario 6 however this scenario did result in the largest number of agents arriving at brentford creek by the end of the simulation 92 6 4 case study 2 assessment of juvenile eel entrainment in a power station intake and outfall in milford haven waterway 4 1 overview in this case study the developed abm is used to predict the rate of entrainment of juvenile eels in the cooling water intake and outfall of pembroke gas fired power station during their migration up milford haven waterway mhw in relation to those successfully reaching any of the rivers adjoining the estuary 4 2 site description the study location is situated in southwest wales where the eastern and western cleddeau rivers merge with the river carew and creswell river to form the daugleddau estuary fig 2 this drains into the celtic sea along with the pembroke river via the mhw with a length of approximately 27 km and surface area of 55 km 2 it is the largest estuary in wales it originated as a flooded valley during the last ice age and as a result is one of the deepest natural harbours in the world since the 1960s it has been extensively used for industry freight and tourism the cooling water intake to pembroke gas fired power station is located in the pembroke river close to where it merges with the mhw whereas the outfall is located in the mhw fig 9 although there is currently no commercial eel fishing on the mhw it is close to the severn estuary which features intensive fisheries ices 2014 it can therefore be hypothesised that juvenile eels are capable of entering the mhw and attempt to progress inland via this estuary small numbers of juvenile eels have indeed been recorded as part of the monitoring of impingement of fish on the screens installed on the intakes of the power station generally fewer than 10 juvenile eels are found per year in either january or february rwe npower pers comm however the 6 mm mesh size of the screens is large enough for juvenile eels to pass through and losses could be considerably higher environment agency 2015 4 3 methods 4 3 1 hydrodynamic model description a 3d hydrodynamic model of mhw which included the cooling intake and outfall of pembroke gas fired power station was provided by rwe npower fig 9 the model which simulated temperature and salinity as coupled tracers was developed using the delft3d modelling suite https oss deltares nl web delft3d the model mesh consisted of a curvilinear grid made up of 7864 active horizontal cells and 10 planes spaced equally between the bed and the water surface resolution of the model varied spatially from 15 m inside the estuary to up to 500 m in offshore regions the total duration of the simulated flows was 15 days i e a spring neap cycle 4 3 2 power station intake and outfall entrainment assessment the same parameters as used for scenario 7 from the thames estuary simulations were used i e all stst behaviours and diel behaviour but now applied to the milford haven waterway these settings were the most energy efficient out of the tested scenarios that included diel behaviour table 3 agents were released into the model en masse at the start of the simulation in a rectangular region 1578 x 1442 m in the mouth of mhw fig 9 the horizontal spacing of the released agents in this areas was 5 m resulting in a total of 91 324 individuals released which were then tracked for the 15 day period as they navigated up the estuary to assess the probability of entrainment agents entering the power station intake and outfall at each model time step were counted to understand the relative impacts on numbers agents were also counted when they reached either of the rivers that flow into mhw this was achieved by defining rectangles at the intakes outfall and each of the tributaries fig 10 individuals entering the rectangles were assumed to have either been entrained or reached a tributary and were counted according to their location and then removed from the simulation 4 4 results the cumulative number of modelled agents entering either the power station intake or outfall or successfully reaching each of the adjoining rivers is shown in fig 11 over the 15 day model duration the majority 77 3 of agents reached one of the rivers the predicted number of eels entering the intake and outfall of the power station was 2 0 and 4 7 respectively for those that successfully reach a river the highest percentage of agents reached the western cleddau with a total of 22 7 table 4 the adjacent cleddau ddu received 19 7 of agents far fewer tended to swim up the cresswell and carew river at 4 6 and 9 0 respectively pembroke river received the second highest percentage of released agents at 22 5 this is interesting because to get up the pembroke eels need to swim past the entrance of the intake since 2 of the release agents entered the intake equal to 9 of those entering through the confluence of the pembroke and mhw it suggests that the intake is suitably located for preventing eels from swimming into it for most of the time this finding is consistent with the small numbers of juvenile eels recorded as being impinged on the intake screens mentioned earlier although further measurements would be required to substantiate this on closer inspection of the model results it was apparent that at the intake the negative salinity gradient vectors i e towards fresh water tended to point up the pembroke river rather than towards the intake since the modelled eels preferentially orientated according to this gradient they generally swam or drifted up the river rather than into the intake entrainment occurred for a short period each tide just after low slack water when higher salinity water started to enter the pembroke as this water flowed past the entrance to the intake which still contained relatively low salinity water the gradient vectors briefly pointed towards the intake mimicking a flood tide and the agents drifted into the intake thus being entrained the larger number of agents swimming into the outfall 4 7 of those released can be explained by the relatively low salinity of the discharged cooling water compared to the ambient salinity in the mhw which the eel agents perceived as a river flow the lower salinity is due to intake drawing water from inside pembroke river interestingly agents were only able to swim into the outfall when the tide was above approximately mean water level below this water level the shallow depth meant that the flow speed of the outfall discharge exceeded the swim speed of the agents thus preventing them from entering the outfall if this had not been the case then it is likely that the numbers entering the outfall would have been significantly higher it is noted that a lack of reliable in situ data on eel entrainment at the power station means these modelled entrainment rates cannot yet be confirmed 5 discussion 5 1 key behaviours affecting migration efficiency including the selective tidal stream transport stst behaviours was found to be essential in reproducing the observed arrival patterns of juvenile eels in the thames case study more specifically the inclusion of downward migration and anchoring at the bed in response to the ebbing tide was found to have the greatest effect on improving the comparison with eel trap data scenarios that included downward migration to the bed during the ebb tide and upward migration to the surface at the beginning of each flood tide led to the fastest migration times and shortest average distance swum this is because the tidal current speeds are fastest at the surface and the vertical distance to reach the surface is relatively small order of a few metres the importance of vertical migration and bed anchoring behaviours in response to tidal state is supported by numerous investigations which show that the number of juvenile eel caught using nets in estuaries tends to be higher during the flood tide than during the ebb sheldon and mccleave 1985 mccleave and kleckner 1982 tzeng 1985 mcgovern and mccarthy 1992 ciccotti et al 1995 arribas et al 2012 in terms of relative energy expenditure a clear distinction was found between scenarios which included diel behaviour and those that did not without diel behaviour the energy expenditure was lower this is understandable since diel behaviour i e bed anchoring during daylight is for predator avoidance rather than efficiency of movement the most energy efficient scenario overall did not include diel behaviour and only included bed anchoring during the ebb and upward migration during the flood scenario 4 however with diel behaviour included the most efficient method was found to be that which included all of the stst behaviours scenario 7 interestingly for scenarios that did not include diel behaviour but included bed anchoring and upward migration the addition of both edging and drifting behaviours resulted in an increase in energy expenditure for example scenario 9 which included all stst behaviours apart from diel behaviour only ranked third in terms of energy expenditure behind scenario 8 which did not include edging table 3 scenarios that included diel behaviour showed the opposite effect with energy expenditure reduced if edging or drifting were added the effectiveness of edging behaviour by juvenile eels has not been reported on widely elsewhere during this study edging was found to reduce the distance swum to reach brentford creek reasons for this are difficult to determine precisely from the model results but it is likely to be a combination of several factors for instance flows along channel margins are generally slower thus offer less impedance the shallower depths also mean that the eels can swim to the bottom for anchoring more quickly when necessary keeping to the side of the estuary with the slowest ebb tide flows also has the effect of directing the eels to the inside of meanders thus leading to a shorter and more optimal route in the model results edging behaviour also increased the agents chances of successfully reaching brentford creek it is unclear exactly why this is the case but it appeared that the lateral movement helped the agents avoid obstacles such as bridge piers headlands or embayments along the route to simulate the edging behaviour a relatively simple yet effective method was developed and implemented whereby the eels altered their heading by 45 towards slower water either side of them aiming directly towards the channel edges i e adjusting their direction by 90 was found to be detrimental to their movement because the flow tended to carry them downstream whereas adjusting by 45 towards the lower flow direction meant that half of their swim speed was utilised in swimming against the flow since by definition the flow speed during edging was less than or equal to their swim speed they then lost relatively little ground the active swim speed of the agents was also found to be an important parameter for migration efficiency swimming faster was found to reduce the overall efficiency and perhaps counter intuitively did not improve the time of migration this was because a main limiting factor on the agent progression in this instance was the salinity detection threshold s t h r e s h which due to the low salinity in the estuary between april and june initially prevented them from navigating directly to brentford creek hence although the agents swam faster they simply reached the freshwater more quickly and then could not navigate further due to the lack of a salinity gradient to follow the subsequent delay therefore meant they expended more energy 5 2 the importance of freshwater discharge on navigation during the modelling of eel migration in the thames estuary case study it was found that the detection threshold for salinity was an important calibration parameter during periods of low river discharge especially during larger spring tides the saltwater mixing zone progresses further inland and hence the eels look for sources of freshwater further up the estuary seasonal and daily variability in river discharge therefore must play a role in the navigation of eels in estuaries river discharge is generally not reported as often as other factors such as temperature as a cue for eel migration and it can also have an inhibiting effect if the discharge is high enough to lead to fast opposing flow speeds gandolfi et al 1984 mouton et al 2011 river discharge tends to have a gradual effect on the large scale salinity distribution in estuaries as a result of mixing with tidal saline waters cresci 2020 more locally for example near weirs and sluices the variability in river discharge will have a more pronounced effect on the salinity and or odour concentration and therefore will be more important for navigation over shorter time and space scales in this modelling study it has been assumed that the eels directly detect the salinity or rather the freshness of the water in order to align themselves for navigation however they could alternatively use their olfactory organs to sense some other chemical compound within the water other than salinity previous researchers have shown that juvenile eels prefer natural inland surface water over odourless water with the same physical properties creutzberg 1961 attractive substances include but are not limited to earthy and green odours sola and tongiorgi 1996 amino acids sola et al 1993 and bile salts or taurine which are readily released from other eels sola and tosi 1993 whatever the attractive property of the freshwater the outcome of modelling is likely to be broadly similar to that presented here this is because what is being modelled is the mixing of two water bodies distinguished according to the concentration of a conservative dissolved tracer either salinity or odour the concentration of a detectable odour would therefore vary spatially in a similar way to the ratio of freshwater to seawater an exception to this would be if the odour was specific to just one river adjoining an estuary in which case navigation would be more directed to that river another exception would be if the odour was non conservative i e it decayed over time via chemical reaction or adsorption onto particulate matter in which case the concentration could decrease more quickly with distance away from the source of input further work is required in this area 5 3 a tool for assessing barriers to eel recruitment the milford haven waterway test case highlighted how the abm developed here can potentially be used to assess entrainment or impingement of individuals at power station intakes this demonstrated how such models could be a useful tool for assisting in the design stage and environmental impact assessment for new power stations and other infrastructure such as tidal turbines in turn such tools are valuable in enabling management to identify and mitigate for the adverse effects of human exploitation of waterways on the migratory success and population status of an endangered species that has experienced a strong decline in recruitment in the past decades ices 2017 an example of this would be to rerun the thames model without richmond weir in place to see what impact it had on the salinity and hence migration patterns of the eels 5 4 model limitations and future developments it has been shown in this study that by using a combination of the local salinity or odour gradient and the current velocity field as a navigational cue modelled agents are able to swim autonomously up estuary to reach the source of freshwater however it is acknowledged that the behavioural rules governing the eel movement are largely based on theory and there is an urgent need for more data from field and laboratory experiments using live animals to provide supporting or contradictory evidence for all of the behaviours included in the abm additional behavioural rules some of which have been suggested in the literature that would benefit from further supporting data and which could readily be implemented and tested in the model are described below in terms of navigation it is assumed in the abm that the agents are able to simply detect the salinity gradient and flow velocity field at their present location in time and space whilst the flow velocity field and velocity gradients may be detected using the lateral lines along either side of the eels bodies bleckmann and zelick 2009 the method by which juvenile eels detect the salinity or odour gradient might require a behavioural mechanism one possibility is that the eels assess the change in salinity over time whilst they are anchored on the bed during the ebb tide cresci 2020 this would provide them with a reference frame for assessing the relative directions of the flow and salinity gradients since the model already includes bed anchoring behaviour this detail could be easily incorporated into the abm it has been shown that eels can sense the earth s magnetic field cresci et al 2017 which could provide them with a reference frame regardless of whether they were anchored on the bed this could assist in determining the correct direction of navigation and requires further investigation the described model currently only considers a specific stage of eels migration as they pass through an estuary the abm could be extended further to simulate the change in behaviour as the eels reach the river currently in the model when the agents reach freshwater they are not able to continue migrating since there is no longer a salinity gradient for them to orientate themselves additional navigational cues such as a time decaying odours are therefore likely to be important for their migration a physiological characteristic which might also be important for helping the agents transition between saline to freshwater is the recent finding that they have an accurate circatidal rhythm which allows them to remember the timing of the flood and ebb tides and behave accordingly cresci et al 2017 there are also possible improvements to be made in the agents ability to avoid becoming stranded on intertidal areas in the thames estuary case study significant numbers of modelled agents became stranded on mucking flats this is unlikely to happen in reality because the eels are able to move over sufficiently damp land which is a behaviour that was not included in the model described here other land avoidance mechanisms could also be included to help reduce stranding such as programming the agents to swim in the direction of the flow when they encounter very shallow water a potentially important environmental variable currently not included in the model is turbidity in waters with high suspended sediment concentrations such as the thames estuary baugh et al 2013 the associated reduction in underwater light due to turbidity is likely to reduce or even remove the requirement for diel behaviour the model scenario testing carried out in this study suggested that the inclusion of diel behaviour significantly reduced the migration efficiency hence to accurately simulate upstream migration in a particular estuary the abm might be improved by including the response of juvenile eels to local underwater light levels caused by both daylight and time varying turbidity achieving this would require laboratory measurements on eel behaviour in response to light levels and also a well calibrated 3d suspended sediment model of the estuary including the above factors would make for an interesting continuation of the current work other future directions would be to use the abm to assess climate change and associated effects of multiple factors e g increases in habitat fragmentation water abstraction rates and water temperature on eel recruitment drouineau et al 2018 finally there are several other species that make use of stst as juveniles e g plaice and our abm could be used to assess their upstream migration with adaptations to species specific behavioural rules forward and tankersley 2001 credit authorship contribution statement thomas benson

24658,recruitment of temperate eel species anguilla anguilla a rostrata a japonica has declined over the last few decades due to human activities such as overfishing and construction of migratory barriers e g dams weirs and sluices and hazardous energy infrastructure e g turbines intakes and outfalls numerical models substantiated with data from field and laboratory studies can potentially predict and quantify the relative impacts of such activities thereby assisting in the sustainable management of eel populations here we present an agent based model abm of juvenile eel migration up estuaries the model includes relevant eel behaviours and environmental conditions that according to the literature influence upstream migration crucially by assessing the local salinity gradient and relative flow direction the modelled eels agents self determine whether the tide is flooding or ebbing and orientate themselves for navigation with no top down instructions this allows the agents to decide which particular behaviour to undertake as part of selective tidal stream transport stst the developed abm is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of the thames estuary and the results substantiated by comparison against eel trap data combinations of the various stst behaviours are systematically tested and the influence they have on up estuary migration is assessed in terms of relative energy expenditure the parameterised model is then used predictively at milford haven waterway to investigate potential impacts on the juvenile eel population due to entrainment in a power plant cooling water intake and outfall results from the thames model case study indicate that including bed anchoring behaviour is essential for achieving a good comparison with the eel trap data and the choice of salinity detection threshold is also important if daylight avoidance diel behaviour is not included the most energy efficient migration is achieved using just two stst behaviours ebb tide bed anchoring and upward migration during flood with diel behaviour included energy expenditure is greater but some efficiency is regained by including all of the stst behaviours for the milford haven case study the model predicted a juvenile eel intake and outfall entrainment rate of 2 0 and 4 7 respectively it is concluded that the abm is a valuable tool for assessing potential impacts on the recruitment of eels extendable to other species and could be used to assist in site selection and low impact design of energy infrastructure in tidal environments keywords abm agent based model glass eel elver ibm migration selective tidal stream transport 1 introduction all anguillid eels have a catadromous life cycle in which the juveniles migrate from the ocean into rivers where they mature for several years and then return to the ocean as adult silver eels to spawn tesch 2008 the focus of this study is the swimming behaviour of juvenile european eels anguilla anguilla in the latter stages of their migration as they progress up macro tidal 1 1 where the tidal range is in excess of 4 m estuaries to reach freshwater environments at this stage in their life cycle they are approximately 8 12 cm in length and translucent so referred to as glass eels and become elvers when more pigmented in this study the term juvenile eel will be used to describe both of these stages and for brevity we will usually refer to them as simply eel hereafter unless clarity is needed furthermore numerically modelled eel individuals will generally be referred to as agents the international union for conservation of nature iucn has classified the status of the european eel as critically endangered their decline is thought to be due to various anthropogenic factors dekker 2003 macgregor et al 2008 arai 2014 such as entrainment in power plant intakes and outfalls or impingement on screens piper et al 2015 blockage due to poorly designed fish passes and weirs amaral et al 2002 russon et al 2010 calles et al 2013 vowles et al 2015 population losses due to commercial fishing ices 2014 and impacts on larval stages due to climate change knights 2003 bonhommeau et al 2008 in an attempt to re establish the european eel populations legislation has been passed whereby eu member states must identify suitable eel habitats and manage these in a manner that ensures sufficient escapement of adult eels to the sea european commission 2007 to achieve this annual data on recruitment and commercial or recreational catch data are required ices 2017 currently recruitment estimates and trends are derived from local catch data annually across the western part of europe ices 2017 and this information can further be used to provide larger scale estimates of recruitment via empirical modelling briand et al 2006 bru et al 2009 despite numerous studies into the topic of eel migration current knowledge of how eels migrate from the continental shelf through tidal estuaries and into freshwater environments is limited cresci 2020 this is partly due to the difficulty of monitoring these small semi transparent life stages which tend to migrate during the night to avoid predation often in turbid water i e low underwater light transmission levels caused by suspended sediment most information on their migratory behaviour has therefore been obtained from controlled laboratory experiments and from catch data using fishing nets or eel traps located on weirs or sluices laboratory studies have been used to determine the swimming speeds of juvenile european eel vezza et al 2020 recorded a sustained swim speed 20 200 min duration of approximately 0 05 m s 1 prolonged speeds up to 20 min duration of between 0 2 to 0 4 m s 1 dependent on water temperature and maximum burst speeds of up to about 0 5 m s 1 field studies have also shown that they are unable to progress upstream against currents greater than 0 36 to 0 50 m s 1 creutzberg 1961 mccleave 1980 depth averaged flow speeds in many estuaries often exceed 1 m s 1 during the outbound ebb tide it is therefore necessary that the eels perform decision making and exhibit behavioural strategies that allow them to efficiently make headway to reach the tidal limit a conceptual model that describes how eels navigate up estuaries is called selective tidal stream transport harrison et al 2014 in this model eel individuals follow three key behavioural regimes in response to the time varying state of the tide first during the inbound flood tide the eels are assumed to drift with the flow to conserve energy and are dispersed throughout the water column second after slack high water during the early stages of the following outbound ebb tide the eels are assumed to move towards the edges of the channel where the flows are slower thus allowing them to continue progressing upstream third as the ebb flows increase the eels are assumed to swim to the bed and anchor themselves thus preventing themselves from being carried back downstream one way of quantitatively assessing the advantages or disadvantages of stst behaviour for example in terms of energy expenditure is to use a numerical model key variables such as swim speed can be easily manipulated in a numerical model and assessed in terms of relative sensitivity on the outcomes furthermore a wide variety of conditions can be tested numerical models can also help to bridge gaps in understanding between data collected from field or laboratory studies grimm and railsback 2005 field data such as from net catches or eel traps are crucial for supporting a model or theory but are often sparse or incomplete in both time and space on the other hand data sets from small scale laboratory studies are useful for isolating and quantifying behaviours in a controlled manner e g swim speed light sensitivity or rheotaxis 2 2 the movement of an organism towards or away from an oncoming current of water making them suitable for gathering model calibration data however laboratory experiments cannot incorporate all of the complexity of the physical estuarine environment such as tidal flows river discharge turbidity daylight salinity and temperature which all affect eel behaviour to some degree cresci 2020 and vary continuously in space and time combining the three disciplines i e numerical models in situ data collection and controlled laboratory experiments is therefore crucial for gaining a better understanding of the migratory behaviour of eels and indeed other fish species one form of numerical model that is suitable for simulating fish dynamics and behaviour is an agent based model abms within an abm a collection of autonomous decision making entities called agents are represented and each agent individually assesses its situation and makes decisions on the basis of a set of rules bonabeau 2002 this approach can be applied to simulating the movements and decision making of fish in which individuals use relatively simple behavioural rules that are dependent on their surrounding environment jager and deangelis 2018 abms have been applied successfully in ecological research and are a valuable tool in predicting fish recruitment deangelis and mooij 2005 mclane et al 2011 for example past modelling studies have reproduced annual trends and estimates for species such as atlantic cod gadus morhua and european anchovy engraulis encrasicolus daewel et al 2015 ospina alvarez et al 2015 abms of fish behaviour have also been used successfully at smaller temporal and spatial scales for example goodwin et al 2006 developed an abm using a eulerian lagrangian agent method elam to mimic the swimming behaviour of fish around man made structures such as fish passes and weirs in the present study an abm is developed for simulating the upstream migration of european eel through macro tidal estuaries behavioural rules and abilities of the eels are defined based on an earlier assessment of the literature on this subject cresci 2020 parameterisation and testing of the model is performed using two case studies in the first case study the abm is coupled to a three dimensional hydrodynamic model of the thames estuary uk the aim of this case study is to assess the relative importance of the various stst behaviours on migration efficiency and to verify the model results against eel trap data collected at stoney sluice in brentford where the river brent joins the tidal thames in the second case study the parameterised abm is applied to the milford haven waterway estuarine environment and used to predict entrainment of eels in the cooling water intake and outfall of pembroke power station 2 agent based model description this section describes the abm which consists of a particle tracking model and an eel behaviour model user specified parameter values for the described formulae vary according to calibration and are given in the subsequent case study sections 2 1 particle tracking model the general approach of the abm is to simulate agents in this case eels as a set of discrete points lagrangian framework which move within and are influenced by the three dimensional flow field provided by a gridded hydrodynamic model eulerian framework the underlying model for performing the lagrangian calculations without eel behaviour is called hydroboids which was developed previously at hr wallingford for modelling dispersion of fish larvae wallingford 2016 behaviour of fish species in response to stimuli such as underwater noise benson et al 2016 and assessing collisions of marine species with tidal turbines rossington and benson 2020 the model which is coded in the matlab programming environment www mathworks com was further developed during the current work to include the behaviour of juvenile eel migration up estuaries described in section 2 2 hydroboids requires as input the 3d flow vector field from a eulerian grid hydrodynamic model and then performs the necessary time and space interpolation for obtaining the velocity vector at the centre of each modelled agent using this information the cumulative displacement d x d y d z of each agent located at x x y z is tracked at discrete time intervals d t using a standard particle tracking formula monti and leuzzi 2010 with an additional term for the agent swim velocity components written as 1 d x t d y t d z t u x t v x t w x t u a t v a t w a t 2 k x 0 0 0 2 k y 0 0 0 2 k z γ x γ y γ z d t for each agent the resultant path travelled is a function of the 3d flow velocity vector u v w the agent s swim vector u a v a w a and turbulent diffusion which is calculated using the diagonal components of the eulerian eddy diffusivity tensor k x k y k z and independent random numbers γ x γ y γ z for each axis selected from a normal distribution with mean of zero and variance of one n 0 1 the vertical component of the eddy diffusivity in eq 1 varies with height z above the bed and is modelled using a mixing length model prandtl 1925 as a function of the bed shear velocity u water depth h and a characteristic mixing length κ 0 41 as 2 k z z β κ u z 1 z h the bed shear velocity in eq 2 is in turn dependent on the flow speed water depth and bed friction z 0 as 3 u κ u z ln z z 0 bed friction is prescribed in the model using a nikuradse roughness length which is related to z 0 as k s 30 z 0 nikuradse 1933 β is the prandtl number with a value between 0 and 1 to reduce the turbulent displacement since fish will disperse less quickly than the water for the horizontal diffusion k x and k y a constant eddy diffusivity coefficient is applied everywhere in both the x and y directions at a specified time step interval the 3d positions of all the tracked agents are saved to binary results files for subsequent post processing information on the swim speed heading and elevation angle of the agents is also recorded in the file to allow 3d visualisation of the their movements 2 2 eel behaviour model the abm of upstream migrating eels was developed during this study using the three stst regimes of behaviour which occur at different stages of the tidal cycle flood ebb and early ebb tide importantly the modelled eels or agents are assumed to be able to determine the tidal state and hence which regime they are in by assessing the local salinity gradient and flow velocity field they are therefore self governing agents without any external top down instructions on their movement the dynamics of the model are described below and represented as a flowchart in fig 1 2 2 1 initialisation at the start of the simulation t 0 eel agents are placed into the flow model domain as discrete points in 3d space x y z within a user defined region the swim speed of each agent v s w i m is randomly selected from a gaussian distribution of speeds with a specified mean v s w i m and standard deviation σ s w i m obtained from laboratory experiments performed over a range of temperatures to represent the variability in the population vezza et al 2020 the swim speed for each agent remains constant throughout a simulation except for when they temporarily anchor themselves at the bed section 2 2 4 or drift during the flood tide section 2 2 5 the initial heading θ s w i m of each agent is also randomly selected between 0 and 360 and the elevation angles ϕ s w i m are initialised to zero the behavioural rules then bias subsequent swim angles according to the salinity and tide 2 2 2 position updating and land avoidance before the new agent position is calculated using eq 1 additional random variability in the agent navigation other than turbulence is applied by adding a small angular error or persistence angle in radians to both the agent s heading θ s w i m and vertical elevation angle ϕ s w i m at each time step eq 4 and 5 the persistence angle is selected from a normal distribution which has a mean of zero and separate standard deviations for the horizontal and vertical σ h and σ v then added to the heading and elevation angle of the fish in the polar coordinate system in general a smaller standard deviation for vertical persistence σ v is used since fish tend to navigate more in the horizontal direction 4 θ s w i m θ s w i m n 0 σ h 2 5 ϕ s w i m ϕ s w i m n 0 σ v 2 because the persistence angle is applied to the agent s heading the magnitude of the resultant navigation error at each time step is dependent on the swim speed of the agent becoming zero if the swim speed is zero i e drifting vertical turbulent eddy viscosity k z on the other hand varies according to flow speed and depth becoming zero in still water it is therefore important to model random displacement due to both persistence error and turbulent diffusion using the set of agent swim speeds v s w i m modified headings θ s w i m and elevation angles ϕ s w i m from either the initialisation step or the end of the previous time step in addition to the interpolated flow vectors v f l o w the agents are moved to their new positions according to eq 1 see section 2 1 the moved agents can occasionally encounter land either by crossing a model land boundary or by entering dry areas with zero water depth such as tidal flats in such instances to simulate active avoidance behaviour by an agent an iterative process occurs in the model whereby the agent modifies its previous trajectory heading by 10 degree increments simultaneously both left and right of its current heading and tests to see if the new position is within water the first non dry position is kept and the iterations are finished if the heading increments reach 180 degrees then the agent is assumed to be stranded on a dry model element and its original position at the beginning of the time step is kept stranded agents are assumed to survive in the model and they reattempt navigation during each subsequent model iteration this allows the agents to be re entrained into the water column on a following high tide 2 2 3 assessment of tidal state at the beginning of each time step the eel agents assess the surrounding salinity gradients interpolated from the hydrodynamic model at their body centres for each agent if the salinity is detectable s s t h r e s h and there is also a discernible horizontal salinity gradient s s t h r e s h the agent actively aligns itself with the flow vectors refer to section 3 4 2 for threshold values the direction of alignment with or against the flow vector is chosen to be that closest to the direction of decreasing salinity θ s and in doing so it is assumed to be pointing up the estuary the direction of the flow vector relative to the agent s heading consequently determines whether the agent detects an ebbing or flooding tide and hence determines which behaviour the agent will perform during this model time interval fig 1 if an agent enters a freshwater region or a region where there is no salinity gradient then it is assumed to have no directional cue to follow in this case it continues in the same direction as the previous time interval using a correlated random walk eq 4 and 5 the agent might therefore continue up the estuary even if there are meanders by encountering the banks and consequently following the channel alignment there is also a chance that it will turn around due to the random walk or it may become trapped in an embayment until the salinity returns to higher levels on a subsequent flood tide 2 2 4 ebb tide behaviour when an agent detects that it is an ebb tide if the local flow speed is less than the agent s initialised swim speed v f l o w v s w i m initiation of so called edging behaviour occurs fig 1 edging is most likely to occur close to either high or low water during the early or late ebb but its effect will be greatest during early ebb because of the higher tidal level at this time and hence wider channel cross section a minimum threshold on local water depth h m i n is used to prevent agents from swimming into very shallow water and getting stuck on intertidal areas if either the flow speed or minimum depth criteria are not met edging behaviour is not initiated when activated each affected agent moves towards the channel boundaries whilst also swimming against the flow this is achieved by adjusting the heading of the agent by 45 from its present flow aligned heading towards decreasing flows during stronger ebb tide flows when by default an agent will be heading into the flow 45 if the oncoming current speed exceeds its swim speed v f l o w v s w i m fig 1 then it actively migrates down to the bed at a user specified elevation angle ϕ m i g when within a small distance of the bed z m i n the agent is assumed to hold itself stationary on the substrate referred to as bed anchoring behaviour as soon as the agent is able to make headway against the flow v f l o w v s w i m this behaviour ceases and the agent s speed is returned to its initial speed upwards migration or drifting is then initiated as described in the following section 2 2 5 flood tide behaviour when an agent detects that it is a flood tide if the flow speed is less than the agent s initial swim speed then it swims upwards towards the surface at a user specified elevation angle ϕ m i g if the flow speed is faster then the agent s swim speed is set to zero to simulate drifting behaviour fig 1 thus saving energy during upstream movement during drifting behaviour the eel agents are treated as passive lagrangian particles which are advected and dispersed solely by the 3d modelled currents and turbulence 2 2 6 diel behaviour previous field studies have reported that juvenile eels avoid daylight presumably as an anti predatory behaviour and migrate mainly during hours of darkness de casamajor et al 1999 during daylight hours they stay hidden in the deeper parts of the water column and halt their movements to simulate this diel behaviour the time of day is assessed in the model at each time interval between sunrise and sunset it is assumed the agents are able to detect the sunlight and are programmed to swim to the bed then anchor themselves as described in section 2 2 4 this behaviour is not strictly part of the stst set of behaviours but was included in the model in order to investigate the cost in terms of relative energy expenditure due to this known anti predatory behaviour 3 case study 1 modelling juvenile eel migration in the thames estuary 3 1 overview this case study assesses the relative importance of the various stst behaviours for eel migration the model results are also verified against eel trap data collected at stoney sluice in brentford creek a tributary to the tidal thames 3 2 site description the thames is the second longest river in the united kingdom ranging over 346 km from its source in gloucestershire to the estuary which passes through central london and continues to its mouth at southend on sea essex where it drains into the north sea the thames river basin district rbd covers and area of approximately 16 000 km 2 including the greater london area and parts of oxfordshire and kent defra 2010 fig 2 the tidal limit is at teddington lock approximately 112 km from the mouth 3 3 observations of juvenile eels in the thames historically the river supported eel fisheries but the population severely declined due to anthropogenic actions e g water pollution in the 1980s and flood defence engineering and barrier construction naismith and knights 1988 defra 2010 monitoring of juvenile eel migration has intermittently been conducted in the past between 1985 and 1987 traps were installed at locations near the estuary tidal limit and further upstream and around 9000 individuals were caught mostly glass eels naismith and knights 1988 between 2005 and 2009 three tributaries rivers roding darent and mole were sampled with similar traps and a decrease in recruitment of 99 was reported gollock et al 2011 since 2011 the zoological society of london zsl and the environment agency has been involved in monitoring of numbers of migrating juvenile eels in the thames rbd at several monitoring sites ewcp 2017 the 2014 trap data for one of the sites stoney sluice in brentford lat 51 48424 lon 0 30957 has been used here to parameterise the abm stoney sluice is at the junction between the river brent and brentford creek which adjoins the tidal thames the 2014 stoney sluice eel trap data fig 3 show that eels mainly started passing the sluice in early july and there was a general increase in trapped numbers throughout the measurement period to the end of september the time series consists of a number of peaks separated by periods of a few days up to about 10 days when the number of trapped eels decreased by an order of magnitude according to the survey logs the traps continued to work well during most of the measurement period thus discounting this as the cause of the variability however there is a two week period august 13th to 26th during which no eel trap data were recorded due to pump failure fig 3 eels started to arrive during a period of very low run off and the peaks appear to coincide with short term increases in run off presumably due to rain events fig 3a however it is not clear from this visual comparison how river discharge could explain all of the peaks and troughs in the eel count data another possible cause of the temporal variability in eel counts is temperature field experiments conducted by various researchers in estuaries other than the thames have found a link between temperature and the onset of migration gascuel 1986 moriarty 1986 white and knights 1997a b migration peak white and knights 1997a and the number of migrants hvidsten 1985 vøllestad and jonsson 1988 in general the minimum threshold for migration up estuaries to occur has been reported to be between 10 14 c with increased migration above 14 16 c and peaking at 18 20 c white and knights 1997a b moriarty 1986 naismith and knights 1988 for the present study water temperature data were available at a recording station at kew approximately 1 km from the entrance to brentford creek fig 3b water temperature was greater than 14 c for the whole data period hence temperature is unlikely to be a limiting factor on migration during this period the low numbers of eels trapped during the first three months suggests that another factor must be impeding their migration a better indication of the cause of the time variability can be seen by comparing the trapped eel counts with the modelled salinity at brentford creek fig 3c which shows an inverse relationship but only following periods when there were detectable levels of salinity possible reasons for this relationship will be considered in the discussion 3 4 methods 3 4 1 hydrodynamic model description to provide the flow environment for the abm a 3d numerical model of the thames estuary between teddington lock and southend pier fig 4 was constructed using the telemac mascaret modelling suite telemac mascaret consortium tidal flows and salinity distribution were simulated for the five month period april to september during 2014 for which eel trap data were available the horizontal resolution of the unstructured triangular model mesh was in the range 5 to 500 m with the finer resolution in the narrower upstream sections and around small islands and bridge piers the piers for all of the thames bridges and the tidal barrage at woolwich were included in the model the vertical discretisation of the model consisted of four planes with one at both the bed and surface and the other two spaced at 10 and 50 of the water column height above the bed this vertical discretisation has been found to be sufficient for accurately modelling the hydrodynamics and salinity within the thames wallingford 2018 which is mainly well mixed in the vertical the tidal boundary of the model at southend pier was driven using harmonically synthesised tides for the modelled period no atmospheric surge component was included in the simulated water levels at the upstream boundary of the model at teddington a time varying river discharge was applied using daily gauge data for kingston lock sourced from the environment agency at richmond approximately 5 km downstream from teddington a half tide weir was installed in 1894 the weir is raised during the lower half of each tide to ensure sufficient navigable depth in the channel upstream of the weir between richmond and teddington the weir was included in the model by dynamically raising the bed elevation across the estuary at the weir location when the water level dropped below 1 72 m above ordance datum newlyn and lowering it again when the downstream levels returned to higher values on the following flood tide 3 4 2 eel swim speed and dispersion parameterisation values for each of the input parameters for the eel behaviour model as described in section 2 1 are shown in table 1 swimming speed was derived from laboratory experiments performed by vezza et al 2020 who studied the swimming capabilities of glass eels at water temperatures ranging from 8 18 c which is consistent with the temperature range recorded during the eel trap measurements fig 3b prolonged 1 20 min and sustained 20 200 min swimming speeds were reported as 0 35 and 0 04 m s 1 respectively the long term average speed of the eels is likely to be between these two values and the precise value is dependent on how long it takes for the eels to recover from prolonged swimming in the absence of any information on juvenile eel recovery time in the literature an average swimming speed of 0 20 m s 1 was chosen which was applied in all the model scenarios except one scenario 10 the speed of each eel agent was prescribed randomly from a gaussian distribution with a mean speed of 0 20 m s 1 and standard deviation of 0 05 m s 1 sensitivity to swim speed was assessed separately in scenario 10 see section 3 4 4 in which the mean speed of the agents was set to 0 35 m s 1 equal to the reported prolonged speed of glass eels neither interaction between agents nor time varying temperature dependence on their swim speed was included in the model random error in the eel agent navigation was prescribed with a horizontal and vertical standard deviation of 5 and 0 respectively eqs 4 and 5 to include the effect of turbulence on movement important if the agents were drifting in the model the vertical diffusivity was calculated using eq 2 and the prandtl number was set to 0 5 bed friction in the model was assumed to be equal to a nikuradse roughness length of 0 01 m everywhere which is a typical value used for bed sediment composed of mixtures of mud sand and gravel soulsby 1990 for horizontal dispersion of the eel agents eq 1 a constant eddy viscosity coefficient of 0 1 m 2 s 1 was applied which is a typical value for estuaries fischer et al 1979 3 4 3 salinity detection threshold calibration the choice of threshold for the detection of salinity s t h r e s h was found to be an important calibration parameter for predicting the temporal trends observed in the eel trap catch data fig 3 a suitable value for salinity threshold was determined iteratively by running the abm several times for a range of different values and calculating the number of eels within 500 m distance of the entrance to brentford creek for comparison with the eel trap data in these tests the eel agents were programmed to perform all the stst behaviours but with no diel behaviour i e the same as scenario 9 in the stst sensitivity tests described in the following section an approximate estimate of the threshold value was first obtained by a visual comparison of the time series of salinity and trapped eel numbers at the mouth of brentford creek fig 3c at times when significant numbers of eels were trapped the modelled salinity at the entrance to the creek was generally less than 0 1 ppt assuming that this represented the approximate limit of the eel sensitivity to salinity three abm simulations were run using thresholds of 0 02 0 04 and 0 08 ppt from which a more precise threshold value could be determined the choice of salinity gradient threshold s t h r e s h was found to be less important than the salinity detection threshold s t h r e s h because in general the salinity in the thames estuary model showed strong gradients in places where the salinity was above the absolute salinity threshold it was therefore set to a value close to but slightly greater than zero to ensure a sensible directional cue was provided to the eels for navigation the chosen value for s t h r e s h used in all simulations was 10 7 ppt m 1 3 4 4 stst behaviour scenario testing to understand the relative importance of each of the stst behaviours described in section 2 2 a set of ten scenarios were simulated each with various parts of the behaviour switched off table 2 scenario 1 investigated the eel migration under the assumption of no stst behaviour other than navigation by detection of the salinity gradient the rest of the scenarios were chosen to evaluate the relative efficiency saving of each key behaviour compared to continuous active upstream swimming the first stst behaviour under investigation was downward migration and bed anchoring during the ebb tide because of its importance in migration this was switched on for all of the stst scenarios other than scenario 1 in most of the scenarios bed anchoring also occurred during daylight hours i e diel behaviour but this behaviour was switched off in three scenarios 4 8 and 9 to test its effect on migration also for most of the tests the eel agents were programmed to perform upward migration swimming to the surface during the flood tide where the flow was faster this behaviour was turned off in scenarios 2 and 5 in which case the eels were assumed to have no preference on height three of the scenarios 5 7 and 9 also investigated the effect of passive drifting rather than active swimming during the flood phase of the tide the last five scenarios included edging behaviour to assess its importance on migration the final scenario 10 used the same settings as scenario 6 but with a faster average swim speed of 0 35 m s 1 at the start of each model scenario eel agents were placed at a height of 0 1 m from the seabed in a 1 2 km square grid with a spacing of 5 m in the main channel close to the london gateway port approximately 14 km from the seaward boundary at southend pier fig 4 those initialised in water depths less than 0 1 m were removed since they were deemed to be stuck on intertidal areas i e mudflats resulting in a total of 58 057 placed agents all the model scenarios were run for the same five month 165 days period commencing at midnight on 18th april 2014 when data collection began at brentford with a computational time step of 30 s throughout each simulation batches of 24 agents were randomly selected every 2 h to be released from the start grid thus totalling 47 520 released the position order of the randomly selected agents was made to be the same for each modelled scenario by seeding the random number generator to a pre saved state at the start of each simulation the model output files recorded the agent positions swim speeds and heading at a sample interval of 15 min on completion of each simulation the files were post processed to determine the numbers of agents within a distance of 500 m of the entrance to brentford creek for assessing the efficiency of migration the model scenario data were further processed to determine information on the average through water distance swum the total migration time and the percentage of released agents arriving by the end of the simulation assuming the eels were inactive when their modelled swim speed was zero i e during bed anchoring or drifting the total migration time was further split into the average period of time that the agents were either actively swimming t a c t i v e or inactive t i n a c t i v e using these times an estimate of the relative energy expenditure e r e l of migration was calculated for each model scenario according to the following equation 6 e r e l m r r a t i o t a c t i v e t i n a c t i v e m r r a t i o t r e f e r e n c e in eq 6 the reference time t r e f e r e n c e is the average active migration time for the constant swimming scenario the calculation also requires an approximate value for the ratio m r r a t i o between active metabolic rate amr and inactive or standard metabolic rate smr no measurements of these parameters were found in the literature for juvenile eels however a previous study using 3 year old hatchery anguilla anguilla determined that the oxygen consumption rate a proxy for metabolic rate during swimming was approximately twice that during resting van ginneken et al 2005 assuming this ratio is the same for juvenile eels a value of m r r a t i o 2 was used 3 5 results 3 5 1 spatiotemporal patterns of migration up the estuary differences in spatiotemporal patterns between scenarios were generally small fig 5 in all scenarios the agents tended to congregate at the position of the contour of the salinity detection threshold s t h r e s h 0 04 ppt generally located between about 0 and 40 km from teddington the first subplot in fig 5 shows the results for scenario 1 constant swimming in this scenario the agents were relatively dispersed spatially compared to the other scenarios due to fact that the agents could not easily maintain proximity to the time varying location of the s t h r e s h contour in this scenario there was also some trapping of agents modelled at the entrance to the river derwent the agents in other scenarios that included vertical migration e g scenario 3 6 and 7 were more tightly arranged around the high tide position of the s t h r e s h contour red dashed line in fig 5 which was calculated by applying a peak finding algorithm to the time series of the along estuary distance of the s t h r e s h contour after first smoothing the series using a fourth order low pass butterworth filter with a 3 h cutoff the modelled aggregation of agents near to the high tide position of the s t h r e s h contour resulted in the more defined peaks in numbers of agents at the entrance to brentford creek especially when the s t h r e s h contour position coincided with the entrance at around high water slack for scenario 3 which includes stst behaviour without edging or drifting there is some trapping of agents in deptford creek including edging scenario 6 results in much less trapping of agents with very similar results to the full suite of stst behaviours scenario 7 in the final subplot in fig 5 3 5 2 salinity detection threshold calibration the salinity detection threshold s t h r e s h was calibrated using the results from three abm simulations covering a range of thresholds 0 02 0 04 and 0 08 ppt time series of the number of agents within a distance of 500 m of the entrance to brentford creek were extracted from each simulation and plotted with the measured eel trap data for visual comparison fig 6 to allow a clear comparison the modelled eel numbers were filtered using a 4th order low pass butterworth filter with a 5 h cut off frequency so as to remove the tidal signature in the agent numbers this was due to variability in the number of modelled agents passing the entrance to brentford creek at different stages of the tide thus creating scatter in the time series also the eel trap data were a cumulative measurement of eel numbers over the sample interval approximately 24 h and therefore tidal variability was not present in the data the modelled eel numbers were also arbitrarily scaled by a factor of 0 2 to allow a visual comparison with the eel trap data justifiable since absolute eel numbers entering the estuary and the trap efficiency was not known the timing of the peaks become less comparable to the data using the 0 08 ppt threshold fig 6 the results using the 0 02 and 0 04 ppt thresholds are very similar to each other but a 0 02 ppt threshold shows an early peak occurring in late july which is not in the trap data a threshold of 0 04 ppt was therefore chosen for the stst sensitivity tests 3 5 3 comparison between modelled and measured numbers of eels at brentford creek comparison of the time series of eel numbers near the entrance to brentford creek for all the modelled stst sensitivity tests shows only small differences between almost all of the scenarios fig 7 the exception is scenario 1 constant swimming which has a more gradual increase in arriving numbers with smaller peaks compared to the other scenarios whilst there are discrepancies in the absolute numbers the overall trends indicate that the abm performed well in predicting peak arrival times at brentford creek some differences can be seen between the model and observations for example there are some small early peaks in modelled eel numbers which are not observed in the data this might be due to over simplification in the model for example the arrival rate of the eels at the mouth of the thames in the model is assumed to be constant whereas in reality there is likely to be a gradual increase in numbers over time followed by a decrease due to the hatching rate of the eel larvae temperature dependency as described in section 3 3 and other variability along their journey from the sargasso sea small inaccuracies in the modelled salinity might also lead to relatively large differences since the threshold of salinity detection was found to be a sensitive parameter for controlling the timing of arrival of the eels the arrival rate is also likely to vary with offshore sea conditions the measured peaks in eel numbers tend to rise rapidly followed by a more gradual decrease the modelled peaks in agent numbers also rise in a similar manner but the numbers tend to remain higher for longer than the data followed by a rapid decrease a possible reason for this is that the model does not remove agents during the simulation as they pass stoney sluice differences between the model and observations are also expected because the eel trap measurements were made at stoney sluice at the junction with brent river which is located about 300 m upstream from the entrance to brentford creek the modelled agents on the other hand were counted in a zone centred on the entrance to the creek refer to fig 4 the agents were counted in this way because the creek entrance was not modelled in high detail and the creek did not extend all the way up to stoney sluice the unmodelled portion of the creek is coloured white in fig 4 a future improvement would be to more accurately represent the creek in the model despite all these potential sources of error the timing of the modelled peaks compare well with the trap data the time at which eels first start arriving at brentford creek and the general increase in numbers over time are also reproduced well in the model 3 5 4 relative efficiency of stst behaviours results from each of the model scenarios for assessing the efficiency of the various stst sub behaviours are shown in fig 8 fig 8a and 8b show the average distance swum and migration time sd to reach brentford creek respectively the migration time is split according to the amount of time spent being active i e swimming and inactive i e bed anchoring or drifting fig 8c shows the cumulative percentage of agents out of the total number of released agents that reached brentford creek by the end of each scenario the relative energy expenditure e r e l for each scenario calculated using eq 6 and expressed as percentages are given in table 3 ranked according to minimum energy overall if daylight avoidance diel behaviour was not included the most energy efficient migration was achieved using just two stst behaviours ebb tide bed anchoring and upward migration during flood scenario 4 with diel behaviour a factor likely to improve migration success due to reducing predation the most energy efficient scenario includes all of the stst behaviours scenario 7 the effect of the different tested behaviours on the model results will now be described in more detail constant swimming for scenario 1 which excluded any stst or diel behaviours the average migration time of 14 8 days was the fifth fastest out of the ten scenarios however because the agents spent the whole time actively swimming including during the fast flowing ebb tide which pushed them back seaward the average distance swum 253 km was the furthest out of all the runs with the same swim speed consequently it ranked seventh in terms of relative energy expenditure table 3 furthermore the percentage of released agents that made it to brentford creek by the end of the model run 79 was the second lowest overall diel behaviour in terms of relative energy expenditure scenarios that did not include diel behaviour other than constant swimming were the most efficient scenarios 4 8 and 9 the most energy efficient upstream migration scenario 4 was accomplished simply by implementing both bed anchoring behaviour during the ebb tide used in all scenarios except number 1 and upward migration during the flood tide used in all scenarios except numbers 1 2 and 5 using just these two behaviours scenario 4 resulted in the shortest time taken to reach brentford creek 10 9 days and the equal second shortest distance swum 124 km it also performed best in terms of energy expenditure table 3 using only 62 of the energy compared to constant swimming diel behaviour i e anchoring during daylight was found to reduce the efficiency of migration by increasing both the time of migration and the average distance swum this is shown in fig 8 by comparing scenario 3 with 4 and scenario 7 with 9 for scenario 3 the average distance swum was 176 km reducing to 124 km in scenario 4 which had diel behaviour switched off similarly the distance swum reduced from 124 to 113 km for scenarios 7 and 9 in both cases the agents swam less distance and a higher percentage successfully arrived when they did not perform diel behaviour although scenario 4 performed best overall in terms of energy usage the most optimal strategy in terms of distance swum was scenario 9 which included all of the considered behavioural strategies other than diel behaviour under this treatment the average distance swum to reach brentford creek was 113 km lowest overall the average time taken was 14 3 days fourth lowest and 88 1 second highest of the released agents arrived successfully fig 8c scenario 2 was the only scenario with standard swim speed that was less efficient than constant swimming scenario 1 with a relative energy expenditure of 109 this is because the energy saving due to ebb tide bed anchoring was not enough to overcome the additional energy expenditure due to diel behaviour i e additional time spent anchoring on the bed however by further including upward migration scenario 3 a relatively large increase in efficiency was achieved with the distance swum reducing from 239 km to 176 km and the time of migration reducing from 18 days to 14 2 days the resultant reduction in energy expenditure 26 was the largest efficiency saving due to the addition of any single behaviour drifting passively drifting rather than swimming during the flood tide as in scenarios 5 7 and 9 reduced the average distance the agents had to swim to reach brentford creek but increased the duration of the migration this is seen in fig 8 by comparing scenarios 6 and 7 in the which the modelled distance swum reduced from 159 km to 124 km respectively whereas the average time taken increased from 13 6 to 15 0 days the overall effect in terms of energy expenditure table 3 was beneficial but only for scenarios that included diel behaviour with diel behaviour the effect of including drifting is shown by comparing scenario 6 with 7 in which the relative energy expenditure decreased slightly from 78 and 76 or scenario 2 with 5 which showed a decrease from 109 to 88 without diel behaviour the effect of drifting is seen by comparing scenario 8 with 9 in which the relative energy expenditure rose from 65 to 71 edging including edging behaviour scenarios 6 to 10 had the effect of reducing energy expenditure but again only for scenarios that included diel behaviour comparing scenario 3 with 6 which included diel behaviour the addition of edging behaviour resulted in a slight reduction in average distance swum 176 to 159 km and a decrease in time taken 14 2 to 13 6 days this led to a reduction in the relative energy expenditure from 83 to 78 ranked sixth and fifth in table 3 in contrast comparing scenario 4 and 8 ranked first and second which did not include diel behaviour the addition of edging behaviour resulted in a slight increase in the distance swum 124 to 131 km time taken 10 9 to 11 3 days and relative energy expenditure 62 to 65 edging behaviour also led to a marked increase in the percentage of released agents reaching brentford creek rising from 84 5 to 89 8 for scenario 3 and 6 respectively a similar increase was modelled between scenario 4 86 and 8 89 6 this appears to be due to fewer agents becoming trapped in creeks and on tidal flats in particular deptford creek and mucking flats further downstream fig 5 faster swim speed scenario 10 which used the same parameters as scenario 6 but with a faster average swim speed was by far the least efficient option 135 of the energy expended compared to scenario 1 the total distance swum was 309 km which was almost double the distance swum for scenario 6 however this scenario did result in the largest number of agents arriving at brentford creek by the end of the simulation 92 6 4 case study 2 assessment of juvenile eel entrainment in a power station intake and outfall in milford haven waterway 4 1 overview in this case study the developed abm is used to predict the rate of entrainment of juvenile eels in the cooling water intake and outfall of pembroke gas fired power station during their migration up milford haven waterway mhw in relation to those successfully reaching any of the rivers adjoining the estuary 4 2 site description the study location is situated in southwest wales where the eastern and western cleddeau rivers merge with the river carew and creswell river to form the daugleddau estuary fig 2 this drains into the celtic sea along with the pembroke river via the mhw with a length of approximately 27 km and surface area of 55 km 2 it is the largest estuary in wales it originated as a flooded valley during the last ice age and as a result is one of the deepest natural harbours in the world since the 1960s it has been extensively used for industry freight and tourism the cooling water intake to pembroke gas fired power station is located in the pembroke river close to where it merges with the mhw whereas the outfall is located in the mhw fig 9 although there is currently no commercial eel fishing on the mhw it is close to the severn estuary which features intensive fisheries ices 2014 it can therefore be hypothesised that juvenile eels are capable of entering the mhw and attempt to progress inland via this estuary small numbers of juvenile eels have indeed been recorded as part of the monitoring of impingement of fish on the screens installed on the intakes of the power station generally fewer than 10 juvenile eels are found per year in either january or february rwe npower pers comm however the 6 mm mesh size of the screens is large enough for juvenile eels to pass through and losses could be considerably higher environment agency 2015 4 3 methods 4 3 1 hydrodynamic model description a 3d hydrodynamic model of mhw which included the cooling intake and outfall of pembroke gas fired power station was provided by rwe npower fig 9 the model which simulated temperature and salinity as coupled tracers was developed using the delft3d modelling suite https oss deltares nl web delft3d the model mesh consisted of a curvilinear grid made up of 7864 active horizontal cells and 10 planes spaced equally between the bed and the water surface resolution of the model varied spatially from 15 m inside the estuary to up to 500 m in offshore regions the total duration of the simulated flows was 15 days i e a spring neap cycle 4 3 2 power station intake and outfall entrainment assessment the same parameters as used for scenario 7 from the thames estuary simulations were used i e all stst behaviours and diel behaviour but now applied to the milford haven waterway these settings were the most energy efficient out of the tested scenarios that included diel behaviour table 3 agents were released into the model en masse at the start of the simulation in a rectangular region 1578 x 1442 m in the mouth of mhw fig 9 the horizontal spacing of the released agents in this areas was 5 m resulting in a total of 91 324 individuals released which were then tracked for the 15 day period as they navigated up the estuary to assess the probability of entrainment agents entering the power station intake and outfall at each model time step were counted to understand the relative impacts on numbers agents were also counted when they reached either of the rivers that flow into mhw this was achieved by defining rectangles at the intakes outfall and each of the tributaries fig 10 individuals entering the rectangles were assumed to have either been entrained or reached a tributary and were counted according to their location and then removed from the simulation 4 4 results the cumulative number of modelled agents entering either the power station intake or outfall or successfully reaching each of the adjoining rivers is shown in fig 11 over the 15 day model duration the majority 77 3 of agents reached one of the rivers the predicted number of eels entering the intake and outfall of the power station was 2 0 and 4 7 respectively for those that successfully reach a river the highest percentage of agents reached the western cleddau with a total of 22 7 table 4 the adjacent cleddau ddu received 19 7 of agents far fewer tended to swim up the cresswell and carew river at 4 6 and 9 0 respectively pembroke river received the second highest percentage of released agents at 22 5 this is interesting because to get up the pembroke eels need to swim past the entrance of the intake since 2 of the release agents entered the intake equal to 9 of those entering through the confluence of the pembroke and mhw it suggests that the intake is suitably located for preventing eels from swimming into it for most of the time this finding is consistent with the small numbers of juvenile eels recorded as being impinged on the intake screens mentioned earlier although further measurements would be required to substantiate this on closer inspection of the model results it was apparent that at the intake the negative salinity gradient vectors i e towards fresh water tended to point up the pembroke river rather than towards the intake since the modelled eels preferentially orientated according to this gradient they generally swam or drifted up the river rather than into the intake entrainment occurred for a short period each tide just after low slack water when higher salinity water started to enter the pembroke as this water flowed past the entrance to the intake which still contained relatively low salinity water the gradient vectors briefly pointed towards the intake mimicking a flood tide and the agents drifted into the intake thus being entrained the larger number of agents swimming into the outfall 4 7 of those released can be explained by the relatively low salinity of the discharged cooling water compared to the ambient salinity in the mhw which the eel agents perceived as a river flow the lower salinity is due to intake drawing water from inside pembroke river interestingly agents were only able to swim into the outfall when the tide was above approximately mean water level below this water level the shallow depth meant that the flow speed of the outfall discharge exceeded the swim speed of the agents thus preventing them from entering the outfall if this had not been the case then it is likely that the numbers entering the outfall would have been significantly higher it is noted that a lack of reliable in situ data on eel entrainment at the power station means these modelled entrainment rates cannot yet be confirmed 5 discussion 5 1 key behaviours affecting migration efficiency including the selective tidal stream transport stst behaviours was found to be essential in reproducing the observed arrival patterns of juvenile eels in the thames case study more specifically the inclusion of downward migration and anchoring at the bed in response to the ebbing tide was found to have the greatest effect on improving the comparison with eel trap data scenarios that included downward migration to the bed during the ebb tide and upward migration to the surface at the beginning of each flood tide led to the fastest migration times and shortest average distance swum this is because the tidal current speeds are fastest at the surface and the vertical distance to reach the surface is relatively small order of a few metres the importance of vertical migration and bed anchoring behaviours in response to tidal state is supported by numerous investigations which show that the number of juvenile eel caught using nets in estuaries tends to be higher during the flood tide than during the ebb sheldon and mccleave 1985 mccleave and kleckner 1982 tzeng 1985 mcgovern and mccarthy 1992 ciccotti et al 1995 arribas et al 2012 in terms of relative energy expenditure a clear distinction was found between scenarios which included diel behaviour and those that did not without diel behaviour the energy expenditure was lower this is understandable since diel behaviour i e bed anchoring during daylight is for predator avoidance rather than efficiency of movement the most energy efficient scenario overall did not include diel behaviour and only included bed anchoring during the ebb and upward migration during the flood scenario 4 however with diel behaviour included the most efficient method was found to be that which included all of the stst behaviours scenario 7 interestingly for scenarios that did not include diel behaviour but included bed anchoring and upward migration the addition of both edging and drifting behaviours resulted in an increase in energy expenditure for example scenario 9 which included all stst behaviours apart from diel behaviour only ranked third in terms of energy expenditure behind scenario 8 which did not include edging table 3 scenarios that included diel behaviour showed the opposite effect with energy expenditure reduced if edging or drifting were added the effectiveness of edging behaviour by juvenile eels has not been reported on widely elsewhere during this study edging was found to reduce the distance swum to reach brentford creek reasons for this are difficult to determine precisely from the model results but it is likely to be a combination of several factors for instance flows along channel margins are generally slower thus offer less impedance the shallower depths also mean that the eels can swim to the bottom for anchoring more quickly when necessary keeping to the side of the estuary with the slowest ebb tide flows also has the effect of directing the eels to the inside of meanders thus leading to a shorter and more optimal route in the model results edging behaviour also increased the agents chances of successfully reaching brentford creek it is unclear exactly why this is the case but it appeared that the lateral movement helped the agents avoid obstacles such as bridge piers headlands or embayments along the route to simulate the edging behaviour a relatively simple yet effective method was developed and implemented whereby the eels altered their heading by 45 towards slower water either side of them aiming directly towards the channel edges i e adjusting their direction by 90 was found to be detrimental to their movement because the flow tended to carry them downstream whereas adjusting by 45 towards the lower flow direction meant that half of their swim speed was utilised in swimming against the flow since by definition the flow speed during edging was less than or equal to their swim speed they then lost relatively little ground the active swim speed of the agents was also found to be an important parameter for migration efficiency swimming faster was found to reduce the overall efficiency and perhaps counter intuitively did not improve the time of migration this was because a main limiting factor on the agent progression in this instance was the salinity detection threshold s t h r e s h which due to the low salinity in the estuary between april and june initially prevented them from navigating directly to brentford creek hence although the agents swam faster they simply reached the freshwater more quickly and then could not navigate further due to the lack of a salinity gradient to follow the subsequent delay therefore meant they expended more energy 5 2 the importance of freshwater discharge on navigation during the modelling of eel migration in the thames estuary case study it was found that the detection threshold for salinity was an important calibration parameter during periods of low river discharge especially during larger spring tides the saltwater mixing zone progresses further inland and hence the eels look for sources of freshwater further up the estuary seasonal and daily variability in river discharge therefore must play a role in the navigation of eels in estuaries river discharge is generally not reported as often as other factors such as temperature as a cue for eel migration and it can also have an inhibiting effect if the discharge is high enough to lead to fast opposing flow speeds gandolfi et al 1984 mouton et al 2011 river discharge tends to have a gradual effect on the large scale salinity distribution in estuaries as a result of mixing with tidal saline waters cresci 2020 more locally for example near weirs and sluices the variability in river discharge will have a more pronounced effect on the salinity and or odour concentration and therefore will be more important for navigation over shorter time and space scales in this modelling study it has been assumed that the eels directly detect the salinity or rather the freshness of the water in order to align themselves for navigation however they could alternatively use their olfactory organs to sense some other chemical compound within the water other than salinity previous researchers have shown that juvenile eels prefer natural inland surface water over odourless water with the same physical properties creutzberg 1961 attractive substances include but are not limited to earthy and green odours sola and tongiorgi 1996 amino acids sola et al 1993 and bile salts or taurine which are readily released from other eels sola and tosi 1993 whatever the attractive property of the freshwater the outcome of modelling is likely to be broadly similar to that presented here this is because what is being modelled is the mixing of two water bodies distinguished according to the concentration of a conservative dissolved tracer either salinity or odour the concentration of a detectable odour would therefore vary spatially in a similar way to the ratio of freshwater to seawater an exception to this would be if the odour was specific to just one river adjoining an estuary in which case navigation would be more directed to that river another exception would be if the odour was non conservative i e it decayed over time via chemical reaction or adsorption onto particulate matter in which case the concentration could decrease more quickly with distance away from the source of input further work is required in this area 5 3 a tool for assessing barriers to eel recruitment the milford haven waterway test case highlighted how the abm developed here can potentially be used to assess entrainment or impingement of individuals at power station intakes this demonstrated how such models could be a useful tool for assisting in the design stage and environmental impact assessment for new power stations and other infrastructure such as tidal turbines in turn such tools are valuable in enabling management to identify and mitigate for the adverse effects of human exploitation of waterways on the migratory success and population status of an endangered species that has experienced a strong decline in recruitment in the past decades ices 2017 an example of this would be to rerun the thames model without richmond weir in place to see what impact it had on the salinity and hence migration patterns of the eels 5 4 model limitations and future developments it has been shown in this study that by using a combination of the local salinity or odour gradient and the current velocity field as a navigational cue modelled agents are able to swim autonomously up estuary to reach the source of freshwater however it is acknowledged that the behavioural rules governing the eel movement are largely based on theory and there is an urgent need for more data from field and laboratory experiments using live animals to provide supporting or contradictory evidence for all of the behaviours included in the abm additional behavioural rules some of which have been suggested in the literature that would benefit from further supporting data and which could readily be implemented and tested in the model are described below in terms of navigation it is assumed in the abm that the agents are able to simply detect the salinity gradient and flow velocity field at their present location in time and space whilst the flow velocity field and velocity gradients may be detected using the lateral lines along either side of the eels bodies bleckmann and zelick 2009 the method by which juvenile eels detect the salinity or odour gradient might require a behavioural mechanism one possibility is that the eels assess the change in salinity over time whilst they are anchored on the bed during the ebb tide cresci 2020 this would provide them with a reference frame for assessing the relative directions of the flow and salinity gradients since the model already includes bed anchoring behaviour this detail could be easily incorporated into the abm it has been shown that eels can sense the earth s magnetic field cresci et al 2017 which could provide them with a reference frame regardless of whether they were anchored on the bed this could assist in determining the correct direction of navigation and requires further investigation the described model currently only considers a specific stage of eels migration as they pass through an estuary the abm could be extended further to simulate the change in behaviour as the eels reach the river currently in the model when the agents reach freshwater they are not able to continue migrating since there is no longer a salinity gradient for them to orientate themselves additional navigational cues such as a time decaying odours are therefore likely to be important for their migration a physiological characteristic which might also be important for helping the agents transition between saline to freshwater is the recent finding that they have an accurate circatidal rhythm which allows them to remember the timing of the flood and ebb tides and behave accordingly cresci et al 2017 there are also possible improvements to be made in the agents ability to avoid becoming stranded on intertidal areas in the thames estuary case study significant numbers of modelled agents became stranded on mucking flats this is unlikely to happen in reality because the eels are able to move over sufficiently damp land which is a behaviour that was not included in the model described here other land avoidance mechanisms could also be included to help reduce stranding such as programming the agents to swim in the direction of the flow when they encounter very shallow water a potentially important environmental variable currently not included in the model is turbidity in waters with high suspended sediment concentrations such as the thames estuary baugh et al 2013 the associated reduction in underwater light due to turbidity is likely to reduce or even remove the requirement for diel behaviour the model scenario testing carried out in this study suggested that the inclusion of diel behaviour significantly reduced the migration efficiency hence to accurately simulate upstream migration in a particular estuary the abm might be improved by including the response of juvenile eels to local underwater light levels caused by both daylight and time varying turbidity achieving this would require laboratory measurements on eel behaviour in response to light levels and also a well calibrated 3d suspended sediment model of the estuary including the above factors would make for an interesting continuation of the current work other future directions would be to use the abm to assess climate change and associated effects of multiple factors e g increases in habitat fragmentation water abstraction rates and water temperature on eel recruitment drouineau et al 2018 finally there are several other species that make use of stst as juveniles e g plaice and our abm could be used to assess their upstream migration with adaptations to species specific behavioural rules forward and tankersley 2001 credit authorship contribution statement thomas benson

24659,we develop a model that reveals the preservation value of maintaining connectivity within a socio ecological system ses by means of a multiplex network built from the layers composing the sustainability venn diagram we define two measures of preservation value of inter and intra layer connections most policymakers and researchers have tended to assume that all elements within an ses are unconditionally connected which implied that dimensions of sustainable development functioned unhindered we must instead explicitly explore how connectivity is operational given explicit threats to connectivity we show under which conditions connectivity is valuable and should be preserved this implies that policies aimed at sustainable development should focus on explicitly addressing connections and disconnections using numerical simulations our results suggest that the preservation value of the ses topological structure is greatest when we secure the connectivity of inter layer connections keywords bioeconomics socio ecological systems sustainable development connectivity value spacetime discounting 1 introduction since the famous brundtland 1987 report people have promoted the idea of sustainable development as a noble goal that reflects the need to account for how humans affect nature and how nature affects humans the report notably put an emphasis on policies aimed at reducing economic disparities social exclusion and environmental degradation elkington 1998 tomlinson 1987 the three overlapping realms of economy society and environment structured in the form of a venn diagram mebratu 1998 lozano 2008 bell et al 2000 then became the most common representation of sustainable development for the reason that policy approaches could be mapped onto the sustainability version of it levett 1998 capturing sustainable development is a challenge however due to the many connections and feedbacks between and within social and ecology systems one tool to capture these connections are polycentric socio ecological system ses models those have proved to be a useful organizing device to capture these links and feedbacks between humans and their environment ostrom 2009 by taking into account diverse information flow capabilities ostrom 2010 observers argued that these models describe better the dynamics of interactions between man and nature waltner toews et al 2008 a typical ses is composed of anthropogenic and natural elements interacting through temporal spatial and organizational scales a network consists of nodes which represent the entities of interest and of edges which embody their interactions when ses are represented in form of a network the organizational scale is composed of nodes such as natural components resource users civil players voters economic actors or regulatory organizations and of linkages between those nodes like exchanges or transfers of money energy information and strategies 1 1 interest in ses has grown with the awareness that ecosystems evolve with respect to the social organization brondizio et al 2009 human societies and their institutions are thus central when comes to studying the ecological systems halliday and glaser 2011 at a global level an ses can be seen as earth system where human agents act on patterns of global change schellnhuber et al 2004 at a territorial level it can be illustrated as a framework for implementing ecological solidarity within the policies of protection of natural areas that revolve within a territory frank et al 2017 mathevet et al 2016 at a local level ses can be used to study family farms the organization of which is determined not only by farmers and their economic constraints but also by plants and animals halliday and glaser 2011 although networks provide opportunity to study a large variety of systems among which are the socio ecological ones their framework does not account for interconnected systems such as the networks of networks baggio et al 2016 most research has focused on separate social or ecological networks sayles et al 2019 provided that nodes have different kinds of interactions creating a layered network or a multiplex network where each layer represents a different type of interaction proves relevant in point of fact social ecological links build on the appreciation that environmental problems draw from a set of challenges that re occur across contexts bodin et al 2019 the network layers are then constituted of links of different types the field of multilayer networks includes such multiple layers of complexity as it specifically allows one to differentiate and model the intra layer and inter layer connections kivelä et al 2014 lee et al 2015 pilosof et al 2017 the key to extracting useful information from these ses models is to address the degree and level of connectivity which we define as the property of all types of elements interacting on a network connectivity then refers to any form of assemblage interaction or linkage between human and non human agents nicholls et al 2016 its expression can take multiple forms such as economic stromquist 2002 wenz and levermann 2016 social miritello 2013 environmental crooks and sanjayan 2006 dragicevic et al 2017 moritz et al 2013 noss 1987 technological webb 2007 and organizational tillquist 2002 unhelkar 2009 besides those interactions can be between and within the economic social and environmental systems can we measure the operationality of interactions in such networked systems for example we know that the performance of complex systems and networks such as ses depends on their ability to maintain the topological structures through the vertex connectivity frank and frisch 1970 up to now the analysis of ses sustainability has been mostly conducted through the idea of resilience gonzalès and parrott 2012 a system is considered to be resilient when it adapts to external perturbations while continuing to function be it at the expense of changes in the configuration public policies toward resilience must then overcome budget limitations address trade offs be acceptable to many competing interests and overcome barriers in the structure of existing institutions carpenter et al 2012 with a view to reaching resilience dragicevic et al 2017 subjected an ses multiplex network to dynamics of reform through the knock on effect such that the spread of reform on a node came from the neighborhood or from the counterparts previously reformed they found that proportional weighting of all corner stone realms of sustainable development yielded the maximum magnitude of efficiency of the knock on effect nonetheless for a reform to spread on a multiplex network the connectivity between the nodes needs to be operational researchers and policymakers recognize that in reality risks exist within an ses system that can work to undercut the connectivity due to some exogenous endogenous economic or ecological barrier constraint which will undermine the goal of sustainable development forces such as global environmental change and globalization have pushed connectivity to such a level brondizio et al 2009 young et al 2006 that impacts of connections and disconnections on the governance of interactions need to be fully integrated clark 2000 these risks can be both intra and inter layer disconnections an intra layer disconnection within each layer means the termination of an interaction examples of the risk to connectivity include trade that no longer takes place emergence of social distrust or a destruction of an ecological corridor an inter layer disconnection between the layers can be illustrated in the context of absence of an equitable society pointing to the lack of contribution of economic capital in social development that of an unbearable environment where society is unresponsive to the natural environment and through the absence of a viable economy such that economic growth is pursued against the environment despite a substantial literature on network formation and dismantling jackson and rogers 2005 jackson and watts 2002 jackson and wolinsky 1996 johnson and gilles 2000 vega redondo 2007 small research agenda has been devoted to the economic value of the overall network connectivity dragicevic et al 2017 considered the construction of ecological networks in forest environments as the optimal control dynamic graph theoretic problem through shadow prices they managed to provide an economic value to the network connectivity which was found to be of an aggregated nature afterward dragicevic 2018 considered the spacetime discounting in order to compute the present value of connectivity at the scale of a graph through numerical simulations he found that securing connectivity was much more sensitive to spatial discounting than to the temporal one implying that agents valued the safeguard of connections less in time than in space contrary to the existing literature cited above in which nodes decide themselves whether to form or to sever a link we are interested in the capacity of decision makers to achieve policies of maintaining a designed connectedness preserved in a time evolving network geometry this aim is motivated by the postulate that links are at risk of unintended disconnections either in natural or socioeconomic grids we integrate the analysis of social ecological networks using the multiplex networks baggio and hillis 2018 rather than their usual maximization of discounted expected payoffs willems and zwart 2018 we investigate the ability of social planners to provide a resilient ses system against the threat of being deteriorated or dismantled the concept of shadow price as a willingness to undertake control of the network connectivity for an additional unit of time by accepting the cost to be incurred for that purpose then takes the form of a costate variable in the minimization problem lyon 1999 herein we develop a model that reveals the preservation value of maintaining connectivity within an ses system by means of a multiplex network built from the layers composing the sustainability venn diagram we define two measures of preservation value of inter and intra layer connections most policymakers and researchers have tended to assume that all elements within an ses are unconditionally connected which implied that dimensions of sustainable development functioned unhindered we must instead explicitly explore how connectivity is operational given explicit threats to connectivity we show under which conditions connectivity is valuable and should be preserved this implies that policies aimed at sustainable development should focus on explicitly addressing connections and disconnections using numerical simulations our results suggest that the preservation value of the ses topological structure is greatest when we secure the connectivity of inter layer connections the introduction is followed by section 2 where the optimal control in a graph theoretic setting is presented section 3 is dedicated to the simulations conclusive remarks are given in section 4 2 model the first modeling phase consists in creating a multiplex network in which every network layer built from nodes and edges represents a pillar of sustainability consider an undirected and unweighted multiplex network based on the euclidean metric of dimension r n these properties ensure that the relationships between the graph constituents are multidimensional and equally weighted the network is illustrated by an undirected graph γ v e the graph is built from the set of vertices v 1 n and from the set of edges e i j v v which represent the interactions between the nodes in that case i and j represent two interacting nodes fig 1 illustrates the ses framework composed of three layers with a graph theoretic mapping the population of nodes is distributed among l n layers where n 1 2 3 each layer contains n n nodes with i n 1 n n with different intra layer connectivity such a multiplex system is completely specified by the vector of the adjacency matrices of the n layers let a n for n 1 2 3 be the adjacency matrix 2 2 in an undirected graph the adjacency matrix is symmetric of l n with nonnegative elements a i j n n n for i n 1 n n consider two nodes to be connected when i j e such that a i j n 1 and a i j n 0 otherwise each node in l n is connected to its counterparts in l n 3 3 l n should read for all layers of n but the one at stake such that there exists a one to one connectivity pattern between the identical nodes of different layers 4 4 the entries of the adjacency matrix associated with the undirected and unweighted graph represent the network topology otherwise we do not take account of a particular network topology as in many practical applications the multiplex network topology is unknown and global information is not available lombana et al 2020 for a finite time t 0 t the set of edges e and graph γ are treated as variables let us now endow the network with some additional properties such that each node becomes a sustainability element connected to its environment we assume a convex hull of vertices ω in form of an n simplex with the euclidean norm in r n let x i n e i n t r n where n 1 2 3 and i n 1 n n denote the state of node i n characterized by its feature e i n at time t 5 5 in what follows the explicit indication of time such as in x i n e i n t is not specified unless necessary this state encompasses two characteristics 1 its scalar value which permits computing its distance from the neighboring nodes and 2 its nature like its affiliation to a layer or its similarity with the other nodes through the introduction of the states we are now able to measure the intensity of interaction between two random nodes with respect to the network topology the challenge is mainly to infer the network structure using measurements of the nodes activities such as the states of the nodes the configuration space corresponds to the set of all possible states of the dynamic system the global state vector x x 1 n t x n n t t is in form of a stack vector of all the control inputs the evolution of the state of each node depends on the dynamics which maps control inputs to states through 1 x u i n where u i n is the control input of node i n and x 0 implies a steady state 2 1 distance the second modeling phase matches with the establishment of a distance between two random nodes as a measure of intensity of interaction between them these interactions can take place both inside a pillar of sustainable development or between the pillars at stake the set of nodes λ is such that the nodes connected to node i λ form subset λ i for i j λ d i j x i e i x j e j and for λ i j λ 0 d i j z d i j represents the euclidean distance between two nodes while z stands for their respective interaction capacity the utility between two connected nodes u i j is measured from their capacities in flows it is defined as follows definition 1 for i j λ d i j x i e i x j e j and for λ i j λ 0 d i j z u i j 0 if a i j 0 0 otherwise a disconnection between two nodes generates zero utility although the existence of nodes could in itself be valued through utility and their connections defined as sources of positive externalities we assume that only connections provide utility the network utility is thus the connectivity between nodes separated by distances which satisfy the capacities to interact the utility set u i λ of node i corresponds to all nodes connected to it in that manner the overall adequate connectivity in the network is taken account of definition 2 for i j λ the network utility set of node i is the union of utilities issued from the network intra and inter layer connections or u i λ j λ u i j the euclidean distance becomes irrelevant if the interaction occurs between nodes defined as incompatible in other words a node sufficiently close but endowed with a different feature cannot provide any utility to the interacting node therefore we shall employ the mahalanobis distance which takes into account the covariance between the variables as such smaller distances correspond to interacting nodes that are designated as similar or compatible dragicevic et al 2017 the mahalanobis distance enables us to uncover the strong relationship between two constituents of sustainable development and to underweight the weakest links in the graph topology according to shaw et al 2011 an euclidean distance metric is dependent on a positive semidefinite matrix π l t l s 1 where π r n n and l r n n a positive semidefinite laplacian matrix godsil and royle 2001 6 6 matrix π is the inverse of the covariance matrix s 1 two unconnected nodes are then independent in the graph bell et al 2000 the mahalanobis distance preserves the network structure if the weighted graph γ v e σ gives a n γ with a n for n 1 2 3 the adjacency matrix according to the foregoing the three dimensional mahalanobis distance m c a b c between nodes a λ 1 b λ 2 and c λ 3 issued from the three layers corresponds to 2 m c a b c x a 1 e a 1 l 0 l δ l x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 t s 1 x a 1 e a 1 l 0 l δ l x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 1 2 c where l 0 l δ l denotes the composite factor of the spatial discounting dependent on the sequence of vertices the distances of which are being measured when the metric is the identity matrix or π s 1 i m c a b c falls back to the standard euclidean distance between a b and c in order to ensure flowing through the network the nodes specified as compatible shall be linked which is verified by s 1 0 in different words the mahalanobis distance metric guarantees that the connection occurs when two nodes display compatible characteristics in light of finiteness of resources nodes that interact build a grid dependent of their opportunity costs 7 7 the opportunity cost arises from two mutually exclusive options it refers to a benefit that an agent gave up while choosing let scalar c be this economic opportunity cost from choosing either node from the multiplex graph computable at the market value the social planner can thus measure the consequence of connecting the multiplex network in a certain way for other configurations might lead to a different structure of pillars of sustainable development a network administrator is able to identify the subset of nodes λ n for n 1 2 3 evolving on either layer through intra layer connections which all have counterparts on other layers for example for n 1 2 3 we have λ n n such that 3 λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 λ 4 λ 5 λ and λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 λ 4 λ 5 λ 1 n 1 λ 2 n 2 and λ 3 n 3 give the number of nodes in each subset as for subsets λ 4 and λ 5 they correspond to regions delimiting inter layer connections 2 2 dynamics the third modeling phase is about defining the time evolution of states of nodes connected to each other indeed the dynamics governing the evolution of states will enable us to study how the intensity of interaction changes over time following gustavi et al 2010 the follower node dynamics is given by the laplacian based control strategy consensus differential equation according to it the state of a node evolves with respect to the states of the nodes issued from the utility set the cascade effects can thus be modeled dragicevic 2018 the dynamics for a node can be written as 4 x a 1 e a 1 n x a 1 e a 1 δ l 1 1 δ 1 n x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 x d 1 e d 1 x d 2 e d 2 x d 3 e d 3 where x a 1 e a 1 is the state of a node x b 2 e b 2 and x c 3 e c 3 are the states of counterparts from the other layers be it the inter layer connectivity in other terms we are in presence of elements connecting different pillars of sustainable development as for x d 1 e d 1 x d 2 e d 2 and x d 3 e d 3 they denote the states of nodes connected through intra layer connectivity this time we focus on the elements composing one pillar of sustainable development the expression within parentheses is weighted by the spatial discount factor with respect to node i for i n 1 n n it corresponds to the graph diameter west 2000 be it the largest number of nodes which must be traversed in order to travel from one node to another the graph diameter is employed to take account of all the indirect connections in the multiplex graph that have an impact on the evolution of states the annulment of the differential equation yields the node equilibrium state it can be formulated through the following lemma lemma 1 the network equilibrium under consensus dynamics corresponds to the annulment of differential equation x a 1 e a 1 weighted by the spatial discount factor up to the graph diameter the proof is provided in the appendix the following theorem ensues theorem 1 given the consensus problem is well defined in the initial state the ses equilibrium is at a steady state when the whole is greater than the sum of its parts i e formally when the marginal variation of the ses barycenter exceeds the marginal variation of a node s utility set the proof is provided in the appendix the result shows that for ses to remain in equilibrium its center of gravity needs to be greater than the aggregate of states of nodes connecting the layers with respect to the graph diameter or in the longest path the general conditions for the connectivity to be preserved are now announced 2 3 connectivity the fourth modeling phase deals with highlighting the properties that enable two random nodes to remain connected despite the evolution of their states that way we can equally see under which conditions a disconnection between them occurs the preservation of the network connectedness in time goes through the connectivity relation m c a b c the connectivity between two nodes is preserved if the time derivative of the mahalanobis distance between them is nonpositive put differently the condition for nodes i and j to be connected is m c i j 0 should it be the case the convex hull ω is unchanged and the network is lyapunov stable dragicevic and sinclair desgagné 2013 we compute the squared distance derivative gustavi et al 2010 between nodes a b and c and obtain 5 m c a b c 2 2 x a 1 e a 1 l 0 l δ l x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 t s 1 x a 1 e a 1 l 0 l δ l x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 c 2 for arbitrary nodes a λ 1 b λ 2 and c λ 3 the connectivity is defined by 6 m c a b c 2 2 n x a 1 e a 1 l 0 l δ l x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 t s 1 x a 1 e a 1 2 δ l 1 1 δ 1 1 c 2 2 n x a 1 e a 1 l 0 l δ l x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 t s 1 x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 c 2 6 x a 1 e a 1 l 0 l δ l x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 t s 1 δ l 1 1 δ 1 x d 1 e d 1 x d 2 e d 2 x d 3 e d 3 c 2 nodes remain connected when m c i j 0 this results in having δ l 1 1 δ 1 x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 x a 1 e a 1 1 2 given that δ l 1 1 δ 1 0 1 the inequality is verified when the states of nodes connected between different layers are equal corollary 1 necessary and sufficient condition for arbitrary nodes from different layers to evolve connected in a multilayered graph is that their states be similar the proof is provided in the appendix the corollary highlights the egalitarian aspect to be applied to nodes involving on ses which could be read in conjunction with social justice promoted within sustainable development policies it also confirms the idea supported in dragicevic et al 2017 that equal weight should be assigned to all constituents of sustainability 2 4 optimal control problem the last modeling phase consists in presenting a method to keep the initial network connected over time despite the risk of the graph dismantling the latter is due to the variation of intensity of interactions between the nodes we apply the optimal control method to guarantee the preservation of the network connectedness mesbahi and egerstedt 2010 for that purpose we include the performance function j the purpose of which is maintain the network configuration at the lowest cost it takes the form of a cost function integrated over finite time for all 0 t t 7 j 0 t m c a b c d t the network administrator decides to sustain the network topology via control variables m c a b c in which control translates into creating edges sengupta and lafortune 1992 the continuous time optimal control problem is that of maintaining connectivity under the constraint of network equilibrium lachner et al 1998 defined over the state variables subject to consensus dynamics the optimal control problem is formulated as the minimization of the performance function put differently 8 min x a 1 e a 1 x d 1 e d 1 j subject to two first order dynamic constraints 9 x a 1 e a 1 x d 1 e d 1 the problem pertains to the choice of the control vector provided the constraints on the state vector as a matter of fact the nodes update their states from the utility set which both includes nodes from the same layer and counterparts from the other layers we must study the first order necessary optimality conditions where the states of counterparts from different layers are used as inputs to the network through this methodology we can control the connections between different pillars of sustainable development that way the social planner ensures the preservation of sustainable development in time the optimal control problem can be solved with the help of the present value hamiltonian discounted in time up to t t which represents the impact of evolution of x a 1 e a 1 and x d 1 e d 1 on the network topology the first order optimality conditions yield 10 λ μ δ 2 δ l 1 3 2 δ 1 δ l the costate variables lyon 1999 are given by λ and μ they disclose the shadow prices for keeping the network connected they also provide indication on the network connectivity value λ for the connectivity between the layers and μ for the connectivity within a layer the former equality is part of the initial conditions on the choices of costate variables for the system control such that theorem 1 holds let w 0 x a 0 1 e a 1 t x b 0 2 e b 2 t x c 0 3 e c 3 t x d 0 1 e d 1 t x d 0 2 e d 2 t x d 0 3 e d 3 t λ 0 t μ 0 t t be the initial network state controlling the network consists in fixing λ 0 and μ 0 such that 11 x a t 1 e a 1 δ l 1 1 δ 1 x b t 2 e b 2 x c t 3 e c 3 δ l 1 1 n δ 1 x d t 1 e d 1 x d t 2 e d 2 x d t 3 e d 3 where λ 0 and μ 0 are subject to 10 lemma 2 the preservation of ses inter and intra layer connections is subject to imperfect strategic substitutability the proof is provided in the appendix thereby the willingness to pay for maintaining the connectivity between counterparts from different layers is equal to the willingness to pay for preserving the connectivity between nodes within a layer weighted by spatial discounting up to the graph diameter otherwise controlling the network is non optimal by letting w x a 1 e a 1 t x b 2 e b 2 t x c 3 e c 3 t x d 1 e d 1 t x d 2 e d 2 t x d 3 e d 3 t λ t μ t t reflect the network state where the values of shadow prices comply with 10 the system control is obtained through the following hamiltonian system it corresponds to all the constraints placed on the social planner to keep the sustainable development operational through time 12 w p w where p 0 0 1 2 c 2 s 1 e δ t 1 2 δ l 1 1 δ 1 0 0 0 1 6 c 2 s 1 e δ t 1 6 c 2 s 1 e δ t 2 n s 1 c 2 e δ t δ l 1 1 δ 1 3 δ

finding costate variables that validate theorem 2 3 simulations the aim of this section is to discuss through simulations the conditions that guarantee the preservation of ses connectivity in time for the sake of simplicity consider a reduced version of the ses multiplex network let n 1 2 3 represent the three ses layers and i 1 9 the nodes composing the multilayered network each layer is then formed of three nodes the vector of states such that x 0 10 9 8 5 4 4 3 5 2 issued from the subsets of economic social and environmental nodes that is n 1 x a 1 e a 1 x d 1 1 e d 1 1 x d 2 1 e d 2 1 n 2 x b 2 e b 2 x d 1 2 e d 1 2 x d 2 2 e d 2 2 and n 3 x c 3 e c 3 x d 1 3 e d 1 3 x d 2 3 e d 2 3 is converted into a square form distance matrix we are interested in the behavior of the triad of

95 1 00 the laplacian dynamics applied to the nodes yields the following evolution of mahalanobis coordinates we suppose that the multilayered network is initially in equilibrium and connected at t 0 let us now expose the nodes to the laplacian dynamics the evolution of coordinates is shown in fig 2 we can see that distances between the nodes within and between layers enlarge along the timeline the ses multiplex network is no longer in equilibrium at t 50 in that the average gap between the triad states is increasing in time going from 1 33 at t 0 with 1 90 at t 25 to 3 67 at t 50 the absence of maintenance of the opening equilibrium goes against the constraints from lemma 1 or corollary 1 at the multiplex graph level the nodes are likely to disconnect which can jeopardize their ability to maintain the convex hull unchanged in detail we have 1 9 6 0 03 0 02 2 0 02 0 04 such that the marginal variation of the ses barycenter is less than the marginal variation of node a s utility set therefore the network equilibrium is not at a steady state in the simulated example theorem 1 is valid but unverified along the time path let us first analyze the inter layer connectivity as can be observed in the figure after the initial decrease in the states of the triad at stake x a 1 e a 1 remains stable throughout the timeline while x b 2 e b 2 and x c 3 e c 3 experience a steady decrease from t 2 until t 45 after that time step an oscillation between rise and fall is observed the interesting feature of what is noted stands at the stabilization of the economic agent at the expense of both social and environmental agents to take the analysis one step further the swinging of social and environmental nodes starting at t 46 is reflective such that the state improvement of the former seems to deteriorate the state of the latter which can for example illustrate the substitutability between labor market improvement and environmental degradation widely documented in the literature lawn 2006 just as much triads x d 1 1 e d 1 1 x d 1 2 e d 1 2 x d 1 3 e d 1 3 and x d 2 1 e d 2 1 x d 2 2 e d 2 2 x d 2 3 e d 2 3 show the substitution between the three pillars of sustainability nevertheless unlike in the previous pattern the economic x d 1 1 e d 1 1 x d 2 1 e d 2 1 and environmental x d 1 3 e d 1 3 x d 2 3 e d 2 3 agents now co evolve in a compatible manner the most striking feature coming from the overall examination is that social agents appear to be the adjustment variable in the ses framework indeed their states follow the opposite dynamics of either or both the economic and environmental nodes as for the intra layer connectivity the broad analysis reveals that a different type of substitutability occurs within the layers like in the previous case the rise of two nodes is realized at the cost of the third one a more detailed examination shows three different dynamics the first one is relative to the social triad and illustrates the fall of x b 2 e b 2 with respect to x d 1 2 e d 1 2 x d 2 2 e d 2 2 the second one applies to the economic triad and reveals an irregular trend thereby x a 1 e a 1 and x d 2 1 e d 2 1 first decline and then stand on flat trajectories which is not the case of x d 1 1 e d 1 1 that has a v shaped path with an inflection at t 31 before faltering after t 45 the third pattern can be considered as trendless that is while x d 2 3 e d 2 3 is almost stable from t 2 until the terminal time step x c 3 e c 3 and x d 2 3 e d 2 3 start to oscillate at t 45 after a monotonous decrease with a vacillating trajectory of x d 1 3 e d 1 3 explained earlier through that of x d 1 1 e d 1 1 result 1 the mahalanobis coordinates free from optimal control indicate that the ses multiplex structure is out of equilibrium and at risk of dismantling let us now look at the optimal control conditions for different levels of opportunity costs as said earlier the optimal control is meant to secure the coordinates of the ses multiplex graph at a cost evaluated through shadow prices such that inter and intra layer connections are preserved two cases are examined i e 1 the preservation of ses through its inter layer connections ses λ and 2 the preservation of ses through its intra layer connections ses μ shadow prices represent the costate variables the equation of which is detailed in 10 computed by solving the optimal control problem the first case is studied by considering λ to which the hamiltonian coordinates from 12 are applied the outcomes correspond to the preservation values of inter λ λ p and intra layer μ λ p connections the second case is studied by considering μ to which the hamiltonian coordinates are applied as well the outcomes then correspond to the preservation values of inter λ μ p and intra layer μ μ p connections fig 3 illustrates the behavior of shadow prices λ λ p μ λ p obtained with respect to inter layer control with rising levels of opportunity costs such that c 0 50 1 10 6 we observe that lim c 0 λ μ and lim c λ μ 115 0 09 fig 4 depicts the behavior of shadow prices λ μ p μ μ p obtained with respect to intra layer control with rising levels of opportunity costs such that c 0 50 1 10 6 we observe that lim c 0 λ μ and lim c λ μ 6 52 8 556 result 2 the shadow prices are negatively unbounded at near zero opportunity costs and positively bounded with significant levels of opportunity costs therefore in both cases null opportunity costs generate high negative preservation values whereas significant opportunity costs starting at c 10 produce ceiling values of preservation put differently when the opportunity cost is close to zero which implies indifference toward preserving connectivity between the layers or operating on its own layer without considering the remaining sustainability pillars the value of connectivity is negative in that maintaining connectivity between economy society and environment is a costly undertaking when the opportunity cost is of significant amount the value of connectivity is upper bounded because the role of ses is to provide utility both within and between layers the numerical values show that lemma 2 is verified for two reasons first we see that λ λ p μ λ p and λ μ p μ μ p thereby there exists strategic substitutability between preserving connectivity within and between layers then we have λ λ p μ λ p and λ μ p μ μ p in that strategic substitutability is imperfect in either case and also far from being proportional in the second case at a first glance preserving the ses structure by investing in inter layer connections seems irrelevant with respect to the costs to be incurred via λ p maintaining the ses intact is cost consuming on the contrary securing both inter and intra layer connections via μ p requires a moderate investment however due to imperfect substitution noted above a closer look on the values of λ λ p and μ λ p proves the exact opposite simply because preserving the ses structure from within the layers appears less onerous risking a low cost intra layer control of 6 52 for a possible damage of 8 556 on intra layer connectivity against a high cost inter layer control of 115 for a damage of only 0 09 on intra layer connectivity can be considered as economically unsound not only because the sacrificed connections would then need to be rehabilitated in the long run but also in the wake of compensatory damages that would need to be paid 8 8 in a study conducted by oecd 2018 the authors point out that the catnat compensation scheme which was conceived to encourage flood prevention rather than indemnity for damages simply because the former is less expensive for all the stakeholders has not been successful to date when read in conjunction with our results their conclusions bring to light that the tradeoff between willingness to pay as the cost of prevention and willingness to accept as the monetary payout is of utmost importance economically speaking the shadow price is the maximum price one is willing to pay to maintain the network connected for an additional unit of time if a negative value is the willingness to accept a monetary compensation for letting the ses connectivity deteriorate one would only ask for an offset of 0 09 in case of investment in inter layer connections and of 8 556 in case of investment in intra layer connections result 3 preserving the ses structure through optimal control is more efficient by securing connectivity of inter layer connections than of intra layer connections furthermore if one considers the opportunity costs to be negligible one could even ask for infinite compensation demanded indeed due to broken links between the layers one could end up disconnecting from the overall network while mostly evolving with respect to the nodes from its layer neighborhood this result emphasizes the importance of connections between economy society and environment that might lead to the collapse of ses simply because one distances oneself from the inter layer connectivity this also ties up with the idea that ses are linked systems of people and nature where economic agents are not apart from the nature berkes et al 2003 4 conclusion by considering the ses system as a multiplex network composed of layers borrowed from the sustainability venn diagram we uncovered its properties of equilibrium and performance the latter being defined as the ability to maintain its topological structure through the vertex connectivity we could think of the relevance to preserve the ses structure through its inter layer connections as our main result it ties up with a previous finding obtained through the resolution of an evolutionary variational inequality that the stability of compartmentalized networks depends on the preservation of between subnetwork coupling dragicevic 2016 should the ses multilayered network be seen as a networked system divided into compartments the model outputs also show that investing in equity supportability and viability as the very well known goals to be pursued within sustainable development might be onerous but they also notify that this approach significantly reduces the risk of damaging interactions taking place inside the pillars inherently constitutive of the sustainable development the initial works by mäler 2008 and mäler and li 2010 dealt with resilience management as insurance against reaching a non desired state these authors focused on social cost benefit analyses and considered time dependent preferences in order to unveil as a metric for sustainability measurement the shadow price of resilience in their modeling framework the shadow price takes the form of the present discounted value of future improvements in welfare due to a marginal increase in the resilience stock increased by the reduced regime shift risk also termed as the flip to a qualitatively different state as for the resilience stock it corresponds to the distance between the current state and a threshold level of state two main differences with respect to our model are worthy of note by considering interacting nodes in our case the distance in nodes states becomes the relative level of resilience supplied by their suitable connectivity rather than being related to welfare enhancement our shadow price corresponds to a marginal willingness of a regulator to provide a resilience management in a way that the multiplex connectivity is ensured for an additional unit of time nevertheless our results are partly in accordance with their findings since their resilience stock sustains the system when it is high for we define equilibrium properties in the longest path likewise maintaining connectivity as a necessary condition for resilience is ensured by the egalitarian feature of states which would be a refinement of their outcome in that it should apply in each point of time to every constitutive member of the networked ecological system using an ecological economic model baumgärtner and strunz 2014 extended the works mentioned above and studied the ecosystem resilience as an insurance tool that enables risk averse ecosystem users to mitigate against potential welfare losses their modeling enabled to provide the marginal economic insurance value of ecosystem resilience as a maximum willingness to pay for a marginal increase in the level of resilience according to their results the insurance value of resilience is negative positive for low high levels of resilience although we do not consider risk averse utility functions just as much they do not take account of time preferences their results can still be considered in line with our outcomes when read in conjunction with our framework maintaining the connectivity in time can be interpreted as a type of insurance for the ses system to function unhindered provided that our measure of resilience depends exclusively on the maintenance of connectivity where connections provide utility rather than spearhead positive externalities both frameworks consider an overall economic value of resilience measuring through shadow prices the preservation of connectivity in time hence boils down to setting apart a component of this value in addition obtaining a negative insurance value for a low level of resilience matches with the results obtained with respect to our opportunity costs as a matter of fact a low opportunity cost implies indifference between being connected and disconnected since the ses resilience relies on connectedness a low opportunity cost involves a low level of resilience just as their insurance level is negative at low levels of resilience we obtain negative shadow prices at such levels of opportunity costs in case the level of resilience is high our results show bounded positive values this could be an additive feature pertaining to connected architectures as for the research carried out in network theory a geographically based cost structure to forming links was presented in jackson and rogers 2005 their structure captured heterogeneity in link costs where agents grouped on an island bore a lower cost of forming connections within that island and bore a higher cost across the islands accordingly the links within an island represent the intra layer connectivity while the links across the islands represent the inter layer connectivity given the benefits of indirect connections the authors showed that this type of cost structure generated the structure of a small world network with higher rates of connections on a local scale such that the neighbors of any given node were likely to be the neighbors of each other through the optimal control method this work extends their findings in that 1 result 3 reveals the presence of characteristics of a multiplex small world network agarwal et al 2016 2 a higher shadow cost is meant to avoid severing links of any kind in the multilayered network instead let us now dedicate a couple of words on the role of system size and the use of distance metrics if the system size is very large the local interpretation of the distance and connectivity might differ from the global interpretation of ses which might result in a conflict with the model despite the fact that we have conducted simple simulations in order to highlight the preservation value of socio ecological systems our results hold on a large scale of complex systems this is due to the fact that the social planner initially engineers the multiplex network such that it verifies the properties of connectedness leading to sustainable development moreover despite the laplacian dynamics that might enlarge the distances and thus compromise the connectivity of system elements the optimal control enables him or her to keep the engineered network functional over time let us recall that the safeguard of the multiplex network is achieved by taking into account all the indirect connections via the graph diameter this method makes sense in large systems for all that needs to be monitored even in presence of numerous nodes and links is the upholding of all mahalanobis distances through two costate variables independent from the number of nodes in the system that work at the aggregate level we thus avoid confining the use of distance metrics at a local scale the alternative representation of sustainable development in form of concentric circles mitchell 2000 in which the economic area is embedded within the social area which is within the natural environment is probably the most appropriate to address the challenges faced by the ses system dragicevic 2020 as a matter of fact the concentric diagram brings out the mutual involvement between the factors at stake for any interaction within the economic area has an impact upon the social and environmental realms which contain it contrary to what is stated in the current balancing of factors hacking and guthrie 2008 the evaluation of public policies that aim at promoting social responsibility ought to incorporate this type of diagnosis more widely it is already the case within the corporate triple bottom line strategies elkington 1998 wilson 2015 ergo in the absence of such full reasoning at the global scale working collectively on the safeguard of connections that link economy society and environment should be the second best blueprint on which to engage in the medium term the future avenues of research are found to be three the first category is about the study of weighted socio ecological multiplex systems through the analysis of an aggregated topological adjacency matrix by discriminating between the strength of a node over its neighbors and or counterparts that way we could monitor the dynamics subject to an ex ante layer discrimination the second category concerns the graph theoretic characterization of stochastic controllability by means of stochastic optimal control all the more so due to the conjunction of different types of uncertainty hambusch 2008 such as climate change joyce et al 2006 that weigh on ses systems finally we could envisage a multiplex network where some connections whether intra or inter layer provide disutility and study how their presence affects the choices of social planners to preserve the ses network topology over time as previously stated in other works dragicevic 2018 dragicevic et al 2017 this one also has to be considered as exploratory inasmuch as graph theory is a schematized representation of network patterns

24659,we develop a model that reveals the preservation value of maintaining connectivity within a socio ecological system ses by means of a multiplex network built from the layers composing the sustainability venn diagram we define two measures of preservation value of inter and intra layer connections most policymakers and researchers have tended to assume that all elements within an ses are unconditionally connected which implied that dimensions of sustainable development functioned unhindered we must instead explicitly explore how connectivity is operational given explicit threats to connectivity we show under which conditions connectivity is valuable and should be preserved this implies that policies aimed at sustainable development should focus on explicitly addressing connections and disconnections using numerical simulations our results suggest that the preservation value of the ses topological structure is greatest when we secure the connectivity of inter layer connections keywords bioeconomics socio ecological systems sustainable development connectivity value spacetime discounting 1 introduction since the famous brundtland 1987 report people have promoted the idea of sustainable development as a noble goal that reflects the need to account for how humans affect nature and how nature affects humans the report notably put an emphasis on policies aimed at reducing economic disparities social exclusion and environmental degradation elkington 1998 tomlinson 1987 the three overlapping realms of economy society and environment structured in the form of a venn diagram mebratu 1998 lozano 2008 bell et al 2000 then became the most common representation of sustainable development for the reason that policy approaches could be mapped onto the sustainability version of it levett 1998 capturing sustainable development is a challenge however due to the many connections and feedbacks between and within social and ecology systems one tool to capture these connections are polycentric socio ecological system ses models those have proved to be a useful organizing device to capture these links and feedbacks between humans and their environment ostrom 2009 by taking into account diverse information flow capabilities ostrom 2010 observers argued that these models describe better the dynamics of interactions between man and nature waltner toews et al 2008 a typical ses is composed of anthropogenic and natural elements interacting through temporal spatial and organizational scales a network consists of nodes which represent the entities of interest and of edges which embody their interactions when ses are represented in form of a network the organizational scale is composed of nodes such as natural components resource users civil players voters economic actors or regulatory organizations and of linkages between those nodes like exchanges or transfers of money energy information and strategies 1 1 interest in ses has grown with the awareness that ecosystems evolve with respect to the social organization brondizio et al 2009 human societies and their institutions are thus central when comes to studying the ecological systems halliday and glaser 2011 at a global level an ses can be seen as earth system where human agents act on patterns of global change schellnhuber et al 2004 at a territorial level it can be illustrated as a framework for implementing ecological solidarity within the policies of protection of natural areas that revolve within a territory frank et al 2017 mathevet et al 2016 at a local level ses can be used to study family farms the organization of which is determined not only by farmers and their economic constraints but also by plants and animals halliday and glaser 2011 although networks provide opportunity to study a large variety of systems among which are the socio ecological ones their framework does not account for interconnected systems such as the networks of networks baggio et al 2016 most research has focused on separate social or ecological networks sayles et al 2019 provided that nodes have different kinds of interactions creating a layered network or a multiplex network where each layer represents a different type of interaction proves relevant in point of fact social ecological links build on the appreciation that environmental problems draw from a set of challenges that re occur across contexts bodin et al 2019 the network layers are then constituted of links of different types the field of multilayer networks includes such multiple layers of complexity as it specifically allows one to differentiate and model the intra layer and inter layer connections kivelä et al 2014 lee et al 2015 pilosof et al 2017 the key to extracting useful information from these ses models is to address the degree and level of connectivity which we define as the property of all types of elements interacting on a network connectivity then refers to any form of assemblage interaction or linkage between human and non human agents nicholls et al 2016 its expression can take multiple forms such as economic stromquist 2002 wenz and levermann 2016 social miritello 2013 environmental crooks and sanjayan 2006 dragicevic et al 2017 moritz et al 2013 noss 1987 technological webb 2007 and organizational tillquist 2002 unhelkar 2009 besides those interactions can be between and within the economic social and environmental systems can we measure the operationality of interactions in such networked systems for example we know that the performance of complex systems and networks such as ses depends on their ability to maintain the topological structures through the vertex connectivity frank and frisch 1970 up to now the analysis of ses sustainability has been mostly conducted through the idea of resilience gonzalès and parrott 2012 a system is considered to be resilient when it adapts to external perturbations while continuing to function be it at the expense of changes in the configuration public policies toward resilience must then overcome budget limitations address trade offs be acceptable to many competing interests and overcome barriers in the structure of existing institutions carpenter et al 2012 with a view to reaching resilience dragicevic et al 2017 subjected an ses multiplex network to dynamics of reform through the knock on effect such that the spread of reform on a node came from the neighborhood or from the counterparts previously reformed they found that proportional weighting of all corner stone realms of sustainable development yielded the maximum magnitude of efficiency of the knock on effect nonetheless for a reform to spread on a multiplex network the connectivity between the nodes needs to be operational researchers and policymakers recognize that in reality risks exist within an ses system that can work to undercut the connectivity due to some exogenous endogenous economic or ecological barrier constraint which will undermine the goal of sustainable development forces such as global environmental change and globalization have pushed connectivity to such a level brondizio et al 2009 young et al 2006 that impacts of connections and disconnections on the governance of interactions need to be fully integrated clark 2000 these risks can be both intra and inter layer disconnections an intra layer disconnection within each layer means the termination of an interaction examples of the risk to connectivity include trade that no longer takes place emergence of social distrust or a destruction of an ecological corridor an inter layer disconnection between the layers can be illustrated in the context of absence of an equitable society pointing to the lack of contribution of economic capital in social development that of an unbearable environment where society is unresponsive to the natural environment and through the absence of a viable economy such that economic growth is pursued against the environment despite a substantial literature on network formation and dismantling jackson and rogers 2005 jackson and watts 2002 jackson and wolinsky 1996 johnson and gilles 2000 vega redondo 2007 small research agenda has been devoted to the economic value of the overall network connectivity dragicevic et al 2017 considered the construction of ecological networks in forest environments as the optimal control dynamic graph theoretic problem through shadow prices they managed to provide an economic value to the network connectivity which was found to be of an aggregated nature afterward dragicevic 2018 considered the spacetime discounting in order to compute the present value of connectivity at the scale of a graph through numerical simulations he found that securing connectivity was much more sensitive to spatial discounting than to the temporal one implying that agents valued the safeguard of connections less in time than in space contrary to the existing literature cited above in which nodes decide themselves whether to form or to sever a link we are interested in the capacity of decision makers to achieve policies of maintaining a designed connectedness preserved in a time evolving network geometry this aim is motivated by the postulate that links are at risk of unintended disconnections either in natural or socioeconomic grids we integrate the analysis of social ecological networks using the multiplex networks baggio and hillis 2018 rather than their usual maximization of discounted expected payoffs willems and zwart 2018 we investigate the ability of social planners to provide a resilient ses system against the threat of being deteriorated or dismantled the concept of shadow price as a willingness to undertake control of the network connectivity for an additional unit of time by accepting the cost to be incurred for that purpose then takes the form of a costate variable in the minimization problem lyon 1999 herein we develop a model that reveals the preservation value of maintaining connectivity within an ses system by means of a multiplex network built from the layers composing the sustainability venn diagram we define two measures of preservation value of inter and intra layer connections most policymakers and researchers have tended to assume that all elements within an ses are unconditionally connected which implied that dimensions of sustainable development functioned unhindered we must instead explicitly explore how connectivity is operational given explicit threats to connectivity we show under which conditions connectivity is valuable and should be preserved this implies that policies aimed at sustainable development should focus on explicitly addressing connections and disconnections using numerical simulations our results suggest that the preservation value of the ses topological structure is greatest when we secure the connectivity of inter layer connections the introduction is followed by section 2 where the optimal control in a graph theoretic setting is presented section 3 is dedicated to the simulations conclusive remarks are given in section 4 2 model the first modeling phase consists in creating a multiplex network in which every network layer built from nodes and edges represents a pillar of sustainability consider an undirected and unweighted multiplex network based on the euclidean metric of dimension r n these properties ensure that the relationships between the graph constituents are multidimensional and equally weighted the network is illustrated by an undirected graph γ v e the graph is built from the set of vertices v 1 n and from the set of edges e i j v v which represent the interactions between the nodes in that case i and j represent two interacting nodes fig 1 illustrates the ses framework composed of three layers with a graph theoretic mapping the population of nodes is distributed among l n layers where n 1 2 3 each layer contains n n nodes with i n 1 n n with different intra layer connectivity such a multiplex system is completely specified by the vector of the adjacency matrices of the n layers let a n for n 1 2 3 be the adjacency matrix 2 2 in an undirected graph the adjacency matrix is symmetric of l n with nonnegative elements a i j n n n for i n 1 n n consider two nodes to be connected when i j e such that a i j n 1 and a i j n 0 otherwise each node in l n is connected to its counterparts in l n 3 3 l n should read for all layers of n but the one at stake such that there exists a one to one connectivity pattern between the identical nodes of different layers 4 4 the entries of the adjacency matrix associated with the undirected and unweighted graph represent the network topology otherwise we do not take account of a particular network topology as in many practical applications the multiplex network topology is unknown and global information is not available lombana et al 2020 for a finite time t 0 t the set of edges e and graph γ are treated as variables let us now endow the network with some additional properties such that each node becomes a sustainability element connected to its environment we assume a convex hull of vertices ω in form of an n simplex with the euclidean norm in r n let x i n e i n t r n where n 1 2 3 and i n 1 n n denote the state of node i n characterized by its feature e i n at time t 5 5 in what follows the explicit indication of time such as in x i n e i n t is not specified unless necessary this state encompasses two characteristics 1 its scalar value which permits computing its distance from the neighboring nodes and 2 its nature like its affiliation to a layer or its similarity with the other nodes through the introduction of the states we are now able to measure the intensity of interaction between two random nodes with respect to the network topology the challenge is mainly to infer the network structure using measurements of the nodes activities such as the states of the nodes the configuration space corresponds to the set of all possible states of the dynamic system the global state vector x x 1 n t x n n t t is in form of a stack vector of all the control inputs the evolution of the state of each node depends on the dynamics which maps control inputs to states through 1 x u i n where u i n is the control input of node i n and x 0 implies a steady state 2 1 distance the second modeling phase matches with the establishment of a distance between two random nodes as a measure of intensity of interaction between them these interactions can take place both inside a pillar of sustainable development or between the pillars at stake the set of nodes λ is such that the nodes connected to node i λ form subset λ i for i j λ d i j x i e i x j e j and for λ i j λ 0 d i j z d i j represents the euclidean distance between two nodes while z stands for their respective interaction capacity the utility between two connected nodes u i j is measured from their capacities in flows it is defined as follows definition 1 for i j λ d i j x i e i x j e j and for λ i j λ 0 d i j z u i j 0 if a i j 0 0 otherwise a disconnection between two nodes generates zero utility although the existence of nodes could in itself be valued through utility and their connections defined as sources of positive externalities we assume that only connections provide utility the network utility is thus the connectivity between nodes separated by distances which satisfy the capacities to interact the utility set u i λ of node i corresponds to all nodes connected to it in that manner the overall adequate connectivity in the network is taken account of definition 2 for i j λ the network utility set of node i is the union of utilities issued from the network intra and inter layer connections or u i λ j λ u i j the euclidean distance becomes irrelevant if the interaction occurs between nodes defined as incompatible in other words a node sufficiently close but endowed with a different feature cannot provide any utility to the interacting node therefore we shall employ the mahalanobis distance which takes into account the covariance between the variables as such smaller distances correspond to interacting nodes that are designated as similar or compatible dragicevic et al 2017 the mahalanobis distance enables us to uncover the strong relationship between two constituents of sustainable development and to underweight the weakest links in the graph topology according to shaw et al 2011 an euclidean distance metric is dependent on a positive semidefinite matrix π l t l s 1 where π r n n and l r n n a positive semidefinite laplacian matrix godsil and royle 2001 6 6 matrix π is the inverse of the covariance matrix s 1 two unconnected nodes are then independent in the graph bell et al 2000 the mahalanobis distance preserves the network structure if the weighted graph γ v e σ gives a n γ with a n for n 1 2 3 the adjacency matrix according to the foregoing the three dimensional mahalanobis distance m c a b c between nodes a λ 1 b λ 2 and c λ 3 issued from the three layers corresponds to 2 m c a b c x a 1 e a 1 l 0 l δ l x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 t s 1 x a 1 e a 1 l 0 l δ l x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 1 2 c where l 0 l δ l denotes the composite factor of the spatial discounting dependent on the sequence of vertices the distances of which are being measured when the metric is the identity matrix or π s 1 i m c a b c falls back to the standard euclidean distance between a b and c in order to ensure flowing through the network the nodes specified as compatible shall be linked which is verified by s 1 0 in different words the mahalanobis distance metric guarantees that the connection occurs when two nodes display compatible characteristics in light of finiteness of resources nodes that interact build a grid dependent of their opportunity costs 7 7 the opportunity cost arises from two mutually exclusive options it refers to a benefit that an agent gave up while choosing let scalar c be this economic opportunity cost from choosing either node from the multiplex graph computable at the market value the social planner can thus measure the consequence of connecting the multiplex network in a certain way for other configurations might lead to a different structure of pillars of sustainable development a network administrator is able to identify the subset of nodes λ n for n 1 2 3 evolving on either layer through intra layer connections which all have counterparts on other layers for example for n 1 2 3 we have λ n n such that 3 λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 λ 4 λ 5 λ and λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 λ 4 λ 5 λ 1 n 1 λ 2 n 2 and λ 3 n 3 give the number of nodes in each subset as for subsets λ 4 and λ 5 they correspond to regions delimiting inter layer connections 2 2 dynamics the third modeling phase is about defining the time evolution of states of nodes connected to each other indeed the dynamics governing the evolution of states will enable us to study how the intensity of interaction changes over time following gustavi et al 2010 the follower node dynamics is given by the laplacian based control strategy consensus differential equation according to it the state of a node evolves with respect to the states of the nodes issued from the utility set the cascade effects can thus be modeled dragicevic 2018 the dynamics for a node can be written as 4 x a 1 e a 1 n x a 1 e a 1 δ l 1 1 δ 1 n x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 x d 1 e d 1 x d 2 e d 2 x d 3 e d 3 where x a 1 e a 1 is the state of a node x b 2 e b 2 and x c 3 e c 3 are the states of counterparts from the other layers be it the inter layer connectivity in other terms we are in presence of elements connecting different pillars of sustainable development as for x d 1 e d 1 x d 2 e d 2 and x d 3 e d 3 they denote the states of nodes connected through intra layer connectivity this time we focus on the elements composing one pillar of sustainable development the expression within parentheses is weighted by the spatial discount factor with respect to node i for i n 1 n n it corresponds to the graph diameter west 2000 be it the largest number of nodes which must be traversed in order to travel from one node to another the graph diameter is employed to take account of all the indirect connections in the multiplex graph that have an impact on the evolution of states the annulment of the differential equation yields the node equilibrium state it can be formulated through the following lemma lemma 1 the network equilibrium under consensus dynamics corresponds to the annulment of differential equation x a 1 e a 1 weighted by the spatial discount factor up to the graph diameter the proof is provided in the appendix the following theorem ensues theorem 1 given the consensus problem is well defined in the initial state the ses equilibrium is at a steady state when the whole is greater than the sum of its parts i e formally when the marginal variation of the ses barycenter exceeds the marginal variation of a node s utility set the proof is provided in the appendix the result shows that for ses to remain in equilibrium its center of gravity needs to be greater than the aggregate of states of nodes connecting the layers with respect to the graph diameter or in the longest path the general conditions for the connectivity to be preserved are now announced 2 3 connectivity the fourth modeling phase deals with highlighting the properties that enable two random nodes to remain connected despite the evolution of their states that way we can equally see under which conditions a disconnection between them occurs the preservation of the network connectedness in time goes through the connectivity relation m c a b c the connectivity between two nodes is preserved if the time derivative of the mahalanobis distance between them is nonpositive put differently the condition for nodes i and j to be connected is m c i j 0 should it be the case the convex hull ω is unchanged and the network is lyapunov stable dragicevic and sinclair desgagné 2013 we compute the squared distance derivative gustavi et al 2010 between nodes a b and c and obtain 5 m c a b c 2 2 x a 1 e a 1 l 0 l δ l x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 t s 1 x a 1 e a 1 l 0 l δ l x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 c 2 for arbitrary nodes a λ 1 b λ 2 and c λ 3 the connectivity is defined by 6 m c a b c 2 2 n x a 1 e a 1 l 0 l δ l x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 t s 1 x a 1 e a 1 2 δ l 1 1 δ 1 1 c 2 2 n x a 1 e a 1 l 0 l δ l x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 t s 1 x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 c 2 6 x a 1 e a 1 l 0 l δ l x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 t s 1 δ l 1 1 δ 1 x d 1 e d 1 x d 2 e d 2 x d 3 e d 3 c 2 nodes remain connected when m c i j 0 this results in having δ l 1 1 δ 1 x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 x a 1 e a 1 1 2 given that δ l 1 1 δ 1 0 1 the inequality is verified when the states of nodes connected between different layers are equal corollary 1 necessary and sufficient condition for arbitrary nodes from different layers to evolve connected in a multilayered graph is that their states be similar the proof is provided in the appendix the corollary highlights the egalitarian aspect to be applied to nodes involving on ses which could be read in conjunction with social justice promoted within sustainable development policies it also confirms the idea supported in dragicevic et al 2017 that equal weight should be assigned to all constituents of sustainability 2 4 optimal control problem the last modeling phase consists in presenting a method to keep the initial network connected over time despite the risk of the graph dismantling the latter is due to the variation of intensity of interactions between the nodes we apply the optimal control method to guarantee the preservation of the network connectedness mesbahi and egerstedt 2010 for that purpose we include the performance function j the purpose of which is maintain the network configuration at the lowest cost it takes the form of a cost function integrated over finite time for all 0 t t 7 j 0 t m c a b c d t the network administrator decides to sustain the network topology via control variables m c a b c in which control translates into creating edges sengupta and lafortune 1992 the continuous time optimal control problem is that of maintaining connectivity under the constraint of network equilibrium lachner et al 1998 defined over the state variables subject to consensus dynamics the optimal control problem is formulated as the minimization of the performance function put differently 8 min x a 1 e a 1 x d 1 e d 1 j subject to two first order dynamic constraints 9 x a 1 e a 1 x d 1 e d 1 the problem pertains to the choice of the control vector provided the constraints on the state vector as a matter of fact the nodes update their states from the utility set which both includes nodes from the same layer and counterparts from the other layers we must study the first order necessary optimality conditions where the states of counterparts from different layers are used as inputs to the network through this methodology we can control the connections between different pillars of sustainable development that way the social planner ensures the preservation of sustainable development in time the optimal control problem can be solved with the help of the present value hamiltonian discounted in time up to t t which represents the impact of evolution of x a 1 e a 1 and x d 1 e d 1 on the network topology the first order optimality conditions yield 10 λ μ δ 2 δ l 1 3 2 δ 1 δ l the costate variables lyon 1999 are given by λ and μ they disclose the shadow prices for keeping the network connected they also provide indication on the network connectivity value λ for the connectivity between the layers and μ for the connectivity within a layer the former equality is part of the initial conditions on the choices of costate variables for the system control such that theorem 1 holds let w 0 x a 0 1 e a 1 t x b 0 2 e b 2 t x c 0 3 e c 3 t x d 0 1 e d 1 t x d 0 2 e d 2 t x d 0 3 e d 3 t λ 0 t μ 0 t t be the initial network state controlling the network consists in fixing λ 0 and μ 0 such that 11 x a t 1 e a 1 δ l 1 1 δ 1 x b t 2 e b 2 x c t 3 e c 3 δ l 1 1 n δ 1 x d t 1 e d 1 x d t 2 e d 2 x d t 3 e d 3 where λ 0 and μ 0 are subject to 10 lemma 2 the preservation of ses inter and intra layer connections is subject to imperfect strategic substitutability the proof is provided in the appendix thereby the willingness to pay for maintaining the connectivity between counterparts from different layers is equal to the willingness to pay for preserving the connectivity between nodes within a layer weighted by spatial discounting up to the graph diameter otherwise controlling the network is non optimal by letting w x a 1 e a 1 t x b 2 e b 2 t x c 3 e c 3 t x d 1 e d 1 t x d 2 e d 2 t x d 3 e d 3 t λ t μ t t reflect the network state where the values of shadow prices comply with 10 the system control is obtained through the following hamiltonian system it corresponds to all the constraints placed on the social planner to keep the sustainable development operational through time 12 w p w where p 0 0 1 2 c 2 s 1 e δ t 1 2 δ l 1 1 δ 1 0 0 0 1 6 c 2 s 1 e δ t 1 6 c 2 s 1 e δ t 2 n s 1 c 2 e δ t δ l 1 1 δ 1 3 δ

finding costate variables that validate theorem 2 3 simulations the aim of this section is to discuss through simulations the conditions that guarantee the preservation of ses connectivity in time for the sake of simplicity consider a reduced version of the ses multiplex network let n 1 2 3 represent the three ses layers and i 1 9 the nodes composing the multilayered network each layer is then formed of three nodes the vector of states such that x 0 10 9 8 5 4 4 3 5 2 issued from the subsets of economic social and environmental nodes that is n 1 x a 1 e a 1 x d 1 1 e d 1 1 x d 2 1 e d 2 1 n 2 x b 2 e b 2 x d 1 2 e d 1 2 x d 2 2 e d 2 2 and n 3 x c 3 e c 3 x d 1 3 e d 1 3 x d 2 3 e d 2 3 is converted into a square form distance matrix we are interested in the behavior of the triad of nodes x a 1 e a 1 x b 2 e b 2 x c 3 e c 3 issued from the sustainability pillars which provide connectivity between the three layers and in the behavior of the remaining nodes the union of which forms the intra layer connections now consider the following covariance matrix e a 1 e b 2 e c 3 e d 1 1 e d 2 1 e d 1 2 e d 2 2 e d 1 3 e d 2 3 e a 1 1 00 0 75 0 50 0 90 0 80 0 70 0 75 0 60 0 50 e b 2 0 75

95 1 00 the laplacian dynamics applied to the nodes yields the following evolution of mahalanobis coordinates we suppose that the multilayered network is initially in equilibrium and connected at t 0 let us now expose the nodes to the laplacian dynamics the evolution of coordinates is shown in fig 2 we can see that distances between the nodes within and between layers enlarge along the timeline the ses multiplex network is no longer in equilibrium at t 50 in that the average gap between the triad states is increasing in time going from 1 33 at t 0 with 1 90 at t 25 to 3 67 at t 50 the absence of maintenance of the opening equilibrium goes against the constraints from lemma 1 or corollary 1 at the multiplex graph level the nodes are likely to disconnect which can jeopardize their ability to maintain the convex hull unchanged in detail we have 1 9 6 0 03 0 02 2 0 02 0 04 such that the marginal variation of the ses barycenter is less than the marginal variation of node a s utility set therefore the network equilibrium is not at a steady state in the simulated example theorem 1 is valid but unverified along the time path let us first analyze the inter layer connectivity as can be observed in the figure after the initial decrease in the states of the triad at stake x a 1 e a 1 remains stable throughout the timeline while x b 2 e b 2 and x c 3 e c 3 experience a steady decrease from t 2 until t 45 after that time step an oscillation between rise and fall is observed the interesting feature of what is noted stands at the stabilization of the economic agent at the expense of both social and environmental agents to take the analysis one step further the swinging of social and environmental nodes starting at t 46 is reflective such that the state improvement of the former seems to deteriorate the state of the latter which can for example illustrate the substitutability between labor market improvement and environmental degradation widely documented in the literature lawn 2006 just as much triads x d 1 1 e d 1 1 x d 1 2 e d 1 2 x d 1 3 e d 1 3 and x d 2 1 e d 2 1 x d 2 2 e d 2 2 x d 2 3 e d 2 3 show the substitution between the three pillars of sustainability nevertheless unlike in the previous pattern the economic x d 1 1 e d 1 1 x d 2 1 e d 2 1 and environmental x d 1 3 e d 1 3 x d 2 3 e d 2 3 agents now co evolve in a compatible manner the most striking feature coming from the overall examination is that social agents appear to be the adjustment variable in the ses framework indeed their states follow the opposite dynamics of either or both the economic and environmental nodes as for the intra layer connectivity the broad analysis reveals that a different type of substitutability occurs within the layers like in the previous case the rise of two nodes is realized at the cost of the third one a more detailed examination shows three different dynamics the first one is relative to the social triad and illustrates the fall of x b 2 e b 2 with respect to x d 1 2 e d 1 2 x d 2 2 e d 2 2 the second one applies to the economic triad and reveals an irregular trend thereby x a 1 e a 1 and x d 2 1 e d 2 1 first decline and then stand on flat trajectories which is not the case of x d 1 1 e d 1 1 that has a v shaped path with an inflection at t 31 before faltering after t 45 the third pattern can be considered as trendless that is while x d 2 3 e d 2 3 is almost stable from t 2 until the terminal time step x c 3 e c 3 and x d 2 3 e d 2 3 start to oscillate at t 45 after a monotonous decrease with a vacillating trajectory of x d 1 3 e d 1 3 explained earlier through that of x d 1 1 e d 1 1 result 1 the mahalanobis coordinates free from optimal control indicate that the ses multiplex structure is out of equilibrium and at risk of dismantling let us now look at the optimal control conditions for different levels of opportunity costs as said earlier the optimal control is meant to secure the coordinates of the ses multiplex graph at a cost evaluated through shadow prices such that inter and intra layer connections are preserved two cases are examined i e 1 the preservation of ses through its inter layer connections ses λ and 2 the preservation of ses through its intra layer connections ses μ shadow prices represent the costate variables the equation of which is detailed in 10 computed by solving the optimal control problem the first case is studied by considering λ to which the hamiltonian coordinates from 12 are applied the outcomes correspond to the preservation values of inter λ λ p and intra layer μ λ p connections the second case is studied by considering μ to which the hamiltonian coordinates are applied as well the outcomes then correspond to the preservation values of inter λ μ p and intra layer μ μ p connections fig 3 illustrates the behavior of shadow prices λ λ p μ λ p obtained with respect to inter layer control with rising levels of opportunity costs such that c 0 50 1 10 6 we observe that lim c 0 λ μ and lim c λ μ 115 0 09 fig 4 depicts the behavior of shadow prices λ μ p μ μ p obtained with respect to intra layer control with rising levels of opportunity costs such that c 0 50 1 10 6 we observe that lim c 0 λ μ and lim c λ μ 6 52 8 556 result 2 the shadow prices are negatively unbounded at near zero opportunity costs and positively bounded with significant levels of opportunity costs therefore in both cases null opportunity costs generate high negative preservation values whereas significant opportunity costs starting at c 10 produce ceiling values of preservation put differently when the opportunity cost is close to zero which implies indifference toward preserving connectivity between the layers or operating on its own layer without considering the remaining sustainability pillars the value of connectivity is negative in that maintaining connectivity between economy society and environment is a costly undertaking when the opportunity cost is of significant amount the value of connectivity is upper bounded because the role of ses is to provide utility both within and between layers the numerical values show that lemma 2 is verified for two reasons first we see that λ λ p μ λ p and λ μ p μ μ p thereby there exists strategic substitutability between preserving connectivity within and between layers then we have λ λ p μ λ p and λ μ p μ μ p in that strategic substitutability is imperfect in either case and also far from being proportional in the second case at a first glance preserving the ses structure by investing in inter layer connections seems irrelevant with respect to the costs to be incurred via λ p maintaining the ses intact is cost consuming on the contrary securing both inter and intra layer connections via μ p requires a moderate investment however due to imperfect substitution noted above a closer look on the values of λ λ p and μ λ p proves the exact opposite simply because preserving the ses structure from within the layers appears less onerous risking a low cost intra layer control of 6 52 for a possible damage of 8 556 on intra layer connectivity against a high cost inter layer control of 115 for a damage of only 0 09 on intra layer connectivity can be considered as economically unsound not only because the sacrificed connections would then need to be rehabilitated in the long run but also in the wake of compensatory damages that would need to be paid 8 8 in a study conducted by oecd 2018 the authors point out that the catnat compensation scheme which was conceived to encourage flood prevention rather than indemnity for damages simply because the former is less expensive for all the stakeholders has not been successful to date when read in conjunction with our results their conclusions bring to light that the tradeoff between willingness to pay as the cost of prevention and willingness to accept as the monetary payout is of utmost importance economically speaking the shadow price is the maximum price one is willing to pay to maintain the network connected for an additional unit of time if a negative value is the willingness to accept a monetary compensation for letting the ses connectivity deteriorate one would only ask for an offset of 0 09 in case of investment in inter layer connections and of 8 556 in case of investment in intra layer connections result 3 preserving the ses structure through optimal control is more efficient by securing connectivity of inter layer connections than of intra layer connections furthermore if one considers the opportunity costs to be negligible one could even ask for infinite compensation demanded indeed due to broken links between the layers one could end up disconnecting from the overall network while mostly evolving with respect to the nodes from its layer neighborhood this result emphasizes the importance of connections between economy society and environment that might lead to the collapse of ses simply because one distances oneself from the inter layer connectivity this also ties up with the idea that ses are linked systems of people and nature where economic agents are not apart from the nature berkes et al 2003 4 conclusion by considering the ses system as a multiplex network composed of layers borrowed from the sustainability venn diagram we uncovered its properties of equilibrium and performance the latter being defined as the ability to maintain its topological structure through the vertex connectivity we could think of the relevance to preserve the ses structure through its inter layer connections as our main result it ties up with a previous finding obtained through the resolution of an evolutionary variational inequality that the stability of compartmentalized networks depends on the preservation of between subnetwork coupling dragicevic 2016 should the ses multilayered network be seen as a networked system divided into compartments the model outputs also show that investing in equity supportability and viability as the very well known goals to be pursued within sustainable development might be onerous but they also notify that this approach significantly reduces the risk of damaging interactions taking place inside the pillars inherently constitutive of the sustainable development the initial works by mäler 2008 and mäler and li 2010 dealt with resilience management as insurance against reaching a non desired state these authors focused on social cost benefit analyses and considered time dependent preferences in order to unveil as a metric for sustainability measurement the shadow price of resilience in their modeling framework the shadow price takes the form of the present discounted value of future improvements in welfare due to a marginal increase in the resilience stock increased by the reduced regime shift risk also termed as the flip to a qualitatively different state as for the resilience stock it corresponds to the distance between the current state and a threshold level of state two main differences with respect to our model are worthy of note by considering interacting nodes in our case the distance in nodes states becomes the relative level of resilience supplied by their suitable connectivity rather than being related to welfare enhancement our shadow price corresponds to a marginal willingness of a regulator to provide a resilience management in a way that the multiplex connectivity is ensured for an additional unit of time nevertheless our results are partly in accordance with their findings since their resilience stock sustains the system when it is high for we define equilibrium properties in the longest path likewise maintaining connectivity as a necessary condition for resilience is ensured by the egalitarian feature of states which would be a refinement of their outcome in that it should apply in each point of time to every constitutive member of the networked ecological system using an ecological economic model baumgärtner and strunz 2014 extended the works mentioned above and studied the ecosystem resilience as an insurance tool that enables risk averse ecosystem users to mitigate against potential welfare losses their modeling enabled to provide the marginal economic insurance value of ecosystem resilience as a maximum willingness to pay for a marginal increase in the level of resilience according to their results the insurance value of resilience is negative positive for low high levels of resilience although we do not consider risk averse utility functions just as much they do not take account of time preferences their results can still be considered in line with our outcomes when read in conjunction with our framework maintaining the connectivity in time can be interpreted as a type of insurance for the ses system to function unhindered provided that our measure of resilience depends exclusively on the maintenance of connectivity where connections provide utility rather than spearhead positive externalities both frameworks consider an overall economic value of resilience measuring through shadow prices the preservation of connectivity in time hence boils down to setting apart a component of this value in addition obtaining a negative insurance value for a low level of resilience matches with the results obtained with respect to our opportunity costs as a matter of fact a low opportunity cost implies indifference between being connected and disconnected since the ses resilience relies on connectedness a low opportunity cost involves a low level of resilience just as their insurance level is negative at low levels of resilience we obtain negative shadow prices at such levels of opportunity costs in case the level of resilience is high our results show bounded positive values this could be an additive feature pertaining to connected architectures as for the research carried out in network theory a geographically based cost structure to forming links was presented in jackson and rogers 2005 their structure captured heterogeneity in link costs where agents grouped on an island bore a lower cost of forming connections within that island and bore a higher cost across the islands accordingly the links within an island represent the intra layer connectivity while the links across the islands represent the inter layer connectivity given the benefits of indirect connections the authors showed that this type of cost structure generated the structure of a small world network with higher rates of connections on a local scale such that the neighbors of any given node were likely to be the neighbors of each other through the optimal control method this work extends their findings in that 1 result 3 reveals the presence of characteristics of a multiplex small world network agarwal et al 2016 2 a higher shadow cost is meant to avoid severing links of any kind in the multilayered network instead let us now dedicate a couple of words on the role of system size and the use of distance metrics if the system size is very large the local interpretation of the distance and connectivity might differ from the global interpretation of ses which might result in a conflict with the model despite the fact that we have conducted simple simulations in order to highlight the preservation value of socio ecological systems our results hold on a large scale of complex systems this is due to the fact that the social planner initially engineers the multiplex network such that it verifies the properties of connectedness leading to sustainable development moreover despite the laplacian dynamics that might enlarge the distances and thus compromise the connectivity of system elements the optimal control enables him or her to keep the engineered network functional over time let us recall that the safeguard of the multiplex network is achieved by taking into account all the indirect connections via the graph diameter this method makes sense in large systems for all that needs to be monitored even in presence of numerous nodes and links is the upholding of all mahalanobis distances through two costate variables independent from the number of nodes in the system that work at the aggregate level we thus avoid confining the use of distance metrics at a local scale the alternative representation of sustainable development in form of concentric circles mitchell 2000 in which the economic area is embedded within the social area which is within the natural environment is probably the most appropriate to address the challenges faced by the ses system dragicevic 2020 as a matter of fact the concentric diagram brings out the mutual involvement between the factors at stake for any interaction within the economic area has an impact upon the social and environmental realms which contain it contrary to what is stated in the current balancing of factors hacking and guthrie 2008 the evaluation of public policies that aim at promoting social responsibility ought to incorporate this type of diagnosis more widely it is already the case within the corporate triple bottom line strategies elkington 1998 wilson 2015 ergo in the absence of such full reasoning at the global scale working collectively on the safeguard of connections that link economy society and environment should be the second best blueprint on which to engage in the medium term the future avenues of research are found to be three the first category is about the study of weighted socio ecological multiplex systems through the analysis of an aggregated topological adjacency matrix by discriminating between the strength of a node over its neighbors and or counterparts that way we could monitor the dynamics subject to an ex ante layer discrimination the second category concerns the graph theoretic characterization of stochastic controllability by means of stochastic optimal control all the more so due to the conjunction of different types of uncertainty hambusch 2008 such as climate change joyce et al 2006 that weigh on ses systems finally we could envisage a multiplex network where some connections whether intra or inter layer provide disutility and study how their presence affects the choices of social planners to preserve the ses network topology over time as previously stated in other works dragicevic 2018 dragicevic et al 2017 this one also has to be considered as exploratory inasmuch as graph theory is a schematized representation of network patterns
