19160,free nitrous acid fna pre treatment has been previously demonstrated to be effective in enhancing methane production and volatile solids vs destruction in the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge for an equivalent hydraulic retention time hrt we hypothesise that due to enhancement of hydrolysis kinetics fna pre treatment will also allow reduction in the hrt while retaining performance this would allow for improvement of capacity constrained digesters two anaerobic sludge digesters control experiment were fed with the same thickened waste activated sludge twas from a full scale plant for 6 months with 24 h pre treatment of twas at an fna concentration of 6 1 mgn l no2 n 250 mg l ph 5 0 t 25 c the hrt for the experimental anaerobic digester was progressively reduced from 15 days to 12 days and then to 7 5 days in comparison the control reactor was operated at a constant hrt of 15 days representing typical loading conditions with the shortened hrts the experimental ad reactor achieved vs destruction at 36 9 0 8 12 days and 36 8 1 0 7 5 days representing 30 40 relative increase in comparison to the control reactor at 26 5 0 8 and 28 3 0 7 respectively in the same two periods this was supported by a similar 31 35 increase in the methane production per unit of vs fed the volumetric methane production rate of the experimental digester was increased by 165 at hrt of 7 5 days compared with the control digester at hrt of 15 days the results demonstrated that fna pre treatment of twas can substantially increase the capacity of an anaerobic sludge digester with a highly favourable economic outcome graphical abstract image 1 keywords free nitrous acid waste activated sludge anaerobic digestion methane production dewaterability 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the main by product of activated sludge wastewater treatment the treatment and disposal of was incurs large costs to wastewater treatment plants abelleira pereira et al 2015 anaerobic digestion ad of was is widely applied due to its reasonably effective volatile solids destruction vsd at a relatively low cost the hydrolysis of was is the rate limiting step in anaerobic sludge digestion a long hydraulic retention time hrt ca 15 20 days is usual needed to reach an acceptable level of vs destruction and biogas production in order to enhance the efficiency of the ad process pre treatment methods including mechanical chemical and heat pre treatment have been proposed carrère et al 2010 which all require significant energy or chemical input yet often resulting in limited improvement free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 at parts per million mg n l levels is biocidal for microbes in anaerobic wastewater biofilms jiang et al 2011 and in was pijuan et al 2012 through biochemical methane production bmp tests wang et al 2013 demonstrated that methane production from a full scale thickened waste activated sludge twas with fna pre treatment at 0 4 2 1 mg n l for 24 h was enhanced by 10 30 at a digestion time of 20 days compared with the twas without fna pre treatment these results were supported by similar bmp tests with different full scale twas and primary sludge zahedi et al 2016 2017a 2017b in a more recent study using two continuous ad reactors operated at an identical hrt of 15 days wei et al 2018 demonstrated that 24 h pre treatment of twas at an fna concentration of 1 8 mgn l no2 n 250 mg l ph 5 5 t 25 c improved the vs destruction of a full scale twas by 17 from 29 vsd to 34 vsd accompanied by a similar increase in methane production the pre treatment also enhanced the dewaterability of the digested sludge by 14 economic analysis showed that fna pre treatment can substantially reduce operational costs for wastewater treatment wei et al 2018 through model based analysis of bmp data wang et al 2013 found that in addition to enhancing the methane yield fna pre treatment also improved the hydrolysis rate of twas at fna concentrations of 1 78 2 13 mg n l the twas hydrolysis rate was found to increase by approximately 50 compared to the twas without fna pre treatment the result suggests that due to enhanced hydrolysis kinetics fna pre treatment may not only improve vs destruction in an ad reactor at a given hrt but also maintain this improvement while the ad reactor is operated at a lower hrt this potentially provides an effective strategy for the upgrading of capacity limited anaerobic sludge digesters leading to savings in capital costs in this study we extend the study reported in wei et al 2018 to experimentally identify if fna pre treatment could retain enhanced vs destruction and methane yield even when the digester is operated at hrts that are much shorter than the commonly acceptable hrt 2 materials and methods 2 1 overall experimental design two continuous anaerobic sludge digesters fed with the same full scale twas were operated for six months with 24 h pre treatment of twas at an fna concentration of 6 1 mgn l the hrt for the experimental ad reactor was progressively reduced from 15 days to 12 days and then to 7 5 days the overall performance of the experimental system was evaluated through the measurement of vs destruction methane production ammonium release ph and dewaterability of digested sludge compared with those of the control reactor a constant hrt of 15 days was applied to the control reactor throughout the experimental study to provide a standard reference for performance comparison in all phases it is noted an hrt of 15 20 days is typically applied in the anaerobic digestion of twas 2 2 sludge sources twas was collected from the dissolved air flotation thickener of a local wastewater treatment plant brisbane australia the plant operated with a solids retention time srt of 15 days receives primarily domestic wastewater at an average flow of approximately 120 000 m3 day and performs biological cod chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen removal the sludge was collected weekly and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for use in the week the sludge was used as received without any modifications regular chemical analysis was performed to characterise the feed sludge table 1 shows the average characteristics of the twas used in this study 2 3 reactor design and operation the schematic of the anaerobic sludge digestion systems used in this study is shown in fig 1 the experimental system consisted of a 0 3 l pre treatment unit and a 1 3 l anaerobic digester 1 l liquid volume and 0 3 l headspace and the control system only has an identical anaerobic digester the temperature in both digesters was maintained at 35 1 c with a temperature controlled water jacket biogas production was measured using tipping bucket gasmeters which were recalibrated every two months the exhaust gas from the gas meters was collected with gas bags both digesters were continually mixed with magnetic stirrers ph in both digesters was measured with a ph meter minichem the pre treatment unit in the experimental system was continually mixed with a magnetic stirrer and the ph was measured using a ph meter minichem and controlled by a programmable logic controller plc at a set point of 5 0 see 2 4 the sludge from the feed tank was uniformly supplied to both systems and simultaneously discharged from two digesters with peristaltic pumps 2 4 experimental design the two systems were continuously operated in a laboratory for 180 days which were divided into three periods period 1 baseline period 0 48 days in the baseline period the pre treatment unit in the experimental system was not operated the two systems were operated identically to reach steady state steady state i as indicated by stable vs destruction and stable methane production both anaerobic digesters were operated with an hrt of 15 days by feeding 66 7 ml twas on a daily basis and simultaneously discharging the same volume of digested sludge period 2 second period 49 132 days in the second period the control system was operated as in period 1 for the experimental system the fna pre treatment unit was started the pre treatment conditions were as follows ph 5 0 0 1 no2 n 250 mgn l t 25 c treatment duration 24 h the ph and nitrite levels applied gave rise to an fna concentration of 6 1 mg n l the concentration of fna was calculated as s n o 2 n k a 10 p h where k a e 2 300 273 t with t 25 c anthonisen et al 1976 pre treated twas of 83 3 ml was fed into the experimental reactor each day resulting in an hrt of 12 days the two systems were operated to establish steady state steady state ii of the second period as indicated by stable vs destruction and methane production period 3 third period 133 180 days in the third period the control system was operated as in period 1 for the experimental system the pre treatment unit was operated as in period 2 pre treated twas of 133 3 ml was fed into the experimental reactor on a daily basis resulting in an hrt of 7 5 days the two systems were operated to establish steady state steady state iii again as indicated by stable vs destruction and methane production an alternative experimental design was to apply the same shorter hrts as applied to the experimental reactor to the control reactor in period 2 and period 3 however such short hrts are well known to be impractical for twas digestion without pre treatment such an experimental design while with theoretical interest is not ideal for our purpose to demonstrate the practical value of the newly proposed process with the current design we assumed that the control reactor would not achieve better vs destruction with shorter hrts in comparison to the longer and more suitable hrt of 15 days 2 5 monitoring protocol the biogas production rates and ph of the two anaerobic digesters were measured once a day total solids ts and vs of both the feed and digested sludge from the two anaerobic digesters and the volatile fatty acids vfas and ammonium concentrations in the two digesters were measured twice a week samples from the ad reactors were taken immediately before the twas feeding was started biogas composition including ch4 h2 co2 was also measured twice a week total chemical oxygen demand tcod of the feed and discharged sludge was measured once a week the dewaterability of the digested sludge were measured twice a week the fecal coliform level in the feed sludge the digested sludge and also in the fna pre treated sludge was measured at steady states of all periods in triplicate 2 6 analytical methods ts vs tcod and tkn were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 vs destruction of the anaerobic digesters was calculated based on the difference between the vs concentrations in the feed and digested sludge as switzenbaum et al 2003 1 v s d e s t r u c t i o n vs conc in vs conc out vs conc in 100 where vsconc in and vsconc out are the vs concentrations in the feed and digested sludge for the measurement of soluble cod skn nh4 n and vfas filtration was carried out first with a syringe filter 0 45 μm pore size nh4 n was measured using a lachat quik chem 8000 flow injection analyser lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin vfas were determined using a gc agilent fid with polar capillary column gas composition h2 ch4 co2 was analysed by gc tcd shimadzu gc 2014 methane production rate was calculated based on the biogas production rate and the methane fraction in biogas dewaterability of digested sludge was measured according to chen et al 2001 and devlin et al 2011 briefly the sludge samples and cationic polymer 0 005 g polymer g sludge were mixed and stirred for 1 min then the sludge was drained into solids cake through a belt filter fabric the solids cake was then centrifuged using the belt filter fabric at 3750 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was removed and the solids content of thickened sludge cake was measured the measurement of fecal coliform was performed using colilert 18 test kit from the idexx laboratories devlin et al 2011 the sludge samples were diluted to 100 ml diluted 102 to 105 times depending on the sludge samples in 120 ml sterilized bottles the colilert 18 reagents were afterwards dissolved in the 100 ml diluted samples the above mentioned 100 ml mixed solution was transferred into the quanti tray 2000 and then sealed with a quanti tray sealer the sealed quanti tray 2000 was then incubated at an incubator at 44 5 0 5 c for 18 h finally the positive yellow wells were counted and the most probable number mpn of fecal coliform was calculated based on the idexx quanti tray 2000 mpn table http www idexx com au 2 7 biochemical methane potential bmp tests bmp tests were carried out for the feed sludge and fna pre treated sludge with the procedure detailed in wang et al 2013 and jensen et al 2011 to determine the biochemical methane potential and hydrolysis rate of the twas treated with fna at 6 1 mgn l this level fna was not used in any of the previous studies briefly a twas sample of 25 ml along with 75 ml inoculum with an inoculum to twas ratio of 2 0 on a dry vs basis was added to a 160 ml serum vials where the sludge was anaerobically digested for 40 days in a temperature controlled incubator at 37 1 c control tests with fna treated twas replaced with twas without pre treatment along with blank tests without addition of twas i e inoculum only were also conducted all tests were carried out in triplicate the biogas volume and composition were monitored the cumulative methane production was determined with results reported as the amount of methane produced per vs mass added l ch4 kg vsadded a first order kinetics model was used to assess methane production kinetics and methane potential of the sludge samples two key parameters hydrolysis rate k and biochemical methane potential b0 were estimated according to the method described in batstone 2013 3 results 3 1 vs destruction fig 2 shows the vs destruction and ammonium release in the two anaerobic sludge digesters over the three experimental periods the vs destruction in the two systems in the baseline period fig 2a was not significantly different in the second period the vs destruction level of the experimental reactor was 39 0 higher than that of the control reactor despite of a shorter hrt 12 days vs 15 days in control table 2 this trend remained in the third period when the experimental reactor hrt was further reduced to 7 5 days with the vs destruction in the experimental reactor being 30 higher table 2 the enhanced vs destruction at a shorter hrt is likely due to that fna pre treatment destroyed cells and or extracellular polymeric substances eps with the release of intracellular and or extracellular constituents wang et al 2013 comparison of the tcod in the feed sludge and the digested sludge from the two lines showed tcod removal of 0 96 0 05 gcod d n 12 and 2 48 0 08 gcod d n 12 in the control and experimental line respectively in period 3 in comparison the methane production rate in the same period was 0 95 0 02 gcod d n 12 and 2 59 0 11 gcod d n 12 for the control and experimental system respectively the agreement of tcod removal and methane production p 0 05 in both cases provided independent support to the vs destruction results similar cod balances were also achieved for both reactors in period 2 the scod measurement of the feed sludge and the fna treated sludge showed significant sludge solubilization during fna treatment scod increased from 0 85 0 08 before treatment to 4 99 0 26 g l after treatment the increase represented approximately 10 of the non soluble cod in the sludge 42 8 2 1 g l this means that fna treatment contributed substantially to vs destruction in the experimental line taking vs destruction in the fna treatment reactor into consideration the vs destruction achieved in the experimental ad reactor was approximately 29 9 in both period 2 and period 3 which was comparable to or slightly higher than vs destruction in the control ad reactor at 26 5 0 8 in period 2 and 28 3 0 7 in period 3 these results suggest that fna pre treatment not only directly solubilized particulate organics in was at 10 but also converted some of the organics not digestible in a normal ad reactor to digestible organics in comparison to the control system the average nh4 n release increased by 47 and 38 at the steady state of the second and third periods fig 2b table 2 respectively which supports the vs destruction results the higher ammonium concentration in the experimental reactor implies that the nitrogen load to the mainstream system would increase slightly as a result of the enhanced vs destruction should the anaerobic digestion liquor be returned to the mainstream for further treatment 3 2 methane production similarly fna pre treatment resulted in a higher conversion of organic components to methane even at shorter hrts fig 3 a while the methane production rate in the two digesters was not statistically different in the baseline period the methane production rate for the experimental reactor increased substantially by 64 and 165 compared to the control digester in period 2 and period 3 respectively the increases were partly due to the increased loading rates to the experimental digester 25 and 100 higher in period 2 and period 3 respectively and partly due to the enhanced vs destruction table 2 despite a shortened hrt the enhanced methane yield was calculated to be 31 and 35 higher than the control reactor in period 2 and period 3 respectively table 2 in the first 10 days of the second period methane production rate in the experimental reactor decreased temporarily vfas in the experimental reactor increased sharply from 106 mg cod l to 3221 mg cod l before returning to the baseline level fig 3c suggesting a temporary overloading caused by the simultaneous reduction in hrt 12 days and fna pre treatment it should be noted that the digesters were fed semi continuously sludge was pulse fed once a day rather than continuously which would have also contributed to the loading shock in the third period the average vfa concentrations for the control and experimental systems were 151 14 mg cod l and 685 64 mg cod l at steady state lasting for 45 days i e 6 hrts respectively the average effluent vfa concentration of 685 mg cod l suggests that methanogenesis was the rate limiting step in the experimental digester without adjusting the ph after pre treatment with fna at ph 5 0 ph in the control and experimental digesters was comparable at 7 25 0 01 and 7 29 0 01 respectively indicating that the experimental reactor was not acidified despite of the accumulation of vfas this was likely because of the higher ammonium release in the experimental digester 38 higher which countered the additional acid production indeed the average bicarbonate alkalinities were 3148 47 mg hco3 l and 3756 17 mg hco3 l in the control and experimental systems respectively the average methane and co2 content in the experimental reactor biogas in period 3 was 63 3 and 33 7 respectively in comparison to 60 6 and 35 3 in the control reactor biogas the lower co2 content and consequently higher ch4 content was likely due to the higher ph in experimental system 7 29 0 01 vs 7 25 0 01 which caused more inorganic carbon to remain in the liquid phase in the experimental reactor 3 3 other performance indicators 3 3 1 dewaterability of digested sludge the solids content of the digested sludge after dewatering using a laboratory belt filter centrifuge was not different for the two reactors over all three experimental periods fig 4 which indicates that dewaterability can be maintained even at this reduced hrt wei et al 2018 observed that fna pre treatment of was enhanced dewaterability of digested sludge however the same hrt 15 days was applied to both digesters with and without fna pre treatment the application of hrts different from the control may have incurred additional effects on the dewaterability of the digested sludge 3 3 2 pathogen removal the biomass specific mpn of fecal coliform in the twas fna treated twas and digested sludge from the two systems in the three steady states are presented in fig 5 in the baseline period the mpn of fecal coliform present in the digested sludge from the control and experimental reactors were similar at 5 6 0 1 logmpn gts fna pre treatment reduced the mpn of fecal coliform present in the twas from 6 2 0 1 to 3 4 0 1 logmpn gts however when hrt was decreased from 15 days to 12 days and then to 7 5 days combined with fna pre treatment the mpn of fecal coliform present in the discharged sludge from the experimental reactor remained at 5 5 0 2 logmpn gts the results mean there was an unexpected re growth of pathogens in the anaerobic digester the results are also somewhat different from that reported in wei et al 2018 which reported lower fecal coliform levels in the line with fna pre treatment of was compared to that without the difference could be related to the shortened hrt applied in this study but the exact reason for the 2 log re growth of pathogens in the digester following the 3 log destruction by fna treatment is unclear and remains to be further investigated the digested sludge 5 7 0 1 and 5 5 0 2 logmpn gts for the control and experimental digesters respectively could meet class b biosolids standards for land application us epa 40 cfr part 503 regulation 3 3 3 bmp tests fig 6 shows the cumulative methane production from twas and twas with fna pre treatment fna 6 1 mg n l in bmp tests in the first two days the cumulative methane production of twas with fna pre treatment was close to control however it increased greatly after 3 days and exceeded that of control table 3 summarizes the estimated sludge hydrolysis rate k and biochemical methane potential b0 for the two sludges using a first order kinetic model fig s2 the hydrolysis rate k was found to be improved by 67 through fna pre treatment similarly the biochemical methane potential b0 was enhanced about 20 4 discussion this study demonstrates that fna pre treatment of twas enables the use of shortened hrt in anaerobic digestion of sludge yet with an improved vs destruction and enhanced methane production fna pre treatment of twas may potentially be used to enhance the capacity of an anaerobic sludge digester at an hrt of 7 5 days half that of the control digester i e 15 days the experimental digester was able to achieve a vs destruction of 36 8 1 0 compared to 28 3 0 7 achieved in the control reactor this means that the incorporation of an fna pre treatment unit with an hrt of 1 day the capacity of a digester can be doubled this offers a promising technology to upgrade anerobic sludge digesters that are receiving or are expected to receive a sludge loading rate above the designed level contrary to incorporating an additional digester which requires large volume gas tight reactors biogas collection and security protection the fna pre treatment simply requires an open mixed tank with a retention time of one day thus the capital investment required is expected to be a small fraction of what required to build an additional anerobic sludge digester the fna based twas pre treatment process does require addition of nitite and acid economic analysis previously done wei et al 2018 showed that the economic return due to reduced sludge disposal costs and increased biogas production far outweigh these operational costs in this study we applied ph 5 0 rather than 5 5 as used in wei et al 2018 titration tests showed that the acid consumption is increased by 36 supplementary infromation fig s1 this only moderately increases the total chemical costs by 8 8 as the costs for nitrite remains unchanged but induced futher increases in vs destruction 30 39 and biogas production 31 35 in comparison with the case when ph 5 5 was used 17 for vs destruction and 16 in methane production wei et al 2018 the treatment conditions applied ph 5 0 no2 n 250 mg l treatment duration 24 h and t 25 c were not the results of a systematic optimisation and hence the conditions applied are not necessarily optimal in fact the above treatment conditions were varied from wei et al 2018 with the only variation being a reduction in ph from 5 5 to 5 0 we hypothesized that such a change could potentially further enhance vs destruction and methane production which was supported by the experimental results to separate the effects of fna 6 1 mgn l and low ph 5 0 treatment batch tests were performed to determine the soluble cod concentration after 24 h treatment of twas at these two conditions the soluble cod concentration at the end of the tests was 5 6 0 5 g l and 1 1 0 4 g l respectively with the fna and low ph treatment these results indicate that while low ph did contribute to solublization of twas fna was the dominating factor for twas solubilization when increasing the organic loading rate olr an anaerobic digester may entail higher risks of acidification failure liu et al 2012 besides ph the vfa alkalinity ratio is also an important parameter for an ad process the effluent vfa bicarbonate alkalinity ratio was 0 05 and 0 18 for the control and experimental digester respectively in period 3 these ratios are both below the critical ratio of 0 4 gallaghan et al 2002 underpinning the stability of both reactors the higher alkalinity in the experimental reactor in comparison to control was likely mainly due to the increase of ammonium in the experimental ad reactor fig 2b further the removal of residual nitrite in the fna treated twas through denitrification in the anaerobic reactor also contributed to alkalinity production the residual nitrite concentration after fna pre treatment was 136 8 25 2 mg l the temporary increase in vfa to 3221 mg cod l was likely due to simultaneous introduction of a shorter hrt 12 days and fna pre treatment i e increased material degradability this did not occur in transition to the third period indicating that the main impact may be increased material degradability rather than the reduction in hrt the loading shock could potentially be avoided by feeding pre treated sludge continuously as opposed to pulse dosing once a day hydrolysis is usually accepted as the rate limiting step of anaerobic digestion of twas carrère et al 2010 through the bmp tests wei et al 2018 observed that pre treatment of twas at an fna concentration of 1 8 mg n l no2 n 250 mg l ph 5 5 resulted in 11 1 improvement in the biochemical methane potential b0 but did not alter the hydrolysis rate k the bmp tests performed in this study showed that pre treatment of twas at an fna concentration of 6 1 mg n l no2 n 250 mg l ph 5 0 improved b0 by 20 and k by 67 the improvement in kinetics needed to support an hrt of 7 5 days in a continuous digester far exceed this improvement this latter discrepancy is probably related to the conservative nature of a batch bmp test compared with a continuous digester particularly on highly degradable materials jensen et al 2011 in fact the accumulation of vfa at 685 64 mgcod l in period 3 fig 3c indicates that methanogenesis rather than sludge hydrolysis was the limiting step in this period the fact that the same vs destruction was observed in the experimental reactor in period 2 hrt 12 days and period 3 hrt 7 5 days table 2 indicated that with fna pre treatment at 6 1 mgn l the highest vs destruction achievable with this method can already be achieved in 7 5 days and a further extended hrt does not further enhance vs destruction the reason that wei et al 2018 did not observe any improvement in batch tests of k is likely related to pretreatment conditions that is our pre treatment at 6 1 mg n l gives superior performance compared to fna pre treatment at 1 8 mgn l as used in wei et al 2018 and results in enhancement in rate as well as extent to shorten the hrt of anaerobic digestion of twas several pre treatment technologies including thermal hydrolysis process thp ultrasound and alkaline pre treatment have been explored to enhance ad performance pérez elvira and fdz polanco 2012 employed thp 170 c 30 min to treat mixed primary and secondary sludge prior to its anaerobic digestion biogas production was increased by 24 even when hrt was reduced from 17 days to 8 5 days souza et al 2013 investigated the effects of thp 170 c 40 min and hrt on the performance of pilot scale digesters cstr 35 c fed with mixed sludge when hrt was reduced from 20 to 10 days the specific methane yield by vs fed was reduced sahinkaya and sevimli 2013 examined the synergistic effects of combined ultrasonic e s 6000 kj kg ds and alkaline ph 12 1 pre treatment on anaerobic biodegradability of was and found that hrt can be shortened from 14 days to 7 days without reducing the treatment efficiency lin et al 1997 investigated the performance of an anaerobic digester single stage high rate digester 35 c fed with twas pretreated with naoh 0 20 and 40 mg l the effect of hrt on the performance of the digester was examined through increasing olr by shortening hrt from 20 days to 13 10 and then 7 5 days when pretreated with 20 mg l of naoh ph 8 07 and at 7 5 days of hrt the vs removal increased from 19 to 26 compared to that of control system without pre treatment compared to the thp and ultrasonic processes fna based twas pre treatment requires ambient temperature and pressure the fna method is thus much simpler and does not require intensive energy input compared with the alkaline pre treatment method the fna method has the advantage that nitrite the primary chemical required can be produced from the anaerobic sludge digestion liquor law et al 2015 however the direct quantitative comparison of all these methods is difficult without back to back experiments since many factors e g twas characteristics and operating conditions among others could influence the results carrère et al 2010 it should also be noted that different methods may be more suitable for different scenarios depending on sludge characteristics sludge disposal methods and various economic factors e g prices of power and various types chemicals 5 conclusions in this study it was experimentally demonstrated that with fna pre treatment an anaerobic sludge digester can achieve enhanced vs destruction and methane production at a shorter solids retention time this provides an attractive method for retrofitting existing anaerobic sludge digesters with capacity limitations in a previous study an fna concentration of up to 1 8 mgn l was used in this study we found that its further increase to 6 1 mgn l achieved by reducing ph from previously used 5 5 to 5 0 while maintaining the nitrite concentration at 250 mgn l could further significantly enhance both the biochemical methane potential and the sludge hydrolysis rate however

19160,free nitrous acid fna pre treatment has been previously demonstrated to be effective in enhancing methane production and volatile solids vs destruction in the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge for an equivalent hydraulic retention time hrt we hypothesise that due to enhancement of hydrolysis kinetics fna pre treatment will also allow reduction in the hrt while retaining performance this would allow for improvement of capacity constrained digesters two anaerobic sludge digesters control experiment were fed with the same thickened waste activated sludge twas from a full scale plant for 6 months with 24 h pre treatment of twas at an fna concentration of 6 1 mgn l no2 n 250 mg l ph 5 0 t 25 c the hrt for the experimental anaerobic digester was progressively reduced from 15 days to 12 days and then to 7 5 days in comparison the control reactor was operated at a constant hrt of 15 days representing typical loading conditions with the shortened hrts the experimental ad reactor achieved vs destruction at 36 9 0 8 12 days and 36 8 1 0 7 5 days representing 30 40 relative increase in comparison to the control reactor at 26 5 0 8 and 28 3 0 7 respectively in the same two periods this was supported by a similar 31 35 increase in the methane production per unit of vs fed the volumetric methane production rate of the experimental digester was increased by 165 at hrt of 7 5 days compared with the control digester at hrt of 15 days the results demonstrated that fna pre treatment of twas can substantially increase the capacity of an anaerobic

twas at an fna concentration of 1 8 mgn l no2 n 250 mg l ph 5 5 t 25 c improved the vs destruction of a full scale twas by 17 from 29 vsd to 34 vsd accompanied by a similar increase in methane production the pre treatment also enhanced the dewaterability of the digested sludge by 14 economic analysis showed that fna pre treatment can substantially reduce operational costs for wastewater treatment wei et al 2018 through model based analysis of bmp data wang et al 2013 found that in addition to enhancing the methane yield fna pre treatment also improved the hydrolysis rate of twas at fna concentrations of 1 78 2 13 mg n l the twas hydrolysis rate was found to increase by approximately 50 compared to the twas without fna pre treatment the result suggests that due to enhanced hydrolysis kinetics fna pre treatment may not only improve vs destruction in an ad reactor at a given hrt but also maintain this improvement while the ad reactor is operated at a lower hrt this potentially provides an effective strategy for the upgrading of capacity limited anaerobic sludge digesters leading to savings in capital costs in this study we extend the study reported in wei et al 2018 to experimentally identify if fna pre treatment could retain enhanced vs destruction and methane yield even when the digester is operated at hrts that are much shorter than the commonly acceptable hrt 2 materials and methods 2 1 overall experimental design two continuous anaerobic sludge digesters fed with the same full scale twas were operated for six months with 24 h pre treatment of twas at an fna concentration of 6 1 mgn l the hrt for the experimental ad reactor was progressively reduced from 15 days to 12 days and then to 7 5 days the overall performance of the experimental system was evaluated through the measurement of vs destruction methane production ammonium release ph and dewaterability of digested sludge compared with those of the control reactor a constant hrt of 15 days was applied to the control reactor throughout the experimental study to provide a standard reference for performance comparison in all phases it is noted an hrt of 15 20 days is typically applied in the anaerobic digestion of twas 2 2 sludge sources twas was collected from the dissolved air flotation thickener of a local wastewater treatment plant brisbane australia the plant operated with a solids retention time srt of 15 days receives primarily domestic wastewater at an average flow of approximately 120 000 m3 day and performs biological cod chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen removal the sludge was collected weekly and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for use in the week the sludge was used as received without any modifications regular chemical analysis was performed to characterise the feed sludge table 1 shows the average characteristics of the twas used in this study 2 3 reactor design and operation the schematic of the anaerobic sludge digestion systems used in this study is shown in fig 1 the experimental system consisted of a 0 3 l pre treatment unit and a 1 3 l anaerobic digester 1 l liquid volume and 0 3 l headspace and the control system only has an identical anaerobic digester the temperature in both digesters was maintained at 35 1 c with a temperature controlled water jacket biogas production was measured using tipping bucket gasmeters which were recalibrated every two months the exhaust gas from the gas meters was collected with gas bags both digesters were continually mixed with magnetic stirrers ph in both digesters was measured with a ph meter minichem the pre treatment unit in the experimental system was continually mixed with a magnetic stirrer and the ph was measured using a ph meter minichem and controlled by a programmable logic controller plc at a set point of 5 0 see 2 4 the sludge from the feed tank was uniformly supplied to both systems and simultaneously discharged from two digesters with peristaltic pumps 2 4 experimental design the two systems were continuously operated in a laboratory for 180 days which were divided into three periods period 1 baseline period 0 48 days in the baseline period the pre treatment unit in the experimental system was not operated the two systems were operated identically to reach steady state steady state i as indicated by stable vs destruction and stable methane production both anaerobic digesters were operated with an hrt of 15 days by feeding 66 7 ml twas on a daily basis and simultaneously discharging the same volume of digested sludge period 2 second period 49 132 days in the second period the control system was operated as in period 1 for the experimental system the fna pre treatment unit was started the pre treatment conditions were as follows ph 5 0 0 1 no2 n 250 mgn l t 25 c treatment duration 24 h the ph and nitrite levels applied gave rise to an fna concentration of 6 1 mg n l the concentration of fna was calculated as s n o 2 n k a 10 p h where k a e 2 300 273 t with t 25 c anthonisen et al 1976 pre treated twas of 83 3 ml was fed into the experimental reactor each day resulting in an hrt of 12 days the two systems were operated to establish steady state steady state ii of the second period as indicated by stable vs destruction and methane production period 3 third period 133 180 days in the third period the control system was operated as in period 1 for the experimental system the pre treatment unit was operated as in period 2 pre treated twas of 133 3 ml was fed into the experimental reactor on a daily basis resulting in an hrt of 7 5 days the two systems were operated to establish steady state steady state iii again as indicated by stable vs destruction and methane production an alternative experimental design was to apply the same shorter hrts as applied to the experimental reactor to the control reactor in period 2 and period 3 however such short hrts are well known to be impractical for twas digestion without pre treatment such an experimental design while with theoretical interest is not ideal for our purpose to demonstrate the practical value of the newly proposed process with the current design we assumed that the control reactor would not achieve better vs destruction with shorter hrts in comparison to the longer and more suitable hrt of 15 days 2 5 monitoring protocol the biogas production rates and ph of the two anaerobic digesters were measured once a day total solids ts and vs of both the feed and digested sludge from the two anaerobic digesters and the volatile fatty acids vfas and ammonium concentrations in the two digesters were measured twice a week samples from the ad reactors were taken immediately before the twas feeding was started biogas composition including ch4 h2 co2 was also measured twice a week total chemical oxygen demand tcod of the feed and discharged sludge was measured once a week the dewaterability of the digested sludge were measured twice a week the fecal coliform level in the feed sludge the digested sludge and also in the fna pre treated sludge was measured at steady states of all periods in triplicate 2 6 analytical methods ts vs tcod and tkn were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 vs destruction of the anaerobic digesters was calculated based on the difference between the vs concentrations in the feed and digested sludge as switzenbaum et al 2003 1 v s d e s t r u c t i o n vs conc in vs conc out vs conc in 100 where vsconc in and vsconc out are the vs concentrations in the feed and digested sludge for the measurement of soluble cod skn nh4 n and vfas filtration was carried out first with a syringe filter 0 45 μm pore size nh4 n was measured using a lachat quik chem 8000 flow injection analyser lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin vfas were determined using a gc agilent fid with polar capillary column gas composition h2 ch4 co2 was analysed by gc tcd shimadzu gc 2014 methane production rate was calculated based on the biogas production rate and the methane fraction in biogas dewaterability of digested sludge was measured according to chen et al 2001 and devlin et al 2011 briefly the sludge samples and cationic polymer 0 005 g polymer g sludge were mixed and stirred for 1 min then the sludge was drained into solids cake through a belt filter fabric the solids cake was then centrifuged using the belt filter fabric at 3750 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was removed and the solids content of thickened sludge cake was measured the measurement of fecal coliform was performed using colilert 18 test kit from the idexx laboratories devlin et al 2011 the sludge samples were diluted to 100 ml diluted 102 to 105 times depending on the sludge samples in 120 ml sterilized bottles the colilert 18 reagents were afterwards dissolved in the 100 ml diluted samples the above mentioned 100 ml mixed solution was transferred into the quanti tray 2000 and then sealed with a quanti tray sealer the sealed quanti tray 2000 was then incubated at an incubator at 44 5 0 5 c for 18 h finally the positive yellow wells were counted and the most probable number mpn of fecal coliform was calculated based on the idexx quanti tray 2000 mpn table http www idexx com au 2 7 biochemical methane potential bmp tests bmp tests were carried out for the feed sludge and fna pre treated sludge with the procedure detailed in wang et al 2013 and jensen et al 2011 to determine the biochemical methane potential and hydrolysis rate of the twas treated with fna at 6 1 mgn l this level fna was not used in any of the previous studies briefly a twas sample of 25 ml along with 75 ml inoculum with an inoculum to twas ratio of 2 0 on a dry vs basis was added to a 160 ml serum vials where the sludge was anaerobically digested for 40 days in a temperature controlled incubator at 37 1 c control tests with fna treated twas replaced with twas without pre treatment along with blank tests without addition of twas i e inoculum only were also conducted all tests were carried out in triplicate the biogas volume and composition were monitored the cumulative methane production was determined with results reported as the amount of methane produced per vs mass added l ch4 kg vsadded a first order kinetics model was used to assess methane production kinetics and methane potential of the sludge samples two key parameters hydrolysis rate k and biochemical methane potential b0 were estimated according to the method described in batstone 2013 3 results 3 1 vs destruction fig 2 shows the vs destruction and ammonium release in the two anaerobic sludge digesters over the three experimental periods the vs destruction in the two systems in the baseline period fig 2a was not significantly different in the second period the vs destruction level of the experimental reactor was 39 0 higher than that of the control reactor despite of a shorter hrt 12 days vs 15 days in control table 2 this trend remained in the third period when the experimental reactor hrt was further reduced to 7 5 days with the vs destruction in the experimental reactor being 30 higher table 2 the enhanced vs destruction at a shorter hrt is likely due to that fna pre treatment destroyed cells and or extracellular polymeric substances eps with the release of intracellular and or extracellular constituents wang et al 2013 comparison of the tcod in the feed sludge and the digested sludge from the two lines showed tcod removal of 0 96 0 05 gcod d n 12 and 2 48 0 08 gcod d n 12 in the control and experimental line respectively in period 3 in comparison the methane production rate in the same period was 0 95 0 02 gcod d n 12 and 2 59 0 11 gcod d n 12 for the control and experimental system respectively the agreement of tcod removal and methane production p 0 05 in both cases provided independent support to the vs destruction results similar cod balances were also achieved for both reactors in period 2 the scod measurement of the feed sludge and the fna treated sludge showed significant sludge solubilization during fna treatment scod increased from 0 85 0 08 before treatment to 4 99 0 26 g l after treatment the increase represented approximately 10 of the non soluble cod in the sludge 42 8 2 1 g l this means that fna treatment contributed substantially to vs destruction in the experimental line taking vs destruction in the fna treatment reactor into consideration the vs destruction achieved in the experimental ad reactor was approximately 29 9 in both period 2 and period 3 which was comparable to or slightly higher than vs destruction in the control ad reactor at 26 5 0 8 in period 2 and 28 3 0 7 in period 3 these results suggest that fna pre treatment not only directly solubilized particulate organics in was at 10 but also converted some of the organics not digestible in a normal ad reactor to digestible organics in comparison to the control system the average nh4 n release increased by 47 and 38 at the steady state of the second and third periods fig 2b table 2 respectively which supports the vs destruction results the higher ammonium concentration in the experimental reactor implies that the nitrogen load to the mainstream system would increase slightly as a result of the enhanced vs destruction should the anaerobic digestion liquor be returned to the mainstream for further treatment 3 2 methane production similarly fna pre treatment resulted in a higher conversion of organic components to methane even at shorter hrts fig 3 a while the methane production rate in the two digesters was not statistically different in the baseline period the methane production rate for the experimental reactor increased substantially by 64 and 165 compared to the control digester in period 2 and period 3 respectively the increases were partly due to the increased loading rates to the experimental digester 25 and 100 higher in period 2 and period 3 respectively and partly due to the enhanced vs destruction table 2 despite a shortened hrt the enhanced methane yield was calculated to be 31 and 35 higher than the control reactor in period 2 and period 3 respectively table 2 in the first 10 days of the second period methane production rate in the experimental reactor decreased temporarily vfas in the experimental reactor increased sharply from 106 mg cod l to 3221 mg cod l before returning to the baseline level fig 3c suggesting a temporary overloading caused by the simultaneous reduction in hrt 12 days and fna pre treatment it should be noted that the digesters were fed semi continuously sludge was pulse fed once a day rather than continuously which would have also contributed to the loading shock in the third period the average vfa concentrations for the control and experimental systems were 151 14 mg cod l and 685 64 mg cod l at steady state lasting for 45 days i e 6 hrts respectively the average effluent vfa concentration of 685 mg cod l suggests that methanogenesis was the rate limiting step in the experimental digester without adjusting the ph after pre treatment with fna at ph 5 0 ph in the control and experimental digesters was comparable at 7 25 0 01 and 7 29 0 01 respectively indicating that the experimental reactor was not acidified despite of the accumulation of vfas this was likely because of the higher ammonium release in the experimental digester 38 higher which countered the additional acid production indeed the average bicarbonate alkalinities were 3148 47 mg hco3 l and 3756 17 mg hco3 l in the control and experimental systems respectively the average methane and co2 content in the experimental reactor biogas in period 3 was 63 3 and 33 7 respectively in comparison to 60 6 and 35 3 in the control reactor biogas the lower co2 content and consequently higher ch4 content was likely due to the higher ph in experimental system 7 29 0 01 vs 7 25 0 01 which caused more inorganic carbon to remain in the liquid phase in the experimental reactor 3 3 other performance indicators 3 3 1 dewaterability of digested sludge the solids content of the digested sludge after dewatering using a laboratory belt filter centrifuge was not different for the two reactors over all three experimental periods fig 4 which indicates that dewaterability can be maintained even at this reduced hrt wei et al 2018 observed that fna pre treatment of was enhanced dewaterability of digested sludge however the same hrt 15 days was applied to both digesters with and without fna pre treatment the application of hrts different from the control may have incurred additional effects on the dewaterability of the digested sludge 3 3 2 pathogen removal the biomass specific mpn of fecal coliform in the twas fna treated twas and digested sludge from the two systems in the three steady states are presented in fig 5 in the baseline period the mpn of fecal coliform present in the digested sludge from the control and experimental reactors were similar at 5 6 0 1 logmpn gts fna pre treatment reduced the mpn of fecal coliform present in the twas from 6 2 0 1 to 3 4 0 1 logmpn gts however when hrt was decreased from 15 days to 12 days and then to 7 5 days combined with fna pre treatment the mpn of fecal coliform present in the discharged sludge from the experimental reactor remained at 5 5 0 2 logmpn gts the results mean there was an unexpected re growth of pathogens in the anaerobic digester the results are also somewhat different from that reported in wei et al 2018 which reported lower fecal coliform levels in the line with fna pre treatment of was compared to that without the difference could be related to the shortened hrt applied in this study but the exact reason for the 2 log re growth of pathogens in the digester following the 3 log destruction by fna treatment is unclear and remains to be further investigated the digested sludge 5 7 0 1 and 5 5 0 2 logmpn gts for the control and experimental digesters respectively could meet class b biosolids standards for land application us epa 40 cfr part 503 regulation 3 3 3 bmp tests fig 6 shows the cumulative methane production from twas and twas with fna pre treatment fna 6 1 mg n l in bmp tests in the first two days the cumulative methane production of twas with fna pre treatment was close to control however it increased greatly after 3 days and exceeded that of control table 3 summarizes the estimated sludge hydrolysis rate k and biochemical methane potential b0 for the two sludges using a first order kinetic model fig s2 the hydrolysis rate k was found to be improved by 67 through fna pre treatment similarly the biochemical methane potential b0 was enhanced about 20 4 discussion this study demonstrates that fna pre treatment of twas enables the use of shortened hrt in anaerobic digestion of sludge yet with an improved vs destruction and enhanced methane production fna pre treatment of twas may potentially be used to enhance the capacity of an anaerobic sludge digester at an hrt of 7 5 days half that of the control digester i e 15 days the experimental digester was able to achieve a vs destruction of 36 8 1 0 compared to 28 3 0 7 achieved in the control reactor this means that the incorporation of an fna pre treatment unit with an hrt of 1 day the capacity of a digester can be doubled this offers a promising technology to upgrade anerobic sludge digesters that are receiving or are expected to receive a sludge loading rate above the designed level contrary to incorporating an additional digester which requires large volume gas tight reactors biogas collection and security protection the fna pre treatment simply requires an open mixed tank with a retention time of one day thus the capital investment required is expected to be a small fraction of what required to build an additional anerobic sludge digester the fna based twas pre treatment process does require addition of nitite and acid economic analysis previously done wei et al 2018 showed that the economic return due to reduced sludge disposal costs and increased biogas production far outweigh these operational costs in this study we applied ph 5 0 rather than 5 5 as used in wei et al 2018 titration tests showed that the acid consumption is increased by 36 supplementary infromation fig s1 this only moderately increases the total chemical costs by 8 8 as the costs for nitrite remains unchanged but induced futher increases in vs destruction 30 39 and biogas production 31 35 in comparison with the case when ph 5 5 was used 17 for vs destruction and 16 in methane production wei et al 2018 the treatment conditions applied ph 5 0 no2 n 250 mg l treatment duration 24 h and t 25 c were not the results of a systematic optimisation and hence the conditions applied are not necessarily optimal in fact the above treatment conditions were varied from wei et al 2018 with the only variation being a reduction in ph from 5 5 to 5 0 we hypothesized that such a change could potentially further enhance vs destruction and methane production which was supported by the experimental results to separate the effects of fna 6 1 mgn l and low ph 5 0 treatment batch tests were performed to determine the soluble cod concentration after 24 h treatment of twas at these two conditions the soluble cod concentration at the end of the tests was 5 6 0 5 g l and 1 1 0 4 g l respectively with the fna and low ph treatment these results indicate that while low ph did contribute to solublization of twas fna was the dominating factor for twas solubilization when increasing the organic loading rate olr an anaerobic digester may entail higher risks of acidification failure liu et al 2012 besides ph the vfa alkalinity ratio is also an important parameter for an ad process the effluent vfa bicarbonate alkalinity ratio was 0 05 and 0 18 for the control and experimental digester respectively in period 3 these ratios are both below the critical ratio of 0 4 gallaghan et al 2002 underpinning the stability of both reactors the higher alkalinity in the experimental reactor in comparison to control was likely mainly due to the increase of ammonium in the experimental ad reactor fig 2b further the removal of residual nitrite in the fna treated twas through denitrification in the anaerobic reactor also contributed to alkalinity production the residual nitrite concentration after fna pre treatment was 136 8 25 2 mg l the temporary increase in vfa to 3221 mg cod l was likely due to simultaneous introduction of a shorter hrt 12 days and fna pre treatment i e increased material degradability this did not occur in transition to the third period indicating that the main impact may be increased material degradability rather than the reduction in hrt the loading shock could potentially be avoided by feeding pre treated sludge continuously as opposed to pulse dosing once a day hydrolysis is usually accepted as the rate limiting step of anaerobic digestion of twas carrère et al 2010 through the bmp tests wei et al 2018 observed that pre treatment of twas at an fna concentration of 1 8 mg n l no2 n 250 mg l ph 5 5 resulted in 11 1 improvement in the biochemical methane potential b0 but did not alter the hydrolysis rate k the bmp tests performed in this study showed that pre treatment of twas at an fna concentration of 6 1 mg n l no2 n 250 mg l ph 5 0 improved b0 by 20 and k by 67 the improvement in kinetics needed to support an hrt of 7 5 days in a continuous digester far exceed this improvement this latter discrepancy is probably related to the conservative nature of a batch bmp test compared with a continuous digester particularly on highly degradable materials jensen et al 2011 in fact the accumulation of vfa at 685 64 mgcod l in period 3 fig 3c indicates that methanogenesis rather than sludge hydrolysis was the limiting step in this period the fact that the same vs destruction was observed in the experimental reactor in period 2 hrt 12 days and period 3 hrt 7 5 days table 2 indicated that with fna pre treatment at 6 1 mgn l the highest vs destruction achievable with this method can already be achieved in 7 5 days and a further extended hrt does not further enhance vs destruction the reason that wei et al 2018 did not observe any improvement in batch tests of k is likely related to pretreatment conditions that is our pre treatment at 6 1 mg n l gives superior performance compared to fna pre treatment at 1 8 mgn l as used in wei et al 2018 and results in enhancement in rate as well as extent to shorten the hrt of anaerobic digestion of twas several pre treatment technologies including thermal hydrolysis process thp ultrasound and alkaline pre treatment have been explored to enhance ad performance pérez elvira and fdz polanco 2012 employed thp 170 c 30 min to treat mixed primary and secondary sludge prior to its anaerobic digestion biogas production was increased by 24 even when hrt was reduced from 17 days to 8 5 days souza et al 2013 investigated the effects of thp 170 c 40 min and hrt on the performance of pilot scale digesters cstr 35 c fed with mixed sludge when hrt was reduced from 20 to 10 days the specific methane yield by vs fed was reduced sahinkaya and sevimli 2013 examined the synergistic effects of combined ultrasonic e s 6000 kj kg ds and alkaline ph 12 1 pre treatment on anaerobic biodegradability of was and found that hrt can be shortened from 14 days to 7 days without reducing the treatment efficiency lin et al 1997 investigated the performance of an anaerobic digester single stage high rate digester 35 c fed with twas pretreated with naoh 0 20 and 40 mg l the effect of hrt on the performance of the digester was examined through increasing olr by shortening hrt from 20 days to 13 10 and then 7 5 days when pretreated with 20 mg l of naoh ph 8 07 and at 7 5 days of hrt the vs removal increased from 19 to 26 compared to that of control system without pre treatment compared to the thp and ultrasonic processes fna based twas pre treatment requires ambient temperature and pressure the fna method is thus much simpler and does not require intensive energy input compared with the alkaline pre treatment method the fna method has the advantage that nitrite the primary chemical required can be produced from the anaerobic sludge digestion liquor law et al 2015 however the direct quantitative comparison of all these methods is difficult without back to back experiments since many factors e g twas characteristics and operating conditions among others could influence the results carrère et al 2010 it should also be noted that different methods may be more suitable for different scenarios depending on sludge characteristics sludge disposal methods and various economic factors e g prices of power and various types chemicals 5 conclusions in this study it was experimentally demonstrated that with fna pre treatment an anaerobic sludge digester can achieve enhanced vs destruction and methane production at a shorter solids retention time this provides an attractive method for retrofitting existing anaerobic sludge digesters with capacity limitations in a previous study an fna concentration of up to 1 8 mgn l was used in this study we found that its further increase to 6 1 mgn l achieved by reducing ph from previously used 5 5 to 5 0 while maintaining the nitrite concentration at 250 mgn l could further significantly enhance both the biochemical methane potential and the sludge hydrolysis rate however

microcystins cylindrospermopsin saxitoxin and anatoxin a and as such they have become a human and environmental health concern hybrid photocatalytic composites hpcs comprising carbon nanotubes on the surface of tio2 nanotubes were designed in this study the hpcs have a selective adsorption capacity to cyanotoxins and provide photocatalytic activity to produce reactive oxygen species for the degradation of cyanotoxins hpcs with 5 2 mg carbon nanotubes cm2 showed an excellent removal efficiency of microcystins lr 95 at 55 6 l m2 hr bar the hpcs more efficiently removed the relatively larger and more hydrophobic cyanotoxins i e microcystin lr than the relatively smaller and more hydrophilic compounds such as cylindrospermopsin saxitoxin and anatoxin a with a further increased in the carbon nanotube content to 8 6 mg cm2 the adsorption capacity of the hpcs for cyanotoxins increased to 70 6 for mc lr however there was significant decrease in the photocatalytic activity of the hpcs for production of reactive oxygen species and consequently a decrease in the degradation of cyanotoxins it is considered that this device could be used to provide complete rejection of particles

limits photocatalytic process in becoming a primary choice for the water treatment systems de freitas et al 2013 physical adsorption of cyanotoxins using powdered activated carbon pac and granular activated carbon gac has been studied over the last few decades removal of cyanotoxins through sorption has been shown to be dependent on electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions these electrostatic interactions were caused due to the range of ph being studied from 5 7 to 10 2 with a maximum sorption at ph 10 2 at ph 10 2 1 40 mg l pac dose removed 99 of sxt whereas almost no removal sorption of sxt was observed for pac dose between 1 and 40 mg l at ph 5 7 shi et al 2012 these observations suggest effective sorption of cyanotoxin molecules under alkaline conditions which are somewhat irrational to be applied in dwtps further pac dose varies a lot with the treatment efficiency required moreover the presence of natural organic matter nom was shown to decrease the sorption behavior of the pac for the amount of sxt removed and thus higher dose of pac was required to effectively adsorb it shi et al 2012 like pacs removal of cyanotoxins by gacs highly depends on the electrostatic repulsion between the cyanotoxin molecules which aids in their overall removal for example in a gac filter treatment sxt exhibited cationic nature between mono cationic and di cationic in their molecular structure due to the presence of the amine group at neutral ph which further helped these molecules to get removed due to the electrostatic repulsion silva buarque et al 2015 however these electrostatic repulsions might vary among different cyanotoxins based on the size and charges for example it was found that the electrostatic repulsion factor decreased the mc removal in a gac filter column larger in size as compared to sxt wang et al 2007 in another study an attempt was made to reduce the repulsion by increasing the ionic strength of the solution containing mcs that resulted in their enhanced removal newcombe et al 2003 with adsorption being the principal mechanism the problem of early breakthrough arises due to a decrease in the adsorption over the time in the presence of nom on the other hand carbon nanomaterials particularly carbon nanotubes cnts have also been widely studied for use as an adsorbent to remove various organic compounds such as phenols lin and xing 2008 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons fagan et al 2004 long and yang 2001 peng et al 2003 heavy metals li et al 2005 wang et al 2005 and trace organic compounds ji et al 2010 joseph et al 2013 although nano sized carbon nanomaterials have large effective surface areas and thus provide many advantages it is challengeable to separate the materials from treated water which hinders their practical application in drinking water treatment although one approach used to minimize the post separation processes is to stabilize the nanomaterials via immobilization on suitable support materials recently nanostructured composite catalysts have been produced using cnts and tio2 the introduction of cnts into the titanium matrix induces a synergic effect on the photocatalytic degradation of benzene derivatives silva and faria 2010 and mcs sampaio et al 2015 by near ultraviolet uv to visible light irradiation however the main technical barriers impeding its commercialization are i the post recovery of photocatalyst nanoparticles after water treatment fernández ibáñez et al 2003 lee et al 2001 xi and geissen 2001 and ii the incomplete removal of degradation intermediates after treatment gaya and abdullah 2008 to overcome these challenges this study aimed to design novel hybrid hpcs by introducing cnt layers directly onto immobilized tio2 nanotubes with the ultimate aim of effectively removing various dissolved cyanotoxins and intermediates a synergic effect was expected by introducing cnts directly onto tio2 nanotubes as follows i tio2 nanotubes are designed to degrade dissolved cyanotoxins by producing ros under uv irradiation and ii cnts are mainly responsible for the adsorption of intermediates and unreacted dissolved cyanotoxins most of physical and chemical treatment processes are also being commonly practiced in dwtps however the degree of treatment widely varies among cyanotoxin variants and is mainly governed by the source water characteristics operational parameters temperature ph cyanotoxin level which changes continuously in treatment plants moreover the majority of studies on cyanotoxins and their fate during drinking water treatment focus on mcs and particularly the mc lr variants merel et al 2013 the lack of information on efficient treatment options for other cyanotoxins including cyn antx a and sxt which have different chemical properties such as functional groups and speciation compared to mcs has been frequently noted hitzfeld et al 2000 newcombe and nicholson 2004 westrick et al 2010 given that chemical properties of cyanotoxins are critical factors determining performance of physical and chemical water treatment processes we aimed to determine the effects of chemical properties of the dissolved cyanotoxins on their removal by adsorption and photocatalytic degradation using innovative hpcs comprising cnts on the surface of tio2 nanotubes 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis

fluorinated solution of ethylene glycol c2h6o2 vwr as described in the previous study noeiaghaei et al 2015 first the ti foil was decontaminated by sonication in acetone c3h6o vwr ethanol c2h6o vwr and deionized water for 10 min and then vacuum dried electrolyte anodization was subsequently prepared by mixing ethylene glycol and 0 5 wt of naf sigma aldrich with a water content of 5 wt finally anodization of ti foil was conducted in a one compartment two electrode system with pt foil pt 99 99 thickness 1 mm sigma aldrich and pt wire pt 99 9 diameter 2 mm sigma aldrich as the control electrode cathode and ti foil as the working electrode anode the volume of electrolyte was kept constant and stirred at 200 ml and 400 rpm respectively a programmable direct current power supply e3632a keysight technologies interfaced with a computer was used to monitor the anodization current 2 2 hpc fabrication cnts that are adsorption materials of the hpcs were directly grown on the tio2 nanotube array in a dual zone chemical vapor deposition cvd reactor figure s1appsec1 in supplementary data at an ambient pressure as described in the previous study yang et al 2013 the cvd reactor consists of a 150 cm long quartz tube with an inner diameter of 4 5 cm c2h4 and h2 were utilized as a carbon source and a reducing agent respectively ferrocene 25 100 mg was placed in a ceramic boat and introduced into the first zone of the reactor to remove any oxygen in the reactor it was firstly flushed with ar at a flow rate of 600 cubic centimeters per minute sccm for 10 min and the ar flow rate was then reduced to 167 sccm simultaneously the temperatures of the first and the second zones of the reactor were increased to 250 c with a ramp of 3 c min and 770 c with a ramp of 10 c min respectively subsequently c2h4 and h2 were passed through the reactor for 5 min at flow rates of 115 and 400 sccm respectively to increase hydrophilicity of hpcs each hpc was immersed into a mixture of h2so4 0 5 n and hno3 1 n at temperature of 60 c for minimum 4 h 2 3 hpc characterization hpc surface morphology was characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem with energy dispersive x ray edx s4500 hitachi at 15 kv without any coating the diameters of cnts were measured using transmission electron microscopy tem jem 1400 jeol to determine the phase composition

s2 in supplementary data that was placed in the dark the feed water was circulated through an hpc at 0 5 ml min for 2 h four model cyanotoxins mc lr cyn sxt and antx a table s1 in supplementary data were obtained from abraxis inc and the initial concentration of the cyanotoxins in deionized water was maintained at 100 μg l a virgin hpc was used with each model cyanotoxin and the average rejection efficiency of model organic compounds by the model hpcs was calculated as follows 2 r 1 c f c i x 100 where r is the removal efficiency ci is the initial concentration mg l of model organic compounds in the feed and cf is the final concentration mg l of model organic compounds in the permeate all experiments were performed in triplicate after 2 h aqueous suspension was collected from the feed tank and then used for further analysis the student s t test was used to assess the significance of results employing a 95 confidence interval 2 4 3 photocatalytic reactivity of hpcs to investigate the photo induced charge separation efficiency of hpcs photocurrent response measurements were conducted under uv a irradiation 1 6 mw cm2 using either tio2 nanotubes or hpcs as the working electrode pt foil and ag agcl were employed as the counter and reference electrodes respectively and a na2so4 solution 0 5 m was used as the electrolyte the light dark photo current response was recorded under zero bias 0 0 v with a digital potentiostat sp 300 bio logic science instruments all experiments were conducted in triplicate under ambient conditions photocatalytic reactivity of hpcs was evaluated for its ability to degrade the four model cyanotoxins using the cross flow membrane filtration system figure s2 in supplementary data under uv irradiation λ max 365 nm 1 6 mw cm2 for the test one virgin hpc effective area 1 7 cm2 was used for each model cyanotoxin each hpc was immersed into a glass beaker 90 mm outer diameter 115 mm height of the respective model cyanotoxin suspension the initial concentration of cyanotoxins in the deionized water was maintained at 100 μg l the beaker with the hpc was directly irradiated under two 15 w fluorescent uv bulbs philips tld 15w 08 in an uv cryo chamber electron microscopy science the bulbs had an output spectrum ranging from 310 to 400 nm and a total irradiance of 24 1 w m2 with a peak at 365 nm water samples in the glass beaker were collected from the suspension every 30 min for 2 h for further analyses and all experiments were performed in triplicate the student s t test was used to assess the significance of the results employing a 95 confidence interval 2 4 4 ros detection singlet oxygen sensor green thermo fisher scientific 2 3 bis 2 methoxy 4 nitro 5 sulfophenyl 2h tetrazolium 5 carboxanilide thermo fisher scientific and a hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite sensor thermo fisher scientific were used to detect 1o2 o2 and oh respectively the fluorescence unit fsu or absorbance of each chemical reagent after reaction with ros were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer turner designs or an uv visible spectrophotometer u 2000 hitachi respectively as described in the previous studies chae et al 2009 price et al 2009 ukeda et al 1997 the net ros production rate fsu min of hpcs was calculated from the difference between overall ros production in water samples in the presence of hpcs under uv irradiation and the ros production in water samples without hpcs under uv irradiation methanol was used as a scavenger for hydroxyl radicals el morsi et al 2000 2 4 5 characterization of model cyanotoxins in water the concentration of each of the four cyanotoxins was measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa kits obtained from abraxis inc and the detection limits of mc lr cyn sxt and antx a were 0 10 μg l 0 04 μg l 0 015 μg l and 0 10 μg l respectively u s epa method 546 3 results and discussion 3 1 hpc characteristics in our previous study noeiaghaei et al 2015 it was found that the photocatalytic activity of tio2 nanotubes relies on their geometrical characteristics such as the surface area and porosity of the tio2 nanotubes in addition it was found that generation of ros and degradation of 4 chlorobenzoic acid by tio2 nanotubes was increased with increases in both the surface area and porosity of the tio2 nanotubes under an optimum condition whereby tio2 nanotubes were fabricated at 60 v for 3 h more than 70 of 4 chlorobenzoic acid initial concentration 25 μm was degraded within 2 h in this study tio2 nanotube array was fabricated through anodization at 60 v for 3 h as described in our previous study noeiaghaei et al 2015 and were then used as a support to synthesize hpcs as shown in fig 2 and summarized in table 1 the tio2 nanotube array employed had an outer diameter of 147 nm length of 7 6 μm and an average porosity of 47 using the tio2 nanotube array as a support layer various hpcs were synthesized via the cvd process as shown in table 2 with an increase in the ferrocene dosage from 25 mg to 100 mg the diameter surface area and weight of the cnts on tio2 nanotubes were found to increase from 25 4 to 54 2 nm 5 1 17 2 m2 g and 2 4 8 6 mg cm2 respectively in addition the water contact angle i e hydrophobicity of hpcs increased from 118 to 138 with an increase in the cnt content from 2 4 to 8 6 mg cm2 but the water contact angle of hpcs greatly decreased to below 5 after the acid treatment using h2so4 and hno3 sem images confirmed the changes in the geometrical characteristics of the hpcs fig 3 from edx analysis related to chemical composition of hpcs the sample hpc 3 was found to have carbon content of 28 6 with 65 6 ti and 5 8 oxygen while the control sample i e hpc 0 contained 1 4 of carbon even this may have originated from the carbon tape that was used to fix the sample on the sem sample holder with 89 8 ti and 8 8 oxygen fig 4 3 2 photocatalytic activity of hpcs xrd patterns of the hpc 0 and the hpc 3 samples showed the presence of anatase tio2 the diffraction 101 peak at 2θ 25 5 fig 5 a similar result was reported by ong et al 2013 for fabrication of a cnt tio2 nanoparticle nanocomposite by the direct growth of cnts on tio2 nanoparticles via cvd it is known that anatase is the most photoactive polymorph of tio2 transformation between the anatase and rutile phase in pure tio2 usually occurs at 600 700 c and this transformation is non reversible because of the greater thermodynamic stability of the rutile phase pillai et al 2007 however there was no evidence of the unique diffraction 110 and 220 peaks related to the rutile phase in the xrd patterns of the hpc 3 sample even the sample was processed up to 770 c for the direct growth of cnts on the tio2 nanotubes this is possibly resulted from the very short reaction time 5 min of the cvd process recently few studies have reported enhanced photocatalytic activity of tio2 nanomaterials by carbon doping when a carbon impurity state is introduced into the tio2 lattice park et al 2013 yao et al 2008 yu et al 2005 in this respect the photo generated electrons formed in the tio2 nanoparticles can be transported into the cnts at interaction sites which extends the lifetime of electron hole pairs and increases the quantum yield of tio2 nanoparticles the inhibited recombination of photo generated charge carriers in the cnt tio2 matrix has been referred as the heterojunction function of the composite material yu et al 2007 to investigate the effect of cnt layers on the charge separation efficiency of tio2 nanotubes the photocurrent responses of the hpc 0 and the hpc 3 samples were measured under uv a irradiation as shown in figure s3 supplementary data a similar magnitude of generated photocurrent was observed for both samples this result shows that the direct growth of cnts on the surface of tio2 nanotubes made no significant delay in the photocurrent response of the tio2 nanotubes although the cnts on the surface of tio2 nanotubes made no significant change in the photocurrent response of the tio2 nanotubes the cnts made significant change in ros production of the tio2 nanotubes fig 6 shows the net ros production for the various hpcs the net ros production of the hpc 0 sample i e control tio2 nanotubes without cnts was the highest 6870 fsu min as the cnt content on the tio2 nanotubes increased from zero control hpc 0 to 8 6 mg cm2 hpc 3 sample the net ros production rate gradually decreased to below 3200 fsu min this result implies that the cnt layers which were directly synthesized on the tio2 nanotubes decreased the photocatalytic activity of the tio2 nanotubes this could have resulted from the physical blockage of active sites of the tio2 nanotubes which thus impeded the photocatalytic reaction or from the poor transport of light to the surfaces of hpcs which are mostly covered by cnts fig 3c it has been determined that an excess amount of methanol not only serves as a scavenger for both free and adsorbed hydroxyl radicals but also acts as a scavenger of photo generated holes it is known that the methanol radical which is generated by the reaction of methanol and photo generated holes quenches surface bounded hydroxyl radicals in this study it was found that the net ros production from hpcs is negligible in the presence of 500 mm methanol date not shown 3 3 removal of dissolved cyanotoxins using hpcs the overall removal efficiencies of the four model cyanotoxins by adsorption and photocatalytic degradation using hpcs were determined first the removal efficiency of model cyanotoxins by size exclusion and potentially adsorption was studied using a commercially available nanofiltration nf membrane nf270 mwco 200 400 da dow filmtec and three hpcs with various cnt contents ranging from 2 4 to 8 6 mg cm2 the results see table 3 show that the commercial nf membrane achieved more than 90 removal of relatively large cyanotoxins such as mc lr and cyn but its removal efficiency of relatively smaller toxins such as sxt and antx a were limited to below 35 according to literature nf membranes successfully retain mcs depending on the membrane charge and mwco as well as on the operating conditions for example gijsbertsen abrahamse et al 2006 studied the removal of cell bound and dissolved cyanotoxins using a nf membrane mwco is unknown stabilized mgso4 rejection 99 2 in the experiments cyanotoxins appeared to absorb on the membrane surface and the rejections were 99 and 96 using a tight nf membrane respectively for mc rr and antx a the performance of a negatively charged nf membrane on mc removal was recently evaluated addressing the effects of feed water background organic and inorganic matrixes results showed that this nf membrane is a very effective barrier against mc lr mc ly and mc lf present in the raw water regardless of the variations in feed water quality the high mc rejections obtained above 97 were related to size exclusion effects based on the high mc size compared to the membrane pore size and on the mcs overall net charge negative but weakly charged ribau teixeira and rosa 2006 from those results the size exclusion and potentially adsorption is considered as a main separation mechanism for removal of high molar mass toxins such mc lr mw 995 19 g mol and cyn mw 415 43 g mol by the nf membrane mwco 200 400 da however the removal of low molar mass toxins such as sxt mw 299 29 g mol and antx a mw 165 0 g mol was not governed by the size exclusion but potentially surface adsorption and or electro static hindrance therefore a proper membrane and optimal operating conditions should be used to guarantee efficient removal of both low molar mass cyanotoxins such as sxt and antx a on the other hand a significant amount of mc lr 70 6 was removed using the hpc 3 and the removal efficiency of cyanotoxins by adsorption was proportionate to the cnt content table 3 however in comparison with mc lr removal less of the relatively smaller cyanotoxins such as cyn 53 5 sxt 23 6 and antx a 1 6 were removed by the hpc 3 these results could be explained by the weak surface interaction between hpcs and relatively more hydrophilic groups and speciation of cyn sxt and antx a compared to mcs hitzfeld et al 2000 newcombe and nicholson 2004 westrick et al 2010 as shown in table 4 the removal of model cyanotoxins by photocatalytic activity of the commercial nf membrane was negligible data not shown the removal efficiency by photocatalytic degradation of the hpcs decreased as the cnt content increased for all types of cyanotoxins for example from 42 6 to 17 2 for mc lr using the hpc 3 table 4 the more cnts were added onto the composites the less photocatalytic degradation of the model toxins was observed these results are consistent with net ros production obtained from the various hpcs fig 6 photocatalytic oxidation of various cyanotoxins using tio2 has proven successful the major oxidizing species formed during the photocatalysis process for example tio2 with uv a light is hydroxyl radical where they perform substitution of a hydrogen atom or hydroxyl addition reaction by products formed during the photocatalytic treatment of cyanotoxin have been documented in very few studies for example some hydroxyl substituted molecule includes m z 1011 5 and 1029 5 during the mc lr degradation antoniou et al 2008 other cyanotoxins such as cyn has been shown the same mechanistic pathway of hydroxyl radical attack m z 432 starting from dehydroxylate m z 450 fotiou et al 2015 it was observed that most of reaction by products mainly dehydroxylated products of the main mc lr molecule formed during the photocatalytic reaction failed to undergo further degradation after a prolonged exposure for 100 min a lawton and k j robertson 1999 meanwhile the intermediate formation during each reaction step is a toxic component which requires an additional treatment for their removal keijola et al 1988 increasing the overall photocatalysis operation cost therefore the introduction of cnt layers onto tio2 photocatalyst might potentially remove the reaction by products by adsorption and ultimately reduce energy demand associated with the prolonged exposure of uv light to remove the reaction by products major challenges posed by photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins include ph change and the presence of nom for example a recent study reported over 99 9 mc lr degradation efficiency at ph 5 01 using ag3po4 catalyst sui et al 2014 however when the ph was increased to 11 96 the overall degradation efficiency reduced to 59 change in ph influences the hydrophobicity of cyanotoxins which increases with a decrease in ph preferentially allowing such compounds to move towards the catalyst surface from the bulk solution on the other hand under basic conditions mc lr showed very low adsorption on the catalyst surface reducing kinetic constant of photocatalytic degradation of the toxins sui et al 2014 that could be overcome by introduction relatively hydrophobic cnt layers onto the tio2 surface however the presence of other substances such as nom and other organic matter can further decrease the removal efficiency of cyanotoxins by the hpcs because the effect of surface adsorption of nom inhibits the mc molecule interaction with the catalyst surface under low ph kumar et al 2018 the overall removal efficiency of model cyanotoxins is calculated by combining the average removal efficiency of the toxins by physical adsorption i e the results in table 3 and the average removal efficiency of the toxins by photocatalytic degradation i e the results in table 4 using the hpcs fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the hpc 2 showed the highest overall removal efficiency of four model cyanotoxins i e mc lr 96 cyn 70 sxt 55 and antx a 40 this result is comparable to the performance of a commercial nf membrane and is even superior with respect for removing some toxins such as sxt and antx a although water permeability through the membrane was more than 10 times faster than that of the commercial nf membrane if a very limited amount of light penetration inside the hpc pores only compounds retained on the surface can react with ros and both un degraded cyanotoxins and degraded by products which are not adsorbed by the hpcs can pass through the porous channels of the hpc during filtration process which may require a post treatment process these results also show that an increase in the cnt content improves the adsorption capacity of the tio2 nanotubes but there is a trade off between adsorption enhancement and a decrease in the photocatalytic activity of the hpcs fig 8 therefore to enhance the performance of these novel materials it is important to optimize the cnt content over the photocatalytic hpc area for effective removal of both dissolved toxins and reaction intermediates 4 conclusions in this study tio2 nanotubes were fabricated by anodizing porous ti foil and various hpcs were subsequently synthesized by directly growing cnts on the surface of the tio2 nanotubes via cvd and their cyanotoxin removal performance was studied the conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows 1 for synthesizing cnts on tio2 nanotubes the content water contact angle diameter and bet surface area of the cnts increased with an increased ferrocene dosage from 25 mg to 100 mg although a high temperature i e 770 c was applied for cnt synthesis the anatase phase of the tio2 nanotubes was maintained following the cvd process and there was no significant transformation to the rutile phase within the reaction time 2 with an increase in the cnt content of hpcs from zero i e hpc 0 to 8 6 mg cm2 hpc 3 the adsorption capacity of the hpcs for dissolved cyanotoxins increased from zero to 70 6 for mc lr however there were significant decreases in the water permeability net ros production and the consequent removal of cyanotoxins by the photocatalytic activity of hpcs the change in water permeability can be attributed to the shielding effects of cnts respectively the decrease in photocatalytic activity of the hpcs by adding cnts possibly occurred from i the blockage of active tio2 nanotube sites that produce ros ii poor transport of light to the surface of hpcs and iii reduced wettability of the highly hydrophobic membrane surfaces 3 the increased cnt content on tio2 nanotube surfaces improved their adsorption capacity for cyanotoxins however there was a trade off between adsorption enhancement and decrease in hpc photocatalytic activity therefore it is considered necessary to optimize the content and structural characteristics of cnts over the effective photocatalytic hpc area to enhance material performance 4 a cyanotoxin that is relatively larger and more hydrophobic i e mc lr was more efficiently removed by the hpcs than compounds that are relatively smaller and more hydrophilic it has been frequently noted that there is a lack of information on efficient treatment options for other cyanotoxins including cyn antx a and sxt that have different chemical properties such as functional groups and speciation compared to the information on cyanotoxins therefore it is considered necessary to further optimize the hpcs presented here to achieve selective and efficient

19161,harmful algal blooms are occurring more frequently in fresh water throughout the world certain cyanobacteria can produce and release potent toxic compounds known as cyanotoxins such as microcystins cylindrospermopsin saxitoxin and anatoxin a and as such they have become a human and environmental health concern hybrid photocatalytic composites hpcs comprising carbon nanotubes on the surface of tio2 nanotubes were designed in this study the hpcs have a selective adsorption capacity to cyanotoxins and provide photocatalytic activity to produce reactive oxygen species for the degradation of cyanotoxins hpcs with 5 2 mg carbon nanotubes cm2 showed an excellent removal efficiency of microcystins lr 95 at 55 6 l m2 hr bar the hpcs more efficiently removed the relatively larger and more hydrophobic cyanotoxins i e microcystin lr than the relatively smaller and more hydrophilic compounds such as cylindrospermopsin saxitoxin and anatoxin a with a further increased in the carbon nanotube content to 8 6 mg cm2 the adsorption capacity of the hpcs for cyanotoxins increased to 70 6 for mc lr however there was significant decrease in the photocatalytic activity of the hpcs for production of reactive oxygen species and consequently a decrease in the degradation of cyanotoxins it is considered that this device could be used to provide complete rejection of particles

environment and hence can directly enter the drinking water treatment plants dwtps de la cruz et al 2013 for example the half life times of mc lr and saxitoxin are around 90 days and 9 28 days respectively welker and steinberg 2000 some of their by products such as gonyautoxin have even a longer half life of 90 days jones and orr 1994 conventional drinking water treatments using coagulation flocculation sedimentation and sand filtration are efficient barriers against cyanobacteria and cell bound cyanotoxins to a certain extent for example depending on the operating conditions applied conventional treatment removes between 58 and 90 of cyanobacteria cells teixeira et al 2010 however conventional treatment requires overdosage of coagulation and flocculation chemicals for cyanobacteria removal during algal blooms in addition conventional treatment is ineffective in removing dissolved toxins originating from i free toxins in water and or ii the release of intracellular or cell bound toxins into water during cell ageing and or external stress factors that are responsible for cell damage and may be caused by the treatment itself chow et al 1999 according to literature

2017 feitz et al 1999 fotiou et al 2015 2016 hu et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 malayeri et al 2017 pestana et al 2015 pinho et al 2015 moreover free standing tio2 nanotube membranes have also been developed for photocatalytic applications albu et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 however high energy usage is a common problem associated with photocatalysis along with other factors such as skilled supervision requirement strict experimental conditions for example frequent ph adjustments by products toxicity recovery of photocatalysts after use and most importantly difficulty in process scale up limits photocatalytic process in becoming a primary choice for the water treatment systems de freitas et al 2013 physical adsorption of cyanotoxins using powdered activated carbon pac and granular activated carbon gac has been studied over the last few decades removal of cyanotoxins through sorption has been shown to be dependent on electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions these electrostatic interactions were caused due to the range of ph being studied from 5 7 to 10 2 with a maximum sorption at ph 10 2 at ph 10 2 1 40 mg l pac dose removed 99 of sxt whereas almost no removal sorption of sxt was observed for pac dose between 1 and 40 mg l at ph 5 7 shi et al 2012 these observations suggest effective sorption of cyanotoxin molecules under alkaline conditions which are somewhat irrational to be applied in dwtps further pac dose varies a lot with the treatment efficiency required moreover the presence of natural organic matter nom was shown to decrease the sorption behavior of the pac for the amount of sxt removed and thus higher dose of pac was required to effectively adsorb it shi et al 2012 like pacs removal of cyanotoxins by gacs highly depends on the electrostatic repulsion between the cyanotoxin molecules which aids in their overall removal for example in a gac filter treatment sxt exhibited cationic nature between mono cationic and di cationic in their molecular structure due to the presence of the amine group at neutral ph which further helped these molecules to get removed due to the electrostatic repulsion silva buarque et al 2015 however these electrostatic repulsions might vary among different cyanotoxins based on the size and charges for example it was found that the electrostatic repulsion factor decreased the mc removal in a gac filter column larger in size as compared to sxt wang et al 2007 in another study an attempt was made to reduce the repulsion by increasing the ionic strength of the solution containing mcs that resulted in their enhanced removal newcombe et al 2003 with adsorption being the principal mechanism the problem of early breakthrough arises due to a decrease in the adsorption over the time in the presence of nom on the other hand carbon nanomaterials particularly carbon nanotubes cnts have also been widely studied for use as an adsorbent to remove various organic compounds such as phenols lin and xing 2008 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons fagan et al 2004 long and yang 2001 peng et al 2003 heavy metals li et al 2005 wang et al 2005 and trace organic compounds ji et al 2010 joseph et al 2013 although nano sized carbon nanomaterials have large effective surface areas and thus provide many advantages it is challengeable to separate the materials from treated water which hinders their practical application in drinking water treatment although one approach used to minimize the post separation processes is to stabilize the nanomaterials via immobilization on suitable support materials recently nanostructured composite catalysts have been produced using cnts and tio2 the introduction of cnts into the titanium matrix induces a synergic effect on the photocatalytic degradation of benzene derivatives silva and faria 2010 and mcs sampaio et al 2015 by near ultraviolet uv to visible light irradiation however the main technical barriers impeding its commercialization are i the post recovery of photocatalyst nanoparticles after water treatment fernández ibáñez et al 2003 lee et al 2001 xi and geissen 2001 and ii the incomplete removal of degradation intermediates after treatment gaya and abdullah 2008 to overcome these challenges this study aimed to design novel hybrid hpcs by introducing cnt layers directly onto immobilized tio2 nanotubes with the ultimate aim of effectively removing various dissolved cyanotoxins and intermediates a synergic effect was expected by introducing cnts directly onto tio2 nanotubes as follows i tio2 nanotubes are designed to degrade dissolved cyanotoxins by producing ros under uv irradiation and ii cnts are mainly responsible for the adsorption of intermediates and unreacted dissolved cyanotoxins most of physical and chemical treatment processes are also being commonly practiced in dwtps however the degree of treatment widely varies among cyanotoxin variants and is mainly governed by the source water characteristics operational parameters temperature ph cyanotoxin level which changes continuously in treatment plants moreover the majority of studies on cyanotoxins and their fate during drinking water treatment focus on mcs and particularly the mc lr variants merel et al 2013 the lack of information on efficient treatment options for other cyanotoxins including cyn antx a and sxt which have different chemical properties such as functional groups and speciation compared to mcs has been frequently noted hitzfeld et al 2000 newcombe and nicholson 2004 westrick et al 2010 given that chemical properties of cyanotoxins are critical factors determining performance of physical and chemical water treatment processes we aimed to determine the effects of chemical properties of the dissolved cyanotoxins on their removal by adsorption and photocatalytic degradation using innovative hpcs comprising cnts on the surface of tio2 nanotubes 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis

fluorinated solution of ethylene glycol c2h6o2 vwr as described in the previous study noeiaghaei et al 2015 first the ti foil was decontaminated by sonication in acetone c3h6o vwr ethanol c2h6o vwr and deionized water for 10 min and then vacuum dried electrolyte anodization was subsequently prepared by mixing ethylene glycol and 0 5 wt of naf sigma aldrich with a water content of 5 wt finally anodization of ti foil was conducted in a one compartment two electrode system with pt foil pt 99 99 thickness 1 mm sigma aldrich and pt wire pt 99 9 diameter 2 mm sigma aldrich as the control electrode cathode and ti foil as the working electrode anode the volume of electrolyte was kept constant and stirred at 200 ml and 400 rpm respectively a programmable direct current power supply e3632a keysight technologies interfaced with a computer was used to monitor the anodization current 2 2 hpc fabrication cnts that are adsorption materials of the hpcs were directly grown on the tio2 nanotube array in a dual zone chemical vapor deposition cvd reactor figure s1appsec1 in supplementary data at an ambient pressure as described in the previous study yang et al 2013 the cvd reactor consists of a 150 cm long quartz tube with an inner diameter of 4 5 cm c2h4 and h2 were utilized as a carbon source and a reducing agent respectively ferrocene 25 100 mg was placed in a ceramic boat and introduced into the first zone of the reactor to remove any oxygen in the reactor it was firstly flushed with ar at a flow rate of 600 cubic centimeters per minute sccm for 10 min and the ar flow rate was then reduced to 167 sccm simultaneously the temperatures of the first and the second zones of the reactor were increased to 250 c with a ramp of 3 c min and 770 c with a ramp of 10 c min respectively subsequently c2h4 and h2 were passed through the reactor for 5 min at flow rates of 115 and 400 sccm respectively to increase hydrophilicity of hpcs each hpc was immersed into a mixture of h2so4 0 5 n and hno3 1 n at temperature of 60 c for minimum 4 h 2 3 hpc characterization hpc surface morphology was characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem with energy dispersive x ray edx s4500 hitachi at 15 kv without any coating the diameters of cnts were measured using transmission electron microscopy tem jem 1400 jeol to determine the phase composition and crystal structure of hpcs x ray diffraction xrd measurements were conducted at room temperature using a diffractometer d5000 siemens equipped with a graphite monochromator at 40 kv and 40 ma cu kα

surface area sbet and porosity of hpcs were measured using n2 and he gases asap 2060 micromeritics instrument co 2 4 evaluation of hpc performance 2 4 1 pure water permeability water permeability through the hpcs was determined using deionized water resistivity 18 2 mω cm in a dead end filtration device millipore at room temperature a virgin hpc was used in the experiment mentioned below in pressure driven membrane filtration the driving force of mass transfer is the difference in pressure across the membrane van der bruggen et al 2003 and water permeability through porous materials is defined based on darcy s law as follows 1 j 1 a d v d t δ p μ r t where j is water permeability l m2 hr v is total permeate volume m3 a is the filtration area m2 δp is transmembrane pressure pa μ is dynamic viscosity of the permeate pa s and rt is total resistance m 1 2 4 2 adsorption capacity of hpcs adsorption capacity of hpcs was evaluated in a closed loop continuous filtration system figure s2 in supplementary data that was placed in the dark the feed water was circulated through an hpc at 0 5 ml min for 2 h four model cyanotoxins mc lr cyn sxt and antx a table s1 in supplementary data were obtained from abraxis inc and the initial concentration of the cyanotoxins in deionized water was maintained at 100 μg l a virgin hpc was used with each model cyanotoxin and the average rejection efficiency of model organic compounds by the model hpcs was calculated as follows 2 r 1 c f c i x 100 where r is the removal efficiency ci is the initial concentration mg l of model organic compounds in the feed and cf is the final concentration mg l of model organic compounds in the permeate all experiments were performed in triplicate after 2 h aqueous suspension was collected from the feed tank and then used for further analysis the student s t test was used to assess the significance of results employing a 95 confidence interval 2 4 3 photocatalytic reactivity of hpcs to investigate the photo induced charge separation efficiency of hpcs photocurrent response measurements were conducted under uv a irradiation 1 6 mw cm2 using either tio2 nanotubes or hpcs as the working electrode pt foil and ag agcl were employed as the counter and reference electrodes respectively and a na2so4 solution 0 5 m was used as the electrolyte the light dark photo current response was recorded under zero bias 0 0 v with a digital potentiostat sp 300 bio logic science instruments all experiments were conducted in triplicate under ambient conditions photocatalytic reactivity of hpcs was evaluated for its ability to degrade the four model cyanotoxins using the cross flow membrane filtration system figure s2 in supplementary data under uv irradiation λ max 365 nm 1 6 mw cm2 for the test one virgin hpc effective area 1 7 cm2 was used for each model cyanotoxin each hpc was immersed into a glass beaker 90 mm outer diameter 115 mm height of the respective model cyanotoxin suspension the initial concentration of cyanotoxins in the deionized water was maintained at 100 μg l the beaker with the hpc was directly irradiated under two 15 w fluorescent uv bulbs philips tld 15w 08 in an uv cryo chamber electron microscopy science the bulbs had an output spectrum ranging from 310 to 400 nm and a total irradiance of 24 1 w m2 with a peak at 365 nm water samples in the glass beaker were collected from the suspension every 30 min for 2 h for further analyses and all experiments were performed in triplicate the student s t test was used to assess the significance of the results employing a 95 confidence interval 2 4 4 ros detection singlet oxygen sensor green thermo fisher scientific 2 3 bis 2 methoxy 4 nitro 5 sulfophenyl 2h tetrazolium 5 carboxanilide thermo fisher scientific and a hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite sensor thermo fisher scientific were used to detect 1o2 o2 and oh respectively the fluorescence unit fsu or absorbance of each chemical reagent after reaction with ros were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer turner designs or an uv visible spectrophotometer u 2000 hitachi respectively as described in the previous studies chae et al 2009 price et al 2009 ukeda et al 1997 the net ros production rate fsu min of hpcs was calculated from the difference between overall ros production in water samples in the presence of hpcs under uv irradiation and the ros production in water samples without hpcs under uv irradiation methanol was used as a scavenger for hydroxyl radicals el morsi et al 2000 2 4 5 characterization of model cyanotoxins in water the concentration of each of the four cyanotoxins was measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa kits obtained from abraxis inc and the detection limits of mc lr cyn sxt and antx a were 0 10 μg l 0 04 μg l 0 015 μg l and 0 10 μg l respectively u s epa method 546 3 results and discussion 3 1 hpc characteristics in our previous study noeiaghaei et al 2015 it was found that the photocatalytic activity of tio2 nanotubes relies on their geometrical characteristics such as the surface area and porosity of the tio2 nanotubes in addition it was found that generation of ros and degradation of 4 chlorobenzoic acid by tio2 nanotubes was increased with increases in both the surface area and porosity of the tio2 nanotubes under an optimum condition whereby tio2 nanotubes were fabricated at 60 v for 3 h more than 70 of 4 chlorobenzoic acid initial concentration 25 μm was degraded within 2 h in this study tio2 nanotube array was fabricated through anodization at 60 v for 3 h as described in our previous study noeiaghaei et al 2015 and were then used as a support to synthesize hpcs as shown in fig 2 and summarized in table 1 the tio2 nanotube array employed had an outer diameter of 147 nm length of 7 6 μm and an average porosity of 47 using the tio2 nanotube array as a support layer various hpcs were synthesized via the cvd process as shown in table 2 with an increase in the ferrocene dosage from 25 mg to 100 mg the diameter surface area and weight of the cnts on tio2 nanotubes were found to increase from 25 4 to 54 2 nm 5 1 17 2 m2 g and 2 4 8 6 mg cm2 respectively in addition the water contact angle i e hydrophobicity of hpcs increased from 118 to 138 with an increase in the cnt content from 2 4 to 8 6 mg cm2 but the water contact angle of hpcs greatly decreased to below 5 after the acid treatment using h2so4 and hno3 sem images confirmed the changes in the geometrical characteristics of the hpcs fig 3 from edx analysis related to chemical composition of hpcs the sample hpc 3 was found to have carbon content of 28 6 with 65 6 ti and 5 8 oxygen while the control sample i e hpc 0 contained 1 4 of carbon even this may have originated from the carbon tape that was used to fix the sample on the sem sample holder with 89 8 ti and 8 8 oxygen fig 4 3 2 photocatalytic activity of hpcs xrd patterns of the hpc 0 and the hpc 3 samples showed the presence of anatase tio2 the diffraction 101 peak at 2θ 25 5 fig 5 a similar result was reported by ong et al 2013 for fabrication of a cnt tio2 nanoparticle nanocomposite by the direct growth of cnts on tio2 nanoparticles via cvd it is known that anatase is the most photoactive polymorph of tio2 transformation between the anatase and rutile phase in pure tio2 usually occurs at 600 700 c and this transformation is non reversible because of the greater thermodynamic stability of the rutile phase pillai et al 2007 however there was no evidence of the unique diffraction 110 and 220 peaks related to the rutile phase in the xrd patterns of the hpc 3 sample even the sample was processed up to 770 c for the direct growth of cnts on the tio2 nanotubes this is possibly resulted from the very short reaction time 5 min of the cvd process recently few studies have reported enhanced photocatalytic activity of tio2 nanomaterials by carbon doping when a carbon impurity state is introduced into the tio2 lattice park et al 2013 yao et al 2008 yu et al 2005 in this respect the photo generated electrons formed in the tio2 nanoparticles can be transported into the cnts at interaction sites which extends the lifetime of electron hole pairs and increases the quantum yield of tio2 nanoparticles the inhibited recombination of photo generated charge carriers in the cnt tio2 matrix has been referred as the heterojunction function of the composite material yu et al 2007 to investigate the effect of cnt layers on the charge separation efficiency of tio2 nanotubes the photocurrent responses of the hpc 0 and the hpc 3 samples were measured under uv a irradiation as shown in figure s3 supplementary data a similar magnitude of generated photocurrent was observed for both samples this result shows that the direct growth of cnts on the surface of tio2 nanotubes made no significant delay in the photocurrent response of the tio2 nanotubes although the cnts on the surface of tio2 nanotubes made no significant change in the photocurrent response of the tio2 nanotubes the cnts made significant change in ros production of the tio2 nanotubes fig 6 shows the net ros production for the various hpcs the net ros production of the hpc 0 sample i e control tio2 nanotubes without cnts was the highest 6870 fsu min as the cnt content on the tio2 nanotubes increased from zero control hpc 0 to 8 6 mg cm2 hpc 3 sample the net ros production rate gradually decreased to below 3200 fsu min this result implies that the cnt layers which were directly synthesized on the tio2 nanotubes decreased the photocatalytic activity of the tio2 nanotubes this could have resulted from the physical blockage of active sites of the tio2 nanotubes which thus impeded the photocatalytic reaction or from the poor transport of light to the surfaces of hpcs which are mostly covered by cnts fig 3c it has been determined that an excess amount of methanol not only serves as a scavenger for both free and adsorbed hydroxyl radicals but also acts as a scavenger of photo generated holes it is known that the methanol radical which is generated by the reaction of methanol and photo generated holes quenches surface bounded hydroxyl radicals in this study it was found that the net ros production from hpcs is negligible in the presence of 500 mm methanol date not shown 3 3 removal of dissolved cyanotoxins using hpcs the overall removal efficiencies of the four model cyanotoxins by adsorption and photocatalytic degradation using hpcs were determined first the removal efficiency of model cyanotoxins by size exclusion and potentially adsorption was studied using a commercially available nanofiltration nf membrane nf270 mwco 200 400 da dow filmtec and three hpcs with various cnt contents ranging from 2 4 to 8 6 mg cm2 the results see table 3 show that the commercial nf membrane achieved more than 90 removal of relatively large cyanotoxins such as mc lr and cyn but its removal efficiency of relatively smaller toxins such as sxt and antx a were limited to below 35 according to literature nf membranes successfully retain mcs depending on the membrane charge and mwco as well as on the operating conditions for example gijsbertsen abrahamse et al 2006 studied the removal of cell bound and dissolved cyanotoxins using a nf membrane mwco is unknown stabilized mgso4 rejection 99 2 in the experiments cyanotoxins appeared to absorb on the membrane surface and the rejections were 99 and 96 using a tight nf membrane respectively for mc rr and antx a the performance of a negatively charged nf membrane on mc removal was recently evaluated addressing the effects of feed water background organic and inorganic matrixes results showed that this nf membrane is a very effective barrier against mc lr mc ly and mc lf present in the raw water regardless of the variations in feed water quality the high mc rejections obtained above 97 were related to size exclusion effects based on the high mc size compared to the membrane pore size and on the mcs overall net charge negative but weakly charged ribau teixeira and rosa 2006 from those results the size exclusion and potentially adsorption is considered as a main separation mechanism for removal of high molar mass toxins such mc lr mw 995 19 g mol and cyn mw 415 43 g mol by the nf membrane mwco 200 400 da however the removal of low molar mass toxins such as sxt mw 299 29 g mol and antx a mw 165 0 g mol was not governed by the size exclusion but potentially surface adsorption and or electro static hindrance therefore a proper membrane and optimal operating conditions should be used to guarantee efficient removal of both low molar mass cyanotoxins such as sxt and antx a on the other hand a significant amount of mc lr 70 6 was removed using the hpc 3 and the removal efficiency of cyanotoxins by adsorption was proportionate to the cnt content table 3 however in comparison with mc lr removal less of the relatively smaller cyanotoxins such as cyn 53 5 sxt 23 6 and antx a 1 6 were removed by the hpc 3 these results could be explained by the weak surface interaction between hpcs and relatively more hydrophilic groups and speciation of cyn sxt and antx a compared to mcs hitzfeld et al 2000 newcombe and nicholson 2004 westrick et al 2010 as shown in table 4 the removal of model cyanotoxins by photocatalytic activity of the commercial nf membrane was negligible data not shown the removal efficiency by photocatalytic degradation of the hpcs decreased as the cnt content increased for all types of cyanotoxins for example from 42 6 to 17 2 for mc lr using the hpc 3 table 4 the more cnts were added onto the composites the less photocatalytic degradation of the model toxins was observed these results are consistent with net ros production obtained from the various hpcs fig 6 photocatalytic oxidation of various cyanotoxins using tio2 has proven successful the major oxidizing species formed during the photocatalysis process for example tio2 with uv a light is hydroxyl radical where they perform substitution of a hydrogen atom or hydroxyl addition reaction by products formed during the photocatalytic treatment of cyanotoxin have been documented in very few studies for example some hydroxyl substituted molecule includes m z 1011 5 and 1029 5 during the mc lr degradation antoniou et al 2008 other cyanotoxins such as cyn has been shown the same mechanistic pathway of hydroxyl radical attack m z 432 starting from dehydroxylate m z 450 fotiou et al 2015 it was observed that most of reaction by products mainly dehydroxylated products of the main mc lr molecule formed during the photocatalytic reaction failed to undergo further degradation after a prolonged exposure for 100 min a lawton and k j robertson 1999 meanwhile the intermediate formation during each reaction step is a toxic component which requires an additional treatment for their removal keijola et al 1988 increasing the overall photocatalysis operation cost therefore the introduction of cnt layers onto tio2 photocatalyst might potentially remove the reaction by products by adsorption and ultimately reduce energy demand associated with the prolonged exposure of uv light to remove the reaction by products major challenges posed by photocatalytic degradation of cyanotoxins include ph change and the presence of nom for example a recent study reported over 99 9 mc lr degradation efficiency at ph 5 01 using ag3po4 catalyst sui et al 2014 however when the ph was increased to 11 96 the overall degradation efficiency reduced to 59 change in ph influences the hydrophobicity of cyanotoxins which increases with a decrease in ph preferentially allowing such compounds to move towards the catalyst surface from the bulk solution on the other hand under basic conditions mc lr showed very low adsorption on the catalyst surface reducing kinetic constant of photocatalytic degradation of the toxins sui et al 2014 that could be overcome by introduction relatively hydrophobic cnt layers onto the tio2 surface however the presence of other substances such as nom and other organic matter can further decrease the removal efficiency of cyanotoxins by the hpcs because the effect of surface adsorption of nom inhibits the mc molecule interaction with the catalyst surface under low ph kumar et al 2018 the overall removal efficiency of model cyanotoxins is calculated by combining the average removal efficiency of the toxins by physical adsorption i e the results in table 3 and the average removal efficiency of the toxins by photocatalytic degradation i e the results in table 4 using the hpcs fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the hpc 2 showed the highest overall removal efficiency of four model cyanotoxins i e mc lr 96 cyn 70 sxt 55 and antx a 40 this result is comparable to the performance of a commercial nf membrane and is even superior with respect for removing some toxins such as sxt and antx a although water permeability through the membrane was more than 10 times faster than that of the commercial nf membrane if a very limited amount of light penetration inside the hpc pores only compounds retained on the surface can react with ros and both un degraded cyanotoxins and degraded by products which are not adsorbed by the hpcs can pass through the porous channels of the hpc during filtration process which may require a post treatment process these results also show that an increase in the cnt content improves the adsorption capacity of the tio2 nanotubes but there is a trade off between adsorption enhancement and a decrease in the photocatalytic activity of the hpcs fig 8 therefore to enhance the performance of these novel materials it is important to optimize the cnt content over the photocatalytic hpc area for effective removal of both dissolved toxins and reaction intermediates 4 conclusions in this study tio2 nanotubes were fabricated by anodizing porous ti foil and various hpcs were subsequently synthesized by directly growing cnts on the surface of the tio2 nanotubes via cvd and their cyanotoxin removal performance was studied the conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows 1 for synthesizing cnts on tio2 nanotubes the content water contact angle diameter and bet surface area of the cnts increased with an increased ferrocene dosage from 25 mg to 100 mg although a high temperature i e 770 c was applied for cnt synthesis the anatase phase of the tio2 nanotubes was maintained following the cvd process and there was no significant transformation to the rutile phase within the reaction time 2 with an increase in the cnt content of hpcs from zero i e hpc 0 to 8 6 mg cm2 hpc 3 the adsorption capacity of the hpcs for dissolved cyanotoxins increased from zero to 70 6 for mc lr however there were significant decreases in the water permeability net ros production and the consequent removal of cyanotoxins by the photocatalytic activity of hpcs the change in water permeability can be attributed to the shielding effects of cnts respectively the decrease in photocatalytic activity of the hpcs by adding cnts possibly occurred from i the blockage of active tio2 nanotube sites that produce ros ii poor transport of light to the surface of hpcs and iii reduced wettability of the highly hydrophobic membrane surfaces 3 the increased cnt content on tio2 nanotube surfaces improved their adsorption capacity for cyanotoxins however there was a trade off between adsorption enhancement and decrease in hpc photocatalytic activity therefore it is considered necessary to optimize the content and structural characteristics of cnts over the effective photocatalytic hpc area to enhance material performance 4 a cyanotoxin that is relatively larger and more hydrophobic i e mc lr was more efficiently removed by the hpcs than compounds that are relatively smaller and more hydrophilic it has been frequently noted that there is a lack of information on efficient treatment options for other cyanotoxins including cyn antx a and sxt that have different chemical properties such as functional groups and speciation compared to the information on cyanotoxins therefore it is considered necessary to further optimize the hpcs presented here to achieve selective and efficient

method detection limit otu operational taxonomic units suva specific uv absorbance t o taste and odour 1 introduction the taste and odour of drinking water is often the major water quality criteria used by consumers two of the most common taste and odour t o compounds are algal metabolites produced by a range of cyanobacteria namely 2 methylisoborneol mib and geosmin both are non toxic but lead to musty earthy odour and taste at an extremely low threshold i e at low ng l levels ito 1988 young et al 1996 elevated mib and geosmin concentrations e g 30 40 ng l in south east queensland are a regular occurrence in surface waters during the warm summer months particular for sub tropical conditions the presence of t o compounds is a challenge as they are persistent through conventional coagulation flocculation sedimentation and filtration water treatment bruce et al 2002 nerenberg et al 2000 conventional drinking water treatment plants dwtp most commonly use powdered activated carbon for seasonal t o control nerenberg et al 2000 biofiltration has attracted attention as a removal process as it can be a cost effective solution requiring little or no chemical addition and minimum maintenance efforts in addition to being able to improve biological stability of the water and reduce disinfectant demand biological filtration has been shown to simultaneously remove dissolved organic and inorganic compounds lauderdale et al 2012 while there are conflicting reports on the biodegradation rates of mib and geosmin they have been shown to be successfully removed via biological sand and activated carbon filtration during drinking water treatment ho et al 2007 hsieh et al 2010 lundgren et al 1988 mcdowall et al 2007 2009 however in conventional drinking water treatment processes the bio filtration step follows the flocculation sedimentation process which can result in a lack of nutrients particularly phosphorus for optimal biofilter performance lauderdale 2011 to address this issue a nutrient enhanced engineered biofiltration process has been proposed recently to augment the biological activities required to achieve effective t o compound removal lauderdale et al 2012 however this approach bears a risk of nutrient over dosing potentially leading to unwanted biofilm growth in the distribution network situating a rapid biofiltration process before the flocculation sedimentation stage where nutrients would still be present in the raw water would not be practicable due to the relatively high solids concentration in the raw water leading to excessive headloss and backwashing frequency therefore alternative biological processes need to be considered if applied at this location in the treatment train the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr is a biological wastewater treatment process where microorganisms grow as active biofilms on suspended carriers ødegaard 1994 the carriers maximise surface area in the reactors for the biofilm to establish this has the advantage that the reactors have insignificant headloss no need for periodic backwashing and no susceptibility for clogging therefore this simple and compact technology could be placed at the front end of dwtps using raw water as feed for the biofilm to thrive another advantage of using raw water before the coagulation process is the ph as elevated ph can enhance t o removal rittmann and mccarty 2001 when aluminium based coagulations are used care must be taken not to raise the ph above ph 7 8 to avoid the risk of exceeding the soluble aluminium limits lauderdale et al 2016 there is only very limited research on mbbr technology in the drinking water context to date only one study by xiangyang 2009 tested the potential of the mbbr technology for organics and algae removal using sewage and industry impacted river water aimed for drinking water treatment over a three months period they observed at total organic carbon removal of 17 at a ph range of ph 7 8 8 3 to our knowledge there is currently no study reporting on the applicability of the mbbr process for the removal of mib and geosmin during drinking water treatment therefore this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the mbbr treatment for removing both t o compounds to achieve this objective continuous pilot scale mbbr reactors were set up for assessment of the acclimation period and long term removal efficiencies in addition batch tests were performed to elucidate the underlying removal mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale treatment system three pilot scale cylindrical reactors of approximately 50 l were set up at a drinking water treatment plant in parallel and continuously fed with raw water from a surface water reservoir as shown in fig 1 the aeration and influent occurred at the bottom of the reactors while the treated water was taken through overflow pipes at the top of the reactors the carriers were fully retained in the reactor as the overflow pipe diameters were smaller than the carrier dimensions for full scale installations of such mbbr processes specifically designed sieves are used for the outlet to ensure complete carrier retention while minimising headloss even at high flow rates two of the reactors contained 50 bulk volume anoxk z 400 carriers and were operated initially at a fixed hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 2 h the carriers used in this study differ from mbbr carriers most typically used in wastewater treatment the biofilm grows on the outside of the carrier and not inside voids piculell et al 2016 a grid covering the surface of the carrier protects the exposed biofilm from the scouring action of other carriers but also ensures a thin biofilm preventing any risk of carrier clogging and or anaerobic biofilm formation the z carriers instead of the traditional carriers were chosen as biodegradation of mib and geosmin is an aerobic process and the traditional carriers also provide void spaces for anaerobic biofilms the third reactor was operated as a blank control reactor that did not contain carriers and was used to quantify the removal of the t o compounds through air stripping as there was no biomass growth maintained in this reactor the walls of the reactor were cleaned once a month to avoid biofilm growth the mixing was performed by coarse bubble aeration and the airflow was kept constant at 2 5 l min this airflow was chosen as it could keep the carriers in suspension and maintained the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the mbbr reactors near saturation level at all times solids in the raw water which settled on the bottom of the reactors were drained weekly before sampling occurred 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 continuous flow experiment pilot scale due to the low background levels of mib 5 ng l and geosmin 2 ng l which are levels observed during the colder winter months both compounds were added to the feed water to reach concentrations between 80 and 100 ng l on the day of sampling these levels were chosen as those are elevated concentrations which have been measured at the local water treatment plants during t o events this occurred in a 600 l water reservoir which was protected from sunlight the reactors were fed for a minimum of three hrts with the raw water containing t o compounds before taking the treated water samples in order to monitor that steady state conditions were reached in the reactors nacl was added the amount of nacl added was chosen to increase the conductivity from ambient 196 202 μs cm to around 400 μs cm and only occurred during the sampling events e g once a week during the acclimation period subsequently during experimentation the conductivity was monitored in the mbbr reactors to ensure they had reached the same level as in the feed water reservoir feed water samples of the spiked water reservoir were taken at the beginning midway and at the end of each experiment to monitor for volatilisation losses of the t o compounds as these experiments were undertaken weekly the biofilm on the mbbr carriers experienced a weekly exposure for approximately 12 h to these higher levels of t o compounds while for the remainder of the week only the low background levels were present 2 2 2 biodegradation batch experiment for the biodegradation experiments carriers with an active biofilm after the acclimation period at 5 months were taken from one of the pilot reactors feed water from the pilot reactor was collected and subsequently spiked with t o compounds at 100 ng l the water was then split into two beakers of 2 l each one containing 50 carriers and one without carriers to monitor potential volatilisation losses the carriers were counted to replicate the 50 carrier to water volume used at pilot scale after spiking the beakers were not aerated but stirred at 70 rpm and samples were taken every 10 min for the first hour plus a final sample after 90 min the concentrations of mib and geosmin at each sample time was plotted and a first order degradation curve equation 1 was fitted to the results 1 c c 0 e k t 2 2 3 sorption batch experiment the sorption experiment used new and bioactive carriers which were taken from one of the pilot reactors after the acclimation period when operating on background feed to distinguish potential sorption on the plastic of the carriers and or the biofilm in order to inactivate the bioactivity one set of biological carriers was exposed to 2 mm sodium azide during the experiment feed water collected from the mbbr pilot reactor was spiked with 100 ng l each of mib and geosmin and split into two batches one containing 2 mm sodium azide and one without the two batches were split into three beakers containing either i new unused carriers ii

and discussion 3 1 mib and geosmin removal efficiency 3 1 1 acclimation period surface water reservoirs that feed dwtps have less available nutrients than wastewater treatment plants where the mbbr process is typically applied many nutrients are essential for bacterial cell growth and as an energy source although the concentration required varies for each nutrient and is dependent on the bacterial cell type madigan and martinko 2006 nutrients required by bacterial cells include carbon nitrogen and phosphorus table 1 shows the characteristics of the mbbr feed water compared to a typical medium strength municipal wastewater in the us with a total organic carbon toc ammonia nh4 n and ortho phosphate po4 p concentration of 120 mg l 25 mg l and 5 mg l respectively metcalf and eddy 2003 the doc nh4 n and po4 p were 15 830 and 330 times lower those levels can be higher in other countries for typical aerobic microbial growth a c n p ratio of 100 10 1 has been proposed to be the ideal ratio for cell synthesis lechevallier et al 1991 the c n p ratio in the mbbr feed for this study was approximately 100 3 1 indicating a slight nitrogen deficiency in addition to nutrients microorganisms also require specific ph ranges temperatures and do concentrations for their growth metcalf and eddy 2003 decreased biological activity was reported at low temperatures 10 c moll et al 1999 due to the location in a subtropical climate the temperature was not a limiting factor as the lowest feed water temperature measured was 24 c dependent on the temperature the do ranged between 7 5 and 8 5 mg l in the mbbr reactors the feed water ph showed little variation averaging at ph 7 03 which was in the reported optimal range of ph of 7 9 for the removal of mib rittmann and mccarty 2001 at a ph of less than 7 the degradation potential in biological mib treatment was observed to be substantially less egashira et al 1992 the biological acclimation for mib and geosmin removal was monitored over a 5 7 month period fig 2 shows the evolution of mib and geosmin removal by the mbbr over this timeframe after one week mib and geosmin removal was measured at 46 and 35 respectively during the first 3 5 months of operation geosmin fig 2 a and mib fig 2 b removals continued to increase reaching a plateau at 84 4 and 87 6 respectively while low removal rates were achieved quickly 1 week it took up to 3 5 months to establish a biofilm on the plastic carriers conditioned for t o compound removal for the first 5 months of operation the feed water doc only varied between 8 7 and 11 8 mg l due to a major weather event during the last month of the monitoring period the doc in the feed water increased by 5 mg l doc to 16 4 mg l for several weeks as can be seen in fig 2 the t o removal of the last two sampling events was not impacted by the increased organic loading this implies high stability of the mbbr system and that the microorganisms colonizing the biofilm were well adapted to the source water as compared to wastewater application the biofilm on the carriers in this study it was so thin that is was not visible without microscopy using diversity profiling microbial communities on the mbbr carriers were examined at the phylum class order and family level where those with a relative abundance of 1 were included the predominant phyla were chloroflexi 10 and actinobacteria 6 followed by proteobacteria 4 planctomycetes 3 and acidobacteria 1 at the class level caldilineae and thermoleophilia were the predominant class also planctomycetacia actinobacteria α proteobacteria and β proteobacteria were present 1 2 the major communities at the order level were caldilineales and solirubrobacterales caldilineaceae was the predominant family at 10 while a0839 comamonadaceae holophagaceae planctomycetaceae sandaracinaceae and tm146 showed an abundance of 1 2 however no microbial communities related to mib or geosmin removal reported in the literature were identified at all taxonomic resolutions investigated 3 1 2 impact of hrt fig 3 shows the impact of the hrt on the removal efficiencies of mib and geosmin which was tested after the acclimation period both show a similar behaviour reaching a plateau at 1 h of hrt increasing the hrt from 10 min to 30 min did increase the removal rates by 33 for mib and 24 for geosmin increasing the hrt further to 1 h resulted in a 10 improvement while increasing even further to 2 h hrt only gained an additional removal of 4 given the low substrate concentrations the biofilm based degradation processes on the mbbr carriers are considered to be mass transfer limited which therefore governs the substrate removal performance water environment federation 2010 therefore longer hrts did improve the overall mass transfer of the t o compounds towards the biofilm although the effect becomes less pronounced as the remaining substrate concentrations in the bulk liquid are diminished as the diffusion layer between the biofilm and the bulk liquid is controlled by the hydraulic regime in the reactor a more intensive mixing through higher aeration rates could potentially improve the substrate transfer and hence the degradation rates if required 3 1 3 impact of extended off periods dwtps are regularly shutdown for a day or more as a result of operational issues or routine maintenance to simulate such an extended shutdown period the pilot plant operation was completely stopped no flow and no aeration for an eleven day period fig 4 shows the recovery of mib and geosmin removal capacities following the shutdown period the long shutdown period resulted in do starvation 0 mg l and negatively impacted removal performances one day after restarting operation only 53 and 59 of mib and geosmin removal was observed however after four days of continuous operation the t o removal efficiencies reached levels comparative to those achieved before the shutdown this indicates a high resilience of the biofilm towards starvation conditions to avoid the occurrence of anaerobic conditions it would likely be beneficial to maintain a minimum level of aeration during such shut down periods if possible 3 2 t o compound removal mechanisms in addition to biodegradation sorption and volatilisation via air stripping may be mechanisms contributing to the removal of mib and geosmin during mbbr treatment 3 2 1 sorption sorption of organics to a biofilm is a recognized phenomenon and a requirement for their biodegradation späth et al 1998 batch tests were performed to investigate the sorption of the t o compounds on either the biofilm of the biological active carriers or the high density polyethylene carriers alone fig 5 shows the removal of mib and geosmin from mbbr feed water by the i carriers without biofilm ii carriers with inactivated biofilm and iii carriers with full biological activity over a timeframe of 2 h both mib and geosmin show sorption to the carrier material and the inactivated biofilm fig 5 hydrophobicity can be an influential factor for sorption which is expressed by the octanol water partition coefficient logkow mib and geosmin are both hydrophobic with logkow values of 3 13 and 3 70 respectively pirbazari et al 1992 up until 15 min of contact time sorption was the dominant removal mechanism with biodegradation becoming the predominant removal process beyond that contact time mib reached steady state sorption onto the carrier material and the biofilm within half an hour while geosmin continued to be sorbed slowly beyond the 2 h studied comparing the results of the unused carriers only sorption of geosmin was much greater than that of mib for example after 2 h 56 of the initial geosmin concentration was removed while only 9 of the initial mib concentration has been removed similar behaviour was observed for the sorption onto the biofilm of the carriers with the inactivated biofilm with geosmin sorbing 43 more than mib the greater sorption of geosmin may be related to its greater hydrophobicity another factor contributing to the greater sorption of geosmin may be the lower molecular weight and a flatter molecular structure compared to mib allowing for easier interaction with the biofilm cook et al 2001 and less direct competition with nom molecules a 9 greater geosmin sorption on the biofilm compared to mib was observed also a 12 and 21 greater sorptive removal of mib and geosmin respectively was seen for the carriers supporting a biofilm hence the biofilm may provide a greater surface area for the t o compounds to interact with sorption plays a role in the removal of mib and geosmin however once the sorption sites are saturated this mechanism plays only a minor role if any in supporting the mass transfer towards the active biofilm 3 2 2 volatilisation in order to keep the carriers in suspension and moving around mixing was performed by aeration this could lead to air stripping of the t o compounds the loss of mib and geosmin by volatilisation was determined by comparing the substrate concentrations over one standard hrt 1 2 h in a reactor without carriers but with or without aeration fig 6 shows the percentage removal of mib and geosmin due to volatilisation and aeration volatilisation of the t o compounds without aeration was estimated applying batch testing using glass beakers in order to eliminate sorption on reactor walls losses due to volatilisation were found to be 8 9 of the feed concentration over one hrt the volatility of compounds is described by the henry s constant h which is 5 76 10 5 atm m3 mole for mib and 6 66 10 5 atm m3 mole for geosmin pirbazari et al 1992 compounds with h ranging between 10 3 and 10 2 have been shown to be prone to significant volatilisation stenstrom et al 1989 therefore with an h of 10 5 volatilisation of mib and geosmin would be expected to be minor aeration in comparison to the losses due to volatilisation tripled the removal of mib and geosmin to 24 6 and 27 7 respectively 3 2 3 biodegradation fig 7 shows the results of duplicate biodegradation batch experiments without aeration corrected for volatilisation losses during the experiment no aeration was applied in order to distinguish the biodegradation from the removal due to aeration even without aeration do levels were greater than 85 during the batch test biodegradation rates were calculated based upon a linear regression of the ln of t o concentration divided by the initial t o concentrations of 100 ng l versus time linear regressions all had goodness of fit r2 values greater than 0 97 the reduction of mib and geosmin can therefore be well described as a pseudo first order reaction with rate constants of 1 32 0 06 h 1 for mib and 1 35 0 06 h 1 for geosmin as the concentration of the t o compounds is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the primary substrate doc biodegradation following pseudo first order kinetics in the mbbr process was expected this is in accordance with studies performed in natural water systems westerhoff et al 2005 and using rapid biological sandfilters ho et al 2007 which also observed pseudo first order biodegradation for mib and geosmin the efficient biological removal of mib and geosmin may be related to their molecular structure the inclusion of strong electron donating functional groups makes compounds more readily biodegradable tunkel et al 2000 both mib and geosmin contain a hydroxyl group in their structure monitoring losses due to volatilisation during the batch tests without carriers allowed the calculation of the rate of removal by volatilisation as a pseudo first order rate constant the rate constants for mib and geosmin were similar with 0 04 0 01 h 1 the obtained rate constants for biological degradation and volatilisation losses over time were used to calculate the removal rates at different hrts fig 8 the prediction at hrts of less than 2 h underestimated the removal rates measured at pilot scale this may be explained by the missing contribution of aeration during the batch testing as compared to volatilisation alone for example at 1 2 h hrt the aeration did add 16 6 and 18 7 to mib and geosmin removal at pilot scale respectively these levels are similar to the difference between prediction and pilot scale at 13 for mib and 16 for geosmin at 2 h hrt the prediction without aeration matched with the measured removal rates stenstrom and co authors 1989 found that volatilisation losses for compounds with henry s law constants greater than 10 5 atm m3 mole is insignificant in the presence of high rates of biodegradation therefore air stripping may be negligible during high rates of biological removal achieved in the mbbr i e at hrts greater than 2 h 3 3 application for drinking water treatment biological rapid sand filtration has been shown to be an effective treatment for the control of mib and geosmin during drinking water treatment however drinking water sources are low in nutrients and the coagulation process preceding the biofiltration stage often almost completely removes the phosphate resulting in nutrient deficient conditions additionally pre filter chlorination is often applied to rapid sand filters to increase the manganese removal efficiency resulting in the loss of the biological activity of the filter the mbbr can be placed before the coagulation process as is does not suffer the limitation of headloss and the necessity of backwashing therefore all the nutrients will be available for the biofilm to flourish once established the high t o removal rate of the mbbr treatment will significantly reduce the need for pac dosing for their control high flow rates with corresponding short hrts as low as 20 min could achieve removal rates of at least 60 allowing for small footprints of the reactors as the mbbr technology can be implemented in a variety of different reactor geometries it is compatible for retrofit installation to existing tanks water environment federation 2010 4 conclusions this study demonstrated mbbr treatment to be an effective process for the removal of mib and geosmin during drinking water treatment a long term 5 7 months pilot scale mbbr in combination with batch testing in the laboratory demonstrated the following key findings steady state t o removal was achieved after 3 5 months of operation resulting in 84 4 of mib and 87 6 of geosmin removal increasing hrts resulted in increased t o removal reaching a plateau above about 1 h hrt at least 60 removal efficiency even at high influent concentrations 100 ng l for each mib and geosmin can be achieved at short hrts of 20 30 min biodegradation was the primary removal mechanism in the mbbr process with sorption and air stripping providing some additional removal of mib and geosmin at the typically low t o compound concentrations required in the effluent and hence the reactor the non biological processes will only have limited short term benefits for the overall removal performance biodegradation followed first order kinetics for both mib and geosmin mib and geosmin removal was underestimated by the biodegradation and volatilisation kinetic constants alone adding air stripping losses would be necessitated to enable accurate reactor designs for particular removal requirements acknowledgements the

used by consumers two of the most common taste and odour t o compounds are algal metabolites produced by a range of cyanobacteria namely 2 methylisoborneol mib and geosmin both are non toxic but lead to musty earthy odour and taste at an extremely low threshold i e at low ng l levels ito 1988 young et al 1996 elevated mib and geosmin concentrations e g 30 40 ng l in south east queensland are a regular occurrence in surface waters during the warm summer months particular for sub tropical conditions the presence of t o compounds is a challenge as they are persistent through conventional coagulation flocculation sedimentation and filtration water treatment bruce et al 2002 nerenberg et al 2000 conventional drinking water treatment plants dwtp most commonly use powdered activated carbon for seasonal t o control nerenberg et al 2000 biofiltration has attracted attention as a removal process as it can be a cost effective solution requiring little or no chemical addition and minimum maintenance efforts in addition to being able to improve biological stability of the water and reduce disinfectant demand biological filtration has been shown to simultaneously remove dissolved organic and inorganic compounds lauderdale et al 2012 while there are conflicting reports on the biodegradation rates of mib and geosmin they have been shown to be successfully removed via biological sand and activated carbon filtration during drinking water treatment ho et al 2007 hsieh et al 2010 lundgren et al 1988 mcdowall et al 2007 2009 however in conventional drinking water treatment processes the bio filtration step follows the flocculation sedimentation process which can result in a lack of nutrients particularly phosphorus for optimal biofilter performance lauderdale 2011 to address this issue a nutrient enhanced engineered biofiltration process has been proposed recently to augment the biological activities required to achieve effective t o compound removal lauderdale et al 2012 however this approach bears a risk of nutrient over dosing potentially leading to unwanted biofilm growth in the distribution network situating a rapid biofiltration process before the flocculation sedimentation stage where nutrients would still be present in the raw water would not be practicable due to the relatively high solids concentration in the raw water leading to excessive headloss and backwashing frequency therefore alternative biological processes need to be considered if applied at this location in the treatment train the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr is a biological wastewater treatment process where microorganisms grow as active biofilms on suspended carriers ødegaard 1994 the carriers maximise surface area in the reactors for the biofilm to establish this has the advantage that the reactors have insignificant headloss no need for periodic backwashing and no susceptibility for clogging therefore this simple and compact technology could be placed at the front end of dwtps using raw water as feed for the biofilm to thrive another advantage of using raw water before the coagulation process is the ph as elevated ph can enhance t o removal rittmann and mccarty 2001 when aluminium based coagulations are used care must be taken not to raise the ph above ph 7 8 to avoid the risk of exceeding the soluble aluminium limits lauderdale et al 2016 there is only very limited research on mbbr technology in the drinking water context to date only one study by xiangyang 2009 tested the potential of the mbbr technology for organics and algae removal using sewage and industry impacted river water aimed for drinking water treatment over a three months period they observed at total organic carbon removal of 17 at a ph range of ph 7 8 8 3 to our knowledge there is currently no study reporting on the applicability of the mbbr process for the removal of mib and geosmin during drinking water treatment therefore this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the mbbr treatment for removing both t o compounds to achieve this objective continuous pilot scale mbbr reactors were set up for assessment of the acclimation period and long term removal efficiencies in addition batch tests were performed to elucidate the underlying removal mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale treatment system three pilot scale cylindrical reactors of approximately 50 l were set up at a drinking water treatment plant in parallel and continuously fed with raw water from a surface water reservoir as shown in fig 1 the aeration

solids in the raw water which settled on the bottom of the reactors were drained weekly before sampling occurred 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 continuous flow experiment pilot scale due to the low background levels of mib 5 ng l and geosmin 2 ng l which are levels observed during the colder winter months both compounds were added to the feed water to reach concentrations between 80 and 100 ng l on the day of sampling these levels were chosen as those are elevated concentrations which have been measured at the local water treatment plants during t o events this occurred in a 600 l water reservoir which was protected from sunlight the reactors were fed for a minimum of three hrts with the raw water containing t o compounds before taking the treated water samples in order to monitor that steady state conditions were reached in the reactors nacl was added the amount of nacl added was chosen to increase the conductivity from ambient 196 202 μs cm to around 400 μs cm and only occurred during the sampling events e g once a week during the acclimation period subsequently during experimentation the conductivity was monitored in the mbbr reactors to ensure they had reached the same level as in the feed water reservoir feed water samples of the spiked water reservoir were taken at the beginning midway and at the end of each experiment to monitor for volatilisation losses of the t o compounds as these experiments were undertaken weekly the biofilm on the mbbr carriers experienced a weekly exposure for approximately 12 h to these higher levels of t o compounds while for the remainder of the week only the low background levels were present 2 2 2 biodegradation batch experiment for the biodegradation experiments carriers with an active biofilm after the acclimation

eddy 2003 the doc nh4 n and po4 p were 15 830 and 330 times lower those levels can be higher in other countries for typical aerobic microbial growth a c n p ratio of 100 10 1 has been proposed to be the ideal ratio for cell synthesis lechevallier et al 1991 the c n p ratio in the mbbr feed for this study was approximately 100 3 1 indicating a slight nitrogen deficiency in addition to nutrients microorganisms also require specific ph ranges temperatures and do concentrations for their growth metcalf and eddy 2003 decreased biological activity was reported at low temperatures 10 c moll et al 1999 due to the location in a subtropical climate the temperature was not a limiting factor as the lowest feed water temperature measured was 24 c dependent on the temperature the do ranged between 7 5 and 8 5 mg l in the mbbr reactors the feed water ph showed little variation averaging at ph 7 03 which was in the reported optimal range of ph of 7 9 for the removal of mib rittmann and mccarty 2001 at a ph of less than 7 the degradation potential in biological mib treatment was observed to be substantially less egashira et al 1992 the biological acclimation for mib and geosmin removal was monitored over a 5 7 month period fig 2 shows the evolution of mib and geosmin removal by the mbbr over this timeframe after one week mib and geosmin removal was measured at 46 and 35 respectively during the first 3 5 months of operation geosmin fig 2 a and mib fig 2 b removals continued to increase reaching a plateau at 84 4 and 87 6 respectively while low removal rates were achieved quickly 1 week it took up to 3 5 months to establish a biofilm on the plastic carriers conditioned for t o compound removal for the first 5 months of operation the feed water doc only varied between 8 7 and 11 8 mg l due to a major weather event during the last month of the monitoring period the doc in the feed water increased by 5 mg l doc to 16 4 mg l for several weeks as can be seen in fig 2 the t o removal of the last two sampling events was not impacted by the increased organic loading this implies high stability of the mbbr system and that the microorganisms colonizing the biofilm were well adapted to the source water as compared to wastewater application the biofilm on the carriers in this study it was so thin that is was not visible without microscopy using diversity profiling microbial communities on the mbbr carriers were examined at the phylum class order and family level where those with a relative abundance of 1 were included the predominant phyla were chloroflexi 10 and actinobacteria 6 followed by proteobacteria 4 planctomycetes 3 and acidobacteria 1 at the class level caldilineae and thermoleophilia were the predominant class also planctomycetacia actinobacteria α proteobacteria and β proteobacteria were present 1 2 the major communities at the order level were caldilineales and solirubrobacterales caldilineaceae was the predominant family at 10 while a0839 comamonadaceae holophagaceae planctomycetaceae sandaracinaceae and tm146 showed an abundance of 1 2 however no microbial communities related to mib or geosmin removal reported in the literature were identified at all taxonomic resolutions investigated 3 1 2 impact of hrt fig 3 shows the impact of the hrt on the removal efficiencies of mib and geosmin which was tested after the acclimation period both show a similar behaviour reaching a plateau at 1 h of hrt increasing the hrt from 10 min to 30 min did increase the removal rates by 33 for mib and 24 for geosmin increasing the hrt further to 1 h resulted in a 10 improvement while increasing even further to 2 h hrt only gained an additional removal of 4 given the low substrate concentrations the biofilm based degradation processes on the mbbr carriers are considered to be mass transfer limited which therefore governs the substrate removal performance water environment federation 2010 therefore longer hrts did improve the overall mass transfer of the t o compounds towards the biofilm although the effect becomes less pronounced as the remaining substrate concentrations in the bulk liquid are diminished as the diffusion layer between the biofilm and the bulk liquid is controlled by the hydraulic regime in the reactor a more intensive mixing through higher aeration rates could potentially improve the substrate transfer and hence the degradation rates if required 3 1 3 impact of extended off periods dwtps are regularly shutdown for a day or more as a result of operational issues or routine maintenance to simulate such an extended shutdown period the pilot plant operation was completely stopped no flow and no aeration for an eleven day period fig 4 shows the recovery of mib and geosmin removal capacities following the shutdown period the long shutdown period resulted in do starvation 0 mg l and negatively impacted removal performances one day after restarting operation only 53 and 59 of mib and geosmin removal was observed however after four days of continuous operation the t o removal efficiencies reached levels comparative to those achieved before the shutdown this indicates a high resilience of the biofilm towards starvation conditions to avoid the occurrence of anaerobic conditions it would likely be beneficial to maintain a minimum level of aeration during such shut down periods if possible 3 2 t o compound removal mechanisms in addition to biodegradation sorption and volatilisation via air stripping may be mechanisms contributing to the removal of mib and geosmin during mbbr treatment 3 2 1 sorption sorption of organics to a biofilm is a recognized phenomenon and a requirement for their biodegradation späth et al 1998 batch tests were performed to investigate the sorption of the t o compounds on either the biofilm of the biological active carriers or the high density polyethylene carriers alone fig 5 shows the removal of mib and geosmin from mbbr feed water by the i carriers without biofilm ii carriers with inactivated biofilm and iii carriers with full biological activity over a timeframe of 2 h both mib and geosmin show sorption to the carrier material and the inactivated biofilm fig 5 hydrophobicity can be an influential factor for sorption which is expressed by the octanol water partition coefficient logkow mib and geosmin are both hydrophobic with logkow values of 3 13 and 3 70 respectively pirbazari et al 1992 up until 15 min of contact time sorption was the dominant removal mechanism with biodegradation becoming the predominant removal process beyond that contact time mib reached steady state sorption onto the carrier material and the biofilm within half an hour while geosmin continued to be sorbed slowly beyond the 2 h studied comparing the results of the unused carriers only sorption of geosmin was much greater than that of mib for example after 2 h 56 of the initial geosmin concentration was removed while only 9 of the initial mib concentration has been removed similar behaviour was observed for the sorption onto the biofilm of the carriers with the inactivated biofilm with geosmin sorbing 43 more than mib the greater sorption of geosmin may be related to its greater hydrophobicity another factor contributing to the greater sorption of geosmin may be the lower molecular weight and a flatter molecular structure compared to mib allowing for easier interaction with the biofilm cook et al 2001 and less direct competition with nom molecules a 9 greater geosmin sorption on the biofilm compared to mib was observed also a 12 and 21 greater sorptive removal of mib and geosmin respectively was seen for the carriers supporting a biofilm hence the biofilm may provide a greater surface area for the t o compounds to interact with sorption plays a role in the removal of mib and geosmin however once the sorption sites are saturated this mechanism plays only a minor role if any in supporting the mass transfer towards the active biofilm 3 2 2 volatilisation in order to keep the carriers in suspension and moving around mixing was performed by aeration this could lead to air stripping of the t o compounds the loss of mib and geosmin by volatilisation was determined by comparing the substrate concentrations over one standard hrt 1 2 h in a reactor without carriers but with or without aeration fig 6 shows the percentage removal of mib and geosmin due to volatilisation and aeration volatilisation of the t o compounds without aeration was estimated applying batch testing using glass beakers in order to eliminate sorption on reactor walls losses due to volatilisation were found to be 8 9 of the feed concentration over one hrt the volatility of compounds is described by the henry s constant h which is 5 76 10 5 atm m3 mole for mib and 6 66 10 5 atm m3 mole for geosmin pirbazari et al 1992 compounds with h ranging between 10 3 and 10 2 have been shown to be prone to significant volatilisation stenstrom et al 1989 therefore with an h of 10 5 volatilisation of mib and geosmin would be expected to be minor aeration in comparison to the losses due to volatilisation tripled the removal of mib and geosmin to 24 6 and 27 7 respectively 3 2 3 biodegradation fig 7 shows the results of duplicate biodegradation batch experiments without aeration corrected for volatilisation losses during the experiment no aeration was applied in order to distinguish the biodegradation from the removal due to aeration even without aeration do levels were greater than 85 during the batch test biodegradation rates were calculated based upon a linear regression of the ln of t o concentration divided by the initial t o concentrations of 100 ng l versus time linear regressions all had goodness of fit r2 values greater than 0 97 the reduction of mib and geosmin can therefore be well described as a pseudo first order reaction with rate constants of 1 32 0 06 h 1 for mib and 1 35 0 06 h 1 for geosmin as the concentration of the t o compounds is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the primary substrate doc biodegradation following pseudo first order kinetics in the mbbr process was expected this is in accordance with studies performed in natural water systems westerhoff et al 2005 and using rapid biological sandfilters ho et al 2007 which also observed pseudo first order biodegradation for mib and geosmin the efficient biological removal of mib and geosmin may be related to their molecular structure the inclusion of strong electron donating functional groups makes compounds more readily biodegradable tunkel et al 2000 both mib and geosmin contain a hydroxyl group in their structure monitoring losses due to volatilisation during the batch tests without carriers allowed the calculation of the rate of removal by volatilisation as a pseudo first order rate constant the rate constants for mib and geosmin were similar with 0 04 0 01 h 1 the obtained rate constants for biological degradation and volatilisation losses over time were used to calculate the removal rates at different hrts fig 8 the prediction at hrts of less than 2 h underestimated the removal rates measured at pilot scale this may be explained by the missing contribution of aeration during the batch testing as compared to volatilisation alone for example at 1 2 h hrt the aeration did add 16 6 and 18 7 to mib and geosmin removal at pilot scale respectively these levels are similar to the difference between prediction and pilot scale at 13 for mib and 16 for geosmin at 2 h hrt the prediction without aeration matched with the measured removal rates stenstrom and co authors 1989 found that volatilisation losses for compounds with henry s law constants greater than 10 5 atm m3 mole is insignificant in the presence of high rates of biodegradation therefore air stripping may be negligible during high rates of biological removal achieved in the mbbr i e at hrts greater than 2 h 3 3 application for drinking water treatment biological rapid sand filtration has been shown to be an effective treatment for the control of mib and geosmin during drinking water treatment however drinking water sources are low in nutrients and the coagulation process preceding the biofiltration stage often almost completely removes the phosphate resulting in nutrient deficient conditions additionally pre filter chlorination is often applied to rapid sand filters to increase the manganese removal efficiency resulting in the loss of the biological activity of the filter the mbbr can be placed before the coagulation process as is does not suffer the limitation of headloss and the necessity of backwashing therefore all the nutrients will be available for the biofilm to flourish once established the high t o removal rate of the mbbr treatment will significantly reduce the need for pac dosing for their control high flow rates with corresponding short hrts as low as 20 min could achieve removal rates of at least 60 allowing for small footprints of the reactors as the mbbr technology can be implemented in a variety of different reactor geometries it is compatible for retrofit installation to existing tanks water environment federation 2010 4 conclusions this study demonstrated mbbr treatment to be an effective process for the removal of mib and geosmin during drinking water treatment a long term 5 7 months pilot scale mbbr in combination with batch testing in the laboratory demonstrated the following key findings steady state t o removal was achieved after 3 5 months of operation resulting in 84 4 of mib and 87 6 of geosmin removal increasing hrts resulted in increased t o removal reaching a plateau above about 1 h hrt at least 60 removal efficiency even at high influent concentrations 100 ng l for each mib and geosmin can be achieved at short hrts of 20 30 min biodegradation was the primary removal mechanism in the mbbr process with sorption and air stripping providing some additional removal of mib and geosmin at the typically low t o compound concentrations required in the effluent and hence the reactor the non biological processes will only have limited short term benefits for the overall removal performance biodegradation followed first order kinetics for both mib and geosmin mib and geosmin removal was underestimated by the biodegradation and volatilisation kinetic constants alone adding air stripping losses would be necessitated to enable accurate reactor designs for particular removal requirements acknowledgements the

19163,sustainability and resilience are both key considerations in the design and operation of wastewater systems however there is currently a lack of understanding of the relationship between these two goals and of the effects of increasing resilience on sustainability this paper therefore presents a framework for analysis of the effects of resilience enhancing interventions on sustainability and applies this to an urban wastewater system given that sustainability addresses the long term the framework includes a novel sustainability assessment approach which captures a continuum of potential future conditions and enables identification of tipping points where applicable this method allows a wide range of potential futures to be captured whilst removing the need to develop scenarios or future projections while it may be possible to develop interventions that are beneficial in terms of their effects on both resilience and sustainability the results obtained from the case study demonstrate that implementing measures designed to increase resilience of an integrated urban wastewater system does not guarantee a universal improvement in sustainability therefore when proposing measures to increase resilience the potential effects on sustainability should be considered also it is also shown that the extent of any negative effects on system sustainability can vary significantly depending on future conditions with the case study intervention increasing pump capacity achieving the highest degree of sustainability if rainfall depths or imperviousness in the catchments reduce however trade offs between sustainability indicators are present irrespective of future conditions furthermore while an intervention that enhances resilience may be considered sustainable with respect to specific indicators under current conditions tipping points exist and it will cease to be sustainable if future threat magnitudes exceed these graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban wastewater system sustainability tipping point threat resilience 1 introduction sustainability and resilience are both key considerations in the design and operation of wastewater systems sustainability is a key concern due to factors such as the large quantity of energy and chemicals required shao et al 2017 and there is increasing interest in building resilience in the water sector due to for example legislative drivers e g hm government 2014 and challenges posed by recent extreme events while many different definitions have been used for sustainability ozkaynak et al 2004 it is typically expressed as a set of goals that should be maintained or enhanced for future generations jenks and jones 2010 butler et al 2016 for example defined it as the degree to which the system maintains levels of service in the long term whilst maximizing social economic and environmental goals in addition to meeting these goals sustainable water management strategies should be also future proof haasnoot et al 2011 walker et al 2013 i e effective now and in the future or have the flexibility to adapt to future conditions this includes not just the foreseeable future but also the unforeseen walker et al 2013 which poses a challenge as natural social and technological uncertainties may all affect long term water management haasnoot et al 2011 assessments of sustainability however are typically based on current conditions projections or a limited number of predefined scenarios containing potential future states based on driving pressures such as climate change and do not capture all possibilities resilience defined as the degree to which the system minimizes level of service failure magnitude and duration over its design life when subject to exceptional conditions butler et al 2016 also addresses future performance however the focus here is on performance under extreme events for example quality of wastewater treatment under a shock load to the wastewater treatment plant wwtp as with sustainability though resilience needs to address performance under a range of potential futures including those containing unforeseeable events despite the apparent similarities between resilience and sustainability there is currently limited understanding of the effects of resilience enhancing measures on sustainability while different theories exist on the relationship between resilience and sustainability marchese et al 2018 it has been suggested that sustainability builds upon resilience butler et al 2016 scholz et al 2012 and that increasing the resilience of a system makes it more sustainable marchese et al 2018 given that exceptional conditions may occur over the long term timeframe considered for sustainability resilience is necessary to ensure that the system continues to perform as required into the future and is sustainable however assessments of the sustainability of water systems do not typically incorporate resilience and it is unclear whether increasing resilience alone will increase sustainability or reduce the degree of unsustainability birgani and yazdandoost 2018 for example used resilience and sustainability indicators simultaneously to rank urban drainage plans but did not consider resilience a component of sustainability or investigate the relationship between resilience and sustainability this research therefore aims to investigate whether enhancing the resilience of an urban wastewater system is also beneficial in terms of sustainability given uncertainty in future conditions it also investigates whether tipping points i e magnitudes of future change under which a given intervention becomes or ceases to be the most sustainable option exist to achieve this a framework which incorporates resilience assessment sustainability assessment and tipping point analysis is presented subsequent application to a semi hypothetical integrated urban wastewater system iuws case study demonstrates that the framework can be used to account for the effects of a continuum of scenarios that could occur in the future and analyse the effects of future conditions on the sustainability of a resilience enhancing measure 2 materials and methods 2 1 framework the analysis framework illustrated in fig 1 contains five key elements system characterisation resilience assessment intervention development sustainability assessment and tipping point analysis system characterisation involves identification of system failure modes including appropriate measures of magnitude and ranges for consideration and required levels of service for a defined case study system this provides the information necessary for subsequent resilience assessment and intervention development the sustainability and tipping point analysis components of the framework then provide an evaluation of both the base case and the intervention that has been found to increase resilience and explore the effects of implementing this intervention on the sustainability of the system further detail is given in the following sections 2 2 2 6 2 2 system characterisation 2 2 1 case study system the case study used here is a semi hypothetical iuws which was first presented by schütze et al 2002 and has since been the subject of much research astaraie imani et al 2012 butler and schutze 2005 casal campos et al 2015 fu et al 2008 2009 zacharof et al 2004 it is modelled using simba6 0 ifak 2009 which operates in the matlab simulink environment and integrates the separate component models detailed in the supplementary information a schematic diagram is provided in fig 1 the sewer system contains seven sub catchments four on line pass through storage tanks and a pump at each tank outlet the catchments are simulated using a hydrologic approach with surface and sewer network flows modelled conceptually as a linear cascade of reservoirs nash cascade model nash 1959 the wwtp has an off line pass through storm tank at the inlet and contains a primary clarifier an activated sludge reactor for biological treatment modelled with asm1 henze et al 2000 and a secondary clarifier the wwtp and combined sewer overflows csos discharge into a river of which 45 km is modelled performance is evaluated over a five day period which incorporates a rainfall event with a baseline total depth of 27 mm for further detail on the modelling refer to the supplementary information schütze et al 2002 and butler and schütze 2005 2 2 2 system failure modes potential system failure modes identified for the case study are detailed in table 1 also shown are their measures of magnitude and magnitude ranges for consideration in the following resilience assessment for internal failure modes such as component failure percentage loss of function represents the system failure magnitude in each case loss of function in the range 0 100 is modelled thereby covering the full range of possibilities irrespective of their probability external failure modes identified relate to changes in the sewer influent characteristics and a maximum theoretically possible increase cannot typically be determined the exception here is the percentage increase in vss ss and scod cod ratios for which a maximum stress magnitude is selected so as to provide a maximum ratio of one other upper limits are arbitrarily set to a 100 increase with respect to the base case for the purposes of preliminary analysis but further investigation could explore the effects of extending these limits 2 2 3 levels of service receiving water dissolved oxygen do and un ionized ammonia amm concentrations are chosen to represent the urban wastewater system level of service measures do is selected as it is a good measure of the health of the water body since all higher forms of river life require oxygen butler and davies 2010 un ionized ammonia is also important to monitor since it is particularly toxic to fish and its conversion can exert an oxygen demand as only total ammonia is modelled dynamically in simba un ionized ammonia is estimated using a conversion factor of 0 0195 based on a temperature of 20 c and a ph of 7 7 schütze et al 2002 other potential indicators of water quality include for example temperature ph total suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand kannel et al 2007 however these cannot be extracted from the case study model although evaluation of only do and ammonia is common practice in integrated urban wastewater system studies e g benedetti et al 2013 vanrolleghem et al 2005 additional level of service measures could be considered for other case studies using the proposed framework to provide a more detailed picture of the river water quality a minimum do concentration of 4 mg l dolim and a maximum amm concentration of 0 068 mg l ammlim are required to provide an acceptable level of service this do limit is commonly used in iuws studies e g astaraie imani et al 2012 solvi et al 2006 and is equal to the 1 year return period 1 h limit for salmonid waters i e limit which should not be breached for a 1 h period more than once a year defra 2014 the amm limit is the recommended predicted no effect concentration for freshwater based on the 96 h median lethal concentration for pink salmon johnson et al 2007 failure to comply with either of these limits constitutes a level of service failure failure magnitudes and durations are calculated as follows 1 d o f a i l u r e m a g n i t u d e max 0 d o l i m d o m i n 2 d o f a i l u r e d u r a t i o n t r d o t f d o 3 a m m f a i l u r e m a g n i t u d e max 0 a m m m a x a m m l i m 4 a m m f a i l u r e d u r a t i o n t r a m m t f a m m where domin is the minimum do concentration during the evaluation period ammmax the maximum un ionized ammonia concentration tf do and tf amm the times at which do and amm failures commence and tr do and tr amm the times at which do and amm recovery occur to account for differing do and amm concentrations along the course of the river these measures are calculated for 40 locations along the modelled stretch and the worst i e maximum values used for resilience assessment 2 3 resilience assessment resilience assessment is based on the global resilience analysis gra approach butler et al 2016 diao et al 2016 mugume et al 2015 as illustrated in fig 1a this focuses on system failure modes instead of the threats that may cause them thereby overcoming the challenge of identifying and characterizing all possible threats of which many are unforeseeable and enabling the potential effects of these threats to be captured without needing to identify their root cause in gra level of service failure magnitude and duration are calculated as a function of system failure magnitude this enables the generation of response curves which illustrate the level of service failure magnitude and duration resulting from a wide range of possible system failure magnitudes including those that would be classified as exceptional conditions the area under each response curve calculated using simulations across the range of system failure magnitudes as detailed in section 2 5 1 and the trapezium rule can be considered indicative of the resilience to the corresponding system failure mode a smaller area indicates a lower level of service failure magnitude and duration over a range of conditions and therefore a higher resilience to apply the system failures listed in table 1 it is necessary to decide not only how their magnitude can be varied but also at what time and for how long each stress should be applied for consistency all system failures are assumed to occur throughout the entire simulation period i e recovery of the system due to intervention such as replacement or mending of a failed component is not considered this does not mean however that any level of service failure resulting from the system failure also lasts the entire simulation duration since recovery may be observed as the simulated storm event recedes 2 4 intervention development the system with no design or operational changes i e as described in section 2 2 1 represents the base case evaluation of the base case resilience enables identification of system failure modes to which resilience is lowest and can inform the development of interventions the intervention development can be an iterative process with the intervention modified following assessment of its effects on resilience if sufficient benefits are not observed in the case study resilience to increased sewer influent flow in particular is found to be poor see results in section 3 1 and therefore an increase in the outflow pumping capacity of the storm tank preceding the wwtp tank 7 is proposed so as to increase the volume of flow passed to full treatment this increase is arbitrarily set to 200 from 1 59 ml s to 4 77 ml s so as to ensure benefits are observed although practical considerations may limit the increase that could be achieved in reality 2 5 sustainability assessment in a large complex system with many interdependencies it is hard to know what constitutes complete sustainability due to for example difficulties in identifying every possible social economic and environmental impact as such achieving absolute sustainability may not be considered feasible when evaluating the effects of interventions the concept of sustainability is more easily addressed in the relative sense i e do the interventions cause the system to become more or less sustainable this study therefore evaluates the sustainability of an iuws intervention rather than the absolute sustainability of the iuws if an intervention has a neutral or positive effect on the sustainability of the system then the intervention is sustainable irrespective of the absolute sustainability of the entire system this concept is illustrated in fig 1c where the intervention does not eliminate negative environmental consequences of the system but does have a positive effect on consequences under a range of threat magnitudes that may occur fig 1b shows an alternative response where the sustainability of the intervention is dependent on the threat magnitude in this example the intervention is considered sustainable only if a high threat magnitude is realized the sustainability assessment methodology developed in this study uses response curves in which sustainability indicator values are presented as a function of threat magnitude as illustrated in fig 1b and c this builds upon and complements the gra approach applied in the preceding resilience assessment section 2 3 as in gra this sustainability assessment enables the effects of a continuum of potential future scenarios to be accounted for irrespective of their probability or expected time frame of occurrence and without the need to develop specific predictions or future projections it also captures extreme magnitude events that would be considered unforeseen should they occur the use of threats as the stressor rather than system failures also enables projected scenarios to be mapped onto the results this concept has been used previously in sustainability assessment poff et al 2016 however previous application to sustainability assessment considered only two performance indicators and did not enable evaluation of the relative sustainability of different strategies furthermore the potential effects of resilience enhancing measures on sustainability were not explored to generate the response curves it is necessary to identify relevant threats appropriate ranges of magnitude for these and suitable sustainability indicators these threats may then be modelled individually or simultaneously for a single threat acting alone sustainability indicators are calculated for the iuws with and without intervention under threat magnitudes within the specified range resulting in response curves of the form shown in fig 1b and c for two or more threats acting simultaneously every combination of magnitude for each threat is evaluated therefore the results cannot be presented visually in a two dimensional plot as in fig 1 however the subsequent identification of threat magnitudes threat magnitude combinations under which the intervention improves the sustainability of the system can still be carried out as discussed in section 2 6 consideration of different possible threat magnitudes in this manner helps to address the long term element of sustainability as it enables the effects of a wide range of possible scenarios to be captured without the need for scenario development projections or assigning of probabilities it also eliminates uncertainty associated with generation of projections or scenarios however sustainability under any specific scenario of interest can still be determined from the curves by generating similar response curves for every relevant sustainability indicator and threat combination for both the base case system and system with intervention a detailed picture of the potential social economic and environmental impacts of an intervention can be obtained if a sustainability indicator is improved at a given threat magnitude by implementation of the intervention then the intervention is considered sustainable under that threat magnitude and with respect to that sustainability indicator therefore it is possible to identify specific threat magnitudes under which the intervention is or is not sustainable with respect to each sustainability indicator as assessment of sustainability requires multiple indicators to capture the social economic and environmental elements it is possible that under a specific threat magnitude the intervention may be considered sustainable with respect to some sustainability indicators but unsustainable with respect to others the intervention can only be considered totally sustainable under a given threat magnitude if all sustainability indicators are improved simultaneously 2 5 1 threats wastewater systems may be subject to a host of possible threats in the future including both those that are known and those that are unknown this study addresses four potential known threats with a range of magnitudes as detailed in table 2 other threats that could be included in a more extensive analysis include but are not limited to change in energy prices change in the electricity production emission factor e g due to increased use of renewables and other rainfall changes note that unknown threats may also affect sustainability however by definition these cannot be simulated directly the change in rainfall depth is applied as a multiplier of the baseline rainfall depth series i e the intensity of the rainfall event is altered but the duration unchanged arbitrary magnitude ranges are set for each threat so as to capture a wide range of possibilities irrespective of probability iuws simulations are undertaken at threat magnitude intervals of 10 e g 50 40 40 50 change in population to enable the generation of sustainability indicator response curves only an increase in pump energy factor the energy required to pump a unit volume of wastewater is considered as pumps will not become more efficient than their baseline efficiency assuming they are initially as new unless they are upgraded which would have additional implications for sustainability for the remaining threats both an increase and decrease in magnitude are considered as either may theoretically occur and each may have different effects on sustainability for example impervious surface area could increase or decrease depending on the extent of future housing and green infrastructure development and an intervention that provides improved sustainability for a catchment with high imperviousness may not for one with low imperviousness in this paper to illustrate the concept of sustainability assessment under future threats a maximum of two threats are considered simultaneously however further analysis could investigate additional concurrent threats note that although interdependencies between threats may be present in reality they are considered here as independent variables an increase in population may for example correspond with an increase in impervious catchment area however the relationship between these two threats is not fixed and cannot therefore be modelled furthermore as the model does not encompass pump curves the pump energy factors are considered to be independent of flow changes due to population increase in reality however pump efficiency and therefore the energy factor will vary with flow rate the effects of these interdependencies should be explored in future research 2 5 2 sustainability indicators sustainability is a complex multi dimensional concept lozano oyola et al 2012 thus multiple indicators are required to address social economic and environmental consequences however to assess the sustainability of the intervention not the system it is only necessary to consider indicators affected by the intervention for example indicators of the social sustainability of wastewater treatment technologies include odours noise visual impact and public acceptance molinos senante et al 2014 but installation of additional pumps as in the proposed intervention would be expected to have negligible effect on these this study therefore focusses on economic and environmental sustainability indicators with respect to economic sustainability financial cost capital and operational is the selected indicator whilst in principle social and environmental economics should be incorporated balkema et al 2002 this is challenging and practice most analyses only include financial costs and benefits balkema et al 2002 sets of environmental sustainability indicators used in literature vary but typically address effluent quality sludge production combined sewer overflows and gaseous emissions balkema et al 2002 indicators used in this study are nitrogen n and chemical oxygen demand cod not removed by the wwtp combined sewer overflow cso volume total suspended solids production and greenhouse gas ghg emissions cod removal and n removal have previously been used as indicators for environmental sustainability molinos senante et al 2014 and are important to prevent eutrophication of the receiving water body ma et al 2015 they are expressed in this study as a percentage of the influent load not removed so that for all sustainability indicators a lower value is preferable values for each sustainability indicator are calculated under each threat type and magnitude for both the base case wastewater system and the system with intervention further detail on the calculation of costs and ghg emissions is provided in the supplementary information 2 6 tipping point analysis adaptation tipping points have been explored in many fields and may have physical ecological technical economic societal or political causes kwadijk et al 2010 in the context of climate change for example adaptation tipping points have been defined as the points where the magnitude of climate change is such that the current strategy can no longer meet the pre set objectives gersonius et al 2011 in a more general sense a tipping point may be considered the point at which the magnitude of change is such that the current management strategy can no longer meet its objectives kwadijk et al 2010 instead of evaluating performance under predefined future scenarios a tipping point approach investigates whether or for how long current strategies will continue to be effective whilst tipping points are commonly expressed as a time year e g haasnoot et al 2015 they can also be expressed simply as a magnitude of change as in the above definition in the context of this work this would be the threat magnitude this enables tipping points to be determined without deriving scenarios which relate the threat magnitude to time although the identified tipping point threat magnitude may be mapped onto time based scenarios to estimate when it is expected to occur as in gersonius et al 2012 if the objective is to provide the most sustainable option then the tipping point would be the threat magnitude at which the intervention being evaluated has no net effect on system sustainability and beyond which implementing the intervention would be more sustainable than not as illustrated in fig 1b such a tipping point can only be identified when comparing multiple pre defined design or operational scenarios however and cannot be used to identify the point at which a yet to be decided intervention is required 3 results and discussion 3 1 resilience this section presents the resilience assessment results for the system with and without intervention as described in sections 2 2 1 and 2 4 respectively and demonstrates that the proposed intervention is successful in enhancing resilience gra response curves are generated for the iuws in its base case configuration and with intervention using the system failure modes and level of service measures specified in sections 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 respectively example response curves are provided in fig 3 these illustrate the effects of the intervention on the do and amm failure magnitude and duration calculated using eqs 1 4 under failure of the pump to the primary clarifier system failure mode g this demonstrates that the intervention provides a reduction in failure magnitude and duration under a range of pump failure magnitudes and therefore provides an increase in resilience to this failure mode summary results showing the resilience metric area under the response curve for every system failure mode and level of service measure are given in fig 4 a shorter bar indicates higher resilience to a given failure mode these results show that when considering the receiving water do in particular the intervention provides significant improvement in resilience the do failure magnitude and duration response to every system failure mode is improved by the intervention and do failure magnitude is significantly reduced the intervention is also largely beneficial with respect to amm failure magnitude and duration although resilience is reduced under two failure modes i e increased sewer influent flow a and failure of the activated sludge aeration n detailed results including level of service failure magnitudes and durations calculated under every system failure magnitude and calculation of areas under the response curves i e the resilience metrics shown in fig 4 are provided in the supplementary information 3 2 sustainability response to individual threats fig 5 shows the response of each sustainability indicator to each threat applied singly with threats on the x axes and sustainability indicators on the y axes threat magnitudes which result in the intervention having a lower sustainability indicator value than the base case and under which the intervention is considered sustainable with respect to a given indicator are indicated by grey shading between the response curves note that a reduction in indicator value does not mean that the system is sustainable just that the intervention does not reduce and may increase the degree of sustainability of the system with respect to that indicator for example if operating costs of 400 d are considered sustainable and an intervention reduces costs from 600 d to 500 d it has increased the degree of sustainability decreased the degree of unsustainability but not made the system completely sustainable under current conditions i e all threat magnitudes equal zero increasing pump capacity is not totally sustainable sustainability of the system is increased with respect to two indicators n removal and cso volume but decreased with respect to four conversely however it cannot be argued that maintaining the base case system operation instead is a fully sustainable option under current conditions either as this results in lower n removal and higher cso volume therefore it is evident that trade offs are necessary whether or not the resilience enhancing intervention is applied this is fully expected as use of an indicator approach for sustainability typically results in complex multi objective trade offs within a subjective decision making framework ashley et al 2008 fig 5 shows that proportional change in impervious surface area and rainfall depth result in very similar sustainability indicator responses since both result in an increase in influent to the sewer system however the responses are not identical with respect to tss production increasing the pump capacity provides a very small increase under every threat type and magnitude i e it is not sustainable similarly for cost this is increased by the intervention under every threat type and magnitude since increasing pump capacity incurs capital costs and the results in additional operational costs this cost figure only includes financial costs and the perceived sustainability of the intervention may be improved if social and environmental costs are included since for example the intervention provides significant reduction in cso volume however such accounting is challenging and rarely employed in practice balkema et al 2002 the greatest improvement provided by the intervention is with respect to cso volume substantial reduction is provided at every threat magnitude except those at which cso volume is zero even without the intervention i e no further improvement is possible this is attributed to the greater pump capacity enabling a greater volume of wastewater to be conveyed to full treatment at times of high flow the benefits also typically increase as the threat magnitude increases for example under a 50 change in impervious surface area cso volume is zero irrespective of whether the intervention is applied since the existing pumps have sufficient capacity to convey all flow entering the system however if impervious surface area increases by 50 then the existing pump capacity is insufficient and the intervention is of benefit in this case the cso volume will be 60 lower with the intervention in place than if the base case operation is maintained a reduction from 84 280 m3 to 33 440 m3 due to the additional pumping capacity provided 3 3 sustainability tipping point analysis 3 3 1 under individual threats tipping points for some sustainability indicator and threat combinations can be identified in fig 5 for example under impervious surface area change n removal is improved if impervious surface area does not increase by more than 12 2 since the intervention enables more flow to pass to full treatment hence the intervention is considered sustainable with respect to n removal if impervious surface area does not increase by more than 12 2 reduced n removal beyond this point is attributed to the increased wwtp influent flow rates beyond the design capacity resulting in poor performance of the plant cod removal is better with the intervention than without if impervious surface area decreases by at least 11 2 hence the intervention is considered sustainable with respect to cod removal if impervious surface area decreases by at least 11 2 this is attributed to the wwtp only having capacity to effectively remove cod from the additional flow received as a result of the additional pumping if the total inflow to the sewer system is reduced cso volume is reduced irrespective of change in impervious surface area i e there is no tipping point this is directly attributable to the additional pumping capacity in the system tss production and cost are increased irrespective of change in impervious surface area i e there is no tipping point increased costs are due to the capital and operational costs of increasing the pump capacity and increased tss production is attributed to a greater volume of wastewater and therefore more solids entering the wwtp ghg emissions are reduced if impervious surface area is reduced by at least 15 3 hence the intervention is considered sustainable with respect to ghg emissions only if impervious surface is reduced by at least 15 3 this is primarily attributed to greater nitrogen removal in the wwtp and consequently lower indirect n2o emissions resulting from nitrogen remaining in the sludge this demonstrates again that there are trade offs and that the proposed intervention will not be entirely sustainable under any change in impervious surface area however the number of sustainability indicators improved by the intervention will be maximized if impervious surface area is reduced by at least 15 3 due to the existence of tipping points the number of sustainability indicators improved by the intervention varies with threat magnitude as well as with the type of threat fig 6 shows the number of sustainability indicators improved by the intervention under a range of magnitudes for any threat applied individually note that the indicators are not weighted since application of weights would be subjective and may mask reductions in some indicators change in pump energy factor within the range considered does not alter the number of sustainability indicators improved by the intervention additionally an increase in population of up to 50 the maximum evaluated has no impact on the sustainability of the intervention although a reduction in population of at least 45 4 reduces sustainability due to worsening n removal with respect to the base case the intervention is most sustainable if the rainfall depth decreases by at least 14 8 or impervious surface area by at least 15 3 in which case four of the six sustainability indicators are improved with respect to the base case however it is not completely sustainable under any single threat type or magnitude as at least two sustainability indicator values always worsened the sustainability of the intervention decreases as rainfall depth or impervious surface area increase and it is least sustainable if rainfall depth increases by at least 13 0 or impervious surface area by at least 12 2 in which case five of the six sustainability indicators are worsenedfive sustainability indicators are also worsened by implementation of the intervention if population reduces by at least 45 4 this may be attributed to the reduced influent to the system rendering the additional pumping capacity unnecessary these results illustrate that implementing an intervention which is designed to increase resilience of an iuws does not guarantee a universal improvement in sustainability whilst there are benefits there can also be detrimental effects to some components of sustainability however the extent of these detrimental effects is dependent on what threats and threat magnitudes are realized in the future 3 3 2 under simultaneous threats fig 7 shows the number of sustainability indicators bettered with respect to the base case under two simultaneous threats of varying magnitudes a maximum of five out of six sustainability indicators can be improved and this only occurs under specific scenarios however it is already widely acknowledged that some of the objectives of sustainable wastewater system development can be conflicting and that it is not always possible to find a solution that meets all the sustainability criteria e g balkema et al 2002 as a worst case scenario increasing pump capacity to increase resilience could result in a reduction in sustainability with respect to five out of six indicators interestingly reducing threat magnitudes is shown to not always be entirely beneficial in terms of sustainability for example under a rainfall depth reduction of 20 and a population reduction of 20 implementing the intervention results in four sustainability indicators being bettered with respect to the base case whereas if the population is reduced by a further 10 the number of sustainability indicators bettered drops to three in this instance this is due to the intervention resulting in less cod removal than the base case when population drops by at least 40 the total number of sustainability indicators returns to two when the population drops further however as the intervention then also provides a small reduction in tss production typically fewest sustainability indicator values are improved by the intervention when the magnitude of one or more threats is large positive under any combination of two high magnitude threats a maximum of two sustainability indicators are improved by implementation of the intervention showing that should these conditions be realized the intervention will be largely detrimental to the overall sustainability of the system this demonstrates again that implementing interventions designed to improve resilience does not ensure sustainability and supports the suggestion that resilience is necessary but not sufficient for sustainability butler et al 2016 3 4 discussion when evaluating sustainability under future threats plots of the form shown in figs 6 and 7 are useful because they capture the effects of a wide range of possible future conditions and enable identification of conditions under which an intervention will or will not be sufficiently sustainable it is also possible to map specific scenarios onto these plots to determine how sustainable an intervention will be if they occur and also what the effects might be if projections prove to be inaccurate a similar approach has previously been used for analysis of the effects of drought in a water resources system borgomeo et al 2015 where performance was calculated under a continuum of drought duration and deficit values irrespective of their probability and specific deficit and duration combinations of interest were highlighted to illustrate how these plots can be used to explore the effects of future scenarios that are considered likely fig 8 provides an example in which population change and impervious surface area change projections provided by the office for national statistics 2015 and environment agency respectively 2013a b are mapped onto the corresponding results from fig 7 this shows that under the range of population change values projected the number of sustainability indicators bettered by the intervention is dependent only on the change in impervious surface area i e for a given impervious surface area change scenario the intervention would be just as sustainable if the highest population change projection is realized as if the lowest is realized it also illustrates that if population change projections prove to be inaccurate this will have no effect on the sustainability of the intervention unless the population reduces significantly conversely uncertainty in impervious surface area change may affect sustainability as a small departure from the projected scenarios can alter the number of sustainability indicators bettered these results also illustrate that despite increasing the resilience of the iuws increasing pump capacity will only improve sustainability with respect to a maximum of four out of six indicators under any projected future scenario an improvement in all six sustainability indicators cannot be achieved under the range of threat magnitudes evaluated and whilst an improvement in five can be achieved under two of the projected impervious surface area change scenarios it can only be achieved if population change is also significantly lower i e a large reduction in population than projected such threat dependencies are not revealed by scenario analysis as evidenced in the mapping of projected changes above and are a key output of the framework developed in this paper it is widely acknowledged that there are similarities between the concepts of resilience and sustainability and it has been suggested that increasing the resilience of a system makes the system more sustainable marchese et al 2018 these results clearly demonstrate however that implementing an intervention designed to increase resilience may be detrimental to some components of sustainability even under projected future conditions and should more extreme threats than anticipated occur then there may be significant detriment to sustainability there may be greater benefit and fewer negative consequences under a limited number of scenarios however these do not coincide with projected future conditions this supports the theory that although resilience is a prerequisite for sustainability it does not guarantee sustainability butler et al 2016 and that providing resilience does not guarantee sustainability 4 conclusions using a new analysis framework and a case study iuws this study explores the effects of a resilience enhancing intervention on sustainability under future threats by expressing sustainability as a function of threat magnitude the framework enables a wide range of potential futures to be addressed without the need to develop scenarios or future projections thereby providing a more complete understanding of sustainability than can be obtained with a scenario based methodology this also provides a new approach to dealing with uncertainty in projections the key conclusions drawn from this study are as follows while analysis of a single intervention would be insufficient to prove that enhancing resilience does always increase sustainability this study shows that increasing pump capacity in the iuws increases resilience but does not provide a universal increase in sustainability under any future scenario therefore it demonstrates more generally that intervening to increase resilience does not ensure increased sustainability and that when proposing measures to increase resilience the potential effects on sustainability should be considered also it is revealed that the sustainability of an iuws intervention can differ greatly under different threat types and magnitudes therefore the degree of sustainability achieved will be dependent on future conditions in the case of the iuws investigated increasing pump capacity will be most sustainable only when rainfall depths or imperviousness in the catchments reduce while an intervention that enhances resilience may be considered sustainable with respect to specific indicators under current conditions tipping points exist and it will cease to be sustainable if future threat magnitudes exceed these trade offs between sustainability indicators are observed in the case study irrespective of future conditions under all threat magnitudes improvement in one or more sustainability indicators resulting from a resilience enhancing intervention always corresponds with a negative effect with respect to at least one

19163,sustainability and resilience are both key considerations in the design and operation of wastewater systems however there is currently a lack of understanding of the relationship between these two goals and of the effects of increasing resilience on sustainability this paper therefore presents a framework for analysis of the effects of resilience enhancing interventions on sustainability and applies this to an urban wastewater system given that sustainability addresses the long term the framework includes a novel sustainability assessment approach which captures a continuum of potential future conditions and enables identification of tipping points where applicable this method allows a wide range of potential futures to be captured whilst removing the need to develop scenarios or future projections while it may be possible to develop interventions that are beneficial in terms of their effects on both resilience and sustainability the results obtained from the case study demonstrate that implementing measures designed to increase resilience of an integrated urban wastewater system does not guarantee a universal improvement in sustainability therefore when proposing measures to increase resilience the potential effects on sustainability should be considered also it is also shown that the extent of any negative effects on system sustainability can vary significantly depending on future conditions with the case study intervention increasing pump capacity achieving the highest degree of sustainability if rainfall depths or imperviousness in the catchments reduce however trade offs between sustainability indicators are present irrespective of future conditions furthermore while an intervention that enhances resilience may be considered sustainable with respect to specific indicators under current conditions tipping points exist and it will cease to be sustainable if future threat magnitudes exceed these graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban wastewater system sustainability tipping point threat resilience 1 introduction sustainability and resilience are both key considerations in the design and operation of wastewater systems sustainability is a key concern due to factors such as the large quantity of energy and chemicals required shao et al 2017 and there is increasing interest in building resilience in the water sector due to for example legislative drivers e g hm government 2014 and challenges posed by recent extreme events while many different definitions have been used for sustainability ozkaynak et al 2004 it is typically expressed as a set of goals that should be maintained or enhanced for future generations jenks and jones 2010 butler et al 2016 for example defined it as the degree to which the system maintains levels of service in the long term whilst maximizing social economic and environmental goals in addition to meeting these goals sustainable water management strategies should be also future proof haasnoot et al 2011 walker et al 2013 i e effective now and in the future or have the flexibility to adapt to future conditions this includes not just the foreseeable future but also the unforeseen walker et al 2013 which poses a challenge as natural social and technological uncertainties may all affect long term water management haasnoot et al 2011 assessments of sustainability however are typically based on current conditions projections or a limited number of predefined scenarios containing potential future states based on driving pressures such as climate change and do not capture all possibilities resilience defined as the degree to which the system minimizes level of service failure magnitude and duration over its design life when subject to exceptional conditions butler et al 2016 also addresses future performance however the focus here is on performance under extreme events for example quality of wastewater treatment under a shock load to the wastewater treatment plant wwtp as with sustainability though resilience needs to address performance under a range of potential futures including those containing unforeseeable events despite the apparent similarities between resilience and sustainability there is currently limited understanding of the effects of resilience enhancing measures on sustainability while different theories exist on the relationship between resilience and sustainability marchese et al 2018 it has been suggested that sustainability builds upon resilience butler et al 2016 scholz et al 2012 and that increasing the resilience of a system makes it more sustainable marchese et al 2018 given that exceptional conditions may occur over the long term timeframe considered for sustainability resilience is necessary to ensure that the system continues to perform as required into the future and is sustainable however assessments of the sustainability of water systems do not typically incorporate resilience and it is unclear whether increasing resilience alone will increase sustainability or reduce the degree of unsustainability birgani and yazdandoost 2018 for example used resilience and sustainability indicators simultaneously to rank urban drainage plans but did not consider resilience a component of sustainability or investigate the relationship between resilience and sustainability this research therefore aims to investigate whether enhancing the resilience of an urban wastewater system is also beneficial in terms of sustainability given uncertainty in future conditions it also investigates whether tipping points i e magnitudes of future change under which a given intervention becomes or ceases to be the most sustainable option exist to achieve this a framework which incorporates resilience assessment sustainability assessment and tipping point analysis is presented subsequent application to a semi hypothetical integrated urban wastewater system iuws case study demonstrates that the framework can be used to account for the effects of a continuum of scenarios that could occur in the future and analyse the effects of future conditions on the sustainability of a resilience enhancing measure 2 materials and methods 2 1 framework the analysis framework illustrated in fig 1 contains five key elements system characterisation resilience assessment intervention development sustainability assessment and tipping point analysis system characterisation involves identification of system failure modes including appropriate measures of magnitude and ranges for consideration and required levels of service for a defined case study system this provides the information necessary for subsequent resilience assessment and intervention development the sustainability and tipping point analysis components of the framework then provide an evaluation of both the base case and the intervention that has been found to increase resilience and explore the effects of implementing this intervention on the sustainability of the system further detail is given in the following sections 2 2 2 6 2 2 system characterisation 2 2 1 case study system the case study used here is a semi hypothetical iuws which was first presented by schütze et al 2002 and has since been the subject of much research astaraie imani et al 2012 butler and schutze 2005 casal campos et al 2015 fu et al 2008 2009 zacharof et al 2004 it is modelled using simba6 0 ifak 2009 which operates in the matlab simulink environment and integrates the separate component models detailed in the supplementary information a schematic diagram is provided in fig 1 the sewer system contains seven sub catchments four on line pass through storage tanks and a pump at each tank outlet the catchments are simulated using a hydrologic approach with surface and sewer network flows modelled conceptually as a linear cascade of reservoirs nash cascade model nash 1959 the wwtp has an off line pass through storm tank at the inlet and contains a primary clarifier an activated sludge reactor for biological treatment modelled with asm1 henze et al 2000 and a secondary clarifier the wwtp and combined sewer overflows csos discharge into a river of which 45 km is modelled performance is evaluated over a five day period which incorporates a rainfall event with a baseline total depth of 27 mm for further detail on the modelling refer to the supplementary information schütze et al 2002 and butler and schütze 2005 2 2 2 system failure modes potential system failure modes identified for the case study are detailed in table 1 also shown are their measures of magnitude and magnitude ranges for consideration in the following resilience assessment for internal failure modes such as component failure percentage loss of function represents the system failure magnitude in each case loss of function in the range 0 100 is modelled thereby covering the full range of possibilities irrespective of their probability external failure modes identified relate to changes in the sewer influent characteristics and a maximum theoretically possible increase cannot typically be determined the exception here is the percentage increase in vss ss and scod cod ratios for which a maximum stress magnitude is selected so as to provide a maximum ratio of one other upper limits are arbitrarily set to a 100 increase with respect to the base case for the purposes of preliminary analysis but further investigation could explore the effects of extending these limits 2 2 3 levels of service receiving water dissolved oxygen do and un ionized ammonia amm concentrations are chosen to represent the urban wastewater system level of service measures do is selected as it is a good measure of the health of the water body since all higher forms of river life require oxygen butler and davies 2010 un ionized ammonia is also important to monitor since it is particularly toxic to fish and its conversion can exert an oxygen demand as only total ammonia is modelled dynamically in simba un ionized ammonia is estimated using a conversion factor of 0 0195 based on a temperature of 20 c and a ph of 7 7 schütze et al 2002 other potential indicators of water quality include for example temperature ph total suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand kannel et al 2007 however these cannot be extracted from the case study model although evaluation of only do and ammonia is common practice in integrated urban wastewater system studies e g benedetti et al 2013 vanrolleghem et al 2005 additional level of service measures could be considered for other case studies using the proposed framework to provide a more detailed picture of the river water quality a minimum do concentration of 4 mg l dolim and a maximum amm concentration of 0 068 mg l ammlim are required to provide an acceptable level of service this do limit is commonly used in iuws studies e g astaraie imani et al 2012 solvi et al 2006 and is equal to the 1 year return period 1 h limit for salmonid waters i e limit which should not be breached for a 1 h period more than once a year defra 2014 the amm limit is the recommended predicted no effect concentration for freshwater based on the 96 h median lethal concentration for pink salmon johnson et al 2007 failure to comply with either of these limits constitutes a level of service failure failure magnitudes and durations are calculated as follows 1 d o f a i l u r e m a g n i t u d e max 0 d o l i m d o m i n 2 d o f a i l u r e d u r a t i o n t r d o t f d o 3 a m m f a i l u r e m a g n i t u d e max 0 a m m m a x a m m l i m 4 a m m f a i l u r e d u r a t i o n t r a m m t f a m m where domin is the minimum do concentration during the evaluation period ammmax the maximum un ionized ammonia concentration tf do and tf amm the times at which do and amm failures commence and tr do and tr amm the times at which do and amm recovery occur to account for differing do and amm concentrations along the course of the river these measures are calculated for 40 locations along the modelled stretch and the worst i e maximum values used for resilience assessment 2 3 resilience assessment resilience assessment is based on the global resilience analysis gra approach butler et al 2016 diao et al 2016 mugume et al 2015 as illustrated in fig 1a this focuses on system failure modes instead of the threats that may cause them thereby overcoming the challenge of identifying and characterizing all possible threats of which many are unforeseeable and enabling the potential effects of these threats to be captured without needing to identify their root cause in gra level of service failure magnitude and duration are calculated as a function of system failure magnitude this enables the generation of response curves which illustrate the level of service failure magnitude and duration resulting from a wide range of possible system failure magnitudes including those that would be classified as exceptional conditions the area under each response curve calculated using simulations across the range of system failure magnitudes as detailed in section 2 5 1 and the trapezium rule can be considered indicative of the resilience to the corresponding system failure mode a smaller area indicates a lower level of service failure magnitude and duration over a range of conditions and therefore a higher resilience to apply the system failures listed in table 1 it is necessary to decide not only how their magnitude can be varied but also at what time and for how long each stress should be applied for consistency all system failures are assumed to occur throughout the entire simulation period i e recovery of the system due to intervention such as replacement or mending of a failed component is not considered this does not mean however that any level of service failure resulting from the system failure also lasts the entire simulation duration since recovery may be observed as the simulated storm event recedes 2 4 intervention development the system with no design or operational changes i e as described in section 2 2 1 represents the base case evaluation of the base case resilience enables identification of system failure modes to which resilience is lowest and can inform the development of interventions the intervention development can be an iterative process with the intervention modified following assessment of its effects on resilience if sufficient benefits are not observed in the case study resilience to increased sewer influent flow in particular is found to be poor see results in section 3 1 and therefore an increase in the outflow pumping capacity of the storm tank preceding the wwtp tank 7 is proposed so as to increase the volume of flow passed to full treatment this increase is arbitrarily set to 200 from 1 59 ml s to 4 77 ml s so as to ensure benefits are observed although practical considerations may limit the increase that could be achieved in reality 2 5 sustainability assessment in a large complex system with many interdependencies it is hard to know what constitutes complete sustainability due to for example difficulties in identifying every possible social economic and environmental impact as such achieving absolute sustainability may not be considered feasible when evaluating the effects of interventions the concept of sustainability is more easily addressed in the relative sense i e do the interventions cause the system to become more or less sustainable this study therefore evaluates the sustainability of an iuws intervention rather than the absolute sustainability of the iuws if an intervention has a neutral or positive effect on the sustainability of the system then the intervention is sustainable irrespective of the absolute sustainability of the entire system this concept is illustrated in fig 1c where the intervention does not eliminate negative environmental consequences of the system but does have a positive effect on consequences under a range of threat magnitudes that may occur fig 1b shows an alternative response where the sustainability of the intervention is dependent on the threat magnitude in this example the intervention is considered sustainable only if a high threat magnitude is realized the sustainability assessment methodology developed in this study uses response curves in which sustainability indicator values are presented as a function of threat magnitude as illustrated in fig 1b and c this builds upon and complements the gra approach applied in the preceding resilience assessment section 2 3 as in gra this sustainability assessment enables the effects of a continuum of potential future scenarios to be accounted for irrespective of their probability or expected time frame of occurrence and without the need to develop specific predictions or future projections it also captures extreme magnitude events that would be considered unforeseen should they occur the use of threats as the stressor rather than system failures also enables projected scenarios to be mapped onto the results this concept has been used previously in sustainability assessment poff et al 2016 however previous application to sustainability assessment considered only two performance indicators and did not enable evaluation of the relative sustainability of different strategies furthermore the potential effects of resilience enhancing measures on sustainability were not explored to generate the response curves it is necessary to identify relevant threats appropriate ranges of magnitude for these and suitable sustainability indicators these threats may then be modelled individually or simultaneously for a single threat acting alone sustainability indicators are calculated for the iuws with and without intervention under threat magnitudes within the specified range resulting in response curves of the form shown in fig 1b and c for two or more threats acting simultaneously every combination of magnitude for each threat is evaluated therefore the results cannot be presented visually in a two dimensional plot as in fig 1 however the subsequent identification of threat magnitudes threat magnitude combinations under which the intervention improves the sustainability of the system can still be carried out as discussed in section 2 6 consideration of different possible threat magnitudes in this manner helps to address the long term element of sustainability as it enables the effects of a wide range of possible scenarios to be captured without the need for scenario development projections or assigning of probabilities it also eliminates uncertainty associated with generation of projections or scenarios however sustainability under any specific scenario of interest can still be determined from the curves by generating similar response curves for every relevant sustainability indicator and threat combination for both the base case system and system with intervention a detailed picture of the potential social economic and environmental impacts of an intervention can be obtained if a sustainability indicator is improved at a given threat magnitude by implementation of the intervention then the intervention is considered sustainable under that threat magnitude and with respect to that sustainability indicator therefore it is possible to identify specific threat magnitudes under which the intervention is or is not sustainable with respect to each sustainability indicator as assessment of sustainability requires multiple indicators to capture the social economic and environmental elements it is possible that under a specific threat magnitude the intervention may be considered sustainable with respect to some sustainability indicators but unsustainable with respect to others the intervention can only be considered totally sustainable under a given threat magnitude if all sustainability indicators are improved simultaneously 2 5 1 threats wastewater systems may be subject to a host of possible threats in the future including both those that are known and those that are unknown this study addresses four potential known threats with a range of magnitudes as detailed in table 2 other threats that could be included in a more extensive analysis include but are not limited to change in energy prices change in the electricity production emission factor e g due to increased use of renewables and other rainfall changes note that unknown threats may also affect sustainability however by definition these cannot be simulated directly the change in rainfall depth is applied as a multiplier of the baseline rainfall depth series i e the intensity of the rainfall event is altered but the duration unchanged arbitrary magnitude ranges are set for each threat so as to capture a wide range of possibilities irrespective of probability iuws simulations are undertaken at threat magnitude intervals of 10 e g 50 40 40 50 change in population to enable the generation of sustainability indicator response curves only an increase in pump energy factor the energy required to pump a unit volume of wastewater is considered as pumps will not become more efficient than their baseline efficiency assuming they are initially as new unless they are upgraded which would have additional implications for sustainability for the remaining threats both an increase and decrease in magnitude are considered as either may theoretically occur and each may have different effects on sustainability for example impervious surface area could increase or decrease depending on the extent of future housing and green infrastructure development and an intervention that provides improved sustainability for a catchment with high imperviousness may not for one with low imperviousness in this paper to illustrate the concept of sustainability assessment under future threats a maximum of two threats are considered simultaneously however further analysis could investigate additional concurrent threats note that although interdependencies between threats may be present in reality they are considered here as independent variables an increase in population may for example correspond with an increase in impervious catchment area however the relationship between these two threats is not fixed and cannot therefore be modelled furthermore as the model does not encompass pump curves the pump energy factors are considered to be independent of flow changes due to population increase in reality however pump efficiency and therefore the energy factor will vary with flow rate the effects of these interdependencies should be explored in future research 2 5 2 sustainability indicators sustainability is a complex multi dimensional concept lozano oyola et al 2012 thus multiple indicators are required to address social economic and environmental consequences however to assess the sustainability of the intervention not the system it is only necessary to consider indicators affected by the intervention for example indicators of the social sustainability of wastewater treatment technologies include odours noise visual impact and public acceptance molinos senante et al 2014 but installation of additional pumps as in the proposed intervention would be expected to have negligible effect on these this study therefore focusses on economic and environmental sustainability indicators with respect to economic sustainability financial cost capital and operational is the selected indicator whilst in principle social and environmental economics should be incorporated balkema et al 2002 this is challenging and practice most analyses only include financial costs and benefits balkema et al 2002 sets of environmental sustainability indicators used in literature vary but typically address effluent quality sludge production combined sewer overflows and gaseous emissions balkema et al 2002 indicators used in this study are nitrogen n and chemical oxygen demand cod not removed by the wwtp combined sewer overflow cso volume total suspended solids production and greenhouse gas ghg emissions cod removal and n removal have previously been used as indicators for environmental sustainability molinos senante et al 2014 and are important to prevent eutrophication of the receiving water body ma et al 2015 they are expressed in this study as a percentage of the influent load not removed so that for all sustainability indicators a lower value is preferable values for each sustainability indicator are calculated under each threat type and magnitude for both the base case wastewater system and the system with intervention further detail on the calculation of costs and ghg emissions is provided in the supplementary information 2 6 tipping point analysis adaptation tipping points have been explored in many fields and may have physical ecological technical economic societal or political causes kwadijk et al 2010 in the context of climate change for example adaptation tipping points have been defined as the points where the magnitude of climate change is such that the current strategy can no longer meet the pre set objectives gersonius et al 2011 in a more general sense a tipping point may be considered the point at which the magnitude of change is such that the current management strategy can no longer meet its objectives kwadijk et al 2010 instead of evaluating performance under predefined future scenarios a tipping point approach investigates whether or for how long current strategies will continue to be effective whilst tipping points are commonly expressed as a time year e g haasnoot et al 2015 they can also be expressed simply as a magnitude of change as in the above definition in the context of this work this would be the threat magnitude this enables tipping points to be determined without deriving scenarios which relate the threat magnitude to time although the identified tipping point threat magnitude may be mapped onto time based scenarios to estimate when it is expected to occur as in gersonius et al 2012 if the objective is to provide the most sustainable option then the tipping point would be the threat magnitude at which the intervention being evaluated has no net effect on system sustainability and beyond which implementing the intervention would be more sustainable than not as illustrated in fig 1b such a tipping point can only be identified when comparing multiple pre defined design or operational scenarios however and cannot be used to identify the point at which a yet to be decided intervention is required 3 results and discussion 3 1 resilience this section presents the resilience assessment results for the system with and without intervention as described in sections 2 2 1 and 2 4 respectively and demonstrates that the proposed intervention is successful in enhancing resilience gra response curves are generated for the iuws in its base case configuration and with intervention using the system failure modes and level of service measures specified in sections 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 respectively example response curves are provided in fig 3 these illustrate the effects of the intervention on the do and amm failure magnitude and duration calculated using eqs 1 4 under failure of the pump to the primary clarifier system failure mode g this demonstrates that the intervention provides a reduction in failure magnitude and duration under a range of pump failure magnitudes and therefore provides an increase in resilience to this failure mode summary results showing the resilience metric area under the response curve for every system failure mode and level of service measure are given in fig 4 a shorter bar indicates higher resilience to a given failure mode these results show that when considering the receiving water do in particular the intervention provides significant improvement in resilience the do failure magnitude and duration response to every system failure mode is improved by the intervention and do failure magnitude is significantly reduced the intervention is also largely beneficial with respect to amm failure magnitude and duration although resilience is reduced under two failure modes i e increased sewer influent flow a and failure of the activated sludge aeration n detailed results including level of service failure magnitudes and durations calculated under every system failure magnitude and calculation of areas under the response curves i e the resilience metrics shown in fig 4 are provided in the supplementary information 3 2 sustainability response to individual threats fig 5 shows the response of each sustainability indicator to each threat applied singly with threats on the x axes and sustainability indicators on the y axes threat magnitudes which result in the intervention having a lower sustainability indicator value than the base case and under which the intervention is considered sustainable with respect to a given indicator are indicated by grey shading between the response curves note that a reduction in indicator value does not mean that the system is sustainable just that the intervention does not reduce and may increase the degree of sustainability of the system with respect to that indicator for example if operating costs of 400 d are considered sustainable and an intervention reduces costs from 600 d to 500 d it has increased the degree of sustainability decreased the degree of unsustainability but not made the system completely sustainable under current conditions i e all threat magnitudes equal zero increasing pump capacity is not totally sustainable sustainability of the system is increased with respect to two indicators n removal and cso volume but decreased with respect to four conversely however it cannot be argued that maintaining the base case system operation instead is a fully sustainable option under current conditions either as this results in lower n removal and higher cso volume therefore it is evident that trade offs are necessary whether or not the resilience enhancing intervention is applied this is fully expected as use of an indicator approach for sustainability typically results in complex multi objective trade offs within a subjective decision making framework ashley et al 2008 fig 5 shows that proportional change in impervious surface area and rainfall depth result in very similar sustainability indicator responses since both result in an increase in influent to the sewer system however the responses are not identical with respect to tss production increasing the pump capacity provides a very small increase under every threat type and magnitude i e it is not sustainable similarly for cost this is increased by the intervention under every threat type and magnitude since increasing pump capacity incurs capital costs and the results in additional operational costs this cost figure only includes financial costs and the perceived sustainability of the intervention may be improved if social and environmental costs are included since for example the intervention provides significant reduction in cso volume however such accounting is challenging and rarely employed in practice balkema et al 2002 the greatest improvement provided by the intervention is with respect to cso volume substantial reduction is provided at every threat magnitude except those at which cso volume is zero even without the intervention i e no further improvement is possible this is attributed to the greater pump capacity enabling a greater volume of wastewater to be conveyed to full treatment at times of high flow the benefits also typically increase as the threat magnitude increases for example under a 50 change in impervious surface area cso volume is zero irrespective of whether the intervention is applied since the existing pumps have sufficient capacity to convey all flow entering the system however if impervious surface area increases by 50 then the existing pump capacity is insufficient and the intervention is of benefit in this case the cso volume will be 60 lower with the intervention in place than if the base case operation is maintained a reduction from 84 280 m3 to 33 440 m3 due to the additional pumping capacity provided 3 3 sustainability tipping point analysis 3 3 1 under individual threats tipping points for some sustainability indicator and threat combinations can be identified in fig 5 for example under impervious surface area change n removal is improved if impervious surface area does not increase by more than 12 2 since the intervention enables more flow to pass to full treatment hence the intervention is considered sustainable with respect to n removal if impervious surface area does not increase by more than 12 2 reduced n removal beyond this point is attributed to the increased wwtp influent flow rates beyond the design capacity resulting in poor performance of the plant cod removal is better with the intervention than without if impervious surface area decreases by at least 11 2 hence the intervention is considered sustainable with respect to cod removal if impervious surface area decreases by at least 11 2 this is attributed to the wwtp only having capacity to effectively remove cod from the additional flow received as a result of the additional pumping if the total inflow to the sewer system is reduced cso volume is reduced irrespective of change in impervious surface area i e there is no tipping point this is directly attributable to the additional pumping capacity in the system tss production and cost are increased irrespective of change in impervious surface area i e there is no tipping point increased costs are due to the capital and operational costs of increasing the pump capacity and increased tss production is attributed to a greater volume of wastewater and therefore more solids entering the wwtp ghg emissions are reduced if impervious surface area is reduced by at least 15 3 hence the intervention is considered sustainable with respect to ghg emissions only if impervious surface is reduced by at least 15 3 this is primarily attributed to greater nitrogen removal in the wwtp and consequently lower indirect n2o emissions resulting from nitrogen remaining in the sludge this demonstrates again that there are trade offs and that the proposed intervention will not be entirely sustainable under any change in impervious surface area however the number of sustainability indicators improved by the intervention will be maximized if impervious surface area is reduced by at least 15 3 due to the existence of tipping points the number of sustainability indicators improved by the intervention varies with threat magnitude as well as with the type of threat fig 6 shows the number of sustainability indicators improved by the intervention under a range of magnitudes for any threat applied individually note that the indicators are not weighted since application of weights would be subjective and may mask reductions in some indicators change in pump energy factor within the range considered does not alter the number of sustainability indicators improved by the intervention additionally an increase in population of up to 50 the maximum evaluated has no impact on the sustainability of the intervention although a reduction in population of at least 45 4 reduces sustainability due to worsening n removal with respect to the base case the intervention is most sustainable if the rainfall depth decreases by at least 14 8 or impervious surface area by at least 15 3 in which case four of the six sustainability indicators are improved with respect to the base case however it is not completely sustainable under any single threat type or magnitude as at least two sustainability indicator values always worsened the sustainability of the intervention decreases as rainfall depth or impervious surface area increase and it is least sustainable if rainfall depth increases by at least 13 0 or impervious surface area by at least 12 2 in which case five of the six sustainability indicators are worsenedfive sustainability indicators are also worsened by implementation of the intervention if population reduces by at least 45 4 this may be attributed to the reduced influent to the system rendering the additional pumping capacity unnecessary these results illustrate that implementing an intervention which is designed to increase resilience of an iuws does not guarantee a universal improvement in sustainability whilst there are benefits there can also be detrimental effects to some components of sustainability however the extent of these detrimental effects is dependent on what threats and threat magnitudes are realized in the future 3 3 2 under simultaneous threats fig 7 shows the number of sustainability indicators bettered with respect to the base case under two simultaneous threats of varying magnitudes a maximum of five out of six sustainability indicators can be improved and this only occurs under specific scenarios however it is already widely acknowledged that some of the objectives of sustainable wastewater system development can be conflicting and that it is not always possible to find a solution that meets all the sustainability criteria e g balkema et al 2002 as a worst case scenario increasing pump capacity to increase resilience could result in a reduction in sustainability with respect to five out of six indicators interestingly reducing threat magnitudes is shown to not always be entirely beneficial in terms of sustainability for example under a rainfall depth reduction of 20 and a population reduction of 20 implementing the intervention results in four sustainability indicators being bettered with respect to the base case whereas if the population is reduced by a further 10 the number of sustainability indicators bettered drops to three in this instance this is due to the intervention resulting in less cod removal than the base case when population drops by at least 40 the total number of sustainability indicators returns to two when the population drops further however as the intervention then also provides a small reduction in tss production typically fewest sustainability indicator values are improved by the intervention when the magnitude of one or more threats is large positive under any combination of two high magnitude threats a maximum of two sustainability indicators are improved by implementation of the intervention showing that should these conditions be realized the intervention will be largely detrimental to the overall sustainability of the system this demonstrates again that implementing interventions designed to improve resilience does not ensure sustainability and supports the suggestion that resilience is necessary but not sufficient for sustainability butler et al 2016 3 4 discussion when evaluating sustainability under future threats plots of the form shown in figs 6 and 7 are useful because they capture the effects of a wide range of possible future conditions and enable identification of conditions under which an intervention will or will not be sufficiently sustainable it is also possible to map specific scenarios onto these plots to determine how sustainable an intervention will be if they occur and also what the effects might be if projections prove to be inaccurate a similar approach has previously been used for analysis of the effects of drought in a water resources system borgomeo et al 2015 where performance was calculated under a continuum of drought duration and deficit values irrespective of their probability and specific deficit and duration combinations of interest were highlighted to illustrate how these plots can be used to explore the effects of future scenarios that are considered likely fig 8 provides an example in which population change and impervious surface area change projections provided by the office for national statistics 2015 and environment agency respectively 2013a b are mapped onto the corresponding results from fig 7 this shows that under the range of population change values projected the number of sustainability indicators bettered by the intervention is dependent only on the change in impervious surface area i e for a given impervious surface area change scenario the intervention would be just as sustainable if the highest population change projection is realized as if the lowest is realized it also illustrates that if population change projections prove to be inaccurate this will have no effect on the sustainability of the intervention unless the population reduces significantly conversely uncertainty in impervious surface area change may affect sustainability as a small departure from the projected scenarios can alter the number of sustainability indicators bettered these results also illustrate that despite increasing the resilience of the iuws increasing pump capacity will only improve sustainability with respect to a maximum of four out of six indicators under any projected future scenario an improvement in all six sustainability indicators cannot be achieved under the range of threat magnitudes evaluated and whilst an improvement in five can be achieved under two of the projected impervious surface area change scenarios it can only be achieved if population change is also significantly lower i e a large reduction in population than projected such threat dependencies are not revealed by scenario analysis as evidenced in the mapping of projected changes above and are a key output of the framework developed in this paper it is widely acknowledged that there are similarities between the concepts of resilience and sustainability and it has been suggested that increasing the resilience of a system makes the system more sustainable marchese et al 2018 these results clearly demonstrate however that implementing an intervention designed to increase resilience may be detrimental to some components of sustainability even under projected future conditions and should more extreme threats than anticipated occur then there may be significant detriment to sustainability there may be greater benefit and fewer negative consequences under a limited number of scenarios however these do not coincide with projected future conditions this supports the theory that although resilience is a prerequisite for sustainability it does not guarantee sustainability butler et al 2016 and that providing resilience does not guarantee sustainability 4 conclusions using a new analysis framework and a case study iuws this study explores the effects of a resilience enhancing intervention on sustainability under future threats by expressing sustainability as a function of threat magnitude the framework enables a wide range of potential futures to be addressed without the need to develop scenarios or future projections thereby providing a more complete understanding of sustainability than can be obtained with a scenario based methodology this also provides a new approach to dealing with uncertainty in projections the key conclusions drawn from this study are as follows while analysis of a single intervention would be insufficient to prove that enhancing resilience does always increase sustainability this study shows that increasing pump capacity in the iuws increases resilience but does not provide a universal increase in sustainability under any future scenario therefore it demonstrates more generally that intervening to increase resilience does not ensure increased sustainability and that when proposing measures to increase resilience the potential effects on sustainability should be considered also it is revealed that the sustainability of an iuws intervention can differ greatly under different threat types and magnitudes therefore the degree of sustainability achieved will be dependent on future conditions in the case of the iuws investigated increasing pump capacity will be most sustainable only when rainfall depths or imperviousness in the catchments reduce while an intervention that enhances resilience may be considered sustainable with respect to specific indicators under current conditions tipping points exist and it will cease to be sustainable if future threat magnitudes exceed these trade offs between sustainability indicators are observed in the case study irrespective of future conditions under all threat magnitudes improvement in one or more sustainability indicators resulting from a resilience enhancing intervention always corresponds with a negative effect with respect to at least one

19164,although measures to minimize legionella colonization in sanitary hot water installations are well established there is little evidence of their long term effectiveness in hospital buildings during an 8 year period hot water in a large hospital building was sampled monthly in areas with suitable dimensioning and recirculation and in areas with dead legs and low use taps in the former areas the percentage of legionella negative samples was 83 2 when the temperature was 55 64 9 when between 50 1 c and 54 0 c and 51 6 when 50 c p for trend 0 001 in the highest temperature group no samples with 103 cfu l were observed in poorly designed areas only 44 7 of samples were negative and 28 9 presented 103 cfu l although reaching 55 c in these areas multivariate analysis showed that if hot water supplies were not used daily the risk of legionella colonization was greater than two fold odds ratio 2 84 95 confidence interval 1 26 6 41 and the risk of finding legionella concentrations 103 cfu l was more than three fold odds ratio 3 18 95 confidence interval 1 36 7 46 regardless the temperature these findings indicate that the effectiveness of maintaining sanitary hot water at a minimum temperature of 55 c is significantly better than that at 50 c for the environmental control of legionella but only in installations with suitable dimensioning and recirculation in installations that do not meet these conditions high temperatures alone result in insufficient control graphical abstract image 1 keywords legionella control measures water temperature hospital water network outlets flushing 1 introduction hospital acquired legionellosis is a preventable disease via specific measures applied in water installations within buildings the impact of this disease on hospitalized patients is a matter of concern because of the substantially higher mortality in comparison with the cases acquired in the community jespersen et al 2010 minimizing legionella colonization in sanitary hot water systems is frequently achieved by maintaining temperatures at safe levels however regulations and technical guidelines differ regarding the minimum required threshold in europe some regulations set this threshold at 50 c circulaire interministerielle nº dgs dsc dguhc dge dppr 126 2007 health protection surveillance centre 2009 ecdc 2017 while others postulate that the optimal temperature is 55 c dvgw german technical and scientific association for gas and water 2004 health and safety executive 2013 real decreto 865 2003 spanish legionella legislation dates from 2003 real decreto 865 2003 and prescribes that hot water temperatures at the points of use of high risk installations should be above 50 c however the new spanish standards for legionella prevention and control in facilities published in 2017 point out that the recommended temperature for hospitals is 55 c asociación española de normalización 2017 the association between water temperature and the growth of legionella is well established by the findings of studies conducted in simulated installations farhat et al 2010 buse and ashbolt 2011 and in residential buildings borella et al 2004 mathys et al 2008 however in hospital buildings the use of temperature in hot water systems for legionella control has certain limitations firstly due to the special risk of admitted patients the temperature of the circulating hot water must be high enough to ensure that is free of the microorganism this need is limited by the risk of scalding injuries and as a general rule it is considered to be unsafe having temperatures of 60 c at the end points health and safety executive 2013 secondly the hot water installations in hospitals are particularly complex and specially in old buildings there may be deficiencies in both the design and the state of the piping materials many healthcare facilities have installed additional continuous disinfection systems such as ionization stout and yu 2003 thus the temperature of the hot water can be maintained at a range between 50 c and 55 c but it remains to be proven which the best cut off is this uncertainty is reflected in the discrepancies observed in the regulations for legionella control although it may seem that this temperature difference is not relevant consequences in the risk of nosocomial legionnaires disease in real settings can be considerable in addition to temperature other factors that contribute to minimize the proliferation of legionella include the characteristics uses and maintenance of hot water installations studies performed in water supply simulations show that legionella proliferates easily in stagnant water because it favors the growth of biofilm ciesielski et al 1984 rogers et al 1994 lipphaus et al 2014 therefore recommendations for the prevention of legionellosis encourage minimizing this phenomenon by the regular flushing of taps which are not frequently used but there is no consensus on whether this measure should be performed daily health protection surveillance centre 2009 or weekly real decreto 865 2003 health and safety executive 2013 asociación española de normalización 2017 ecdc 2017 up to now studies performed in hospital buildings aimed at analizyng the long term effectivenes of hot water temperature as the solely continuous disinfection method for legionella control are scarce borau et al 2000 darelid et al 2002 further the benefits of the daily flushing of low use taps in the hospital setting have not been described until recently in only one study totaro et al 2018 the main objective of this study was to determine the best temperature to be maintained in hospital hot water systems to reach an optimum control of legionella colonization secondly the study analyzes the relative role of the frequency of use of hot water and other characteristics of the sanitary water installation on legionella control the context of the study was a large high complexity hospital building where continuous disinfection systems other than temperature had never been used 2 methods 2 1 setting and study design this is an eight year longitudinal study performed from may 2005 to july 2013 at the bellvitge university hospital a 789 bed teaching hospital located in the southern metropolitan area of barcelona catalonia the center accepts referrals for more than two million people requiring high complexity procedures except for hematological pediatric and obstetric patients 2 2 hospital building and hot water system the bellvitge university hospital was inaugurated in 1973 the hospital building has a vertical disposal with three towers of different heights 19 13 and 9 floors and a central tower of communication between them hospitalization units are located in these vertical areas the lowest four floors have annexed facilities to the towers with a horizontal design these facilities do not have admitted patients and correspond with the operating room emergencies department laboratories radiology endoscopy unit pharmacy department and administrative areas fig 1 shows a schematic drawing of the building each hospitalization unit has two common use showers which are used daily with a high turnover because most rooms do not have a shower in the restroom because of the vertical design of the building and the location of showers and toilets the distance between the vertical mains and the points of use was about 50 cm vertical mains fed a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 10 showers recirculation loops were connected at the end of the vertical mains during the study period original mains and distribution rings of stainless steel were progressively replaced with polypropylene in the three towers by contrast in the horizontal dependencies many showers and wash basin taps were infrequently used at the beginning of the study it was revealed that some parts of the installation were improperly designed showing dead legs and deficiencies in the recirculation of hot water throughout the study the hot water mains were progressively refurbished the general policy for the low use taps and showers was to remove the whole installation or if not possible to uninstall the hot water input maintaining only the cold water supply 2 3 hot water temperature during the study period water was heated in two independent pasteurization units where it reached a temperature of 70 c for a minimum of 3 min one for the hospitalization units from the ninth floor to the top floor and another one for the horizontal areas and for the hospitalization areas from the basement floor to the eighth floor the temperature coming out was the same for both systems the pasteurization unites were installed in 2004 and replaced the original hot water accumulators lópez et al 2006 initially the hot water temperature in peripheral outlets was maintained at a minimum of 50 c following the guidelines of the spanish regulation however in june 2007 it was decided to increase this temperature at a minimum of 55 c because the microbiological surveillance of water showed a suboptimal control of legionella colonization in the system the acceptable delay before reaching the minimum required temperature 50 c or 55 c at the points of use was 1 min the study period was stopped in july 2013 because in august 2013 an additional continuous disinfection system based on chlorine dioxide would be installed in the horizontal areas in order maintain a chemical disinfectant in this part of the hot water network 2 4 hot water sampling hot water was cultured on a monthly basis during the study period the sampling criteria and the sampling method were adapted from those specified in the spanish regulation real decreto 865 2003 sampling criteria differed between the hospitalization units and the horizontal areas in the hospitalization units the sampling was rotary in order to achieve the maximum representation of the points of use to whom patients were directly exposed samples were mainly obtained in showers except for intensive care units where wash basin taps were preferred by contrast in horizontal areas a convenience sampling was performed analyzing points of use in dead legs and low use taps dead legs were identified as those parts of the network leading to outlets which were not used low use taps were defined as those that were not used on a daily basis the objective of this convenience sampling was to reveal the colonization status of the worse points in the water system with the aim of making the necessary improvements samples were obtained according the spanish regulation a sterile dracon swab was used to recover the biofilm and the water was collected in a sterile 1000 ml polyethylene vessel first the biofilm was recovered with the swab then the hot water was opened to capture the first 100 ml and the swab was introduced in the vessel finally the vessel was completely filled the temperature of the samples was taken immediately after filling the container the processing was carried out in the laboratory of the barcelona public health agency according to the european standards une en iso 11731 98 the same day after collection the water samples were concentrated by filtration 0 2 μm pore size policarbonate filter millipore billerica ma usa and resuspended in 5 ml of the original sample water by vortexing and sonicating for 10 min four selective glycine vancomycin polymyxin cycloheximide gvpc agar plates oxoid ltd basingstoke hampshire united kingdom were seeded from each sample i direct sample with acid pretreatment and ii concentrated sample without pretreatment iii concentrated sample with acid pretreatment and iv concentrated sample with heat pretreatment the plates were incubated at 36 1 c for 10 days in a moist co2 enriched atmosphere and read from day 3rd with a microscope presumptive legionella colonies were subcultured on bcye with cysteine and cye cysteine free media oxoid and incubated at 36 1 c for 48 h an agglutination test oxoid confirmed the identification of the l pneumophila and determined the serogroup 1 for l pneumophila 2 5 study variables and statistical analysis the water temperature in the container the type of point of use shower or faucet and its geographical code were recorded for identification purposes for the analysis of the association between temperature and legionella growth three temperature groups were considered 50 c 50 1 54 9 c and 55 c each point of use was classified according to its frequency of use as daily use or not daily use the categories were established based on the information provided by the responsible area and whether the area was closed during the weekends the information related to the renewal of the mains and distribution rings of the hot water installation was retrospectively recorded according to that each point of use was classified as associated to the original installation or the renewed installation for the comparison of proportions the chi square test or fisher s exact test were used as well as chi square test for trend in the case of ordinary variables the relative role of the frequency of use of hot water and other characteristics of the sanitary water installation was first addressed by bivariate analysis multivariate analysis using logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals 95 ci used two dependent variables positive result for legionella yes or no and high concentration of legionella 103 cfu l or 103 cfu l the free distribution software r was used for statistical analysis r core team 2013 3 results a total of 399 samples were obtained from may 2005 to july 2013 of which 251 corresponded to the rotary sampling at the hospitalization units and 148 to the convenience sampling at the horizontal areas characteristics of sampled points are summarized in table 1 the differences observed are due to the different sampling criteria employed in hospitalization units and in the horizontal areas most samples obtained in the hospitalization units from not renewed distribution lines corresponded to the earlier years of the study by contrast in horizontal areas samples from not renewed distribution lines were obtained during all the study period showers in hospitalization units were sampled repeatedly during the 8 years of the study the number of showers sampled was 52 and the number of samples was 231 therefore each shower was sampled about 4 times during the study period in horizontal areas the number of outlets sampled was 95 during the study period hot water was uninstalled in 35 outlets whereas 42 outlets were completely removed overall legionella was isolated in 67 samples in the hospitalization units 26 7 all of them being l pneumophila serogroups 2 14 except for two samples of l pneumophila serogroup 1 in the horizontal areas 99 samples were positive for legionella 66 9 here l pneumophila serogroups 2 14 was present in 98 samples legionella non pneumophila in 4 samples and l pneumophila serogroup 1 in 1 sample 57 of samples in hospitalization units and 26 of samples in horizontal areas had a temperature 55 c table 2 in the hospitalization units the mean temperatures were 48 3 c in the group 50 c 53 2 c in the group with a temperature between 50 1 c and 54 9 c and 56 4 c in the group 55 c in horizontal areas the means were 45 2 c 51 3 c and 55 9 c respectively these differences were not significant in the hospitalization units the percentage of negative samples was higher in the temperature group 55 c 83 2 than in the group with a temperature between 50 1 c and 54 9 c 64 9 and in the group with a temperature 50 c 51 6 these differences showed a significant trend among the three temperature groups table 2 also in the highest group of temperature the majority of positive samples had a low concentration of legionella remarkably no sample showed concentrations above 103 cfu l on the contrary in the horizontal areas the absence of legionella did not present a significant trend in the three temperature groups table 2 although the percentage of negative samples was higher in the temperature group 55 c 44 7 than in the group with a temperature between 50 1 c and 54 9 c 29 0 and in the group with a temperature 50 c 29 2 no significant differences were found p 0 235 in these areas although reaching temperatures 55 c nearly one third of the samples still presented concentrations of legionella above 103 cfu l when analyzing the role of factors other than temperature in the hospitalization units none of them was significantly associated with the growth of legionella in horizontal areas the bivariate analysis showed that faucets with occasional use were associated with the presence of legionella occasional use 58 1 vs daily use 41 9 p 0 009 table 3 faucets with occasional use presented legionella concentrations 103 cfu l in more than 40 of the occasions the percentage of positive samples was higher in showers than in taps 76 1 vs 59 3 p 0 03 however it was considered that this result could be a confounder because the percentage of low use points was significantly greater in showers than in taps data not shown the results of the logistic regression analysis table 4 indicated that the risk of legionella recovering in a hot water point of use was 2 46 times 95 ci 1 04 5 83 higher when the temperature was 55 c and 2 84 times 95 ci 1 26 6 41 higher when the frequency of use was not daily when the growth of a concentration 103 cfu l was considered as the dependent variable the low frequency of use presented an adjusted odds ratio of 3 18 95 ci 1 36 7 42 and an association was also found with the type of terminal point of use in this model the level of temperature was not associated with higher concentrations of legionella the inclusion of the renewal of the installation as a third explanatory variable did not introduce significant changes 4 discussion our findings indicate that the effectiveness of maintaining sanitary hot water at a minimum temperature of 55 c is significantly better than that at 50 c for the environmental control of legionella but only in installations with suitable dimensioning and recirculation in installations that do not meet these conditions high temperatures alone result in insufficient control the presence of legionella in this type of installation is significantly associated with a low frequency of installation use studies analyzing long term results after maintaining high temperatures in hospital hot water systems as the solely disinfection method show similar findings to ours but are scarce darelid et al 2002 published a ten year longitudinal study in which after a nosocomial outbreak of legionnaire s disease hot water temperature was kept above 55 c as the sole disinfection measure after implementing this measure legionella was isolated in 30 of 251 12 cultured hospital water samples a concise communication borau et al 2000 reported that no nosocomial cases of legionellosis were detected in a hospital for a period of seven years after maintaining the hot water temperature at 55 c however only 33 water samples were analyzed during the study period another seven year longitudinal study described the improvement in legionella colonization after increasing the temperature of hot water tanks from 50 c to 65 c providing a water temperature over 50 c at most of the outlets blanc et al 2005 but in this case ozonation and ionization were used concomitantly as a continuous disinfection method short duration studies also describe significant reductions in the extent of colonization by legionella after the establishment of temperatures exceeding 55 c kusnetsov et al 2003 völker and kistemann 2015 bédard et al 2015 these results are consistent with reports examining the relationship between temperature and proliferation of legionella under laboratory conditions cervero aragó et al 2015 in addition it is well known that the time required to reduce 90 of a population of l pneumophila is approximately 3 h when exposed to a temperature of 50 c while the time is reduced to 20 min when the temperature is 55 c dennis et al 1984 stout et al 1986 extrapolating these data from the actual conditions of the facilities it can be deduced that if the hot water temperature stays above 55 c the population of legionella present in the aqueous phase of a pipeline would be eliminated more quickly thus reducing the probability of exposure to the microorganism when the water is used with regard to the regular flushing of taps which are not frequently used there is no consensus concerning the optimal frequency legionella control guidelines in europe ecdc 2017 real decreto 865 2003 and in spain real decreto 865 2003 asociación española de normalización 2017 indicate that low use faucets and showers should be flushed once a week national guidelines for the control of legionellosis in ireland state that as a general rule all outlets should be flushed at least once per week at full flow except for high risk areas in hospitals where flushing on a daily basis should become part of the daily cleaning process health protection surveillance centre 2009 the uk s health and safety executive 2013 specifies that when outlets are not in regular use weekly flushing can significantly reduce the number of legionella discharged from the outlet however risk assessment may indicate the need for more frequent flushing where there is a more susceptible population present e g in hospitals or nursing homes our data conclude that if the frequency of use is lower than daily the risk of isolating legionella is multiplied by more than two regardless of the temperature a fact that would support the need for daily flushing is that when not in use the temperature of the hot water in a pipe dramatically decreases until equaling the same temperature at the room in only 20 min offering favorable thermal conditions for the proliferation

flow taps installation in proximity to dead legs before the installation legionella was detected in all points although the hot water network was continuously disinfected with chloride dioxide after implementing the flushing of the taps every 2 h legionella only persisted in 1 point we can thus infer that flushing low use faucets only once a week would not be sufficient to ensure adequate sanitation another controversial aspect is the role of the terminal point as a legionella amplifier it has been demonstrated that electronic eye faucets are more frequently colonized with legionella than manually driven taps halabi et al 2001 sydnor et al 2012 aerators are also a source of waterborne microorganisms in hospitals cristina et al 2014 our findings indicate that at equal temperature and frequency of use manually operated faucets have an increased risk of being colonized with high concentrations of legionella compared to the showers it appears that once the point of use is contaminated there is an increased risk of having high concentrations in the taps compared with the showers this may occur because faucets are difficult to disinfect whereas showers heads can be easily replaced in our particular case it was established that all shower heads were replaced every 6 months as a routine measure included in the risk management plan for legionella prevention our study has some limitations firstly the sampling method does not allow us to differentiate between point of use colonization and hot water network colonization because pre flushing biofilm and post flushing water were included in the same container according to the spanish regulations moreover this sampling method does not allow us to compare water samples with biofilm samples separately an alternative to culture methods for legionella detection in water is real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr which detects culturable viable but not culturable and dead impaired l pneumophila this method could not be used in our study because culture is the only method admitted by the spanish regulations secondly the temperatures considered were those of the samples which certainly were lower than the temperatures achieved in the general network and the recirculation loops finally the improvement measures introduced over the study period in particular the elimination of dead legs and low use points have not been analyzed because of their removal it was not possible to repeat samples of the same point despite these limitations our results provide new evidence for the prevention of legionellosis in large high complexity hospital buildings in particular the importance of properly monitoring the temperature of sanitary hot water as a basic continuous disinfection method should be emphasized installations should ensure proper recirculation otherwise they may be permanently colonized with legionella despite reaching high temperatures removing low use points and dead legs not only has an impact on the microbiological safety of the water but also in the optimization of the energy resources of the building as a final conclusion more studies are needed to better understand how legionella control measures work in real scenarios but there are serious difficulties for performing well designed studies due to the complex interactions of the different related factors 5

19164,although measures to minimize legionella colonization in sanitary hot water installations are well established there is little evidence of their long term effectiveness in hospital buildings during an 8 year period hot water in a large hospital building was sampled monthly in areas with suitable dimensioning and recirculation and in areas with dead legs and low use taps in the former areas the percentage of legionella negative samples was 83 2 when the temperature was 55 64 9 when between 50 1 c and 54 0 c and 51 6 when 50 c p for trend 0 001 in the highest temperature group no samples with 103 cfu l were observed in poorly designed areas only 44 7 of samples were negative and 28 9 presented 103 cfu l although reaching 55 c in these areas multivariate analysis showed that if hot water supplies were not used daily the risk of legionella colonization was greater than two fold odds ratio 2 84 95 confidence interval 1 26 6 41 and the risk of finding legionella concentrations 103 cfu l was more than three fold odds ratio 3 18 95 confidence interval 1 36 7 46 regardless the temperature these findings indicate that the effectiveness of maintaining sanitary hot water at a minimum temperature of 55 c is significantly better than that at 50 c for the environmental control of legionella but only in installations with suitable dimensioning and recirculation in installations that do not meet these conditions high temperatures alone result in insufficient control graphical abstract image 1 keywords legionella control measures water temperature hospital water network outlets flushing 1 introduction hospital acquired legionellosis is a preventable disease via specific measures applied in water installations within buildings the impact of this disease on hospitalized patients is a matter of concern because of the substantially higher mortality in comparison with the cases acquired in the community jespersen et al 2010 minimizing legionella colonization in sanitary hot water systems is frequently achieved by maintaining temperatures at safe levels however regulations and technical guidelines differ regarding the minimum required threshold in europe some regulations set this threshold at 50 c circulaire interministerielle nº dgs dsc dguhc dge dppr 126 2007 health protection surveillance centre 2009 ecdc 2017 while others postulate that the optimal temperature is 55 c dvgw german technical and scientific association for gas and water 2004 health and safety executive 2013 real decreto 865 2003 spanish legionella legislation dates from 2003 real decreto 865 2003 and prescribes that hot water temperatures at the points of use of high risk installations should be above 50 c however the new spanish standards for legionella prevention and control in facilities published in 2017 point out that the recommended temperature for hospitals is 55 c asociación española de normalización 2017 the association between water temperature and the growth of legionella is well established by the findings of studies conducted in simulated installations farhat et al 2010 buse and ashbolt 2011 and in residential buildings borella et al 2004 mathys et al 2008 however in hospital buildings the use of temperature in hot water systems for legionella control has certain limitations firstly due to the special risk of admitted patients the temperature of the circulating hot water must be high enough to ensure that is free of the microorganism this need is limited by the risk of scalding injuries and as a general rule it is considered to be unsafe having temperatures of 60 c at the end points health and safety executive 2013 secondly the hot water installations in hospitals are particularly complex and specially in old buildings there may be deficiencies in both the design and the state of the piping materials many healthcare facilities have installed additional continuous disinfection systems such as ionization stout and yu 2003 thus the temperature of the hot water can be maintained at a range between 50 c and 55 c but it remains to be proven which the best cut off is this uncertainty is reflected in the discrepancies observed in the regulations for legionella control although it may seem that this temperature difference is not relevant consequences in the risk of nosocomial legionnaires disease in real settings can be considerable in addition to temperature other factors that contribute to minimize the proliferation of legionella include the characteristics uses and maintenance of hot water installations studies performed in water supply simulations show that legionella proliferates easily in stagnant water because it favors the growth of biofilm ciesielski et al 1984 rogers et al 1994 lipphaus et al 2014 therefore recommendations for the prevention of legionellosis encourage minimizing this phenomenon by the regular flushing of taps which are not frequently used but there is no consensus on whether this measure should be performed daily health protection surveillance centre 2009 or weekly real decreto 865 2003 health and safety executive 2013 asociación española de normalización 2017 ecdc 2017 up to now studies performed in hospital buildings aimed at analizyng the long term effectivenes of hot water temperature as the solely continuous disinfection method for legionella control are scarce borau et al 2000 darelid et al 2002 further the benefits of the daily flushing of low use taps in the hospital setting have not been described until recently in only one study totaro et al 2018 the main objective of this study was to determine the best temperature to be maintained in hospital hot water systems to reach an optimum control of legionella colonization secondly the study analyzes the relative role of the frequency of use of hot water and other characteristics of the sanitary water installation on legionella control the context of the study was a large high complexity hospital building where continuous disinfection systems other than temperature had never been used 2 methods 2 1 setting and study design this is an eight year longitudinal study performed from may 2005 to july 2013 at the bellvitge university hospital a 789 bed teaching hospital located in the southern metropolitan area of barcelona catalonia the center accepts referrals for more than two million people requiring high complexity procedures except for hematological pediatric and obstetric patients 2 2 hospital building and hot water system the bellvitge university hospital was inaugurated in 1973 the hospital building has a vertical disposal with three towers of different heights 19 13 and 9 floors and a central tower of communication between them hospitalization units are located in these vertical areas the lowest four floors have annexed facilities to the towers with a horizontal design these facilities do not have admitted patients and correspond with the operating room emergencies department laboratories radiology endoscopy unit pharmacy department and administrative areas fig 1 shows a schematic drawing of the building each hospitalization unit has two common use showers which are used daily with a high turnover because most rooms do not have a shower in the restroom because of the vertical design of the building and the location of showers and toilets the distance between the vertical mains and the points of use was about 50 cm vertical mains fed a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 10 showers recirculation loops were connected at the end of the vertical mains during the study period original mains and distribution rings of stainless steel were progressively replaced with polypropylene in the three towers by contrast in the horizontal dependencies many showers and wash basin taps were infrequently used at the beginning of the study it was revealed that some parts of the installation were improperly designed showing dead legs and deficiencies in the recirculation of hot water throughout the study the hot water mains were progressively refurbished the general policy for the low use taps and showers was to remove the whole installation or if not possible to uninstall the hot water input maintaining only the cold water supply 2 3 hot water temperature during the study period water was heated in two independent pasteurization units where it reached a temperature of 70 c for a minimum of 3 min one for the hospitalization units from the ninth floor to the top floor and another one for the horizontal areas and for the hospitalization areas from the basement floor to the eighth floor the temperature coming out was the same for both systems the pasteurization unites were installed in 2004 and replaced the original hot water accumulators lópez et al 2006 initially the hot water temperature in peripheral outlets was maintained at a minimum of 50 c following the guidelines of the spanish regulation however in june 2007 it was decided to increase this temperature at a minimum of 55 c because the microbiological surveillance of water showed a suboptimal control of legionella colonization in the system the acceptable delay before reaching the minimum required temperature 50 c or 55 c at the points of use was 1 min the study period was stopped in july 2013 because in august 2013 an additional continuous disinfection system based on chlorine dioxide would be installed in the horizontal areas in order maintain a chemical disinfectant in this part of the hot water network 2 4 hot water sampling hot water was cultured on a monthly basis during the study period the sampling criteria and the sampling method were adapted from those specified in the spanish regulation real decreto 865 2003 sampling criteria differed between the hospitalization units and the horizontal areas in the hospitalization units the sampling was rotary in order to achieve the maximum representation of the points of use to whom patients were directly exposed samples were mainly obtained in showers except for intensive care units where wash basin taps were preferred by contrast in horizontal areas a convenience sampling was performed analyzing points of use in dead legs and low use taps dead legs were identified as those parts of the network leading to outlets which were not used low use taps were defined as those that were not used on a daily basis the objective of this convenience sampling was to reveal the colonization status of the worse points in the water system with the aim of making the necessary improvements samples were obtained according the spanish regulation a sterile dracon swab was used to recover the biofilm and the water was collected in a sterile 1000 ml polyethylene vessel first the biofilm was recovered with the swab then the hot water was opened to capture the first 100 ml and the swab was introduced in the vessel finally the vessel was completely filled the temperature of the samples was taken immediately after filling the container the processing was carried out in the laboratory of the barcelona public health agency according to the european standards une en iso 11731 98 the same day after collection the water samples were concentrated by filtration 0 2 μm pore size policarbonate filter millipore billerica ma usa and resuspended in 5 ml of the original sample water by vortexing and sonicating for 10 min four selective glycine vancomycin polymyxin cycloheximide gvpc agar plates oxoid ltd basingstoke hampshire united kingdom were seeded from each sample i direct sample with acid pretreatment and ii concentrated sample without pretreatment iii concentrated sample with acid pretreatment and iv concentrated sample with heat pretreatment the plates were incubated at 36 1 c for 10 days in a moist co2 enriched atmosphere and read from day 3rd with a microscope presumptive legionella colonies were subcultured on bcye with cysteine and cye cysteine free media oxoid and incubated at 36 1 c for 48 h an agglutination test oxoid confirmed the identification of the l pneumophila and determined the serogroup 1 for l pneumophila 2 5 study variables and statistical analysis the water temperature in the container the type of point of use shower or faucet and its geographical code were recorded for identification purposes for the analysis of the association between temperature and legionella growth three temperature groups were considered 50 c 50 1 54 9 c and 55 c each point of use was classified according to its frequency of use as daily use or not daily use the categories were established based on the information provided by the responsible area and whether the area was closed during the weekends the information related to the renewal of the mains and distribution rings of the hot water installation was retrospectively recorded according to that each point of use was classified as associated to the original installation or the renewed installation for the comparison of proportions the chi square test or fisher s exact test were used as well as chi square test for trend in the case of ordinary variables the relative role of the frequency of use of hot water and other characteristics of the sanitary water installation was first addressed by bivariate analysis multivariate analysis using logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals 95 ci used two dependent variables positive result for legionella yes or no and high concentration of legionella 103 cfu l or 103 cfu l the free distribution software r was used for statistical analysis r core team 2013 3 results a total of 399 samples were obtained from may 2005 to july 2013 of which 251 corresponded to the rotary sampling at the hospitalization units and 148 to the convenience sampling at the horizontal areas characteristics of sampled points are summarized in table 1 the differences observed are due to the different sampling criteria employed in hospitalization units and in the horizontal areas most samples obtained in the hospitalization units from not renewed distribution lines corresponded to the earlier years of the study by contrast in horizontal areas samples from not renewed distribution lines were obtained during all the study period showers in hospitalization units were sampled repeatedly during the 8 years of the study the number of showers sampled was 52 and the number of samples was 231 therefore each shower was sampled about 4 times during the study period in horizontal areas the number of outlets sampled was 95 during the study period hot water was uninstalled in 35 outlets whereas 42 outlets were completely removed overall legionella was isolated in 67 samples in the hospitalization units 26 7 all of them being l pneumophila serogroups 2 14 except for two samples of l pneumophila serogroup 1 in the horizontal areas 99 samples were positive for legionella 66 9 here l pneumophila serogroups 2 14 was present in 98 samples legionella non pneumophila in 4 samples and l pneumophila serogroup 1 in 1 sample 57 of samples in hospitalization units and 26 of samples in horizontal areas had a temperature 55 c table 2 in the hospitalization units the mean temperatures were 48 3 c in the group 50 c 53 2 c in the group with a temperature between 50 1 c and 54 9 c and 56 4 c in the group 55 c in horizontal areas the means were 45 2 c 51 3 c and 55 9 c respectively these differences were not significant in the hospitalization units the percentage of negative samples was higher in the temperature group 55 c 83 2 than in the group with a temperature between 50 1 c and 54 9 c 64 9 and in the group with a temperature 50 c 51 6 these differences showed a significant trend among the three temperature groups table 2 also in the highest group of temperature the majority of positive samples had a low concentration of legionella remarkably no sample showed concentrations above 103 cfu l on the contrary in the horizontal areas the absence of legionella did not present a significant trend in the three temperature groups table 2 although the percentage of negative samples was higher in the temperature group 55 c 44 7 than in the group with a temperature between 50 1 c and 54 9 c 29 0 and in the group with a temperature 50 c 29 2 no significant differences were found p 0 235 in these areas although reaching temperatures 55 c nearly one third of the samples still presented concentrations of legionella above 103 cfu l when analyzing the role of factors other than temperature in the hospitalization units none of them was significantly associated with the growth of legionella in horizontal areas the bivariate analysis showed that faucets with occasional use were associated with the presence of legionella occasional use 58 1 vs daily use 41 9 p 0 009 table 3 faucets with occasional use presented legionella concentrations 103 cfu l in more than 40 of the occasions the percentage of positive samples was higher in showers than in taps 76 1 vs 59 3 p 0 03 however it was considered that this result could be a confounder because the percentage of low use points was significantly greater in showers than in taps data not shown the results of the logistic regression analysis table 4 indicated that the risk of legionella recovering in a hot water point of use was 2 46 times 95 ci 1 04 5 83 higher when the temperature was 55 c and 2 84 times 95 ci 1 26 6 41 higher when the frequency of use was not daily when the growth of a concentration 103 cfu l was considered as the dependent variable the low frequency of use presented an adjusted odds ratio of 3 18 95 ci 1 36 7 42 and an association was also found with the type of terminal point of use in this model the level of temperature was not associated with higher concentrations of legionella the inclusion of the renewal of the installation as a third explanatory variable did not introduce significant changes 4 discussion our findings indicate that the effectiveness of maintaining sanitary hot water at a minimum temperature of 55 c is significantly better than that at 50 c for the environmental control of legionella but only in installations with suitable dimensioning and recirculation in installations that do not meet these conditions high temperatures alone result in insufficient control the presence of legionella in this type of installation is significantly associated with a low frequency of installation use studies analyzing long term results after maintaining high temperatures in hospital hot water systems as the solely disinfection method show similar findings to ours but are scarce darelid et al 2002 published a ten year longitudinal study in which after a nosocomial outbreak of legionnaire s disease hot water temperature was kept above 55 c as the sole disinfection measure after implementing this measure legionella was isolated in 30 of 251 12 cultured hospital water samples a concise communication borau et al 2000 reported that no nosocomial cases of legionellosis were detected in a hospital for a period of seven years after maintaining the hot water temperature at 55 c however only 33 water samples were analyzed during the study period another seven year longitudinal study described the improvement in legionella colonization after increasing the temperature of hot water tanks from 50 c to 65 c providing a water temperature over 50 c at most of the outlets blanc et al 2005 but in this case ozonation and ionization were used concomitantly as a continuous disinfection method short duration studies also describe significant reductions in the extent of colonization by legionella after the establishment of temperatures exceeding 55 c kusnetsov et al 2003 völker and kistemann 2015 bédard et al 2015 these results are consistent with reports examining the relationship between temperature and proliferation of legionella under laboratory conditions cervero aragó et al 2015 in addition it is well known that the time required to reduce 90 of a population of l pneumophila is approximately 3 h when exposed to a temperature of 50 c while the time is reduced to 20 min when the temperature is 55 c dennis et al 1984 stout et al 1986 extrapolating these data from the actual conditions of the facilities it can be deduced that if the hot water temperature stays above 55 c the population of legionella present in the aqueous phase of a pipeline would be eliminated more quickly thus reducing the probability of exposure to the microorganism when the water is used with regard to the regular flushing of taps which are not frequently used there is no consensus concerning the optimal frequency legionella control guidelines in europe ecdc 2017 real decreto 865 2003 and in spain real decreto 865 2003 asociación española de normalización 2017 indicate that low use faucets and showers should be flushed once a week national guidelines for the control of legionellosis in ireland state that as a general rule all outlets should be flushed at least once per week at full flow except for high risk areas in hospitals where flushing on a daily basis should become part of the daily cleaning process health protection surveillance centre 2009 the uk s health and safety executive 2013 specifies that when outlets are not in regular use weekly flushing can significantly reduce the number of legionella discharged from the outlet however risk assessment may indicate the need for more frequent flushing where there is a more susceptible population present e g in hospitals or nursing homes our data conclude that if the
