programming sustainability decision making 1 introduction agriculture is the cornerstone of mankind existence and national development tian et al 2018 especially for china as an agricultural country over the recent decades agriculture is beset by two major contradictions in china the first one is the conflict between resources supply and demand while the second one is the conflict between economic development and environmental protection to be specific china keeps facing the challenge of feeding 18 of global population with 6 of global water resources and 9 global land resources niva et al 2020 with ongoing rapid urbanization and population explosion the world is expected to experience a 60 increase of food demand fao 2012 a 55 increase of water demand oecd 2012 and a 50 increase of energy demand eia 2019 by 2050 which will magnify pressures on agricultural production even worse climate change is believed to take the world into a new phase of unprecedented water crisis by affecting the availability quality and quantity of water resources wwdr 2020 ausseil et al 2019 thus it is of profound importance to conduct high efficiency integrated management of water food and energy resources for handling the first conflict in agricultural system the second conflict the environment friendly development has gradually aroused more concerns apart from water land and energy resources chemical inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides as well as farming activities such as agricultural films and agricultural machinery hold the important position in boosting crop production and safeguarding food security li et al 2020a however not only do these agricultural inputs result in agricultural non point pollution but also greatly contribute to total global anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs such as co2 n2o and ch4 ji et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 under such circumstances win win strategies aiming at balancing agricultural production and environmental impacts should be further explored in agricultural water food and energy resources management in an irrigated agricultural system water food and energy are highly interwoven mirzabaev et al 2015 water is needed for irrigation and energy generation energy is used for water collection conveying pumping and drainage as well as seeding tillage and harvest for crop food production consumes water and energy resources in turn crop straw can generate bioenergy water energy food nexus wefn is widely believed to be effective for dealing with integrated issues concerning water food and energy on global scales and in academia bazilian et al 2011 tan et al 2020 the wefn concept was firstly proposed in the world economic forum in 2008 wef 2011 while the bonn conference in 2011 has marked the milestone in the development process of wefn hoff 2011 daher and mohtar 2015 discussion on wefn continued in the rio 20 un conference and the sixth world water forum in 2012 lee et al 2020 worldwide scholars have studied the wefn from different perspectives focusing on assessing the sustainability and risk of wefn beas et al 2017 ganoulis 2020 revealing the tradeoffs among wefn cai et al 2018 sunik 2016 singh 2017 establishing the analytical and simulation framework of wefn zhang et al 2018 white et al 2018 and evaluating the effects of policy making on wefn amjath babu et al 2019 more recently some researchers are striving to quantify the interconnections among wefn system and jointly manage water food and energy resources by developing mathematical programming models for example ji et al 2020 developed a multi stage stochastic fuzzy random programming model called msfrp for wefn system management with the objective of maximum total system benefits sun et al 2020 established a chance constrained fuzzy fractional programming model to plan wefn system towards maximum water use efficiency these studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and applicability of optimization models however there is bound to be a long way to the best management of wefn especially in agricultural systems in respect to the existing literatures several respects are worthy of further enhancement as follows 1 agricultural production can guarantee food security and economic development while leading to irreversible environmental changes e g agricultural non point pollution and ghg emissions li et al 2019 in turn environmental degradation in water soil and climate systems greatly affects farmland conditions water supply and water demand these interconnections among water energy food and environment systems were rarely quantified moreover land resources as the important spatial carriers for the sustainable supply of water food and energy should be incorporated into the optimization framework 2 multi objective programming modelling is an effective tool for integrated management of water energy food and land resources coordinating conflicting objectives however existing studies failed to capture comprehensive elements associated with socio economic resources and environmental dimensions for instance how to contribute to transition from traditional fossil energy to renewable energy and thus achieve sustainable development goals sdgs has been overlooked although fossil energy is the dominant ghg contributor guo et al 2020 3 preceding studies ignored quantification of the total water consumption including physical water and virtue water and carbon emissions including direct emissions indirect emissions and soil carbon sequestration across the whole life cycle of crop and thus lead to incomplete guidance of agricultural production to the best of our knowledge no studies have hitherto resolved abovementioned concerns simultaneously towards sustainable agricultural resources management to remedy these deficiencies this study therefore attempts to extend the conventional wefn to a novel water energy food environment nexus wefen for better management of sustainable agriculture the agricultural wefen system is managed by conducting a stochastic multi objective programming model with the objectives of maximization of net economic benefit maximization of renewable energy production minimization of water footprint and minimization of carbon footprint the decision variables are water allocation and land allocation amounts for different sectors in different subareas to address complexities and uncertainties in agricultural wefen system several elements are contained in the model a stochastic expected value model is applied to deal with random natural water availability b uncertain inputs are characterized with triangular fuzzy numbers c the complex relationships between water supply and crop yield in different periods are reflected by stewart model d fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp is introduced to handle possibility and necessity degree of uncertain events e integer programming and non linear programming are incorporated to resolve integer parameters and non linear relationships respectively afterwards the proposed wefen framework is tested by applying to the zhanghe irrigation district of china to demonstrate its practicality the optimal results are beneficial for better understanding over interrelationships in wefen system and sustainable management of agricultural system the remainder of this paper proceeds as follows section 2 formulates a fuzzy stochastic multi objective mixed integer non linear programming model for managing agricultural wefen section 3 applies the established model in a real world case study in the zhanghe irrigation district section 4 presents the optimal results and policy implications and section 5 draws the main conclusions and discusses extensions 2 methodology development 2 1 fuzzy stochastic multi objective mixed integer non linear optimization model this section develops a fuzzy stochastic multi objective mixed integer non linear programming model for sustainable management of agricultural wefen system by incorporating stochastic multi objective programming non linear programming mixed integer programming stewart model fuzzy parameters and fuzzy credibility constrained programming into a general optimization framework additionally four objective functions are established for the optimization model including maximization of net economic benefit maximization of renewable energy production minimization of water footprint and minimization of carbon footprint which are subject to several constraints after solving the optimization model sustainable agricultural water and land resources allocation policies under uncertainty can be generated in summary the following three parts constituted the integrated modelling framework 1 wefen system considering interactions between water food energy and environment components 2 multi objective optimization model for reconciling contradictions of socioeconomic resources environmental development and 3 solutions of uncertainties and complexities existed in the process of agricultural wefen system management the contents and the connections of the three parts are depicted in fig 1 details of optimization model are now discussed below 2 1 1 notations to clearly present the model a list of notations is shown in table 1 2 1 2 objective functions 2 1 2 1 maximum net economic benefit economic benefit is an essential target which reflects local economic development it equals the difference between the revenue and the cost revenue can be gained from food production and non agricultural sectors cost is from planting and allocating different sources of water integer programming is applied to identify whether and when water transfer is needed stewart model is incorporated to accurately express relationship between water supply and crop yield during different crop growth periods this objective can be mathematically expressed as 1a max f n e b max r

have forced policy makers to seek for a cleaner energy generation supply pattern hydroelectricity generated from water and bioenergy produced by crop straw as two typical kinds of renewable energy were considered in the optimization model coefficient method was applied to represent how much renewable energy can be generated li et al 2020b the objective of maximization of renewable energy production can be mathematically presented as 2 max f r e p h 1 h p h w h h σ h y h 1 h i 1 i p h σ s g r σ s c σ l h v a i h y m 1 t 1 t b t e t max t e t a i t h e t max t 2 1 2 3 minimum total crop water footprint crop water footprint refers to the sum of direct and indirect water consumption over the whole crop growth process it is a comprehensive indicator to quantify freshwater consumption and water pollution crop water footprint generally consists of three parts green water footprint blue water footprint and grey water footprint crop green water footprint refers to the consumption of green water resources rainfall infiltration into the soil and can be absorbed by crop crop blue water footprint is the consumption of blue water resources surface or groundwater irrigated to crop xu et al 2018 crop grey water footprint is the volume of freshwater necessary to assimilate the pollutants load mainly refers to nitrogen fertilizers based on natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 towards sustainable water resources utilization minimization of crop water footprint per unit yield is the third objective function which can be expressed as 3a min f w f p min w f p b l u e w f p g r e e n w f p g r e y 3b w f p b l u e w c b l u e y i e l d i 1 i h 1 h t 1 t p h a i h max 0 e t a i t h ρ p r h i 1 i h 1 h p h a

footprint crop carbon footprint is an essential indicator to guide sustainable farmland management which can be defined to estimate carbon emissions induced by production practices across crop life cycle zhang et al 2017 it can be divided into carbon emissions and carbon sequestration the total carbon emissions consist of direct emissions of co2 the emissions of n2o and the emissions of ch4 specifically the direct emissions of co2 mainly derive from agricultural inputs or activities including fertilizer application pesticide application diesel for agricultural machinery and electricity for irrigation expressed as eq 4b the emissions of n2o mainly include direct emissions caused by fertilizer application indirect emissions produced by nitrogen volatilization and nitrogen leaching expressed as eq 4c the emissions of ch4 is mainly from paddy field which can be estimated by multiplying emission coefficient per unit area by planting area of rice expressed as eq 4d the carbon sequestration can be estimated by empirical coefficient according to lu et al 2009 expressed as eq 4e thus the fourth objective is minimization of crop carbon footprint per unit yield which can be expressed as 4a min f c f p min c e c o 2 298 c e n 2 o 25 c e c h 4 s c s i 1 i h 1 h p h a i h y m 1 t 1 t b t e t max t e t a i t h e t max t 4b c e c o 2 h 1 h i 1 i p h a i h ε f e r d o s f e r

reservoir water allocation for all users should not be larger than the total reservoir water availability in different hydrological years fccp is capable of revealing how changes of water availability affected optimal resources allocation schemes the constraint can be expressed as 5 c r i 1 i t 1 t a i h r w i t h η 1 i j 1 j w n j h η 11 w h h r q h λ k h 2 1 3 2 internal water supply constraint internal water allocation for each periods in each subareas must not exceed the internal water availability this study assumed that internal water storage is mainly from precipitation and can be estimated by multiplying precipitation by surface area pandey et al 2011 the constraint can be expressed as 6 c r a i h i w i t h p r t h a i i η 2 λ g i t h 2 1 3 3 external water supply constraint external water transfer in different hydrological years must be less than the total allowable external water availability this constraint can be expressed as 7 i 1 i t 1 t δ i t h a i h w t i t h η 1

irrigation and water discharge i e evapotranspiration drainage and percolation yue et al 2020 field water depth should be controlled within the scope of maximum and minimum water depth the constraint

multi objective non linear programming model under uncertainty as presented above the core to solve the optimization model is to transform it into a deterministic single objective optimization model first the fuzzy parameters existed in the objectives and general constraints should be transformed into their deterministic numbers fuzzy expected value based on expected value theory heilpern 1992 second the fccp should be converted to a series of equivalent crisp constraints with given credibility levels these two steps help convert the uncertain multi objective optimization model to a deterministic multi objective optimization model third weighted minimum deviation method zhang et al 2019 can be used to transform the multi objective optimization model into a single objective optimization model which is subject to specified deterministic constraints finally solve the deterministic single objective programming model by coding it in optimization software 3 case study 3 1 study area a real world case study was applied to demonstrate the feasibility of the developed framework the study case is in the zhanghe irrigation district zid in hubei province north of the yangtze river basin in central china it contains three subarea including jingmen subarea jm jingzhou subarea jzs and dangyang subarea dys with the total designed irrigation area of 1 737 105 ha it has a weather feature of subtropical continental monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 899 mm 1963 2019 it has fertile soil properties well established canal system and well equipped agricultural facilities these features make it favorable for agricultural production zid is an important grain production base of hubei province in china rice is the only agricultural consumer due to its high water requirement and is chosen as the studied crop there are several water sources including the zhanghe reservoir 314 general reservoirs and 81 595 ponds domestic industrial ecological and hydroelectric sectors compete with irrigated agriculture for limited water resources several problems exist in zid such as 1 increasing water demand with shrinking water availability increasing food demand for feeding more than 1 5 million people and increasing renewable energy demand towards low carbon target challenge the agricultural resources management unprecedentedly 2 only reservoir water and internal water i e water from general reservoirs and ponds cannot satisfy the minimum water demand of rice in critical growth periods 3 uncertainties i e fluctuating water availability imprecise socio economic parameters and vague decision preferences and complexities i e multiple water sources and non linear relationships in agricultural system seriously weighted the difficulty of agricultural management 4 rough agricultural activities aggravated environmental pollution i e water pollution and global warming which are little paid attention to in previous researches above problems lead to the necessity to apply proposed optimization model for sustainable agricultural resources management under uncertainty 3 2 input data various kinds of input parameters are needed to solve the optimization model including socioeconomic parameters crop related parameters water resources related parameters and constant coefficients these data were obtained mainly from tuanlin meteorological station monitoring from 1963 to 2019 statistical yearbook of jingzhou city from 2006 to 2017 jingmen city from 2007 to 2017 and yichang city from 2002 to 2017 statistics of irrigation accounts in zhanghe irrigation district from 2003 to 2019 field investigations by hubei zhanghe project administration bureau and related references li et al 2020a chen et al 2017 according to frequency analysis method inflow was classified as three conditions namely wet year normal year and dry year with the corresponding frequencies of 25 50 and 75 respectively using fao 56 penman monteith equation daily reference evapotranspiration et 0 can be estimated the crop water demand is equal in value to the maximum evapotranspiration et m estimated by et 0 multiplying crop coefficient k c i e 1 03 in may 1 35 in june 1 50 in july and 1 40 in august then crop water demand for each growth periods can be calculated by summing up the daily values detailed values of these parameters can be found in tables 2 4 3 3 objective weights in this study typical analytic hierarchy process ahp method was adopted to determine the weights of objective functions the weights of objectives of maximizing net economic benefit neb maximizing renewable energy production rep minimizing total water footprint wfp and minimizing total carbon footprint cfp were denoted as ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 respectively several weights cases were considered as 1 the weights of four objectives were set same then ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω4 0 25 2 neb was considered the most important objective the importance degrees of other objectives were inferior to neb the importance of wfp was considered equal to cfp then we have two cases of ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω4 or ω 1 ω 3 ω4 ω 2 3 similarly rep was considered the most important objective then we have ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 ω4 or ω 2 ω 3 ω4 ω 1 and 4 both wfp and cfp were set the highest weights then we have ω 3 ω4 ω 2 ω 1 or ω 3 ω4 ω 1 ω 2 a semantic 9 point scale for ahp preferences saaty 1990 was used to establish pairwise comparison judgment matrix and then the weights scenarios can be seen in table 5 the consistency ratio cr zhang et al 2018 of these scenarios were all less than 0 1 satisfying the consistency check 4 results analysis and discussion 4 1 optimal resources allocation schemes fig 2 depicts the water resources allocated to different water use sectors in three hydrological years when λ k λ g 0 8 it is clear that there were significant changes in water allocation along with changing water supply availability water requirements of domestic and ecological sectors can be fully satisfied under all scenarios owing to their characters of high profit industrial water allocation can almost reach its requirement except for slight water shortage in dry year however in the case of limited total water resources supply satisfaction of some sectors would inevitably bring about scarcity for others especially for hydroelectric sector water allocation for hydropower dropped dramatically with the decreasing water inflow it reached 6 11 108 m3 in wet year while 4 77 108 m3 in normal year and only 0 80 108 m3 in dry year these solutions expressed the result of coordination between economic objective and energy production consideration specifically in economic dimension hydroelectric sector failed to produce higher direct profit than other sectors while in environmental dimension more hydroelectric water can bring more renewable energy which is beneficial for sustainability inversely agricultural water allocation climbed significantly when hydrological year changes from wet year to dry year this is because precipitation which was one of the main water supply sources diminished significantly when inflow level changed from wet to dry accordingly a compensatory demand for irrigation water should be satisfied fig 3 exhibits the composition of agricultural water resources supply including precipitation reservoir water internal water and transferred water specifically precipitation was the only source of water supply in wet year as the precipitation decreased in normal year internal water was prioritized over reservoir water to compliment irrigation water supply as the inflow further reduced in dry year reservoir water and water transfer were needed for satisfying crop water demand it is obvious that precipitation and internal water resources significantly contributed to crop production fig 4 presents actual crop water evapotranspiration in three subareas in three hydrological years when λ k λ g 0 8 from the figure crop water demand can be fully met in wet year and normal year while water scarcity existed in dry year table 6 depicts land resources allocation schemes in three subareas in three hydrological years when λ k λ g 0 8 it can be observed that land resources allocation for three subareas reached their upper limits of land demand in wet year and normal year while reached their lower limits of land demand in dry year above results of water and land allocation bespeak the great variation of natural water availability i e sufficient water supply in wet year and normal year coupled with great water shortage in dry year it is demonstrated that optimizing agricultural water and land resources allocation in different hydrological years is applicable and necessary fig 4 also shows detailed water allocation in different crop growth stages taking dry year as an example it can be seen that the values of water evapotranspiration equaled to the maximum water requirements in booting stage and heading stage while the values of water evapotranspiration were very close to the minimum water demands in tillering stage and milky stage thus the irrigation priority ranks from high to low were booting and heading stages tillering stage and milky stage which was in accordance with the expectations considering water sensitivity index distribution of rice besides it was internal water availability that resulted in the differences of water allocated to tillering stage among different subareas given that internal water had great contribution to crop production it would be of great significance to enhance internal water storage towards more flexible water supply 4 2 analysis of water footprint and carbon footprint fig 5 presents crop water footprint of three subareas when λ k λ g 0 8 the total crop water footprint were 0 920 m3 kg 0 951 m3 kg and 1 127 m3 kg for jms jzs and dys respectively the results of green and blue water footprints were dependent on water allocation and crop yield while grey water footprint was affected by fertilizer application and crop yield according to optimization model based on the optimization results yield per unit area were 9230 kg ha for jms 9230 kg ha for jzs and 9273 kg ha for dys from the figure both the green water footprint and blue water footprint for three subareas were close in values indicating that they had similar water allocation schemes the grey water footprint of dys was the largest compared with jms and jzs the main reason that caused such a result was its greater dosages of fertilizers than other two subareas it manifested that reduction of fertilizer application would be an effective way to relieve water pollution besides for all three subareas grey water footprint was the largest occupying 44 9 for jms 46 7 for jzs and 54 8 for dys followed by green water footprint occupying 42 8 for jms 41 5 for jzs and 34 8 for dys and blue water footprint occupying 12 3 for jms 11 9 for jzs and 10 4 for dys such results showed the importance of effective fertilizer management for rice production results of different water footprint would help decision makers manage water resources and control fertilizer application in a more efficient and sustainable way the carbon footprint of different greenhouse gases emissions and farmland practices can be seen in fig 6 the total carbon footprint were 1 306 kgco2 eq kg 1 312 kgco2 eq kg and 1 399 kgco2 eq kg for jms jzs and dys respectively from fig 6a the total carbon footprint for the three subareas had a similar composition specifically the emission of co2 and ch4 accounted for the majority of 92 0 91 4 and 88 8 for jms jzs and dys respectively while the emission of n2o occupied the last small part from fig 6b for all subareas paddy field contributed nearly half of total carbon footprint i e 49 1 for jms 48 9 for jzs and 45 6 for dys it was related with soil property tillage methods climate factors and so on the second source contributed to carbon footprint was fertilizer which occupied 32 7 34 9 and 45 6 for jms jzs and dys respectively fig 6b also showed the differences of carbon footprint among different subareas mainly resulted from different amount of agricultural inputs higher product inputs produced more carbon footprint exerting negative influences on global climate therefore high efficiency irrigation energy and fertilizer management were of great significance towards agricultural sustainability 4 3 objectives under different decision preferences objective weights may be different for different decision makers resulting in different optimization results this section analyzed how the values of system objectives changed with varying objectives weights based on the weights scenarios in table 5 the results of objectives are shown in fig 7 taking rep as an example the values of rep were the highest of 4 173 109 mj when rep was given priority ws 3 ws 4 if other objectives were focused on the value of rep fell to 4 118 109 mj indicating that these four objectives were contradictory however rep was inclined to reach its best value although wfp and cfp were focused on ws 5 meanwhile the changes of wfp and cfp were not conspicuous reflecting that they had slight sensitivity to objective weights it s also worth pointing out that the optimal results for ws 1 ws 2 ws 6 and ws 7 were nearly same even they had different objective weights above results were probably because that the multi objective optimization model was dominated by the objective of neb in the background of sustainable agricultural development the weights of environmental objectives are recommended to be increased towards more environment friendly allocation policies analysis based on different weights scenarios can help decision makers identify proper and robust solutions 4 4 optimization results under uncertainty the above results were obtained under a certain credibility level scenario which is λ k λ g 0 8 to further analyze the variation of objectives and resources allocation under uncertainty we considered different combinations of λ k and λ g these combinations can be divided into three kinds of scenarios as 1 scenario 1 λ k λ g 0 5 λ k λ g 0 6 λ k λ g 0 7 λ k λ g 0 8 λ k λ g 0 9 and λ k λ g 1 0 2 scenario 2 λ g 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 with λ k equaled to 0 8 3 scenario 3 λ k 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 with λ g fixed at 0 8 the optimal results under three scenarios can be seen in fig 8 from the figure the variations of credibility levels allowed the value of net economic benefit range within 3 23 3 33 109 yuan the value of renewable energy production change within 4 09 4 22 109 mj the value of water footprint change within 0 937 0 941 m3 kg the value of carbon footprint vary within 1 313 1 320 kgco2 eq kg the value of total water allocation range within 4 02 4 20 108 m3 and the value of total land allocation range within 8 44 8 66 104 ha according to the results net economic benefit renewable energy production water allocation and land allocation had downtrends as credibility levels increased especially for scenario 1 the decreasing extent was the largest because both λ k and λ g increased resulting in less reservoir water availability and internal water availability simultaneously the extent of drop under scenario 2 was similar with that under scenario 3 indicating that the sensitivity of model results to reservoir water availability and internal water availability were similar water footprint and carbon footprint reached their highest values of 0 941 m3 kg and 1 320 kgco2 eq kg respectively when λ k λ g 1 0 that was related to crop yield i e when credibility levels increased shrinking water availability would lead to the reduction of crop yield accordingly resulting in increasing water footprint and carbon footprint above results coincided with the expectation considering the methodology of fccp and provided a robust guidance for decision makers to balance objectives and risk levels 4 5 sensitivity analysis above results shed light on how changing water supply availability affected model performance this section aims to learn the impact of land availability and crop market price on the net economic benefit renewable energy production water footprint and carbon footprint based on sensitivity analysis as shown in fig 9 from the figure all the objectives were sensitive to land availability while expressing low sensitivity to crop market price results showed that the neb rep and wfp had positive linear relations with land availability compared with the baseline the results without considering the variations of sensitive parameters the objectives changing ranges were 3 71 2 29 the minus sign means the decrease in value of neb 8 11 9 09 of rep and 0 06 0 58 of wfp when the land availability was 10 the values of cfp presented uptrends whether land availability increased or decreased what is noteworthy is that a slight increase of land resources supply for example 5 would produce more economic benefit and renewable energy without increase water footprint and carbon footprint cfp would increase 0 83 when land resources increased 10 managers could make decisions based on their own preferences balancing economic factors and environmental impacts results also showed that crop price present had a great potential to increase the economic benefit when crop price was 10 the values of neb were 6 62 5 59 compared with the baseline unlike the economic benefit the values of rep wfp and cfp kept stable until crop price increased 10 when crop price was 10 rep increased 1 28 wfp declined 0 04 and cfp increased 0 12 such results indicated that 1 increasing land availability as well as crop price slightly would be beneficial for the sustainable management of agricultural wefen considering economic resource and environmental dimensions comprehensively 2 neb and rep were most sensitive to crop market price and land availability respectively while wfp and cfp were little sensitive to these parameters 3 the variation of optimization results was acceptable and a robust guidance could be provided based on parameters sensitivity analysis 5 conclusion this study developed a novel water energy food environment nexus optimization model for sustainable resources management in agricultural system the framework is fuzzy credibility constrained multi objective mixed integer non linear programming model considering water footprint and carbon footprint under uncertainty the main contributions of the research can be summarized as follows 1 simultaneously tackling interactions among water energy food and environment components in agricultural system 2 generating high efficiency and environmental friendly water and land resources allocation policies by coordinating the concerns of socio economic resources and environmental dimensions 3 addressing the uncertainties and complexities of agricultural system for flexible decision alternatives the approach was applied to identify the optimal water and land resources allocation schemes in different subareas in the zhanghe irrigation district central china the following conclusions can be drawn from the research 1 booting stage and heading stage are the critical periods of rice which have high water scarcity sensitivities internal water greatly contributed to rice production thus its storage capacity should be enhanced towards flexible water supply 2 grey water footprint contributed most to water footprint while paddy field and fertilizer contributed majority of greenhouse gas emissions to alleviate negative environmental impacts i e water pollution and global warming reasonable fertilizer application tillage method and irrigation management would be of significance 3 an increment in credibility level would result in the reduction of net economic benefit renewable energy production water allocation and land allocation and the increase of water footprint and carbon footprint because less water allocated and crop yield is reduced correspondingly uncertainty analysis could help decision makers identify robust schemes based on their own risk preferences 4 a slight increase for example 5 of land area and crop price were recommended while a larger increase would generate more contamination to the environment the developed approach of this study could provide a template for other predominantly agricultural regions with the aims of sustainable development however further endeavors are needed to fill gaps in our understanding for example land use pattern animal husbandry and more forms of uncertainties would be paid attention to in our future studies to extend the developed approach to a grander scale declaration of competing interest

other agriculture centered regions suffering from multifold resources and environment crisis keywords water energy food environment nexus water footprint carbon footprint stochastic multi objective programming sustainability decision making 1 introduction agriculture is the cornerstone of mankind existence and national development tian et al 2018 especially for china as an agricultural country over the recent decades agriculture is beset by two major contradictions in china the first one is the conflict between resources supply and demand while the second one is the conflict between economic development and environmental protection to be specific china keeps facing the challenge of feeding 18 of global population with 6 of global water resources and 9 global land resources niva et al 2020 with ongoing rapid urbanization and population explosion the world is expected to experience a 60 increase of food demand fao 2012 a 55 increase of water demand oecd 2012 and a 50 increase of energy demand eia 2019 by 2050 which will magnify pressures on agricultural production even worse climate change is believed to take the world into a new phase of unprecedented water crisis by affecting the availability quality and quantity of water resources wwdr 2020 ausseil et al 2019 thus it is of profound importance to conduct high efficiency integrated management of water food and energy resources for handling the first conflict in agricultural system the second conflict the environment friendly development has gradually aroused more concerns apart from water land and energy resources chemical inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides as well as farming activities such as agricultural films and agricultural machinery hold the important position in boosting crop production and safeguarding food security li et al 2020a however not only do these agricultural inputs result in agricultural non point pollution but also greatly contribute to total global anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs such as co2 n2o and ch4 ji et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 under such circumstances win win strategies aiming at balancing agricultural production and environmental impacts should be further explored in agricultural water food and energy resources management in an irrigated agricultural system water food and energy are highly interwoven mirzabaev et al 2015 water is needed for irrigation and energy generation energy is used for water collection conveying pumping and drainage as well as seeding tillage and harvest for crop food production consumes water and energy resources in turn crop straw can generate bioenergy water energy food nexus wefn is widely believed to be effective for dealing with integrated issues concerning water food and energy on global scales and in academia bazilian et al 2011 tan et al 2020 the wefn concept was firstly proposed in the world economic forum in 2008 wef 2011 while the bonn conference in 2011 has marked the milestone in the development process of wefn hoff 2011 daher and mohtar 2015 discussion on wefn continued in the rio 20 un conference and the sixth world water forum in 2012 lee et al 2020 worldwide scholars have studied the wefn from different perspectives focusing on assessing the sustainability and risk of wefn beas et al 2017 ganoulis 2020 revealing the tradeoffs among wefn cai et al 2018 sunik 2016 singh 2017 establishing the analytical and simulation framework of wefn zhang et al 2018 white et al 2018 and evaluating the effects of policy making on wefn amjath babu et al 2019 more recently some researchers are striving to quantify the interconnections among wefn system and jointly manage water food and energy resources by developing mathematical programming models for example ji et al 2020 developed a multi stage stochastic fuzzy random programming model called msfrp for wefn system management with the objective of maximum total system benefits sun et al 2020 established a chance constrained fuzzy fractional programming model to plan wefn system towards maximum water use efficiency these studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and applicability of optimization models however there is bound to be a long way to the best management of wefn especially in agricultural systems in respect to the existing literatures several respects are worthy of further enhancement as follows 1 agricultural production can guarantee food security and economic development while leading to irreversible environmental changes e g agricultural non point pollution and ghg emissions li et al 2019 in turn environmental degradation in water soil and climate systems greatly affects farmland conditions water supply and water demand these interconnections among water energy food and environment systems were rarely quantified moreover land resources as the important spatial carriers for the sustainable supply of water food and energy should be incorporated into the optimization framework 2 multi objective programming modelling is an effective tool for integrated management of water energy food and land resources coordinating conflicting objectives however existing studies failed to capture comprehensive elements associated with socio economic resources and environmental dimensions for instance how to contribute to transition from traditional fossil energy to renewable energy and thus achieve sustainable development goals sdgs has been overlooked although fossil energy is the dominant ghg contributor guo et al 2020 3 preceding studies ignored quantification of the total water consumption including physical water and virtue water and carbon emissions including direct emissions indirect emissions and soil carbon sequestration across the whole life cycle of crop and thus lead to incomplete guidance of agricultural production to the best of our knowledge no studies have hitherto resolved abovementioned concerns simultaneously towards sustainable agricultural resources management to remedy these deficiencies this study therefore attempts to extend the conventional wefn to a novel water energy food environment nexus wefen for better management of sustainable agriculture the agricultural wefen system is managed by conducting a stochastic multi objective programming model with the objectives of maximization of net economic benefit maximization of renewable energy production minimization of water footprint and minimization of carbon footprint the decision variables are water allocation and land allocation amounts for different sectors in different subareas to address complexities and uncertainties in agricultural wefen system several elements are contained in the model a stochastic expected value model is applied to deal with random natural water availability b uncertain inputs are characterized with triangular fuzzy numbers c the complex relationships between water supply and crop yield in different periods are reflected by stewart model d fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp is introduced to handle possibility and necessity degree of uncertain events e integer programming and non linear programming are incorporated to resolve integer parameters and non linear relationships respectively afterwards the proposed wefen framework is tested by applying to the zhanghe irrigation district of china to demonstrate its practicality the optimal results are beneficial for better understanding over interrelationships in wefen system and sustainable management of agricultural system the remainder of this paper proceeds as follows section 2 formulates a fuzzy stochastic multi objective mixed integer non linear programming model for managing agricultural wefen section 3 applies the established model in a real world case study in the zhanghe irrigation district section 4 presents the optimal results and policy implications and section 5 draws the main conclusions and discusses extensions 2 methodology development 2 1 fuzzy stochastic multi objective mixed integer non linear optimization model this section develops a fuzzy stochastic multi objective mixed integer non linear programming model for sustainable management of agricultural wefen system by incorporating stochastic multi objective programming non linear programming mixed integer programming stewart model fuzzy parameters and fuzzy credibility constrained programming into a general optimization framework additionally four objective functions are established for the optimization model including maximization of net economic benefit maximization of renewable energy production minimization of water footprint and minimization of carbon footprint which are subject to several constraints after solving the optimization model sustainable agricultural water and land resources allocation policies under uncertainty can be generated in summary the following three parts constituted the integrated modelling framework 1 wefen system considering interactions between water food energy and environment components 2 multi objective optimization model for reconciling contradictions of socioeconomic resources environmental development and 3 solutions of uncertainties and complexities existed in the process of agricultural wefen system management the contents and the connections of the three parts are depicted in fig 1 details of optimization model are now discussed below 2 1 1 notations to clearly present the model a list of notations is shown in table 1 2 1 2 objective functions 2 1 2 1 maximum net economic benefit economic benefit is an essential target which reflects local economic development it equals the difference between the revenue and the cost revenue can be gained from food production and non agricultural sectors cost is from planting and allocating different sources of water integer programming is applied to identify whether and when water transfer is needed stewart model is incorporated to accurately express relationship between water supply and crop yield during different crop growth periods this objective can be mathematically expressed as 1a max f n e b max r

have forced policy makers to seek for a cleaner energy generation supply pattern hydroelectricity generated from water and bioenergy produced by crop straw as two typical kinds of renewable energy were considered in the optimization model coefficient method was applied to represent how much renewable energy can be generated li et al 2020b the objective of maximization of renewable energy

water footprint crop water footprint refers to the sum of direct and indirect water consumption over the whole crop growth process it is a comprehensive indicator to quantify freshwater consumption and water pollution crop water footprint generally consists of three parts green water footprint blue water footprint and grey water footprint crop green water footprint refers to the consumption of green water resources rainfall infiltration into the soil and can be absorbed by crop crop blue water footprint is the consumption of blue water resources surface or groundwater irrigated to crop xu et al 2018 crop grey water footprint is the volume of freshwater necessary to assimilate the pollutants load mainly refers to nitrogen fertilizers based on natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 towards sustainable water resources utilization minimization of crop water footprint per unit yield is the third objective function which can be expressed as 3a min f w f p min w f p b l u e w f p g r e e n w f p g r e y 3b w f p b l u e w c b l u e y i e l d i 1 i h 1 h t 1 t p h a i h max 0 e t a i t h ρ p r h i 1 i h 1 h p h a

footprint crop carbon footprint is an essential indicator to guide sustainable farmland management which can be defined to estimate carbon emissions induced by production practices across crop life cycle zhang et al 2017 it can be divided into carbon emissions and carbon sequestration the total carbon emissions consist of direct emissions of co2 the emissions of n2o and the emissions of ch4 specifically the direct emissions of co2 mainly derive from agricultural inputs or activities including fertilizer application pesticide application diesel for agricultural machinery and electricity for irrigation expressed as eq 4b the emissions of n2o mainly include direct emissions caused by fertilizer application indirect emissions produced by nitrogen volatilization and nitrogen leaching expressed as eq 4c the emissions of ch4 is mainly from paddy field which can be estimated by multiplying emission coefficient per unit area by planting area of rice expressed as eq 4d the carbon sequestration can be estimated by empirical coefficient according to lu et al 2009 expressed as eq 4e thus the fourth objective is minimization of crop carbon footprint per unit yield which can be expressed as 4a min f c f p min c e c o 2 298 c e n 2 o 25 c e c h 4 s c s i 1 i h 1 h p h a i h y m 1 t 1 t b t e t max t e t a i t h e t max t 4b c e c o 2 h 1 h i 1 i p h a i h ε f e r d o s f e r

reservoir water allocation for all users should not be larger than the total reservoir water availability in different hydrological years fccp is capable of revealing how changes of water availability

internal water allocation for each periods in each subareas must not exceed the internal water availability this study assumed that internal water storage is mainly from precipitation and can be estimated by multiplying precipitation by surface area pandey et al 2011 the constraint can be expressed as 6 c r a i h i w i t h p r t h a i i η 2 λ g i t h 2 1 3 3 external water supply constraint

multi objective non linear programming model under uncertainty as presented above the core to solve the optimization model is to transform it into a deterministic single objective optimization model first the fuzzy parameters existed in the objectives and general constraints should be transformed into their deterministic numbers fuzzy expected value based on expected value theory heilpern 1992 second the fccp should be converted to a series of equivalent crisp constraints with given credibility levels these two steps help convert the uncertain multi objective optimization model to a deterministic multi objective optimization model third weighted minimum deviation method zhang et al 2019 can be used to transform the multi objective optimization model into a single objective optimization model which is subject to specified deterministic constraints finally solve the deterministic single objective programming model by coding it in optimization software 3 case study 3 1 study area a real world case study was applied to demonstrate the feasibility of the developed framework the study case is in the zhanghe irrigation district zid in hubei province north of the yangtze river basin in central china it contains three subarea including jingmen subarea jm jingzhou subarea jzs and dangyang subarea dys with the total designed irrigation area of 1 737 105 ha it has a weather feature of subtropical continental monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 899 mm 1963 2019 it has fertile soil properties well established canal system and well equipped agricultural facilities these features make it favorable for agricultural production zid is an important grain production base of hubei province in china rice is the only agricultural consumer due to its high water requirement and is chosen as the studied crop there are several water sources including the zhanghe reservoir 314 general reservoirs and 81 595 ponds domestic industrial ecological and hydroelectric sectors compete with irrigated agriculture for limited water resources several problems exist in zid such as 1 increasing water demand with shrinking water availability increasing food demand for feeding more than 1 5 million people and increasing renewable energy demand towards low carbon target challenge the agricultural resources management unprecedentedly 2 only reservoir water and internal water i e water from general reservoirs and ponds cannot satisfy the minimum water demand of rice in critical growth periods 3 uncertainties i e fluctuating water availability imprecise socio economic parameters and vague decision preferences and complexities i e multiple water sources and non linear relationships in agricultural system seriously weighted the difficulty of agricultural management 4 rough agricultural activities aggravated environmental pollution i e water pollution and global warming which are little paid attention to in previous researches above problems lead to the necessity to apply proposed optimization model for sustainable agricultural resources management under uncertainty 3 2 input data various kinds of input parameters are needed to solve the optimization model including socioeconomic parameters crop related parameters water resources related parameters and constant coefficients these data were obtained mainly from tuanlin meteorological station monitoring from 1963 to 2019 statistical yearbook of jingzhou city from 2006 to 2017 jingmen city from 2007 to 2017 and yichang city from 2002 to 2017 statistics of irrigation accounts in zhanghe irrigation district from 2003 to 2019 field investigations by hubei zhanghe project administration bureau and related references li et al 2020a chen et al 2017 according to frequency analysis method inflow was classified as three conditions namely wet year normal year and dry year with the corresponding frequencies of 25 50 and 75 respectively using fao 56 penman monteith equation daily reference evapotranspiration et 0 can be estimated the crop water demand is equal in value to the maximum evapotranspiration et m estimated by et 0 multiplying crop coefficient k c i e 1 03 in may 1 35 in june 1 50 in july and 1 40 in august then crop water demand for each growth periods can be calculated by summing up the daily values detailed values of these parameters can be found in tables 2 4 3 3 objective weights in this study typical analytic hierarchy process ahp method was adopted to determine the weights of objective functions the weights of objectives of maximizing net economic benefit neb maximizing renewable energy production rep minimizing total water footprint wfp and minimizing total carbon footprint cfp were denoted as ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 respectively several weights cases were considered as 1 the weights of four objectives were set same then ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω4 0 25 2 neb was considered the most important objective the importance degrees of other objectives were inferior to neb the importance of wfp was considered equal to cfp then we have two cases of ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 ω4 or ω 1 ω 3 ω4 ω 2 3 similarly rep was considered the most important objective then we have ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 ω4 or ω 2 ω 3 ω4 ω 1 and 4 both wfp and cfp were set the highest weights then we have ω 3 ω4 ω 2 ω 1 or ω 3 ω4 ω 1 ω 2 a semantic 9 point scale for ahp preferences saaty 1990 was used to establish pairwise comparison judgment matrix and then the weights scenarios can be seen in table 5 the consistency ratio cr zhang et al 2018 of these scenarios were all less than 0 1 satisfying the consistency check 4 results analysis and discussion 4 1 optimal resources allocation schemes fig 2 depicts the water resources allocated to different water use sectors in three hydrological years when λ k λ g 0 8 it is clear that there were significant changes in water allocation along with changing water supply availability water requirements of domestic and ecological sectors can be fully satisfied under all scenarios owing to their characters of high profit industrial water allocation can almost reach its requirement except for slight water shortage in dry year however in the case of limited total water resources supply satisfaction of some sectors would inevitably bring about scarcity for others especially for hydroelectric sector water allocation for hydropower dropped dramatically with the decreasing water inflow it reached 6 11 108 m3 in wet year while 4 77 108 m3 in normal year and only 0 80 108 m3 in dry year these solutions expressed the result of coordination between economic objective and energy production consideration specifically in economic dimension hydroelectric sector failed to produce higher direct profit than other sectors while in environmental dimension more hydroelectric water can bring more renewable energy which is beneficial for sustainability inversely agricultural water allocation climbed significantly when hydrological year changes from wet year to dry year this is because precipitation which was one of the main water supply sources diminished significantly when inflow level changed from wet to dry accordingly a compensatory demand for irrigation water should be satisfied fig 3 exhibits the composition of agricultural water resources supply including precipitation reservoir water internal water and transferred water specifically precipitation was the only source of water supply in wet year as the precipitation decreased in normal year internal water was prioritized over reservoir water to compliment irrigation water supply as the inflow further reduced in dry year reservoir water and water transfer were needed for satisfying crop water demand it is obvious that precipitation and internal water resources significantly contributed to crop production fig 4 presents actual crop water evapotranspiration in three subareas in three hydrological years when λ k λ g 0 8 from the figure crop water demand can be fully met in wet year and normal year while water scarcity existed in dry year table 6 depicts land resources allocation schemes in three subareas in three hydrological years when λ k λ g 0 8 it can be observed that land resources allocation for three subareas reached their upper limits of land demand in wet year and normal year while reached their lower limits of land demand in dry year above results of water and land allocation bespeak the great variation of natural water availability i e sufficient water supply in wet year and normal year coupled with great water shortage in dry year it is demonstrated that optimizing agricultural water and land resources allocation in different hydrological years is applicable and necessary fig 4 also shows detailed water allocation in different crop growth stages taking dry year as an example it can be seen that the values of water evapotranspiration equaled to the maximum water requirements in booting stage and heading stage while the values of water evapotranspiration were very close to the minimum water demands in tillering stage and milky stage thus the irrigation priority ranks from high to low were booting and heading stages tillering stage and milky stage which was in accordance with the expectations considering water sensitivity index distribution of rice besides it was internal water availability that resulted in the differences of water allocated to tillering stage among different subareas given that internal water had great contribution to crop production it would be of great significance to enhance internal water storage towards more flexible water supply 4 2 analysis of water footprint and carbon footprint fig 5 presents crop water footprint of three subareas when λ k λ g 0 8 the total crop water footprint were 0 920 m3 kg 0 951 m3 kg and 1 127 m3 kg for jms jzs and dys respectively the results of green and blue water footprints were dependent on water allocation and crop yield while grey water footprint was affected by fertilizer application and crop yield according to optimization model based on the optimization results yield per unit area were 9230 kg ha for jms 9230 kg ha for jzs and 9273 kg ha for dys from the figure both the green water footprint and blue water footprint for three subareas were close in values indicating that they had similar water allocation schemes the grey water footprint of dys was the largest compared with jms and jzs the main reason that caused such a result was its greater dosages of fertilizers than other two subareas it manifested that reduction of fertilizer application would be an effective way to relieve water pollution besides for all three subareas grey water footprint was the largest occupying 44 9 for jms 46 7 for jzs and 54 8 for dys followed by green water footprint occupying 42 8 for jms 41 5 for jzs and 34 8 for dys and blue water footprint occupying 12 3 for jms 11 9 for jzs and 10 4 for dys such results showed the importance of effective fertilizer management for rice production results of different water footprint would help decision makers manage water resources and control fertilizer application in a more efficient and sustainable way the carbon footprint of different greenhouse gases emissions and farmland practices can be seen in fig 6 the total carbon footprint were 1 306 kgco2 eq kg 1 312 kgco2 eq kg and 1 399 kgco2 eq kg for jms jzs and dys respectively from fig 6a the total carbon footprint for the three subareas had a similar composition specifically the emission of co2 and ch4 accounted for the majority of 92 0 91 4 and 88 8 for jms jzs and dys respectively while the emission of n2o occupied the last small part from fig 6b for all subareas paddy field contributed nearly half of total carbon footprint i e 49 1 for jms 48 9 for jzs and 45 6 for dys it was related with soil property tillage methods climate factors and so on the second source contributed to carbon footprint was fertilizer which occupied 32 7 34 9 and 45 6 for jms jzs and dys respectively fig 6b also showed the differences of carbon footprint among different subareas mainly resulted from different amount of agricultural inputs higher product inputs produced more carbon footprint exerting negative influences on global climate therefore high efficiency irrigation energy and fertilizer management were of great significance towards agricultural sustainability 4 3 objectives under different decision preferences objective weights may be different for different decision makers resulting in different optimization results this section analyzed how the values of system objectives changed with varying objectives weights based on the weights scenarios in table 5 the results of objectives are shown in fig 7 taking rep as an example the values of rep were the highest of 4 173 109 mj when rep was given priority ws 3 ws 4 if other objectives were focused on the value of rep fell to 4 118 109 mj indicating that these four objectives were contradictory however rep was inclined to reach its best value although wfp and cfp were focused on ws 5 meanwhile the changes of wfp and cfp were not conspicuous reflecting that they had slight sensitivity to objective weights it s also worth pointing out that the optimal results for ws 1 ws 2 ws 6 and ws 7 were nearly same even they had different objective weights above results were probably because that the multi objective optimization model was dominated by the objective of neb in the background of sustainable agricultural development the weights of environmental objectives are recommended to be increased towards more environment friendly allocation policies analysis based on different weights scenarios can help decision makers identify proper and robust solutions 4 4 optimization results under uncertainty the above results were obtained under a certain credibility level scenario which is λ k λ g 0 8 to further analyze the variation of objectives and resources allocation under uncertainty we considered different combinations of λ k and λ g these combinations can be divided into three kinds of scenarios as 1 scenario 1 λ k λ g 0 5 λ k λ g 0 6 λ k λ g 0 7 λ k λ g 0 8 λ k λ g 0 9 and λ k λ g 1 0 2 scenario 2 λ g 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 with λ k equaled to 0 8 3 scenario 3 λ k 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 with λ g fixed at 0 8 the optimal results under three scenarios can be seen in fig 8 from the figure the variations of credibility levels allowed the value of net economic benefit range within 3 23 3 33 109 yuan the value of renewable energy production change within 4 09 4 22 109 mj the value of water footprint change within 0 937 0 941 m3 kg the value of carbon footprint vary within 1 313 1 320 kgco2 eq kg the value of total water allocation range within 4 02 4 20 108 m3 and the value of total land allocation range within 8 44 8 66 104 ha according to the results net economic benefit renewable energy production water allocation and land allocation had downtrends as credibility levels increased especially for scenario 1 the decreasing extent was the largest because both λ k and λ g increased resulting in less reservoir water availability and internal water availability simultaneously the extent of drop under scenario 2 was similar with that under scenario 3 indicating that the sensitivity of model results to reservoir water availability and internal water availability were similar water footprint and carbon footprint reached their highest values of 0 941 m3 kg and 1 320 kgco2 eq kg respectively when λ k λ g 1 0 that was related to crop yield i e when credibility levels increased shrinking water availability would lead to the reduction of crop yield accordingly resulting in increasing water footprint and carbon footprint above results coincided with the expectation considering the methodology of fccp and provided a robust guidance for decision makers to balance objectives and risk levels 4 5 sensitivity analysis above results shed light on how changing water supply availability affected model performance this section aims to learn the impact of land availability and crop market price on the net economic benefit renewable energy production water footprint and carbon footprint based on sensitivity analysis as shown in fig 9 from the figure all the objectives were sensitive to land availability while expressing low sensitivity to crop market price results showed that the neb rep and wfp had positive linear relations with land availability compared with the baseline the results without considering the variations of sensitive parameters the objectives changing ranges were 3 71 2 29 the minus sign means the decrease in value of neb 8 11 9 09 of rep and 0 06 0 58 of wfp when the land availability was 10 the values of cfp presented uptrends whether land availability increased or decreased what is noteworthy is that a slight increase of land resources supply for example 5 would produce more economic benefit and renewable energy without increase water footprint and carbon footprint cfp would increase 0 83 when land resources increased 10 managers could make decisions based on their own preferences balancing economic factors and environmental impacts results also showed that crop price present had a great potential to increase the economic benefit when crop price was 10 the values of neb were 6 62 5 59 compared with the baseline unlike the economic benefit the values of rep wfp and cfp kept stable until crop price increased 10 when crop price was 10 rep increased 1 28 wfp declined 0 04 and cfp increased 0 12 such results indicated that 1 increasing land availability as well as crop price slightly would be beneficial for the sustainable management of agricultural wefen considering economic resource and environmental dimensions comprehensively 2 neb and rep were most sensitive to crop market price and land availability respectively while wfp and cfp were little sensitive to these parameters 3 the variation of optimization results was acceptable and a robust guidance could be provided based on parameters sensitivity analysis 5 conclusion this study developed a novel water energy food environment nexus optimization model for sustainable resources management in agricultural system the framework is fuzzy credibility constrained multi objective mixed integer non linear programming model considering water footprint and carbon footprint under uncertainty the main contributions of the research can be summarized as follows 1 simultaneously tackling interactions among water energy food and environment components in agricultural system 2 generating high efficiency and environmental friendly water and land resources allocation policies by coordinating the concerns of socio economic resources and environmental dimensions 3 addressing the uncertainties and complexities of agricultural system for flexible decision alternatives the approach was applied to identify the optimal water and land resources allocation schemes in different subareas in the zhanghe irrigation district central china the following conclusions can be drawn from the research 1 booting stage and heading stage are the critical periods of rice which have high water scarcity sensitivities internal water greatly contributed to rice production thus its storage capacity should be enhanced towards flexible water supply 2 grey water footprint contributed most to water footprint while paddy field and fertilizer contributed majority of greenhouse gas emissions to alleviate negative environmental impacts i e water pollution and global warming reasonable fertilizer application tillage method and irrigation management would be of significance 3 an increment in credibility level would result in the reduction of net economic benefit renewable energy production water allocation and land allocation and the increase of water footprint and carbon footprint because less water allocated and crop yield is reduced correspondingly uncertainty analysis could help decision makers identify robust schemes based on their own risk preferences 4 a slight increase for example 5 of land area and crop price were recommended while a larger increase would generate more contamination to the environment the developed approach of this study could provide a template for other predominantly agricultural regions with the aims of sustainable development however further endeavors are needed to fill gaps in our understanding for example land use pattern animal husbandry and more forms of uncertainties would be paid attention to in our future studies to extend the developed approach to a grander scale declaration of competing interest

10076,pecan is a major crop in the lower rio grande valley lrgv new mexico new mexico is currently the largest pecan producer in the united states pecan is also considered a major water user which can consume as much as 1200 1300 mm of water during the growing season climate change can have significant potential impact on the water requirement of pecan as well as its productivity and cost of production this study evaluates the climate change effects on the duration of growing season dgs and water requirement of pecan in lrgv over the period of 1901 2019 temperature data for the study period was used to identify the dgs hargreaves samani model was used to calculate reference evapotranspiration et0 daily crop coefficient kc over the study period was calculated using a developed regression model relating growing season kc to cumulative growing degree days gdd the mann kendall and sen s methods were applied to determine if there was a significant positive or negative trend in the dgs et0 and actual evapotranspiration eta statistical results showed a decreasing trend in the dgs over 1901 1950 whereas an increasing trend in the dgs was detected for the period of 1950 2019 like the dgs variations decreasing and increasing trends for both seasonal et0 and eta were observed for the first 50 years and the rest of the period with 99 confidence level respectively results showed an increase of 124 mm in seasonal eta between 1950 and 2019 the study showed that climate change effects in lrgv have been occurring for the study period continuous increases in both dgs and eta may bring changes in crop water requirement and economics of pecan production as well as other horticultural challenges such as insufficient chill period for flowering increased vivipary and delayed or prolonged harvest keywords reference evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration duration of growing season 1 introduction new mexico is the largest producer of pecan carya illinoinensis wangenh k koch in the usa with 43 8 million kilograms of in shell nuts produced in 2019 followed by georgia with 31 3 million kilograms usda nass 2020 the total value of the pecan was 469 million in the usa in 2019 and new mexico contributed 36 of the total value of the pecan which was 170 million usda nass 2020 pecan is the most important crop in new mexico s lower rio grande valley lrgv where the majority of new mexico s pecans are produced pecans are also major water users in the lrgv requiring as low as 368 mm to as high as 1479 mm of annual evapotranspiration et depending on diversity of tree age size spacing density and management practices miyamoto 1983 sammis et al 2004 samani et al 2011 surface water availability for irrigation in the lrgv a semiarid to arid climate zone is becoming scarce due to low precipitation and snowfall leading to decreased runoff high evaporation and continued drought thus water availability for irrigation can play a vital role in pecan productivity more attention is needed to implement better understanding of pecan consumptive use and better water management strategies to maintain sustainable agriculture and food security mokari et al 2019 crop water use actual evapotranspiration eta can be calculated using crop coefficient kc and reference evapotranspiration et0 reference evapotranspiration can be estimated using fao penman monteith allen et al 1998 and other methods such as hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 fao penman monteith is the most accurate way of calculating et0 but requires detailed climate data such as global solar radiation temperature humidity and wind speed eta can be used to manage irrigation and to prevent water and nutrient leaching below the rootzone in lrgv where the climate zone is semiarid to arid surface water resources are limited and irrigation is the main source of water for crops recently the potential impact of climate change on et0 has been reported by various investigators these efforts have highlighted either decreasing or increasing trends in et0 over a long period of time bandyopadhyay et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 2015 2019 huo et al 2013 tabari 2010 tabari and marofi 2010 li et al 2018 fan et al 2016 song et al 2017 nouri and bannayan 2018 li et al 2018 founded that et0 decreased significantly in the upper middle of the huai river basin over a 54 years period while a gradually increasing trend was found in the lower middle of huai river basin over the same period the reasons for these phenomena were explained by differential changes in mean temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity between the two areas of that river basin zhang et al 2019 reported a significant decline in et0 from 1970 to 1993 at 14 91 mm decade rate across china whereas an opposite trend was observed from 1993 to 2014 at 16 50 mm decade rate maximum temperature relative humidity and wind speed were suggested as main contributing meteorological variables that affected et0 according to the ordinary least squares regression the potential impact of climate change on et0 has been widely reported across the world there is no report containing climate change effects on seasonal eta in the lrgv which is dominated by pecan orchards to the best of our knowledge there are studies focused on hydro economic significances of climate change hurd and coonrod 2012 ward et al 2019 and climate change effects on the streamflow volume chavarria and gutzler 2018 in the rio grande basin thus the main objectives of the present research are to 1 evaluate the impact of climate change on the duration of growing season for the pecan in the lrgv 2 evaluate the impact of climate change on pecan eta 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this research was conducted in new mexico s lrgv which is a part of the rio grande basin fig 1 the lrgv is located in south central new mexico extending from elephant butte dam to the borders of texas and chihuahua mexico agriculture is the major land use in the lrgv the climate in the lrgv is arid continental with 203 255 mm of annual precipitation office of the state engineer 2017 average annual temperatures are around 16 24 c river water from the rio grande is the main water supply in the lrgv accounting on average for about 60 of irrigation water used by agriculture the groundwater accounts for about 40 of the total withdrawals in the lrgv where a significant percent of the groundwater use is also used for irrigated agriculture office of the state engineer 2017 however the surface water availability is highly variable and in some years as much as 80 90 of the agricultural water use comes from groundwater office of the state engineer 2017 2 2 data collection and processing in order to calculate the duration of growing season dgs for the pecan minimum and maximum temperature data were obtained from noaa s national centers for environmental information for new mexico state university station 32 2823 106 7598 over a 119 years period pecan growing season start up temperature is the average daily temperature of 15 6 c pessarakli 2014 the end of the season temperature is when the minimum temperature drops below 3 9 c pessarakli 2014 to calculate the dgs days with average and minimum temperatures higher than 15 6 c and 3 9 c were respectively counted for each year separately to calculate eta et0 was first calculated using hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 as follow 1 et 0 0 0023 ra t c 17 8 td 0 5 where et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm d ra is the extraterrestrial radiation representing the amount of solar energy received at any latitude above the atmosphere tc is the average of daily maximum and minimum temperatures c and td is the difference between daily maximum and minimum temperatures c to validate the performance of the hargreaves samani equation in lrgv the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 which is the most precise method was used as follows 2 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm d rn is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 d

pressure kpa es ea is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 quantitative measures including the root mean square error rmse and the index of agreement d willmott 1981 were used to assess the hargreaves samani equation s performance as follows 3 rmse i 1 n s i m i 2 n 4 d 1 0 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n s i m avg m i m avg 2 where rmse is the root mean square error d is the index of agreement n is the number of paired values s i is the ith value of et0 for hargreaves samani model m i is the ith value of et0 for fao penman monteith model and m avg is the average of et0 values for fao penman monteith model in addition growing degree days gdd was calculated for each day of each year using pessarakli 2014 as follows 5 gdd t max t min 2 t base where tmax is the maximum daily temperature tmin is the minimum daily temperature and tbase is the minimum start up base temperature the non parametric statistical methods including mann kendall mann 1945 kendall 1975 and sen s slope estimator sen 1968 were used to detect the climate variable s trends based on the mann kendall test method the standard normal test statistic zs was calculated positive and negative values of zs show increasing and decreasing trends respectively testing trends was performed at different α significance levels including 0 01 and 0 05 in this test if z s 1 96 the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected at the 5 confidence level and rejected at the 1 confidence level if z s 2 576 following the sen s test method the slope of trend q was computed the q sign shows data trend reflection and its value shows the slop of the trend these methods have been frequently used to determine if the trend is significant further explanation of these methodologies can be found in gocic and trajkovic 2013 daily measured mature pecan crop coefficient kc for year 2003 based on eddy covariance flux tower measurement as reported by samani and bawazir 2009 were used the crop coefficient measurements were conducted in a commercial pecan orchard where irrigation water management was based on soil moisture monitoring assuring no moisture deficiencies the rainfall in the area is insignificant and the crop growth during the growing season is based on continuous flood irrigation the regression between kc and cumulative gdd was developed using daily 2003 growing season kc and calculated cumulative gdd fig 2 with respect to this regression daily kc over the whole study period was estimated inversely using calculated cumulative gdd eta was calculated using estimated kc and et0 as follows pessarakli 2014 6 et a k c et 0 3 results and discussion fig 3 shows the daily eto calculated from hargreaves samani equation 1985 in estimating et0 compared with the fao penman monteith equation which is a reference method to estimate et0 allen et al 1998 in lrgv during the 2003 growing season the results showed that hargreaves samani model is capable to estimate et0 in lrgv properly compared with the fao penman monteith equation fig 3 statistical measures including rmse 0 93 mm and d 0 95 also validated the hargreaves samani model as an appropriate tool for estimating et0 in lrgv the reason to use hargreaves samani equation to calculate reference eto was the lack of detailed climatic data required for the fao penman monteith equation for the period of study the fao penman monteith equation is the most accurate and capable model in estimating et0 when compared with other equations in various regions requiring several variables makes the model complex and inefficient where variables are not complete and or not available fig 4 shows the dgs for the pecan over a 119 year period tables 1 3 illustrate the main variations in dgs et0 and eta using statistical tests including mann kendall and sen s slope estimator over the study period respectively dgs decreased gradually over the first 50 years and a 29 days decease in dgs was observed for 1901 1950 years then dgs increased quite sharply by 70 days from 1950 to 2019 fig 4 and table 1 these trends were statistically significant at the 1 significant level table 1 the reasons for these phenomena could be explained by declining temperature in the lrgv in the first 50 years and also increasing temperature since about 1950 although increasing dgs can result in earlier planting complete maturing and possible multiple planting for annual crops it can negatively affect crop production in growing areas where the water available for irrigation is limited increased dgs may cause slight yield reduction in warmer areas as increasing temperature accelerates plant development which can cause decreasing time to build up nut dry matter acia 2004 for the pecan the dgs in hermosillo and sonora is much longer than the dgs in lrgv but the pecan yield in these regions is as good as it is in lrgv dgs also can be an indicator for climate change where permanent increases in dgs may cause long term increases in carbon storage and changes in vegetation cover linderholm 2006 fig 5 illustrates the variations of seasonal et0 and eta for a mature pecan with no moisture restriction during different dgs over a 119 years period also fig 6 shows temporal variations of average daily eta for various months during three different decades within the study period similar to dgs variations both seasonal et0 and eta followed significant decreasing and increasing trends for the first 50 years and the rest of the period respectively fig 5 tables 2 and 3 the same trends were observed for seasonal et0 and eta with different slopes and lower values for eta fig 5 tables 2 and 3 findings showed that seasonal eta increased significantly by 124 mm between 1950 and 2019 years fig 5 and table 3 this reflected a seasonal eta increase of about 10 during this period also results showed that april and october experienced the highest temporal variations in average daily eta in 2010 2019 compared with 1940 1949 83 and 40 increases respectively fig 6 as discussed earlier increased seasonal eta can be explained by both warmer temperatures throughout the growing season in the lrgv and longer growing seasons increasing eta can potentially increase yield due to longer growing seasons but could have adverse effects on pecan s productivity due to reduced chill period increased vivipary and delayed harvesting global warming can potentially decrease yield through reducing winter chill which is required for productivity of fruit and nut trees luedeling et al 2009 according to luedeling et al 2009 insufficient winter chill can severely decrease crop yield and crop quality in addition insufficient winter chill can cause changes in crop sizes and maturity stages in harvesting which result in reducing yield amount and value chandler 1942 vegis 1961 an important challenge would be the increased demand for eta which will put more strains on water resources including groundwater the lrgv is located in a semiarid to arid climate zone where surface water for irrigation is becoming insufficient secondly shortage in irrigation water requirement for the pecan may cause a situation where the pecan trees face physiological water stress which will result in yield reduction directly 4 conclusion this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of climate change on the dgs and eta of pecan in lrgv over a period of 119 years where climate data were available the hargreaves samani equation was validated by comparing the results with fao penman monteith equation rmse 0 93 mm and d 0 95 statistical results for the dgs showed a significant decreasing trend over the first 50 year period as a result of decreases in temperature while an increasing trend in the dgs was observed because of increases in temperature for the rest of the period increasing the dgs could have a negative impact in pecan productivity by putting pressures on limited water resources for irrigation in lrgv also pecan productivity might be affected by increased dgs because of decreasing time to build up nut dry matter the same significant declining and increasing trends were detected for seasonal et0 and eta for the first 50 years and the rest of the period at the 1 significant level respectively results showed the seasonal eta enhanced noticeably by 124 mm because of increases in temperature between 1950 and 2019 increase in seasonal eta may put pressure on limited water resources in lrgv to compensate extra irrigation water requirement in order to prevent water stress for the pecan which will cause yield reductions continuous increases in both dgs and eta may have significant impact on the viability of pecan production and its economic sustainability in the area in addition to causing severe stress on the limited water resources in the area the results from this study showed the climate change effects in lrgv has been taking place for the study period the onset of the climate change appears to coincide with the 2nd industrial revolution in the united states according to

seasonal et0 and eta for a mature pecan with no moisture restriction during different dgs over a 119 years period also fig 6 shows temporal variations of average daily eta for various months during three different decades within the study period similar to dgs variations both seasonal et0 and eta followed significant decreasing and increasing trends for the first 50 years and the rest of the period respectively fig 5 tables 2 and 3 the same trends were observed for seasonal et0 and eta with different slopes and lower values for eta fig 5 tables 2 and 3 findings showed that seasonal eta increased significantly by 124 mm between 1950 and 2019 years fig 5 and table 3 this reflected a seasonal eta increase of about 10 during this period also results showed that april and october experienced the highest temporal variations in average daily eta in 2010 2019 compared with 1940 1949 83 and 40 increases respectively fig 6 as discussed earlier increased seasonal eta can be explained by both warmer temperatures throughout the growing season in the lrgv and longer growing seasons increasing eta can potentially increase yield due to longer growing seasons but could have adverse effects on pecan s productivity due to reduced chill period increased vivipary and delayed harvesting global warming can potentially decrease yield through reducing winter chill which is required for productivity of fruit and nut trees luedeling et al 2009 according to luedeling et al 2009 insufficient winter chill can severely decrease crop yield and crop quality in addition insufficient winter chill can cause changes in crop sizes and maturity stages in harvesting which result in reducing yield amount and value chandler 1942 vegis 1961 an important challenge would be the increased demand for eta which will put more strains on water resources including groundwater the lrgv is located in a semiarid to arid climate zone where surface water for irrigation is becoming insufficient secondly shortage in irrigation water requirement for the pecan may cause a situation where the pecan trees face physiological water stress which will result in yield reduction directly 4 conclusion this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of climate change on the dgs and eta of pecan in lrgv over a period of 119 years where climate data were available the hargreaves samani equation was validated by comparing the results with fao penman monteith equation rmse 0 93 mm and d 0 95 statistical results for the dgs showed a significant decreasing trend over the first 50 year period as a result of decreases in temperature while an increasing trend in the dgs was observed because of increases in temperature for the rest of the period increasing the dgs could have a negative impact in pecan productivity by putting pressures on limited water resources for irrigation in lrgv also pecan productivity might be affected by increased dgs because of decreasing time to build up nut dry matter the same significant declining and increasing trends were detected for seasonal et0 and eta for the first 50 years and the rest of the period at the 1 significant level respectively results showed the seasonal eta enhanced noticeably by 124 mm because of increases in temperature between 1950 and 2019 increase in seasonal eta may put pressure on limited water resources in lrgv to compensate extra irrigation water requirement in order to prevent water stress for the pecan which will cause yield reductions continuous increases in both dgs and eta may have significant impact on the viability of pecan production and its economic sustainability in the area in addition to causing severe stress on the limited water resources in the area the results from this study showed the climate change effects in lrgv has been taking place for the study period the onset of the climate change appears to coincide with the 2nd industrial revolution in the united states according to

10077,the effect of pre harvest deficit irrigation was studied as a tool to reduce fruit moisture and evaluate its influence on fruit characteristics oil yield extraction and oil quality two regulated deficit irrigation treatments rdi were evaluated over two seasons in a cv genovesa olive orchard this study included a control treatment irrigated at 100 crop evapotranspiration over the season and two rdi treatments irrigated at 50 rdi1 and 30 rdi2 of control these treatments were applied from the end of pit hardening mid january until harvest early april when oil is accumulated in fruits fruit moisture decreased as the deficit irrigation period advanced being significantly lower in rdi2 and rdi1 than in the control treatment fruits harvested from the rdi2 treatment had lower moisture dry mass and oil deposition and higher maturation and pulp flavonoid compounds concentration than in rdi1 and control pooled data across seasons showed that a 1 reduction in fruit moisture produced an increase of 0 16 in oil yield extraction phenolic compounds increased consistently with fruit moisture decreasing from 60 to 50 however when fruit moisture was as low as 35 phenolic compounds were the lowest additional fruit samples from rdi2 were processed with water addition after malaxation water addition led to a general pattern of increases in oil yield extraction reduction of phenolic compounds and no influence on acidity uv indexes or fatty acids profile keywords olea europaea l fruit moisture maturity index phenolic compounds fatty acids profile 1 introduction olive oil consumption has been steadily increasing worldwide over the last 20 years ioc 2016 this is due to different reasons mainly consumers growing knowledge about its organoleptic nutritional and therapeutic properties within the mediterranean and non producing countries sala vila et al 2015 numerous studies have shown evidence that the beneficial properties of olive oil are related to the high content of antioxidant compounds and monounsaturated fatty acids eg sala vila et al 2015 recently the phenolic compounds of olive fruits and oil and their relation to antioxidant anti carcinogenic and organoleptic bitter and pungent attributes have attracted considerable attention llorente cortés et al 2010 olive oil phenolic compounds in particular and oil quality in general are affected by many factors such as cultivar environmental conditions orchard management and processing technology servili et al 2004 among cultural practices the influence of irrigation on oil quality has been extensively investigated in different olive cultivars and environments in olive crop a general pattern was observed in which water deficit application during any fruit growth period led to slight or no impact on oil free acidity peroxide value spectrophotometric indices and fatty acid composition but to marked increases in oil phenolic compounds caruso et al 2014 patumi et al 1999 however this relationship is far from universal and the oil quality response can vary according to water deficit exposure time severity and duration water deficit applied during early fruit development seems to produce a more consistent increase in oil phenolic concentration regarding high responsiveness of fruit phenolic synthesis alagna et al 2012 lémole et al 2018 by contrast the effect of water deficit applied during the fruit oil accumulation period on oil phenolic concentration is less clear there is evidence of increase e g gómez rico et al 2007 vidal et al 2019 or reduction e g garcía et al 2020 where environmental conditions and harvest time play a key role sainz et al 2019 water deficit before harvest may increase the concentration of oil phenolic compounds by a reduction of fruit moisture leading to lower losses of fruit phenolic compounds during oil extraction dag et al 2008 olive fruits have high phenolic concentration however only a very low proportion 0 1 2 is transferred to olive oil during the industrial process mainly because phenolic compounds are more soluble in the water than oil phase jerman klen et al 2015 talhaoui et al 2016 evaluated the phenolic concentration and composition of fruits and derived oil from six olive cultivars the authors found that the transfer rate from fruits to oil was highly associated with fruit moisture rather than phenolic concentration in fruits in arid environments such as those used for olive cultivation in argentina deficit irrigation strategies could be managed in different fruit growth periods depending on irrigation objectives such as vegetative growth control and water savings trentacoste et al 2019 pierantozzi et al 2020 evaluated four irrigation levels applied 2 months prior to pit hardening i e late spring in an intensive olive cv genovesa orchard in central western argentina under similar conditions to those reported here the authors observed that spring water deficit affected vegetative growth with a slight effect on oil production although no information was provided on oil quality few studies have focused on evaluating water deficit strategies carried out before harvest this can be explained by the fact that pre harvest water deficit is related to a reduction in fruit oil accumulation tognetti et al 2006 hueso et al 2019 and lower efficiency of mechanical harvesting dag et al 2008 in addition autumn rainfall is frequent in the mediterranean climate where much of the olive research has been carried out from an industrial viewpoint pre harvest water deficit could reduce fruit moisture and increase oil extraction compensating for lower fruit oil content it has the additional advantage of a potential increase in the transfer of phenolic compounds although other characteristics such as fatty acids profile must also be evaluated garcía et al 2020 fruit moisture is highly responsive to plant water status and environmental conditions trentacoste et al 2012 dag et al 2015 observed in some experimental seasons that the response of oil phenolic concentration to water deficit regimes was altered by a change in fruit moisture just before harvest as a consequence of rainfall understanding the influence of irrigation regimen and environmental conditions is fundamental to designing irrigation strategies focused on olive oil quality the aims of the present study were to determine the impact of pre harvest deficit irrigation applied during the oil accumulation period in olive cv genovesa on i maturity oil water and flavonoid compounds in fruit and ii on yield extraction fatty acids and phenolic compounds in oil to deepen the knowledge about the effect of fruit moisture on oil quality an additional treatment was incorporated in which distilled water was added during the industrial processing of olives from the severe water deficit treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 site and orchard the study was carried out during seasons 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 in a commercial olive cv genovesa orchard in cañada honda valley 31º 58 s 68º 32 w 614 m a s l san juan argentina the orchard was established in 2011 with rows oriented n s and trees spaced 3 5 mx7 0 m 408treesha 1 the climate of the region is arid with an annual rainfall of 195 mm concentrated in the summer months and an average annual temperature of 18 5 c the soil is sandy loam with high gravel content less than 0 8 m of depth daily meteorological data recorded at an automated weather station located near the experimental site included maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity and rainfall 2 2 irrigation treatments and experimental design three irrigation regimes were established a control and two regulated deficit irrigation rdi treatments control irrigation corrected for effective rainfall was applied to restore 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc over the whole growing season from bud break to post harvest etc was calculated as 1 etc eto kc kr where eto is reference evapotranspiration calculated with penman monteith modified by fao allen et al 1998 kc is a seasonally constant crop coefficient 0 68 girona et al 2002 and kr is an empirical coefficient to account for changing crop cover fereres et al 1981 it was calculated as 2 x canopy east west width row spacing canopy width was measured in all studied trees in spring

rainfall was estimated daily as daily rainfall 0 80 puertas 2009 in both rdi treatments two periods were identified period i covered from bud break august 22 2017 august 27 2018 to the end of pit hardening january 23 2018 january 16 2019 period ii also referred to as pre harvest covered the fruit oil accumulation period i e from the end of pit hardening until harvest on april 4 2018 and april 8 2019 during period i rdi treatments were irrigated just as the control treatment during period ii rdi treatments were irrigated 50 control rdi1 and 30 control rdi2 after harvest both rdi treatments were irrigated as the control irrigation was supplied with a double irrigation line per row spaced 1 m apart with 2 0 l h 1 emitters spaced at 0 8 m each rdi1 and rdi2 plot had one valve to control operating time according to each treatment a plot with homogeneous tree crowns was selected within a commercial olive orchard nine experimental plots were chosen which consisted of four trees using the two central trees for data collection three irrigation treatments were arranged in a completely randomized design with three replicates 2 3 olive harvest and fruit characteristics every 2 weeks from mid january 20 fruits were extracted from each replicate the fruits were packed and placed in a portable refrigerator until processing fruits were fresh weighed and then oven dried at 60 c for 72 h to determine dry weight and fruit moisture fm fig 1 all olives from each tree were manually harvested on april 4 2018 and april 8 2019 olive fruits from both trees per replicate were pooled and used to determine fruit characteristics and olive milling study from a 2 kg sample 100 fruits were weighed to determine their average fresh weight afterwards fruits were oven dried at 60 c to constant weight in order to estimate fruit dry weight and fm maturity index mi was determined in another subsample of 100 fruits by classifying them from 0 to 7 according to skin and pulp color beltrán et al 2004 later 50 fruits were used to determine fruit oil concentration foc and another 50 fruits were used to determine pulp pit ratio in the laboratory oil concentration was measured in triplicate in each replicate using the method of avidan et al 1999 it was estimated as the quotient in percentage of oil weight and pulp weight on fresh focfb and dry focdb basis flavonoid compounds in fruits were determined by the modified method of zhishen et al 1999 for extraction a sample of 4 g of pulp was added to 10 ml of methanol water solution 4 1 vol vol the mixture was shaken for 24 h at 180 rpm and

replicate and subjected to oil extraction in the case ofrdi2 two samples of 15 kg 2017 2018 and 12 kg 2018 2019 were taken per replicate each fruit sample was individually crushed with an oliomio hammer mill toscana enologica mori tavernelle val di pesa italy the olive paste was subjected to malaxation at 25 c for 30 min oil was extracted using a two phase decanter with a work capacity of 20 kg h 1 oil extraction was performed without added heat or water at any phase of the process in each treatment an additional sample was used to clean the hammer mill and that oil was not evaluated oil yield extraction was estimated as the ratio between oil weight and fruit sample weight refer to table 3 the additional samples separated from the rdi2 treatment were used to study the effect of initial water content in the olive paste on oil yield extraction and oil quality in this new treatment called rdi2w during oil extraction and before centrifugation distilled water was added so that paste moisture was equal to the control treatment measured in each year the added water was determined by a mass balance approach based on fruit moisture determination for this 20 fruits per replicate from control and rdi2 treatments were weighed immediately after harvest then they were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h reweighed and fruit moisture was calculated 2 5 analytical indexes free acidity

weight and moisture daily and accumulated seasonal rainfall is shown in table 1 and fig 1 rainfall in 2017 2018 193 mm and 2018 2019 174 mm was close between the two periods and the long term average of 195 mm period 2014 2019 as usual in san juan province rainfall was concentrated between december and may additionally about 50 of the total rainfall occurred during period ii january to early april when deficit irrigation treatments were applied table 1 the main difference between seasons was rainfall distribution during period ii fig 1 in 2017 2018 an important event of 38 mm occurred on april 1st that is 3 days before harvest in 2018 2019 rains were evenly concentrated in january at the beginning of period ii seasonal applied water in periods i and ii are reported in table 1 during 2017 2018 in period ii rdi1 and rdi2 treatments replaced 67 and 40 of irrigation plus effective rainfall higher than the planned 50 and 30 of the control treatment total applied water savings sum of periods i and ii for rdi1 and rdi2 treatments compared to control amounted to 17 and 28 respectively in 2018 2019 rdi1 and rdi2 treatments replaced 63 and 47 of irrigation plus effective rainfall compared to control in period ii this resulted in total applied water savings of 20 and 28 respectively for rdi1 and rdi2 treatments the dynamics of fruit dry weight and moisture were responsive to pre harvest irrigation regimes as well as to rainfall events fig 1 in 2017 2018 control and rdi1 fruit dry weight increased linearly during period ii to a maximum reached in mid march after which it remained stable until harvest fruit moisture showed the opposite pattern it decreased from early january to a minimum in mid march of 58 and 54 in control and rdi1 respectively remaining low and stable until harvest under rdi2 fruit growth was rapidly reduced and peaked earlier in early march in turn fruit moisture decreased to a minimum of 34 at sampling in mid march but increased rapidly to 54 after rainfall just before harvest in 2018 2019 under control and rdi1 fruit dry weight increased throughout period ii to the maximum at harvest fruits from rdi2 showed a similar pattern but reached the maximum earlier in mid march fruit moisture declined linearly throughout period ii to values about 50 in control and rdi1 in rdi2 fruit moisture was similar to control from mid january until mid february decreasing strongly to 35 at harvest 3 2 fruit characteristics and flavonoid compounds at harvest control and rdi1 trees had a similar yield in 2018 20 6 kg and 23 2 kgtree 1 respectively and in 2019 16 6 kg and 16 3 kg tree 1 respectively higher than rdi2 15 7 kg and 13 4 kgtree 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively fruit characteristics were affected by water deficit more evidently in 2017 2018 than in 2018 2019 when fruit growth and moisture responded later in period ii fig 1 table 2 during the 2017 2018 season fruits from rdi1 and control trees had similar dry weight oil concentration fresh basis and flavonoid concentration in pulp fresh weight by contrast rdi2 had lower fresh weight oil concentration dry basis and pulp pit ratio than control mi was higher for the rdi2 treatment followed by rdi1 and control flavonoid concentration measured in fresh pulp was higher in rdi2 than in rdi1 and control treatments fruit moisture from control 58 was significantly higher than both rdi1 and rdi2 average 54 treatments the 2018 2019 season fruits from rdi1 and control showed similar characteristics but fruits from rdi1 had lower fm and pulp pit ratio than control the rdi2 treatment produced fruits with significantly lower fresh weight pulp pit ratio moisture and oil concentration on fresh basis and higher maturation than control and rdi1 in this second season fruit dry weight oil concentration on dry basis and pulp flavonoid compounds were not affected by irrigation regimens 3 3 oil yield extraction by milling during oil elaboration olive paste from the three treatments was processed with no additional water a new treatment was included rdi2w in which olive paste from rdi2 trees was processed with added water to obtain a matrix with similar moisture to control table 3 the 2017 2018 irrigation regimens did not affect oil yield extraction including the rdi2w treatment to which 1 3 kg water or 8 paste dilution was added yield extraction of the 2018 2019 season was not affected by pre harvest deficit irrigation however in this season the addition to rdi2w of 4 2 kg of water or 34 paste dilution led to a marked rise 24 in oil yield extraction 3 4 oil quality phenolic compounds and fatty acids composition oil acidity ranged from 0 19 to 0 21 oleic acid for the different irrigation treatments and seasons evaluated table 4 pre harvest deficit irrigation had no significant influence on acidity in both seasons by contrast spectrometric uv indexes increased significantly with deficit irrigation increasing in 2017 2018 but not in 2018 2019 peroxide values for season 2017 2018 did not show significant differences among treatments as shown in table 4 peroxide values for season 2018 2019 were similar for control and rdi1 treatments while values increased for rdi2 and rdi2w treatments with significant differences between them the acidity uv indexes and peroxide values of all the samples were well below those established by the international olive council for extra virgin olive oil oil phenolic compounds were affected by irrigation but with the opposite pattern in 2017 2018 the concentration of total phenolic compounds increased slightly by 12 on average in rdi1 and rdi2 compared to control in 2018 2019 oil from control had 9 and 34 higher total phenolic compounds than rd1 and rd2 respectively oil flavonoid compounds were not affected by irrigation oil from rdi2w treatment showed similar acidity and uv spectrophotometric indexes but lower total phenolic compounds than its rdi2 counterpart fatty acids composition was slightly affected by irrigation but there was no clear response to irrigation treatments between seasons the percentage of palmitic acid in 2017 2018 decreased with an increasing irrigation deficit but this behavior was not observed in 2018 2019 in turn oleic and stearic acids were higher as the irrigation deficit increased however in the season 2018 2019 oleic acid did not show a clear behavior but stearic acid behaved the same way in both study seasons linoleic another main fatty acid did not show a clear behavior in response to irrigation treatments in any of the seasons under study table 4 the response to irrigation treatments of palmitoleic acid was stable for the 2018 2019 season with no statistical difference by contrast in the 2017 2018 season a slight increase could be observed with water stress in rdi1 which then decreased with a more marked deficit in rdi2 3 5 relationship among fruit characteristics oil extraction and phenolic compounds concentration fruit moisture decreased with increasing fruit maturity r2 0 79 fig 2 and fruit oil concentration on fresh basis r2 0 80 fig 2 during olive oil processing oil yield extraction increased with a slope of 0 16 per unit change in fruit moisture decrease r2 0 89 fig 2 and 0 35 per unit change in fruit oil concentration increase r2 0 82 pulp flavonoid concentration was closely associated with fruit maturity increase y 60 6x 53 3 r2 0 82 p 0 013 and was not significantly associated with fruit moisture r2 0 42 p 0 162 oil phenolic compounds concentration was negatively related to fruit moisture r2 0 81 fig 2 in this relationship fruits obtained from rdi2 in 2018 2019 showed both the lowest moisture 34 and phenolic compounds concentration 224 mg kg 1 these data were not considered in the fruit moisture vs oil phenolic compounds relationship 4 discussion different irrigation treatments from end of pit hardening to harvest were applied to generate a wide range of variation in fruit moisture as a useful framework to investigate fruit moisture impacts on other fruit materials oil and mass oil extraction and quality the study area is characterized by scarce annual rainfall lower than 200 mm and a summer autumn period period ii with high evaporative demand and some intense rainfall events e g early april 2018 4 1 pre harvest water deficit on fruit characteristics and oil extraction fruit moisture decreased gradually as the deficit irrigation progressed in period ii fruit moisture in rdi2 was significantly lower than in rdi1 and control treatments the decrease in moisture was faster in the season 2017 2018 than in 2018 2019 probably due to rains that occurred at the beginning of the irrigation treatments our results seem to indicate that fruit moisture responds to a change in plant water status or soil moisture as proposed by hueso et al 2019 these authors evaluated different water deficit levels in olive cv arbequina applied 2 months before harvest they observed that fruit moisture decreases close and linearly below threshold plant water status measured as stem water potential of 2 0 mpa measurements of stem water potential from the beginning of the water deﬁcit treatments would allow a better understanding of the impact of water deficit moment and intensity on changes in fruit materials the rain event that took place in april 2018 revealed that the dynamics of fruit moisture during period ii were largely reversible it also showed that fruits from rdi2 increased rapidly from 35 to 54 close to the fruit moisture achieved in rdi1 and control treatments rapid fruit rehydration had been observed in olives previously gómez del campo et al 2014 noticed that fruit dehydration measured as fruit moisture and mesocarp cell area due to severe summer water deficit was rapidly recovered at the control level when all treatments were well irrigated during autumn interestingly we observed that olive fruits keep their rehydration capacity in advanced maturity stages fig 1 in some grapevine cultivars berry shrinkage during late ripening may be driven by xylem functional and anatomic changes reducing their rehydration capacity bondada et al 2005 the reduction of fruit moisture in rdi2 during period ii was accompanied by a decrease in dry mass and oil accumulation in 2018 but not in 2019 a likely explanation is that the water deficit in 2019 occurred after considerable fruit growth and oil accumulation took place in addition fruit moisture showed a more sensitive response to water deficit than mass and oil accumulation as demonstrated by hueso et al 2019 this differential sensitivity may provide an opportunity to develop late water deficit to control fruit moisture with a slight reduction in oil accumulation according to the extraction advantage of processing olives with lower moisture and oil quality discussed further on fruit maturity response to water deficit was higher in 2017 2018 when trees showed greater fruit load as noted by garcía et al 2020 we studied flavonoid compounds because they constitute one of the most abundant olive phenolic compounds groups at the end of olive ripening talhaoui et al 2015 deficit irrigation affected flavonoid concentration in fresh olive pulp but as a consequence of the direct effect of water deficit on fruit maturity sainz et al 2019 fruit moisture and oil yield extraction were inversely related fig 2 this is consistent with the literature where an increase in olive paste moisture increases the difficulty for oil extraction at least above a moisture value greater than 20 30 cecchi et al 2019 the inverse relationship between fruit moisture and oil yield extraction has been noted but seldom quantified in numerous studies the actual slope of the relationship where a reduction of 1 in fruit moisture produced an increase of 0 16 in oil yield extraction for a fruit moisture range of 35 60 is relevant from an industrial viewpoint to devise orchard management strategies for further industrial oil yield improvement this relationship is not universal and depends on cultivar characteristics beltrán et al 2003 thus requiring further study 4 2 pre harvest water deficit on oil quality oil acidity was not inﬂuenced by water deficit consistent with several previous studies that focused on the effect of water supply on olive crops eg garcía et al 2020 by contrast a significant trend of increasing spectrophotometric uv indexes k232 with increasing water deficit was observed only in 2017 2018 which coincides with the results obtained by ahumada orellana et al 2018 and gómez rico et al 2007 conversely oil phenolic compounds concentration responded the opposite in the two seasons studied table 4 however pooled data from both seasons revealed two important aspects that may explain contrasting outcomes fig 2 firstly phenolic compounds concentration increased with the decrease in fruit moisture at harvest within the range of 60 50 the positive effect of water deficit on oil phenolic compounds concentration has been widely reported in olive trees e g ahumada orellana et al 2018 secondly when fruit moisture was the lowest i e 35 from rdi2 oil phenolic compounds concentration was also the lowest a similar general pattern has been reported in olive crops by cecchi et al 2019 the authors determined in two olive cultivars that oil phenolic compounds concentration increased with paste moisture increasing to a maximum of 40 this is due to the limitation of the enzymatic processes that promote the liberation of phenolic compounds from fruits as paste moisture increased above 40 oil phenolic compounds concentration decreased due to substrate and enzyme dilution in olive vegetation water the main fatty acids profile showed a variable pattern between seasons and sometimes opposite patterns in response to irrigation regimens table 4 however all the samples were consistent with the extra virgin olive oil category limit indicated in table 4 in this study oleic acid increased with water deficit irrigation during the season 2017 2018 this behavior had been previously observed by sánchez rodríguez et al 2019 in olives however this increase was not observed in the season 2018 2019 stearic and linoleic acids had a stable behavior in both seasons increasing with deficit irrigation while linoleic acid had a non specific behavior according to the season at the same time pooled data from both seasons showed a non significant relationship between the main fatty acids and fruit moisture and maturity not shown these results coincide with various authors who observed an inconsistent impact of water deficit on fatty acids between seasons inglese et al 1996 garcía et al 2020 in olive trees the influence of the environment on fatty acids has received attention recently for example lémole et al 2018 studied artificial shading 50 of isolated arbequina trees over the entire growing season and for three short intermediate periods the study revealed that shading from pit hardening to harvest was the most critical period for fatty acids determination thus the complex interaction among inter annual environmental variation crop load and fruit maturation may have played an important role in explaining contrasting fatty acids among seasons to deepen the knowledge about paste moisture management on the farm or during industrial oil processing we processed two pastes with the same moisture level viz control and rdi2w in rdi2w however paste moisture was achieved by adding water after malaxation simulating the three phase industrial oil extraction method our results revealed that water addition prior to oil separation had a great impact on increasing oil yield extraction this was the case in the second year when water dilution was approximately 30 but not in the first year when dilution was lower than 10 in line with the findings previously reported by amirante et al 2001 our results also showed that oil from rdi2w with water addition had similar acidity uv indexes and fatty acids profile to rdi2 without water addition however oil from rdi2w had higher peroxide values and lower phenolic compounds than rdi2 similar to the various studies comparing oil quality using two and three phase centrifuges di giovacchino et al 2001 5 conclusions the present study indicates that pre harvest water deficit can be used to manage fruit moisture but responsiveness is highly dependent on rainfall events occurring just before harvest this experiment has identified that fruit moisture of about 50 at harvest leads to maximum oil yield extraction and phenolic compounds concentration further work with paste obtained from fruits with a wider moisture range and from other olive cultivars is required to confirm these conclusions the fatty acids composition response to pre harvest water deficit was inconsistent and other factors such as environmental and fruit crop conditions played an important role an additional experiment in which distilled water was added to compensate for fruit water loss in the crop suggests that managing fruit moisture on the farm differs considerably from managing water during industrial oil processing in this case the added water was related with a marked increase in extraction but with a reduction in phenolic compound concentration our study

10077,the effect of pre harvest deficit irrigation was studied as a tool to reduce fruit moisture and evaluate its influence on fruit characteristics oil yield extraction and oil quality two regulated deficit irrigation treatments rdi were evaluated over two seasons in a cv genovesa olive orchard this study included a control treatment irrigated at 100 crop evapotranspiration over the season and two rdi treatments irrigated at 50 rdi1 and 30 rdi2 of control these treatments were applied from the end of pit hardening mid january until harvest early april when oil is accumulated in fruits fruit moisture decreased as the deficit irrigation period advanced being significantly lower in rdi2 and rdi1 than in the control treatment fruits harvested from the rdi2 treatment had lower moisture dry mass and oil deposition and higher maturation and pulp flavonoid compounds concentration than in rdi1 and control pooled data across seasons showed that a 1 reduction in fruit moisture produced an increase of 0 16 in oil yield extraction phenolic compounds increased consistently with fruit moisture decreasing from 60 to 50 however when fruit moisture was as low as 35 phenolic compounds were the lowest additional fruit samples from rdi2 were processed with water addition after malaxation water addition led to a general pattern of increases in oil yield extraction reduction of phenolic compounds and no influence on acidity uv indexes or fatty acids profile keywords olea europaea l fruit moisture maturity index phenolic compounds fatty acids profile 1 introduction olive oil consumption has been steadily increasing worldwide over the last 20 years ioc 2016 this is due to different reasons mainly consumers growing knowledge about its organoleptic nutritional and therapeutic properties within the mediterranean and non producing countries sala vila et al 2015 numerous studies have shown evidence that the beneficial properties of olive oil are related to the high content of antioxidant compounds and monounsaturated fatty acids eg sala vila et al 2015 recently the phenolic compounds of olive fruits and oil and their relation to antioxidant anti carcinogenic and organoleptic bitter and pungent attributes have attracted considerable attention llorente cortés et al 2010 olive oil phenolic compounds in particular and oil quality in general are affected by many factors such as cultivar environmental conditions orchard management and processing technology servili et al 2004 among cultural practices the influence of irrigation on oil quality has been extensively investigated in different olive cultivars and environments in olive crop a general pattern was observed in which water deficit application during any fruit growth period led to slight or no impact on oil free acidity peroxide value spectrophotometric indices and fatty acid composition but to marked increases in oil phenolic compounds caruso et al 2014 patumi et al 1999 however this relationship is far from universal and the oil quality response can vary according to water deficit exposure time severity and duration water deficit applied during early fruit development seems to produce a more consistent increase in oil phenolic concentration regarding high responsiveness of fruit phenolic synthesis alagna et al 2012 lémole et al 2018 by contrast the effect of water deficit applied during the fruit oil accumulation period on oil phenolic concentration is less clear there is evidence of increase e g gómez rico et al 2007 vidal et al 2019 or reduction e g garcía et al 2020 where environmental conditions and harvest time play a key role sainz et al 2019 water deficit before harvest may increase the concentration of oil phenolic compounds by a reduction of fruit moisture leading to lower losses of fruit phenolic compounds during oil extraction dag et al 2008 olive fruits have high phenolic concentration however only a very low proportion 0 1 2 is transferred to olive oil during the industrial process mainly because phenolic compounds are more soluble in the water than oil phase jerman klen et al 2015 talhaoui et al 2016 evaluated the phenolic concentration and composition of fruits and derived oil from six olive cultivars the authors found that the transfer rate from fruits to oil was highly associated with fruit moisture rather than phenolic concentration in fruits in arid environments such as those used for olive cultivation in argentina deficit irrigation strategies could be managed in different fruit growth periods depending on irrigation objectives such as vegetative growth control and water savings trentacoste et al 2019 pierantozzi et al 2020 evaluated four irrigation levels applied 2 months prior to pit hardening i e late spring in an intensive olive cv genovesa orchard in central western argentina under similar conditions to those reported here the authors observed that spring water deficit affected vegetative growth with a slight effect on oil production although no information was provided on oil quality few studies have focused on evaluating water deficit strategies carried out before harvest this can be explained by the fact that pre harvest water deficit is related to a reduction in fruit oil accumulation tognetti et al 2006 hueso et al 2019 and lower efficiency of mechanical harvesting dag et al 2008 in addition autumn rainfall is frequent in the mediterranean climate where much of the olive research has been carried out from an industrial viewpoint pre harvest water deficit could reduce fruit moisture and increase oil extraction compensating for lower fruit oil content it has the additional advantage of a potential increase in the transfer of phenolic compounds although other characteristics such as fatty acids profile must also be evaluated garcía et al 2020 fruit moisture is highly responsive to plant water status and environmental conditions trentacoste et al 2012 dag et al 2015 observed in some experimental seasons that the response of oil phenolic concentration to water deficit regimes was altered by a change in fruit moisture just before harvest as a consequence of rainfall understanding the influence of irrigation regimen and environmental conditions is fundamental to designing irrigation strategies focused on olive oil quality the aims of the present study were to determine the impact of pre harvest deficit irrigation applied during the oil accumulation period in olive cv genovesa on i maturity oil water and flavonoid compounds in fruit and ii on yield extraction fatty acids and phenolic compounds in oil to deepen the knowledge about the effect of fruit moisture on oil quality an additional treatment was incorporated in which distilled water was added during the industrial processing of olives from the severe water deficit treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 site and orchard the study was carried out during seasons 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 in a commercial olive cv genovesa orchard in cañada honda valley 31º 58 s 68º 32 w 614 m a s l san juan argentina the orchard was established in 2011 with rows

rainfall was estimated daily as daily rainfall 0 80 puertas 2009 in both rdi treatments two periods were identified period i covered from bud break august 22 2017 august 27 2018 to the end of pit hardening january 23 2018 january 16 2019 period ii also referred to as pre harvest covered the fruit oil accumulation period i e from the end of pit hardening until harvest on april 4 2018 and april 8 2019 during period i rdi treatments were irrigated just as the control treatment during period ii rdi treatments were irrigated 50 control rdi1 and 30 control rdi2 after harvest both rdi treatments were irrigated as the control irrigation was supplied with a double irrigation line per row spaced 1 m apart with 2 0 l h 1 emitters spaced at 0 8 m each rdi1 and rdi2 plot had one valve to control operating time according to each treatment a plot with homogeneous tree crowns was selected within a commercial olive orchard nine experimental plots were chosen which consisted of four trees using the two central trees for data collection three irrigation treatments were arranged in a completely randomized design with three replicates 2 3 olive harvest and fruit characteristics every 2 weeks from mid january 20 fruits were extracted from each replicate the fruits were packed and placed in a portable refrigerator until processing fruits were fresh weighed and then oven dried at 60 c for 72

replicate and subjected to oil extraction in the case ofrdi2 two samples of 15 kg 2017 2018 and 12 kg 2018 2019 were taken per replicate each fruit sample was individually crushed with an oliomio hammer mill toscana enologica mori tavernelle val di pesa italy the olive paste was subjected to malaxation at 25 c for 30 min oil was extracted using a two phase decanter with a work capacity of 20 kg h 1 oil extraction was performed without added heat or water at any phase of the process in each treatment an additional sample was used to clean the hammer mill and that oil was not evaluated oil yield extraction was estimated as the ratio between oil weight and fruit sample weight refer to table 3 the additional samples separated from the rdi2 treatment were used to study the effect of initial water content in the olive paste on oil yield extraction and oil quality in this new treatment called rdi2w during oil extraction and before centrifugation distilled water was added so that paste moisture was equal to the control treatment measured in each year the added water was determined by a mass balance approach based on fruit moisture determination for this 20 fruits per replicate from control and rdi2 treatments were weighed immediately after harvest then they were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h reweighed and fruit moisture was calculated 2 5 analytical indexes free acidity

weight and moisture daily and accumulated seasonal rainfall is shown in table 1 and fig 1 rainfall in 2017 2018 193 mm and 2018 2019 174 mm was close between the two periods and the long term average of 195 mm period 2014 2019 as usual in san juan province rainfall was concentrated between december and may additionally about 50 of the total rainfall occurred during period ii january to early april when deficit irrigation treatments were applied table 1 the main difference between seasons was rainfall distribution during period ii fig 1 in 2017 2018 an important event of 38 mm occurred on april 1st that is 3 days before harvest in 2018 2019 rains were evenly concentrated in january at the beginning of period ii seasonal applied water in periods i and ii are reported in table 1 during 2017 2018 in period ii rdi1 and rdi2 treatments replaced 67 and 40 of irrigation plus effective rainfall higher than the planned 50 and 30 of the control treatment total applied water savings sum of periods i and ii for rdi1 and rdi2 treatments compared to control amounted to 17 and 28 respectively in 2018 2019 rdi1 and rdi2 treatments replaced 63 and 47 of irrigation plus effective rainfall compared to control in period ii this resulted in total applied water savings of 20 and 28 respectively for rdi1 and rdi2 treatments the dynamics of fruit dry weight and moisture were responsive to pre harvest irrigation regimes as well as to rainfall events fig 1 in 2017 2018 control and rdi1 fruit dry weight increased linearly during period ii to a maximum reached in mid march after which it remained stable until harvest fruit moisture showed the opposite pattern it decreased from early january to a minimum in mid march of 58 and 54 in control and rdi1 respectively remaining low and stable until harvest under rdi2 fruit growth was rapidly reduced and peaked earlier in early march in turn fruit moisture decreased to a minimum of 34 at sampling in mid march but increased rapidly to 54 after rainfall just before harvest in 2018 2019 under control and rdi1 fruit dry weight increased throughout period ii to the maximum at harvest fruits from rdi2 showed a similar pattern but reached the maximum earlier in mid march fruit moisture declined linearly throughout period ii to values about 50 in control and rdi1 in rdi2 fruit moisture was similar to control from mid january until mid february decreasing strongly to 35 at harvest 3 2 fruit characteristics and flavonoid compounds at harvest control and rdi1 trees had a similar yield in 2018 20 6 kg and 23 2 kgtree 1 respectively and in 2019 16 6 kg and 16 3 kg tree 1 respectively higher than rdi2 15 7 kg and 13 4 kgtree 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively fruit characteristics were affected by water deficit more evidently in 2017 2018 than in 2018 2019 when fruit growth and moisture responded later in period ii fig 1 table 2 during the 2017 2018 season fruits from rdi1 and control trees had similar dry weight oil concentration fresh basis and flavonoid concentration in pulp fresh weight by contrast rdi2 had lower fresh weight oil concentration dry basis and pulp pit ratio than control mi was higher for the rdi2 treatment followed by rdi1 and control flavonoid concentration measured in fresh pulp was higher in rdi2 than in rdi1 and control treatments fruit moisture from control 58 was significantly higher than both rdi1 and rdi2 average 54 treatments the 2018 2019 season fruits from rdi1 and control showed similar characteristics but fruits from rdi1 had lower fm and pulp pit ratio than control the rdi2 treatment produced fruits with significantly lower fresh weight pulp pit ratio moisture and oil concentration on fresh basis and higher maturation than control and rdi1 in this second season fruit dry weight oil concentration on dry basis and pulp flavonoid compounds were not affected by irrigation regimens 3 3 oil yield extraction by milling during oil elaboration olive paste from the three treatments was processed with no additional water a new treatment was included rdi2w in which olive paste from rdi2 trees was processed with added water to obtain a matrix with similar moisture to control table 3 the 2017 2018 irrigation regimens did not affect oil yield extraction including the rdi2w treatment to which 1 3 kg water or 8 paste dilution was added yield extraction of the 2018 2019 season was not affected by pre harvest deficit irrigation however in this season the addition to rdi2w of 4 2 kg of water or 34 paste dilution led to a marked rise 24 in oil yield extraction 3 4 oil quality phenolic compounds and fatty acids composition oil acidity ranged from 0 19 to 0 21 oleic acid for the different irrigation treatments and seasons evaluated table 4 pre harvest deficit irrigation had no significant influence on acidity in both seasons by contrast spectrometric uv indexes increased significantly with deficit irrigation increasing in 2017 2018 but not in 2018 2019 peroxide values for season 2017 2018 did not show significant differences among treatments as shown in table 4 peroxide values for season 2018 2019 were similar for control and rdi1 treatments while values increased for rdi2 and rdi2w treatments with significant differences between them the acidity uv indexes and peroxide values of all the samples were well below those established by the international olive council for extra virgin olive oil oil phenolic compounds were affected by irrigation but with the opposite pattern in 2017 2018 the concentration of total phenolic compounds increased slightly by 12 on average in rdi1 and rdi2 compared to control in 2018 2019 oil from control had 9 and 34 higher total phenolic compounds than rd1 and rd2 respectively oil flavonoid compounds were not affected by irrigation oil from rdi2w treatment showed similar acidity and uv spectrophotometric indexes but lower total phenolic compounds than its rdi2 counterpart fatty acids composition was slightly affected by irrigation but there was no clear response to irrigation treatments between seasons the percentage of palmitic acid in 2017 2018 decreased with an increasing irrigation deficit but this behavior was not observed in 2018 2019 in turn oleic and stearic acids were higher as the irrigation deficit increased however in the season 2018 2019 oleic acid did not show a clear behavior but stearic acid behaved the same way in both study seasons linoleic another main fatty acid did not show a clear behavior in response to irrigation treatments in any of the seasons under study table 4 the response to irrigation treatments of palmitoleic acid was stable for the 2018 2019 season with no statistical difference by contrast in the 2017 2018 season a slight increase could be observed with water stress in rdi1 which then decreased with a more marked deficit in rdi2 3 5 relationship among fruit characteristics oil extraction and phenolic compounds concentration fruit moisture decreased with increasing fruit maturity r2 0 79 fig 2 and fruit oil concentration on fresh basis r2 0 80 fig 2 during olive oil processing oil yield extraction increased with a slope of 0 16 per unit change in fruit moisture decrease r2 0 89 fig 2 and 0 35 per unit change in fruit oil concentration increase r2 0 82 pulp flavonoid concentration was closely associated with fruit maturity increase y 60 6x 53 3 r2 0 82 p 0 013 and was not significantly associated with fruit moisture r2 0 42 p 0 162 oil phenolic compounds concentration was negatively related to fruit moisture r2 0 81 fig 2 in this relationship fruits obtained from rdi2 in 2018 2019 showed both the lowest moisture 34 and phenolic compounds concentration 224 mg kg 1 these data were not considered in the fruit moisture vs oil phenolic compounds relationship 4 discussion different irrigation treatments from end of pit hardening to harvest were applied to generate a wide range of variation in fruit moisture as a useful framework to investigate fruit moisture impacts on other fruit materials oil and mass oil extraction and quality the study area is characterized by scarce annual rainfall lower than 200 mm and a summer autumn period period ii with high evaporative demand and some intense rainfall events e g early april 2018 4 1 pre harvest water deficit on fruit characteristics and oil extraction fruit moisture decreased gradually as the deficit irrigation progressed in period ii fruit moisture in rdi2 was significantly lower than in rdi1 and control treatments the decrease in moisture was faster in the season 2017 2018 than in 2018 2019 probably due to rains that occurred at the beginning of the irrigation treatments our results seem to indicate that fruit moisture responds to a change in plant water status or soil moisture as proposed by hueso et al 2019 these authors evaluated different water deficit levels in olive cv arbequina applied 2 months before harvest they observed that fruit moisture decreases close and linearly below threshold plant water status measured as stem water potential of 2 0 mpa measurements of stem water potential from the beginning of the water deﬁcit treatments would allow a better understanding of the impact of water deficit moment and intensity on changes in fruit materials the rain event that took place in april 2018 revealed that the dynamics of fruit moisture during period ii were largely reversible it also showed that fruits from rdi2 increased rapidly from 35 to 54 close to the fruit moisture achieved in rdi1 and control treatments rapid fruit rehydration had been observed in olives previously gómez del campo et al 2014 noticed that fruit dehydration measured as fruit moisture and mesocarp cell area due to severe summer water deficit was rapidly recovered at the control level when all treatments were well irrigated during autumn interestingly we observed that olive fruits keep their rehydration capacity in advanced maturity stages fig 1 in some grapevine cultivars berry shrinkage during late ripening may be driven by xylem functional and anatomic changes reducing their rehydration capacity bondada et al 2005 the reduction of fruit moisture in rdi2 during period ii was accompanied by a decrease in dry mass and oil accumulation in 2018 but not in 2019 a likely explanation is that the water deficit in 2019 occurred after considerable fruit growth and oil accumulation took place in addition fruit moisture showed a more sensitive response to water deficit than mass and oil accumulation as demonstrated by hueso et al 2019 this differential sensitivity may provide an opportunity to develop late water deficit to control fruit moisture with a slight reduction in oil accumulation according to the extraction advantage of processing olives with lower moisture and oil quality discussed further on fruit maturity response to water deficit was higher in 2017 2018 when trees showed greater fruit load as noted by garcía et al 2020 we studied flavonoid compounds because they constitute one of the most abundant olive phenolic compounds groups at the end of olive ripening talhaoui et al 2015 deficit irrigation affected flavonoid concentration in fresh olive pulp but as a consequence of the direct effect of water deficit on fruit maturity sainz et al 2019 fruit moisture and oil yield extraction were inversely related fig 2 this is consistent with the literature where an increase in olive paste moisture increases the difficulty for oil extraction at least above a moisture value greater than 20 30 cecchi et al 2019 the inverse relationship between fruit moisture and oil yield extraction has been noted but seldom quantified in numerous studies the actual slope of the relationship where a reduction of 1 in fruit moisture produced an increase of 0 16 in oil yield extraction for a fruit moisture range of 35 60 is relevant from an industrial viewpoint to devise orchard management strategies for further industrial oil yield improvement this relationship is not universal and depends on cultivar characteristics beltrán et al 2003 thus requiring further study 4 2 pre harvest water deficit on oil quality oil acidity was not inﬂuenced by water deficit consistent with several previous studies that focused on the effect of water supply on olive crops eg garcía et al 2020 by contrast a significant trend of increasing spectrophotometric uv indexes k232 with increasing water deficit was observed only in 2017 2018 which coincides with the results obtained by ahumada orellana et al 2018 and gómez rico et al 2007 conversely oil phenolic compounds concentration responded the opposite in the two seasons studied table 4 however pooled data from both seasons revealed two important aspects that may explain contrasting outcomes fig 2 firstly phenolic compounds concentration increased with the decrease in fruit moisture at harvest within the range of 60 50 the positive effect of water deficit on oil phenolic compounds concentration has been widely reported in olive trees e g ahumada orellana et al 2018 secondly when fruit moisture was the lowest i e 35 from rdi2 oil phenolic compounds concentration was also the lowest a similar general pattern has been reported in olive crops by cecchi et al 2019 the authors determined in two olive cultivars that oil phenolic compounds concentration increased with paste moisture increasing to a maximum of 40 this is due to the limitation of the enzymatic processes that promote the liberation of phenolic compounds from fruits as paste moisture increased above 40 oil phenolic compounds concentration decreased due to substrate and enzyme dilution in olive vegetation water the main fatty acids profile showed a variable pattern between seasons and sometimes opposite patterns in response to irrigation regimens table 4 however all the samples were consistent with the extra virgin olive oil category limit indicated in table 4 in this study oleic acid increased with water deficit irrigation during the season 2017 2018 this behavior had been previously observed by sánchez rodríguez et al 2019 in olives however this increase was not observed in the season 2018 2019 stearic and linoleic acids had a stable behavior in both seasons increasing with deficit irrigation while linoleic acid had a non specific behavior according to the season at the same time pooled data from both seasons showed a non significant relationship between the main fatty acids and fruit moisture and maturity not shown these results coincide with various authors who observed an inconsistent impact of water deficit on fatty acids between seasons inglese et al 1996 garcía et al 2020 in olive trees the influence of the environment on fatty acids has received attention recently for example lémole et al 2018 studied artificial shading 50 of isolated arbequina trees over the entire growing season and for three short intermediate periods the study revealed that shading from pit hardening to harvest was the most critical period for fatty acids determination thus the complex interaction among inter annual environmental variation crop load and fruit maturation may have played an important role in explaining contrasting fatty acids among seasons to deepen the knowledge about paste moisture management on the farm or during industrial oil processing we processed two pastes with the same moisture level viz control and rdi2w in rdi2w however paste moisture was achieved by adding water after malaxation simulating the three phase industrial oil extraction method our results revealed that water addition prior to oil separation had a great impact on increasing oil yield extraction this was the case in the second year when water dilution was approximately 30 but not in the first year when dilution was lower than 10 in line with the findings previously reported by amirante et al 2001 our results also showed that oil from rdi2w with water addition had similar acidity uv indexes and fatty acids profile to rdi2 without water addition however oil from rdi2w had higher peroxide values and lower phenolic compounds than rdi2 similar to the various studies comparing oil quality using two and three phase centrifuges di giovacchino et al 2001 5 conclusions the present study indicates that pre harvest water deficit can be used to manage fruit moisture but responsiveness is highly dependent on rainfall events occurring just before harvest this experiment has identified that fruit moisture of about 50 at harvest leads to maximum oil yield extraction and phenolic compounds concentration further work with paste obtained from fruits with a wider moisture range and from other olive cultivars is required to confirm these conclusions the fatty acids composition response to pre harvest water deficit was inconsistent and other factors such as environmental and fruit crop conditions played an important role an additional experiment in which distilled water was added to compensate for fruit water loss in the crop suggests that managing fruit moisture on the farm differs considerably from managing water during industrial oil processing in this case the added water was related with a marked increase in extraction but with a reduction in phenolic compound concentration our study emphasizes the need to evaluate different water deficit levels in shorter periods closer to harvest than to the long period evaluated in this study declaration of competing interest the authors

between the earth s surface and the atmosphere sanchez mejia and papuga 2014 soil moisture has strong controlling effects on water cycle and carbon cycle processes thus it is an important indicator for estimating soil drought in the fields of agriculture hydrology and meteorology bolten and crow 2012 moreover in the process of crop growth a lack of soil moisture is a natural disasters that affects crop yield and often causes severe economic losses zhao et al 2020 according to statistics the average area affected by soil drought disasters annually in china is approximately 2 11 107 hm2 accounting for 14 9 of the total planted area thus soil drought disasters seriously threaten the normal growth of crops zhang et al 2017 in general it is necessary to establish a dynamic real time soil moisture detection method that can meet the needs of practical applications however there is a lack of regular soil moisture monitoring in most parts of the world due to the high costs the determination of soil moisture through traditional methods e g the weighing method the resistivity method and the time domain reflectometry is commonly used in studies of water cycle processes cheng and liu 2011 although these methods can accurately measure soil moisture they cannot monitor developments or changes in drought conditions because they cannot be used on large scales lakhankar et al 2009 the limitations of traditional technology provide sufficient space for remote sensing in this regard soil moisture retrieval based on temperature normalized difference vegetation dryness index ts ndvi also called tvdi has been widely conducted in recent years because this method is convenient and effective for determining macroscopic and dynamic spatial distributions of surface soil moisture qiu et al 2014 many research results obtained during recent decades have been reported for shaanxi wang et al 2020 guangdong bai et al 2017 and ningxia du et al 2017 although the tvdi is extensively used in soil moisture monitoring applications the requirements for the type of surface coverage are high maduako et al 2017 in theory the tvdi characteristic space should include bare soil areas of partial vegetation coverage and areas of full vegetation coverage which make it difficult to estimate areas with simple coverage types thus the dry edge and wet edge determined by not fully qualified scatter points are essentially the only edges that exist in the characteristic space rather than the theoretical dry edge and wet edge this causes great uncertainty to solve this problem this study proposes a quantitative dry and wet edge determination method called the temperature vegetation quantitative index tvqi which overcomes the limitation of required vegetation cover types in the ts ndvi characteristic space and improves the accuracy of remote sensing retrieval moreover the traditional method mainly uses a linear relationship to determine deep soil moisture values however soil moisture is affected by precipitation evapotranspiration and irrigation and the relationship between surface and deep soil moisture is often nonlinear ford et al 2014 the filtering algorithm can incorporate the correlations among soil moisture levels in different layers to correct soil moisture values below the observation depth which has become the most appropriate method currently used to obtain deep soil moisture values thus this study combines exponential filtering and the tvqi to estimate deep soil moisture beijing the capital of china is located on the north china plain with the impact of global warming the drought situation in beijing is becoming increasingly severe according to statistical results recorded for nearly fifty years the temperature in beijing has increased by 0 17 c 10 a while the precipitation has decreased by 44 3 mm 10 a longteng et al 2012 therefore determining how to carry out real time drought monitoring in beijing and how to formulate favor management measures is a problem that the water resources management department urgently needs to solve as one manifestation of drought soil moisture is extremely crucial to the ecological environment in beijing and research on soil moisture is of high priority in general this study proposed a model based simulation framework that can determine the variation trends of soil moisture the core of the model framework involves surface soil moisture retrieval based on the temperature vegetation quantitative index tvqi and deep soil moisture estimation based on exponential filtering finally large scale and deep soil moisture monitoring can be performed in an area beijing was used as the study area the objectives of this study can be further broken down into the i modified tvdi tvqi model construction ii surface soil moisture retrieval iii deep soil moisture estimation and iv determination of the soil moisture distribution characteristics in beijing the proposed model based simulation framework will help water resource managers in water stressed regions to guide water resource management agricultural development and protect the ecological environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data beijing 115 25 117 35 e 39 28 41 05 n which covers an area of 1 64 104 km2 with complex topography and an average elevation of 43 5 m includes two regions i e plains 37 8 and mountains 62 2 fig 1 beijing is situated between the liaodong peninsula and shandong peninsula which are connected by the taihang mountains from the west and the jundu mountains from the north and northeast respectively beijing has a typical warm temperate continental monsoon climate that is hot and rainy in summer and cold and dry in winter hong wei and huai liang 2013 in this study two main types of data sources were used from 2013 to 2014 one data source is monitoring station data and the other is remote sensing data for the monitoring station data data was collected from 82 drought monitoring stations in beijing covering 13 districts this study lists information from only 23 representative monitoring stations fig 1 and table 1 the monitoring station data comprising the field water holding capacity saturated water content soil bulk density soil organic matter content soil moisture volume g cm3 and soil ph were collected from the beijing drought monitoring platform for the convenience of research we converted the unit of soil moisture from g cm3 to moreover soil moisture was monitored twice daily by time domain reflectometry tdr at 8 00 and 20 00 the monitoring depths were 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm in this study surface soil moisture was defined as 0 10 cm and deep soil moisture was defined as 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm the soil moisture retrieval conducted based on remote sensing was considered to characterize surface soil moisture for the remote sensing data mod11a2 and mod13a2 products were downloaded from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration https ladsweb modaps

model of beijing was downloaded from the geospatial data cloud https grasswiki osgeo org wiki global datasets furthermore the statistical significance used in the analysis of linear trends and correlations in this study corresponded to significance levels of p 0 05 and p 0 01 unless otherwise stated 2 2 surface soil moisture retrieval 2 2 1 temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi and temperature vegetation quantitative index tvqi in this study the relationship between soil moisture and the slope of dry and wet edge was used to predict soil moisture the ndvi reflects the vegetation information but has a time lag while ts reflects the information about the surrounding environment and responds quickly combining the ts and ndvi tvdi data provides information on surface vegetation and dryness conditions thus the tvdi has certain advantages for reflecting drought conditions patel et al 2009 when the vegetation coverage and soil moisture vary greatly in a study area the surface temperature ts and the vegetation index vi are trapezoidal in fig 2 a the abscissa is the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the ordinate is the surface temperature ts for bare soil changes in surface temperature are closely related to changes in surface soil moisture so a represents dry bare soil low ndvi high ts and b represents wet bare soil low ndvi low ts in general as the vegetation coverage increases the surface temperature decreases so d represents a dry vegetation canopy high ndvi high ts and c represents a humid vegetation canopy high ndvi low ts abcd constitutes the ts vi characteristic space where ad represents dry edges low evapotranspiration drought and bc represents wet edges potential evapotranspiration humidification the relationship between soil moisture and the slope of dry and wet edge was used to predict soil moisture the characteristic space can be regarded as a set of soil moisture contours ad and bc intersect at point o and the solid line between oa and ob is called the soil moisture contour the equations are as follows sandholt et al 2002 1 t v d i t s t s min t s max t s min 2 t s max a 1 b 1 n d v i 3 t s min a 2 b 2 n d v i where ts is the surface temperature for a given pixel ts min is the minimum surface temperature corresponding to the wet edge ts max is the maximum surface temperature corresponding to the dry edge a 1 a 2 and b 1 b 2 are the intercept and slope based on the dry edge and wet edge fig 2 a respectively and ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index the tvdi value is between 0 and 1 and the larger the value is the drier it is as mentioned above the dry edge in the ts ndvi characteristic space constructed based on the remote sensing image is obtained by fitting the scattered observation points however the vegetation coverage and the range of soil moisture in remote sensing images cannot meet the requirements of the ts ndvi theoretical characteristic space under normal circumstances this dry edge is the observed dry edge not the theoretical dry edge the tvdi only represents the estimated value of the relative drought degree and needs to be corrected to the soil moisture value tvdii temperature vegetation dryness index investigation with the observed soil moisture the calculation is as follows 4 tvdii 1 tvdi sm max sm min sm min where sm max and sm min represent the maximum and minimum values of the observed surface soil moisture the tvdi is dimensionless and sm max and sm min are expressed in volumetric water content in this study the ts ndvi characteristic space is constructed based on the theory of surface energy balance fig 2 b where ab is the quantitative dry edge and cd is the quantitative wet edge according to the quantitative dry wet edge and the tvqi model improved tvdi sandholt et al 2002 the estimated soil moisture is calculated the calculation is as follows 5 tvqi ts max qua ts ts max qua ts min qua where ts represents the estimated surface temperature of the pixel ts max qua is the quantitative dry edge temperature corresponding to ts and ts min qua is the quantitative wet edge temperature corresponding to ts the closer ts is to the dry edge the closer the tvqi is to 0 the lower the soil moisture and vice versa that is the tvqi is closely related to soil moisture 2 2 2 quantitative dry wet edge acquisition the quantitative dry edge heat exchange only involves the sensible heat flux and it is expressed as 6 r n g h where r n is the net surface radiation g is the surface soil heat flux and h is the surface sensible heat flux the traditional dry edge is determined by the maximum ts at the minimum ndvi value and the maximum ts at the maximum ndvi value however in most case the maximum dry edge temperature tends to increase first and then decrease with increasing ndvi thus choosing the maximum ts value only from the minimum ndvi values may result in the actual maximum temperature being higher than the theoretical maximum temperature the use of tds the value of ts rising to a maximum point as ndvi increases and tdv the maximum value of ts when the ndvi value is close to 1 can more accurately reflect the quantitative dry edge temperature distribution in this characteristic space while avoiding the restrictions of vegetation cover types present in the traditional dry edge calculation thus the quantitative dry edge temperature tsmax qua is expressed as follows 7 ts max qua a 3 b 3 ndvi where b 3 t ds t dv ndvi ds ndvi dv is the slope of the quantitative dry edge and a 3 t ds b 3 ndvi ds is the intercept of the quantitative dry edge the quantitative wet edge heat exchange only involves the latent heat flux and it is expressed as follows 8 r n g le where r n is the net surface radiation g is the surface soil heat flux and le is the surface latent heat flux tws temperature at the maximum evaporation point of bare soil is the minimum value of ts values when the ndvi value is close to 0 twv temperature at the maximum transpiration point of vegetation cover is the minimum ts value when the ndvi value is close to 1 the quantitative wet edge is determined by tws and twv and the quantitative wet edge temperature tsmin qua is expressed as follows 9 ts min qua a 4 b 4 ndvi where b 4 t ws t wv ndvi ws ndvi wv is the slope of the quantitative dry edge and a 4 t ws b 4 ndvi ws is the intercept of the quantitative dry edge 2 3 exponential filtering wagner first proposed the exponential filter to predict deep soil moisture based on surface water moisture wagner et al 1999 according to wagner soil can be defined as a simple two layer water balance model including the surface layer and the subsurface layer it is assumed that the subsurface layer is a reservoir that does not contact the outside except through the surface layer for a brief description of exponential filtering this method can be given in recursive form as follows albergel et al 2008 10 s w i t i s w i t i 1 k i m s t i s w i t i 1 where swi t i and swi t i 1 are the estimated soil water index in the second layer at time t i and t i 1 respectively ms t i is the soil moisture in the surface layer at time t i and k i is the gain of the exponential filter at time t i k i is given as follows 11 k i k i 1 k i 1 e t i t i 1 t where k i 1 is the gain at time t i 1 t is the characteristic time length and is an important factor in estimating the deep soil moisture as the t corresponding to the maximum nse is defined as the best characteristic time length t opt for calculating the swi of a specific soil layer additionally this study uses the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and coefficient of determination r2 values obtained based on the estimated and measured soil moisture to evaluate the results the rmse reflects the deviation between the estimated and measured values the nse is used to evaluate the accuracy of the exponential filtering method in estimating deep soil moisture and r2 represents the correlation between the estimated and measured values furthermore it should be noted that the soil moisture retrieved from satellites needs to be standardized between 0 and 1 using the maximum and minimum observed soil moisture values before exponential filtering can be applied 2 4 technology roadmap to determine the variation trend of soil moisture in beijing a model based simulation framework is proposed the framework mainly includes the modified tvdi model construction tvqi surface water moisture retrieval deep soil moisture estimation and soil moisture distribution characteristics fig 3 3 results 3 1 tvqi model construction the ts and ndvi values were obtained every 16 days from april 1 to november 1 of 2013 and the ts ndvi characteristic space was constructed fig 4 when all ts ndvi characteristic spaces were compared it can be seen that the trends were similar among the spaces the ndvi values were small during the drought period while they becames larger after the precipitation increases moreover the ndvi and tsmax values had significant negative correlations when the ndvi value was greater than a certain value the correlation between the ndvi and tsmin was unique which is positive during the drought period and negative during the wet period as the ts ndvi characteristic space is affected by the land cover type this study performed quantitative dry wet edge determination method and created an improved tvdi model tvqi taking the ts ndvi characteristic space on may 9 2013 as an example this study compared the retrieval effects of the tvdi and tvqi on surface soil moisture in fig 5 a the red and black dots are the scatter points of the observed wet and dry edges the black dotted line is the fitted observed wet edge and the red dotted line is the fitted observed dry edge the determination coefficients r2 of the fitted observed dry and wet edge were 0 6 and 0 7 respectively the green dot is the vertex of the quantitative dry and wet edges the black solid line is the quantitative wet edge and the red solid line is the quantitative dry edge the distance between the intercept of the quantitative dry edge and the observed dry edge is 5 9 while the distance between the intercept of the quantitative wet edge and the observed wet edge is 5 4 as shown in fig 5 b and table 2 compared with that of tvdi tvqi s scatter distribution is concentrated and shows a good linear relationship with the measured value compared with those of the tvdi the coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of the tvqi are increased by 0 2 0 3 and 4 6 respectively there are many important factors that restrict drought one of which is precipitation to verify the wet edge and dry edge this study calculated the correlation between cumulative precipitation and the tvqi as shown in table 3 the correlation coefficients between the tvqi and accumulated precipitation was large over the last 10 days 20 days and 1 month of the study period moreover the correlation coefficients between the tvqi and precipitation gradually decreased when the cumulative precipitation was greater than 1 month 3 2 surface soil moisture retrieval three steps are required to retrieve surface soil moisture by remote sensing first the characteristic space is constructed based on the tvqi principle second the quantitative dry and wet edge equations are fitted to obtain the tvqi value finally a relationship is established between the measured surface soil moisture value and the tvqi value the spatial resolution of modis products is 1 km which cannot correspond to the measured sampling stations in space however considering that most of the sampling stations are in the plain area of beijing where the terrain is relatively flat the sampling stations are still used to correspond to corresponding pixels wang et al 2004 after constructing the tvqi characteristic space the dry edge and wet edge coefficients of the tvqi model were obtained and the tvqi values were calculated finally the soil moisture of the sample pixel was obtained and the estimated value was compared to the measured value 10 cm as shown in fig 6 the coefficients of determination between the estimated values and measured values were all greater than 0 9 as shown in table 4 the relative errors were all below 15 with an increase in soil moisture the relative error tended to decrease and the average value was 7 to determine the applicability of the model data from 2014 were used to verify the surface soil moisture retrieval model established in 2013 as shown in fig 7 the r2 value of the estimated and measured soil moisture values were all above 0 9 this shows that the relationship between the tvqi and soil moisture values established in 2013 is reasonable as shown in table 5 the estimated values were greater than the measured values the relative errors were all below 20 and the nse were all above 0 7 the model is thus effective and suitable for soil moisture retrieval in beijing 3 3 deep soil moisture estimation to test the relationship between the surface soil moisture 10 cm and precipitation the precipitation data of eight districts in beijing from april to october 2013 were selected namely those of haidian daxing fangshan mentougou miyun pinggu tongzhou and yanqing as shown in fig 8 the change in soil moisture over time are essentially consistent with precipitation except during the crop irrigation period suggesting that changes in surface soil moisture can reflect previous meteorological conditions and provide a guarantee for deep soil moisture estimation the optimal characteristic time length topt is an important factor for estimating deep soil moisture and topt is generally approximately 10 days in this study the maximum time length tmax is set to 30 days and the step size is 1 day the time length t corresponding to the maximum nse value is used as topt finally the topt values at 20 cm and 40 cm are obtained table 6 for topt at 20 cm the nse ranges from 0 5 to 0 9 with an average value of 0 86 and the nse at each station is essentially above 0 7 except for stations 1006 1302 and 1407 the rmse ranges from 0 01 to 0 2 with an average value of 0 08 the r2 ranges from 0 6 to 0 9 with an average value of 0 95 and each station is essentially above 0 9 except stations 0800 0803 and 1408 although the topt values of most stations are 1 day those of stations 0601 1302 and 1409 are more than 1 day and the soil textures of these stations are sand sand and loam respectively for topt at 40 cm the nse ranges from 0 5 to 0 9 with an average value of 0 77 and each station is essentially above 0 6 except for stations 0707 0709 1006 and 1302 the rmse ranges from 0 04 to 0 2 with an average value of 0 13 the r2 ranges from 0 6 to 0 9 with an average value of 0 92 and each station is essentially above 0 8 except stations 0803 and 1408 although the topt values of most stations are 1 day those of stations 0803 loam 0902 cinnamon soil 1010 clay loam 1407 clay loam 1408 clay loam and 1409 loam are more than 1 day additionally this study calculated the correlation between topt and nse at 23 stations at 20 cm and 40 cm and the relationships at different depths were found to be similar as shown in fig 9 as t increased the nse first reached the maximum value and then decreased and the declining process was slow that is within a certain range t corresponds to a higher nse therefore the effect of the exponential filter is not sensitive to topt and the average topt of 23 stations can be used to replace the topt of each station this is consistent with the results of albergel who emphasized that nse was reduced by only 4 albergel et al 2008 this result can be applied to subsequent research in which the empirical topt can be selected without reducing the estimation effect moreover when the average nse and r2 values at 20 cm and 40 cm were compared it was found that the average nse and r2 values at 20 cm were higher than the average nse and r2 values at 40 cm indicating that nse and r2 decreased as the soil thickness increased the rmse values showed just the opposite trend this is coincident with the results of wang wang et al 2017 and guber guber et al 2008 finally the estimated deep soil moisture values of 23 stations were obtained in this study fig 10 shows the estimated soil moisture values at 20 cm and fig 11 shows the estimated soil moisture values at 40 cm albergel believes that the main factors affecting the prediction results of deep soil moisture are soil thickness and meteorological conditions albergel et al 2008 this study calculated the correlations of soil characteristics and precipitation with topt table 7 as shown in table 7 bulk density had the largest impact on topt followed by ph the larger the soil bulk density was the smaller the water capacity was that is water was liable to be lost albergel et al 2008 in addition the correlation between meteorological conditions precipitation and topt was not strong which is consistent with wang s research in the united states wang et al 2017 3 4 distribution characteristics of soil moisture in beijing this study analyzed the distribution characteristics of soil moisture in beijing based on daily measured values at depths of 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm from april to october 2013 the coefficient of determination between the monthly average precipitation and monthly average soil moisture values was 0 7 which indicated that there was a good positive correlation between soil moisture and precipitation regarding the trends of average precipitation and average soil moisture fig 12 the change trends at 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm are essentially consistent there were two periods of soil moisture in beijing from falling to rising during plant growth the first period is from april to july the soil moisture gradually decreases from april to may reaching its lowest values in may at 22 10 cm 27 7 20 cm and 28 4 40 cm the soil moisture gradually rises from may to july and the peak soil moisture values are 44 6 10 cm 46 8 20 cm and 51 8 40 cm the second period is from july to october which is a unique period the soil moisture at 10 cm is essentially stagnant from july to august and slowly declines from august to october the soil moisture at 20 cm decreases slightly from july to august rises in september and then gradually decreases the soil moisture at 40 cm shows a straight downward trend from july to october the peak soil moisture occurs in late july and early august which is related to the maximum precipitation and large scale crop irrigation from the vertical distribution of soil moisture the average soil moisture values were is 27 9 10 cm 31 2 20 cm and 33 0 40 cm these values indicate that soil moisture increases from 10 cm to 40 cm the spatial distribution of soil moisture recorded every 16 days can be divided into four stages fig 13 in april soil moisture is relatively high in the east and west regions of the study area soil moisture is relatively low in the north and south while it decreases slightly from north to south in may soil moisture gradually increases in the north while it decreases in the east and west in early june soil moisture rises again in the east and west after late june the soil moisture is stable and high in the east and low in the west moreover the districts with high soil moisture are mainly shunyi pinggu tongzhou and daxing while the districts with low soil moisture are mainly changping fangshan and mentougou according to the soil moisture classification the suburban areas of beijing experienced a light drought in late april and a moderate drought in may after june the west area became drier and the east area was humid the arid regions are observed because precipitation in beijing was small 501 mm in 2013 and evaporation was high 1597 67 mm in 2013 zhang et al 2019 furthermore precipitation was unevenly distributed throughout the year the precipitation in the nonflood seasons from january to may and from october to december was 44 mm which exacerbated the drought in beijing 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture retrieval based on remote sensing soil moisture is an important factor in earth s system soil moisture affects the water energy and carbon fluxes between the earth s surface and the atmosphere schmugge 2007 soil moisture can be measured with field instruments and estimated using remote sensing technology in recent years large scale and convenient monitoring based on remote sensing has become a focus for many scholars furthermore there are many methods used for soil moisture retrieval based on remote sensing and the tvdi has been verified in different regions because it considers both the vegetation growth state and the surface temperature this study found that the characteristic space of the tvdi changed significantly among different periods the intercept of the wet edge and dry edge increased from spring to summer while it decreased from summer to autumn this change was particularly pronounced on the wet edge which shows that the wet edge was more sensitive to environmental conditions than the dry edge these results are consistent with those of min min et al 2015 and sandholt sandholt et al 2002 who conducted similar research in heilongjiang and west africa this is mainly because an increase in precipitation leads to a large range of ndvi values and under this condition the ts ndvi characteristic space becomes more explicit in addition the temperature vegetation quantitative index tvqi the modified tvdi is effective for surface soil moisture which has not been reported in some relevant studies simultaneously this study also found that the tvqi is most closely related to precipitation within the time scale of a month which is consistent with most research conducted in the past few decades song et al 2011 furthermore the soil texture has a great impact on soil moisture retrieval but this study did not conduct an in depth analysis on this factor according to past research the accuracy of soil texture in soil moisture retrieval is ranked as loam sandy loam sandy soil clay loam clay zhang and chen 2013 4 2 deep soil moisture estimation exponential filtering which has been widely used to estimate deep soil moisture in recent years albergel et al 2008 is a model that combines data assimilation technology with physical processes and can solve nonlinear problems however exponential filtering is not a complete physical model the characteristics time length t the key parameter is developed by considering the specific meteorological and underlying surface conditions of a study area ford et al 2014 therefore the application of t in different meteorological regions and underlying surface conditions must be specifically analyzed and its application in beijing has not yet been developed this study found that topt in beijing is basically 1 day which is different with the results of albergel who thought that topt is generally approximately 10 days albergel et al 2008 in addition although topt becomes larger as the soil depth increases the change is not significant this is different from the findings of gao gao et al 2019 who found that topt doubled as the soil depth increased every 20 cm the effect of the exponential filter is not sensitive to topt and the average topt value of 23 stations can be used instead of the topt of each station this is consistent with the result of albergel who found that nse decreased by only 4 with the topt of each station was used furthermore the average rmse at 20 cm increased by 45 4 over that at 40 cm while the average nse and average r2 decreased by 10 6 and 3 2 respectively the main reason for this result is that the surface soil moisture is strongly affected by meteorological factors e g precipitation and evapotranspiration and fluctuates strongly with time the influence of meteorological factors on soil moisture gradually weakens as the soil depth increases the soil bulk density has a significant effect on topt while the meteorological factors have little effect on topt this is different from the findings of albergel who reported that the soil characteristics have little effect on topt and that the effects of meteorological factors are not clear albergel et al 2008 4 3 future studies soil moisture is an important factor representing land surface conditions and it is also an important indicator for measuring agricultural drought wang and tao 1998 for surface soil moisture retrieval soil moisture data measured at sampling points are used to represent soil moisture within 1 km 1 km of remote sensing image pixels which will have a certain impact on the research result determining how to assimilate data points throughout an entire study area is an urgent problem to be solved in future research additionally the research of many scholars has shown that meteorological conditions have a certain impact on topt but these impact factors are not clear albergel et al 2008 this study explores only the relationship between precipitation and topt which can be further studied from two aspects first the characteristics of beijing determine its unique urban micrometeorological characteristics e g the urban heat island effect and rain island effect determining how these urban micrometeorological factors affect soil moisture in the suburbs can be the focus of research in the future second soil moisture and evaporation are important factors in the hydrological cycle and energy exchange process thus evaporation has a significant effect on soil moisture because evaporation data for beijing were not obtained in this study the relationship between topt and evaporation could not be verified in the future various factors affecting topt should be studied to improve the estimation effect of deep soil moisture moreover the tvqi is selected in this model based simulation framework because it is extremely sensitive to water stress and there are many ways e g microwave remote sensing and thermal inertia to retrieve soil moisture based on remote sensing thus in the future we can combine different methods to increase the accuracy of the obtained prediction results 5 conclusions in this study we proposed a model based simulation framework that can determine variation trends in soil moisture the core of the model framework is surface soil retrieval based on temperature vegetation quantitative index tvqi and deep soil moisture estimation based on exponential filters we demonstrated the applicability of the proposed model based simulation framework in beijing from this study the following conclusions are obtained 1 the ndvi is small during the drought period while the characteristic space of the tvdi becomes clearer as precipitation increases temperature vegetation quantitative index tvqi the modified tvdi is effective for the prediction of surface soil moisture the coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of the tvqi are increased by 0 2 0 3 and 4 6 respectively furthermore the tvqi is closely related to cumulative precipitation within 1 month 2 the surface soil moisture retrieval obtained based on the tvqi characteristic space have a significant effect in 2014 the average relative error was 6 the average r2 was 0 9 and the average nse was 0 7 3 the estimation effect of the soil moisture values at 20 cm and 40 cm based on exponential filtering performs well with average r2 values all above 0 9 the effect decreases as the soil depth increases the topt is mostly 1 day and only a few stations have topt values longer than 1 day the average topt of all stations can be used instead of the topt of each station the soil bulk density is significantly related to topt while the precipitation meteorological condition has little effect on topt 4 there is a significant correlation r2 0 7 between soil moisture and precipitation in beijing the soil moisture is lowest at the end of may while it is highest in july the changes in soil moisture at 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm were consistent and soil moisture increases as the soil depth increases in terms of spatial distribution soil moisture essentially shows a trend of east high and west low the high areas in the east are shunyi pinggu tongzhou and daxing while the low areas in the west are changping fangshan and mentougou the results of this study can not only help to guide agricultural water management in beijing but can also contribute to drought monitoring and environmental protection funding

2013 to 2014 were analyzed the results showed that the temperature vegetation quantitative index tvqi which was modified from the tvdi by the quantitative dry edge and wet edge is effective for predicting surface soil moisture the coefficient of determination r2 root man squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse of the tvqi increased by 0 2 0 3 and 4 6 respectively compared to those of the tvdi moreover the tvqi is closely related to cumulative precipitation within 1 month as the correlation is the highest in this time interval the accuracy of surface soil moisture retrieval was good with relative error re r2 and nse values of 6 0 9 and 0 7 respectively the deep soil moisture estimations performed well at both 20 cm and 40 cm with an average r2 above 0 9 an average re below 0 1 and an average nse above 0 7 however the prediction accuracy decreased as the soil depth increased topt the best characteristic time length of the exponential filter was significantly related to the soil bulk density while the precipitation meteorological condition had little effect moreover the average topt of all stations can be used instead of the topt of each station beijing the study area is dry throughout the year with soil moisture reaching a minimum in may and a maximum in july the changes in soil moisture at 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm were consistent and soil moisture increased with soil depth furthermore the variation trends of soil moisture were high in the east and low in the west not only is this study important for understanding soil moisture variation trends it also provides a preliminary reference for water management in beijing graphical abstract ga1 keywords tvqi soil moisture profile exponential filter surface soil moisture deep soil

between the earth s surface and the atmosphere sanchez mejia and papuga 2014 soil moisture has strong controlling effects on water cycle and carbon cycle processes thus it is an important indicator for estimating soil drought in the fields of agriculture hydrology and meteorology bolten and crow 2012 moreover in the process of crop growth a lack of soil moisture is a natural disasters that affects crop yield and often causes severe economic losses zhao et al 2020 according to statistics the average area affected by soil drought disasters annually in china is approximately 2 11 107 hm2 accounting for 14 9 of the total planted area thus soil drought disasters seriously threaten the normal growth of crops zhang et al 2017 in general it is necessary to establish a dynamic real time soil moisture detection method that can meet the needs of practical applications however there is a lack of regular soil moisture monitoring in most parts of the world due to the high costs the determination of soil moisture through traditional methods e g the weighing method the resistivity method and the time domain reflectometry is commonly used in studies of water cycle processes cheng and liu 2011 although these methods can accurately measure soil moisture they cannot monitor developments or changes in drought conditions because they cannot be used on large scales lakhankar et al 2009 the limitations of traditional technology provide sufficient space for remote sensing in this regard soil moisture retrieval based on temperature normalized difference vegetation dryness index ts ndvi also called tvdi has been widely conducted in recent years because this method is convenient and effective for determining macroscopic and dynamic spatial distributions of surface soil moisture qiu et al 2014 many research results obtained during recent decades have been reported for shaanxi wang et al 2020 guangdong bai et al 2017 and ningxia du et al 2017 although the tvdi is extensively used in soil moisture monitoring applications the requirements for the type of surface coverage are high maduako et al 2017 in theory the tvdi characteristic space should include bare soil areas of partial vegetation coverage and areas of full vegetation coverage which make it difficult to estimate areas with simple coverage types thus the dry edge and wet edge determined by not fully qualified scatter points are essentially the only edges that exist in the characteristic space rather than the theoretical dry edge and wet edge this causes great uncertainty to solve this problem this study proposes a quantitative dry and wet edge determination method called the temperature vegetation quantitative index tvqi which overcomes the limitation of required vegetation cover types in the ts ndvi characteristic space and improves the accuracy of remote sensing retrieval moreover the traditional method mainly uses a linear relationship to determine deep soil moisture values however soil moisture is affected by precipitation evapotranspiration and irrigation and the relationship between surface and deep soil moisture is often nonlinear ford et al 2014 the filtering algorithm can incorporate the correlations among soil moisture levels in different layers to correct soil moisture values below the observation depth which has become the most appropriate method currently used to obtain deep soil moisture values thus this study combines exponential filtering and the tvqi to estimate deep soil moisture beijing the capital of china is located on the north china plain with the impact of global warming the drought situation in beijing is becoming increasingly severe according to statistical results recorded for nearly fifty years the temperature in beijing has increased by 0 17 c 10 a while the precipitation has decreased by 44 3 mm 10 a longteng et al 2012 therefore determining how to carry out real time drought monitoring in beijing and how to formulate favor management measures is a problem that the water resources management department urgently needs to solve as one manifestation of drought soil moisture is extremely crucial to the ecological environment in beijing and research on soil moisture is of high priority in general this study proposed a model based simulation framework that can determine the variation trends of soil moisture the core of the model framework involves surface soil moisture retrieval based on the temperature vegetation quantitative index tvqi and deep soil moisture estimation based on exponential filtering finally large scale and deep soil moisture monitoring can be performed in an area beijing was used as the study area the objectives of this study can be further broken down into the i modified tvdi tvqi model construction ii surface soil moisture retrieval iii deep soil moisture estimation and iv determination of the soil moisture distribution characteristics in beijing the proposed model based simulation framework will help water resource managers in water stressed regions to guide water resource management agricultural development and protect the ecological environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data beijing 115 25 117 35 e 39 28 41 05 n which covers an area of 1 64 104 km2 with complex topography and an average elevation of 43 5 m includes two regions i e plains 37 8 and mountains 62 2 fig 1 beijing is situated between the liaodong peninsula and shandong peninsula which are connected by the taihang mountains from the west and the jundu mountains from the north and northeast respectively beijing has a typical warm temperate continental monsoon climate that is hot and rainy in summer and cold and dry in winter hong wei and huai liang 2013 in this study two main types of data sources were used from 2013 to 2014 one data source is monitoring station data and the other is remote sensing data for the monitoring station data data was collected from 82 drought monitoring stations in beijing covering 13 districts this study lists information from only 23 representative monitoring stations fig 1 and table 1 the monitoring station data comprising the field water holding capacity saturated water content soil bulk density soil organic matter content soil moisture volume g cm3 and soil ph were collected from the beijing drought monitoring platform for the convenience of research we converted the unit of soil moisture from g cm3 to moreover soil moisture was monitored twice daily by time domain reflectometry tdr at 8 00 and 20 00 the monitoring depths were 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm in this study surface soil moisture was defined as 0 10 cm and deep soil moisture was defined as 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm the soil moisture retrieval conducted based on remote sensing was considered to characterize surface soil moisture for the remote sensing data mod11a2 and mod13a2 products were downloaded from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration https ladsweb modaps

correlations in this study corresponded to significance levels of p 0 05 and p 0 01 unless otherwise stated 2 2 surface soil moisture retrieval 2 2 1 temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi and temperature vegetation quantitative index tvqi in this study the relationship between soil moisture and the slope of dry and wet edge was used to predict soil moisture the ndvi reflects the vegetation information but has a time lag while ts reflects the information about the surrounding environment and responds quickly combining the ts and ndvi tvdi data provides information on surface vegetation and dryness conditions thus the tvdi has certain advantages for reflecting drought conditions patel et al 2009 when the vegetation coverage and soil moisture vary greatly in a study area the surface temperature ts and the vegetation index vi are trapezoidal in fig 2 a the abscissa is the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the ordinate is the surface temperature ts for bare soil changes in surface temperature are closely related to changes in surface soil moisture so a represents dry bare soil low ndvi high ts and b represents wet bare soil low ndvi low ts in general as the vegetation coverage increases the surface temperature decreases so d represents a dry vegetation canopy high ndvi high ts and c represents a humid vegetation canopy high ndvi low ts abcd constitutes the ts vi characteristic space where ad represents dry edges low evapotranspiration drought and bc represents wet edges potential evapotranspiration humidification the relationship between soil moisture and the slope of dry and wet edge was used to predict soil moisture the characteristic space can be regarded as a set of soil moisture contours ad and bc intersect at point o and the solid line between oa and ob is called the soil moisture contour the equations are as follows sandholt et al 2002 1 t v d i t s t s min t s max t s min 2 t s max a 1 b 1 n d v i 3 t s min a 2 b 2 n d v i where ts is the surface temperature for a given pixel ts min is the minimum surface temperature corresponding to the wet edge ts max is the maximum surface temperature corresponding to the dry edge a 1 a 2 and b 1 b 2 are the intercept and slope based on the dry edge and wet edge fig 2 a respectively and ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index the tvdi value is between 0 and 1 and the larger the value is the drier it is as mentioned above the dry edge in the ts ndvi characteristic space constructed based on the remote sensing image is obtained by fitting the scattered observation points however the vegetation coverage and the range of soil moisture in remote sensing images cannot meet the requirements of the ts ndvi theoretical characteristic space under normal circumstances this dry edge is the observed dry edge not the theoretical dry edge the tvdi only represents the estimated value of the relative drought degree and needs to be corrected to the soil moisture value tvdii temperature vegetation dryness index investigation with the observed soil moisture the calculation is as follows 4 tvdii 1 tvdi sm max sm min sm min where sm max and sm min represent the maximum and minimum values of the observed surface soil moisture the tvdi is dimensionless and sm max and sm min are expressed in volumetric water content in this study the ts ndvi characteristic space is constructed based on the theory of surface energy balance fig 2 b where ab is the quantitative dry edge and cd is the quantitative wet edge according to the quantitative dry wet edge and the tvqi model improved tvdi sandholt et al 2002 the estimated soil moisture is calculated the calculation is as follows 5 tvqi ts max qua ts ts max qua ts min qua where ts represents the estimated surface temperature of the pixel ts max qua is the quantitative dry edge temperature corresponding to ts and ts min qua is the quantitative wet edge temperature corresponding to ts the closer ts is to the dry edge the closer the tvqi is to 0 the lower the soil moisture and vice versa that is the tvqi is closely related to soil moisture 2 2 2 quantitative dry wet edge acquisition the quantitative dry edge heat exchange only involves the sensible heat flux and it is expressed as 6 r n g h where r n is the net surface radiation g is the surface soil heat flux and h is the surface sensible heat flux the traditional dry edge is determined by the maximum ts at the minimum ndvi value and the maximum ts at the maximum ndvi value however in most case the maximum dry edge temperature tends to increase first and then decrease with increasing ndvi thus choosing the maximum ts value only from the minimum ndvi values may result in the actual maximum temperature being higher than the theoretical maximum temperature the use of tds the value of ts rising to a maximum point as ndvi increases and tdv the maximum value of ts when the ndvi value is close to 1 can more accurately reflect the quantitative dry edge temperature distribution in this characteristic space while avoiding the restrictions of vegetation cover types present in the traditional dry edge calculation thus the quantitative dry edge temperature tsmax qua is expressed as follows 7 ts max qua a 3 b 3 ndvi where b 3 t ds t dv ndvi ds ndvi dv is the slope of the quantitative dry edge and a 3 t ds b 3 ndvi ds is the intercept of the quantitative dry edge the quantitative wet edge heat exchange only involves the latent heat flux and it is expressed as follows 8 r n g le where r n is the net surface radiation g is the surface soil heat flux and le is the surface latent heat flux tws temperature at the maximum evaporation point of bare soil is the minimum value of ts values when the ndvi value is close to 0 twv temperature at the maximum transpiration point of vegetation cover is the minimum ts value when the ndvi value is close to 1 the quantitative wet edge is determined by tws and twv and the quantitative wet edge temperature tsmin qua is expressed as follows 9 ts min qua a 4 b 4 ndvi where b 4 t ws t wv ndvi ws ndvi wv is the slope of the quantitative dry edge and a 4 t ws b 4 ndvi ws is the intercept of the quantitative dry edge 2 3 exponential filtering wagner first proposed the exponential filter to predict deep soil moisture based on surface water moisture wagner et al 1999 according to wagner soil can be defined as a simple two layer water balance model including the surface layer and the subsurface layer it is assumed that the subsurface layer is a reservoir that does not contact the outside except through the surface layer for a brief description of exponential filtering this method can be given in recursive form as follows albergel et al 2008 10 s w i t i s w i t i 1 k i m s t i s w i t i 1 where swi t i and swi t i 1 are the estimated soil water index in the second layer at time t i and t i 1 respectively ms t i is the soil moisture in the surface layer at time t i and k i is the gain of the exponential filter at time t i k i is given as follows 11 k i k i 1 k i 1 e t i t i 1 t where k i 1 is the gain at time t i 1 t is the characteristic time length and is an important factor in estimating the deep soil moisture as the t corresponding to the maximum nse is defined as the best characteristic time length t opt for calculating the swi of a specific soil layer additionally this study uses the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and coefficient of determination r2 values obtained based on the estimated and measured soil moisture to evaluate the results the rmse reflects the deviation between the estimated and measured values the nse is used to evaluate the accuracy of the exponential filtering method in estimating deep soil moisture and r2 represents the correlation between the estimated and measured values furthermore it should be noted that the soil moisture retrieved from satellites needs to be standardized between 0 and 1 using the maximum and minimum observed soil moisture values before exponential filtering can be applied 2 4 technology roadmap to determine the variation trend of soil moisture in beijing a model based simulation framework is proposed the framework mainly includes the modified tvdi model construction tvqi surface water moisture retrieval deep soil moisture estimation and soil moisture distribution characteristics fig 3 3 results 3 1 tvqi model construction the ts and ndvi values were obtained every 16 days from april 1 to november 1 of 2013 and the ts ndvi characteristic space was constructed fig 4 when all ts ndvi characteristic spaces were compared it can be seen that the trends were similar among the spaces the ndvi values were small during the drought period while they becames larger after the precipitation increases moreover the ndvi and tsmax values had significant negative correlations when the ndvi value was greater than a certain value the correlation between the ndvi and tsmin was unique which is positive during the drought period and negative during the wet period as the ts ndvi characteristic space is affected by the land cover type this study performed quantitative dry wet edge determination method and created an improved tvdi model tvqi taking the ts ndvi characteristic space on may 9 2013 as an example this study compared the retrieval effects of the tvdi and tvqi on surface soil moisture in fig 5 a the red and black dots are the scatter points of the observed wet and dry edges the black dotted line is the fitted observed wet edge and the red dotted line is the fitted observed dry edge the determination coefficients r2 of the fitted observed dry and wet edge were 0 6 and 0 7 respectively the green dot is the vertex of the quantitative dry and wet edges the black solid line is the quantitative wet edge and the red solid line is the quantitative dry edge the distance between the intercept of the quantitative dry edge and the observed dry edge is 5 9 while the distance between the intercept of the quantitative wet edge and the observed wet edge is 5 4 as shown in fig 5 b and table 2 compared with that of tvdi tvqi s scatter distribution is concentrated and shows a good linear relationship with the measured value compared with those of the tvdi the coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of the tvqi are increased by 0 2 0 3 and 4 6 respectively there are many important factors that restrict drought one of which is precipitation to verify the wet edge and dry edge this study calculated the correlation between cumulative precipitation and the tvqi as shown in table 3 the correlation coefficients between the tvqi and accumulated precipitation was large over the last 10 days 20 days and 1 month of the study period moreover the correlation coefficients between the tvqi and precipitation gradually decreased when the cumulative precipitation was greater than 1 month 3 2 surface soil moisture retrieval three steps are required to retrieve surface soil moisture by remote sensing first the characteristic space is constructed based on the tvqi principle second the quantitative dry and wet edge equations are fitted to obtain the tvqi value finally a relationship is established between the measured surface soil moisture value and the tvqi value the spatial resolution of modis products is 1 km which cannot correspond to the measured sampling stations in space however considering that most of the sampling stations are in the plain area of beijing where the terrain is relatively flat the sampling stations are still used to correspond to corresponding pixels wang et al 2004 after constructing the tvqi characteristic space the dry edge and wet edge coefficients of the tvqi model were obtained and the tvqi values were calculated finally the soil moisture of the sample pixel was obtained and the estimated value was compared to the measured value 10 cm as shown in fig 6 the coefficients of determination between the estimated values and measured values were all greater than 0 9 as shown in table 4 the relative errors were all below 15 with an increase in soil moisture the relative error tended to decrease and the average value was 7 to determine the applicability of the model data from 2014 were used to verify the surface soil moisture retrieval model established in 2013 as shown in fig 7 the r2 value of the estimated and measured soil moisture values were all above 0 9 this shows that the relationship between the tvqi and soil moisture values established in 2013 is reasonable as shown in table 5 the estimated values were greater than the measured values the relative errors were all below 20 and the nse were all above 0 7 the model is thus effective and suitable for soil moisture retrieval in beijing 3 3 deep soil moisture estimation to test the relationship between the surface soil moisture 10 cm and precipitation the precipitation data of eight districts in beijing from april to october 2013 were selected namely those of haidian daxing fangshan mentougou miyun pinggu tongzhou and yanqing as shown in fig 8 the change in soil moisture over time are essentially consistent with precipitation except during the crop irrigation period suggesting that changes in surface soil moisture can reflect previous meteorological conditions and provide a guarantee for deep soil moisture estimation the optimal characteristic time length topt is an important factor for estimating deep soil moisture and topt is generally approximately 10 days in this study the maximum time length tmax is set to 30 days and the step size is 1 day the time length t corresponding to the maximum nse value is used as topt finally the topt values at 20 cm and 40 cm are obtained table 6 for topt at 20 cm the nse ranges from 0 5 to 0 9 with an average value of 0 86 and the nse at each station is essentially above 0 7 except for stations 1006 1302 and 1407 the rmse ranges from 0 01 to 0 2 with an average value of 0 08 the r2 ranges from 0 6 to 0 9 with an average value of 0 95 and each station is essentially above 0 9 except stations 0800 0803 and 1408 although the topt values of most stations are 1 day those of stations 0601 1302 and 1409 are more than 1 day and the soil textures of these stations are sand sand and loam respectively for topt at 40 cm the nse ranges from 0 5 to 0 9 with an average value of 0 77 and each station is essentially above 0 6 except for stations 0707 0709 1006 and 1302 the rmse ranges from 0 04 to 0 2 with an average value of 0 13 the r2 ranges from 0 6 to 0 9 with an average value of 0 92 and each station is essentially above 0 8 except stations 0803 and 1408 although the topt values of most stations are 1 day those of stations 0803 loam 0902 cinnamon soil 1010 clay loam 1407 clay loam 1408 clay loam and 1409 loam are more than 1 day additionally this study calculated the correlation between topt and nse at 23 stations at 20 cm and 40 cm and the relationships at different depths were found to be similar as shown in fig 9 as t increased the nse first reached the maximum value and then decreased and the declining process was slow that is within a certain range t corresponds to a higher nse therefore the effect of the exponential filter is not sensitive to topt and the average topt of 23 stations can be used to replace the topt of each station this is consistent with the results of albergel who emphasized that nse was reduced by only 4 albergel et al 2008 this result can be applied to subsequent research in which the empirical topt can be selected without reducing the estimation effect moreover when the average nse and r2 values at 20 cm and 40 cm were compared it was found that the average nse and r2 values at 20 cm were higher than the average nse and r2 values at 40 cm indicating that nse and r2 decreased as the soil thickness increased the rmse values showed just the opposite trend this is coincident with the results of wang wang et al 2017 and guber guber et al 2008 finally the estimated deep soil moisture values of 23 stations were obtained in this study fig 10 shows the estimated soil moisture values at 20 cm and fig 11 shows the estimated soil moisture values at 40 cm albergel believes that the main factors affecting the prediction results of deep soil moisture are soil thickness and meteorological conditions albergel et al 2008 this study calculated the correlations of soil characteristics and precipitation with topt table 7 as shown in table 7 bulk density had the largest impact on topt followed by ph the larger the soil bulk density was the smaller the water capacity was that is water was liable to be lost albergel et al 2008 in addition the correlation between meteorological conditions precipitation and topt was not strong which is consistent with wang s research in the united states wang et al 2017 3 4 distribution characteristics of soil moisture in beijing this study analyzed the distribution characteristics of soil moisture in beijing based on daily measured values at depths of 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm from april to october 2013 the coefficient of determination between the monthly average precipitation and monthly average soil moisture values was 0 7 which indicated that there was a good positive correlation between soil moisture and precipitation regarding the trends of average precipitation and average soil moisture fig 12 the change trends at 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm are essentially consistent there were two periods of soil moisture in beijing from falling to rising during plant growth the first period is from april to july the soil moisture gradually decreases from april to may reaching its lowest values in may at 22 10 cm 27 7 20 cm and 28 4 40 cm the soil moisture gradually rises from may to july and the peak soil moisture values are 44 6 10 cm 46 8 20 cm and 51 8 40 cm the second period is from july to october which is a unique period the soil moisture at 10 cm is essentially stagnant from july to august and slowly declines from august to october the soil moisture at 20 cm decreases slightly from july to august rises in september and then gradually decreases the soil moisture at 40 cm shows a straight downward trend from july to october the peak soil moisture occurs in late july and early august which is related to the maximum precipitation and large scale crop irrigation from the vertical distribution of soil moisture the average soil moisture values were is 27 9 10 cm 31 2 20 cm and 33 0 40 cm these values indicate that soil moisture increases from 10 cm to 40 cm the spatial distribution of soil moisture recorded every 16 days can be divided into four stages fig 13 in april soil moisture is relatively high in the east and west regions of the study area soil moisture is relatively low in the north and south while it decreases slightly from north to south in may soil moisture gradually increases in the north while it decreases in the east and west in early june soil moisture rises again in the east and west after late june the soil moisture is stable and high in the east and low in the west moreover the districts with high soil moisture are mainly shunyi pinggu tongzhou and daxing while the districts with low soil moisture are mainly changping fangshan and mentougou according to the soil moisture classification the suburban areas of beijing experienced a light drought in late april and a moderate drought in may after june the west area became drier and the east area was humid the arid regions are observed because precipitation in beijing was small 501 mm in 2013 and evaporation was high 1597 67 mm in 2013 zhang et al 2019 furthermore precipitation was unevenly distributed throughout the year the precipitation in the nonflood seasons from january to may and from october to december was 44 mm which exacerbated the drought in beijing 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture retrieval based on remote sensing soil moisture is an important factor in earth s system soil moisture affects the water energy and carbon fluxes between the earth s surface and the atmosphere schmugge 2007 soil moisture can be measured with field instruments and estimated using remote sensing technology in recent years large scale and convenient monitoring based on remote sensing has become a focus for many scholars furthermore there are many methods used for soil moisture retrieval based on remote sensing and the tvdi has been verified in different regions because it considers both the vegetation growth state and the surface temperature this study found that the characteristic space of the tvdi changed significantly among different periods the intercept of the wet edge and dry edge increased from spring to summer while it decreased from summer to autumn this change was particularly pronounced on the wet edge which shows that the wet edge was more sensitive to environmental conditions than the dry edge these results are consistent with those of min min et al 2015 and sandholt sandholt et al 2002 who conducted similar research in heilongjiang and west africa this is mainly because an increase in precipitation leads to a large range of ndvi values and under this condition the ts ndvi characteristic space becomes more explicit in addition the temperature vegetation quantitative index tvqi the modified tvdi is effective for surface soil moisture which has not been reported in some relevant studies simultaneously this study also found that the tvqi is most closely related to precipitation within the time scale of a month which is consistent with most research conducted in the past few decades song et al 2011 furthermore the soil texture has a great impact on soil moisture retrieval but this study did not conduct an in depth analysis on this factor according to past research the accuracy of soil texture in soil moisture retrieval is ranked as loam sandy loam sandy soil clay loam clay zhang and chen 2013 4 2 deep soil moisture estimation exponential filtering which has been widely used to estimate deep soil moisture in recent years albergel et al 2008 is a model that combines data assimilation technology with physical processes and can solve nonlinear problems however exponential filtering is not a complete physical model the characteristics time length t the key parameter is developed by considering the specific meteorological and underlying surface conditions of a study area ford et al 2014 therefore the application of t in different meteorological regions and underlying surface conditions must be specifically analyzed and its application in beijing has not yet been developed this study found that topt in beijing is basically 1 day which is different with the results of albergel who thought that topt is generally approximately 10 days albergel et al 2008 in addition although topt becomes larger as the soil depth increases the change is not significant this is different from the findings of gao gao et al 2019 who found that topt doubled as the soil depth increased every 20 cm the effect of the exponential filter is not sensitive to topt and the average topt value of 23 stations can be used instead of the topt of each station this is consistent with the result of albergel who found that nse decreased by only 4 with the topt of each station was used furthermore the average rmse at 20 cm increased by 45 4 over that at 40 cm while the average nse and average r2 decreased by 10 6 and 3 2 respectively the main reason for this result is that the surface soil moisture is strongly affected by meteorological factors e g precipitation and evapotranspiration and fluctuates strongly with time the influence of meteorological factors on soil moisture gradually weakens as the soil depth increases the soil bulk density has a significant effect on topt while the meteorological factors have little effect on topt this is different from the findings of albergel who reported that the soil characteristics have little effect on topt and that the effects of meteorological factors are not clear albergel et al 2008 4 3 future studies soil moisture is an important factor representing land surface conditions and it is also an important indicator for measuring agricultural drought wang and tao 1998 for surface soil moisture retrieval soil moisture data measured at sampling points are used to represent soil moisture within 1 km 1 km of remote sensing image pixels which will have a certain impact on the research result determining how to assimilate data points throughout an entire study area is an urgent problem to be solved in future research additionally the research of many scholars has shown that meteorological conditions have a certain impact on topt but these impact factors are not clear albergel et al 2008 this study explores only the relationship between precipitation and topt which can be further studied from two aspects first the characteristics of beijing determine its unique urban micrometeorological characteristics e g the urban heat island effect and rain island effect determining how these urban micrometeorological factors affect soil moisture in the suburbs can be the focus of research in the future second soil moisture and evaporation are important factors in the hydrological cycle and energy exchange process thus evaporation has a significant effect on soil moisture because evaporation data for beijing were not obtained in this study the relationship between topt and evaporation could not be verified in the future various factors affecting topt should be studied to improve the estimation effect of deep soil moisture moreover the tvqi is selected in this model based simulation framework because it is extremely sensitive to water stress and there are many ways e g microwave remote sensing and thermal inertia to retrieve soil moisture based on remote sensing thus in the future we can combine different methods to increase the accuracy of the obtained prediction results 5 conclusions in this study we proposed a model based simulation framework that can determine variation trends in soil moisture the core of the model framework is surface soil retrieval based on temperature vegetation quantitative index tvqi and deep soil moisture estimation based on exponential filters we demonstrated the applicability of the proposed model based simulation framework in beijing from this study the following conclusions are obtained 1 the ndvi is small during the drought period while the characteristic space of the tvdi becomes clearer as precipitation increases temperature vegetation quantitative index tvqi the modified tvdi is effective for the prediction of surface soil moisture the coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of the tvqi are increased by 0 2 0 3 and 4 6 respectively furthermore the tvqi is closely related to cumulative precipitation within 1 month 2 the surface soil moisture retrieval obtained based on the tvqi characteristic space have a significant effect in 2014 the average relative error was 6 the average r2 was 0 9 and the average nse was 0 7 3 the estimation effect of the soil moisture values at 20 cm and 40 cm based on exponential filtering performs well with average r2 values all above 0 9 the effect decreases as the soil depth increases the

10079,tributary stream systems provide an important source of water for sustaining adjacent irrigated agricultural enterprises unfortunately irrigation withdrawals depending on the timing and amounts can have substantial negative impacts on critical aquatic ecosystems in the tributaries current regulatory trends in many regions point to increased restrictions on irrigation diversions for ecosystem protection which could lead to increased risk of shortfalls in agricultural crop production a geospatial decision support system geo dss integrating a spatially gridded hydro meteorological flow estimation model hl rdhm with a gis based river basin management model geomodsim is presented for evaluating water management alternatives for maintaining the viability of irrigated agriculture while mollifying detrimental impacts on aquatic ecosystems and maintaining environmental flow requirements as a case study the geo dss is applied to the feliz creek basin tributary to the russian river of northern coastal california which is home to a thriving viticulture industry while supporting spawning habitat for endangered and threatened fish species the geo dss is applied on spatial 1 km grid size and temporal daily scales that are ecologically relevant for modeling agricultural operations and water rights priorities the geo dss utilizes extensive sets of hydrologic forcing data varying from dry to wet conditions to assess baseline conditions and evaluate management alternatives baseline model results show that with minimum bypass flow restrictions in place for instream flow protection the cumulative effects of upstream diversions can still be significant during low flow periods while creating substantial risk of agricultural irrigation supply shortages the case study application demonstrates that the geo dss is capable of locating sizing and managing off stream farm ponds receiving optimally timed diversions from adjacent streams that are necessary for maintaining agricultural water supply while complying with environmental flow requirements for sustaining aquatic ecosystems keywords stream ecosystems instream flows agricultural water management agricultural storage optimization critical fisheries habitat viticulture 1 introduction agriculture in arid and semi arid regions relies on irrigation to succeed with varying corresponding impacts on related stream ecosystems khan et al 2006 large scale reservoir and irrigation projects have transformed entire river basins often making significant changes to the environmental regime of the basin both directly and indirectly patten 1998 wohl 2018 graf 1999 kingsford 2000 by engineering a river system focused on providing irrigated cropland with necessary water supply at appropriate times many of the natural characteristics of stream systems are negatively impacted for example channelization of rivers provides more efficient conveyance of water but often eliminates wetlands and increases stream velocities and sediment erosion thereby damaging fisheries habitat and reducing the size number and diversity of native fish species schoof 1980 additionally construction and operation of dams for irrigation interrupts riverine natural disturbance regimes which incorporate the geographic variability and time varying streamflow conditions that support stream ecosystems poff et al 1997 this homogenization of river dynamics has been shown to have impacts at regional continental and even global scales poff et al 2007 as an alternative to large scale projects used to satisfy water supply demands on a regional scale water users near tributary streams frequently rely on smaller projects to meet localized needs for flood control water supply and water treatment potter 2006 tiessen et al 2011 while the effects of a single smaller project generally are not as significant on the river basin scale localized and cumulative environmental impacts at the tributary level can be substantial smakhtin 2001 spina et al 2006 pringle 2000 deitch et al 2013 commonly cited effects of small localized storage projects and diversions include reduced downstream supply increased frequency of low flow events and alteration and attenuation of natural streamflow patterns particularly with on stream storage smakhtin 2001 rolls et al 2012 northern california s wine country presents a prime example of a region facing the challenges created by the often disparate needs of agricultural and environmental interests many of the coastal river systems in the region are inhabited by threatened and endangered anadromous fish species in particular the russian river and its tributaries provide critical habitat for endangered coho salmon as well as the threatened chinook salmon and steelhead trout the unique mediterranean climate of the region characterized by high seasonality in both temperature and precipitation supports and informs the variable lifecycle needs of the various fish species bonada and resh 2013 lytle and poff 2004 at the same time the russian river valley supports a thriving agricultural community that is primarily focused on the production of wine grapes while generally requiring relatively lower quantities of irrigation due to widespread use of efficient drip irrigation as compared with other crops grown in the region viticulture still requires irrigation during the usually dry summer growing season smith et al 2004 deitch et al 2009b additionally sprinkler irrigation is often used as a means of protecting grapevine buds against frost and heat damage unfortunately this requires application of large volumes of water over short time durations and can rapidly deplete streamflow in nearby waterways deitch et al 2009b johnson 2015 despite being spatially distributed vineyard demands protecting vine buds are often temporally coincident which can lead to significant short term abstractions from the overall stream system and contribute to fatal stranding events among threatened and endangered fish species swrcb 1997 deitch et al 2009a johnson 2015 in 2008 following one such event the national marine fisheries service nmfs led a multi group effort among a variety of government and non governmental stakeholders to investigate mitigation efforts that would avoid future strandings johnson 2015 in subsequent years the california state water resources control board swrcb approved regulations aimed at protecting fisheries habitat in the russian river basin by maintaining minimum instream flows swrcb 2010 and limiting frost protection diversions swrcb 2011 key to these regulations are the estimation of diversion impacts on unimpaired streamflows and consideration of the cumulative impacts of diversions within a tributary basin accordingly the impacts of tributary diversions in the russian river basin have been the focus of a variety of studies since being highlighted by the nmfs study group in 2008 air temperature and streamflow gage data have been analyzed to document the connection between frost protection and streamflow impacts and the individual and cumulative impacts of diversions on smaller tributary streams have been assessed deitch et al 2009a additionally a gis based model developed that scales streamflow gage data to estimate tributary flows has been extensively used to evaluate water supply and demand throughout the basin merenlender et al 2008 in order to 1 assess the impacts of environmental policies and evaluate off stream storage options grantham et al 2010 2 evaluate the cumulative impacts of small reservoir storage projects deitch et al 2013 and 3 assess the impacts of environmental regulations on streamflows and agricultural water security grantham et al 2014 a key component insufficiently addressed in the referenced research is the incorporation of unimpaired streamflow estimations based on hydrometeorological modeling in the evaluation of water management impacts and alternatives in this study we employ a geospatial decision support system geo dss originally developed by fields et al 2020 that combines a gridded hydrometeorological model hl rdhm with a gis based river basin management model geomodsim to estimate the cumulative effects of agricultural diversions and environmental streamflow regulations on unimpaired streamflow conditions in the feliz creek basin a tributary to the russian river in mendocino county by analyzing agricultural irrigation performance and streamflow impacts across a variety of hydrologic conditions the geo dss is also used to determine the most favorable sizes and locations for supplemental off stream storage development within the basin this type of analysis is key to implementing the goals of the swrcb policy for maintaining instream flows given its reliance on estimates of unimpaired streamflow for setting flow requirements swrcb 2010 2 methods the overall methodology used to examine the water resources characteristics of the feliz creek basin and to develop and optimize agricultural management strategies can be summarized by the following general approach 1 develop geo dss for feliz creek basin based on fields et al 2020 that populates a comprehensive river basin management modeling with spatially distributed unimpaired streamflow input data water rights information demands diversions regulatory constraints and agricultural water management alternatives 2 generate synthetic hydrologic datasets to represent a broad range of water supply conditions for analysis 3 evaluate the existing system of agricultural demands and environmental policies to establish baseline performance metrics across all water supply conditions 4 evaluate the system under various agricultural storage management scenarios and across all water supply conditions for comparison against baseline conditions 5 optimize the size and location of additional agricultural pond storage within the tributary system to maximize environmental benefits and reduce agricultural water supply risk the remainder of this section further details the overall approach and methods of the study and is divided into two larger subsections the first section includes a general overview of the physical agricultural and environmental aspects of the case study area the second section focuses on the modeling aspects of the study and includes a general description of the coupled model and the development of the hydrometeorological model inputs and agricultural management scenarios 2 1 feliz creek case study area as detailed previously the russian river basin and its tributary systems have been the focus of a wide variety of research conservation and regulatory efforts aimed at understanding and improving the overall water resources aspects of the basin the knowledge base established by these previous endeavors provides an ideal framework in which to apply a geo dss to develop management solutions that address the multiple challenges of water management in the basin the feliz creek tributary was selected for a geo dss application based on its ideal combination of relevant features including agricultural ecological and regulatory considerations the availability of hydrologic and typographic data and the practicality of having access to a previously established hl rdhm flow network of the basin this section describes the feliz creek basin in further detail from physical and climatic perspectives and describes the agricultural and environmental aspects of the basin that are considered in the study 2 1 1 characteristics this study focuses on the feliz creek watershed in the upper russian river basin of mendocino county in the northern coastal region of california fig 1 the feliz creek basin generally extends west from its confluence with the mainstem russian river near the town of hopland and drains 108 km2 of total watershed area the climate of the region can be categorized as mediterranean in nature characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers gasith and resh 1999 as a result both precipitation and runoff follow the similar patterns of greater magnitudes of rainfall and streamflows during the wet season dec apr with little to no precipitation and diminishing runoff volumes during the dry season may nov additionally precipitation events during the wet season are primarily driven by atmospheric rivers which generate rainfall patterns that are highly variable in timing duration and intensity dettinger 2013 2 1 2 agricultural setting agriculture in the russian river including the feliz creek subbasin is dominated by viticulture according to 2017 u s department of agriculture data usda nass 2017 approximately 90 of cropland in the russian is devoted to grapevine cultivation with feliz creek similar at 91 of cropland 21 15 ha for grapevine cultivation in 2017 accordingly vineyard based agriculture is the largest water user in the feliz creek watershed and with the absence of a centralized irrigation water supply project in the basin water supplies are generally obtained from direct runoff surface water sources many water users in the basin have developed small storage ponds that are typically less than 200 000 m3 in volume and are used to meet localized demands these ponds are typically filled by either capturing direct surface runoff to the pond or through stream diversions during the wet season and are subsequently relied upon to meet frost protection and summer irrigation demands grantham et al 2014 viticultural irrigation demands can vary significantly depending on local factors such as hydrologic conditions vine types soil types solar radiation levels humidity and temperature among other factors pritchard 2010 furthermore irrigation application rates can vary from full water use to some level of deficit irrigation practice based on localized demands in the absence of specific water use information for each irrigated vineyard parcel an average annual summer irrigation demand of 39 6 cm is appropriate for the north coast region of california pritchard 2010 similarly agricultural water demands for frost protection are generally inconsistent with variations in the number and length of frost events and required application duration while the number of frost events in a particular season can fluctuate between as few as zero events or as many as twenty there are typically four to six frost events in a given year hines et al 2009 furthermore volumetric water demands associated with each frost event also vary but can be approximated as 166 m3 ha per event smith et al 2004 2 1 3 environmental setting northern coastal california provides essential habitat for a variety of threatened and endangered fish species in particular the russian river and many of its tributaries have been listed as critical habitat for coho salmon chinook salmon and steelhead trout since 2005 a designation that recognizes the region as having the physical and biological features essential to conservation of these species u s congress 1973 with respect to anadromous fish species in the russian basin a key component of the critical physical environment is having a requisite amount of instream flows to support the various fish lifecycle stages in recent actions to support this need the swrcb has placed particular emphasis on restriction of streamflow diversions in 2010 the swrcb issued its policy for maintaining instream flows in northern california coastal streams which generally relies on diversion restrictions for maintaining instream flows for protection of fishery resources swrcb 2010 the essence of the policy is that streamflow diversions associated with new water right applications are restricted in time rate and volume in order to mitigate adverse impacts on instream flow rates furthermore the swrcb also adopted the russian river frost protection regulation in 2011 which restricts direct frost protection diversions unless included under an approved water demand management program regardless of the date of the water right swrcb 2011 while additional restrictions meet with some resistance from the agricultural community it is generally recognized that there is a need for better understanding of the impacts of diversions on instream flow rates as well as for methodologies for evaluating viable management alternatives within the basin moreover an increasing number of senior water rights holders in the basin are beginning to adopt operational practices in accordance with the newer environmental flow policies grantham et al 2014 given this trend this study applies the diversion restriction policy set forth by the swrcb as a method of quantifying environmental streamflow demands these policies specify that minimum bypass flows should be based on mean annual unimpaired flows and upstream drainage areas at a point of diversion table 1 2 2 model framework this section provides a brief introduction to the coupled model framework utilized for the feliz creek basin study as well as the hydrometeorological model inputs and agricultural water management scenarios considered for analysis 2 2 1 coupled model description a key component of the swrcb policy for maintaining instream flows is reliance on unimpaired flow estimation for determination of minimum bypass flow regulations table 1 within the policy two general methods for determining unimpaired flows are presented an adjustment of streamflow records method and a precipitation based streamflow modeling method the adjustment of streamflow records method is based on use of existing streamflow gage data from an analog watershed that shares characteristics of the watershed in question as the foundation for analysis characteristics for comparison may include geology soil type topography vegetation land use and precipitation runoff processes among other considerations once streamflow data are obtained they are scaled based on the ratio of upstream drainage area and average annual precipitation at the point of diversion to those at the gage site for estimating unimpaired flows while this method is relatively straightforward it relies on a series of assumptions regarding the watershed characteristics as well as the utilization of streamflow data that may already be considered impaired by upstream diversions and management decisions as a result the accuracy of the unimpaired flow estimations may be compromised the second method for estimation of unimpaired flows as suggested in the swrcb policy is use of precipitation based streamflow models while more technically complex these methods eliminate many of the assumptions associated with the first method that may lead to inaccuracies the policy specifies that such a model should be driven by precipitation data and should incorporate the same watershed characteristics considered in the first method for finding an analog watershed i e geology soil type topography vegetation land use and precipitation runoff processes among other factors after development and calibration a precipitation based model further offers the flexibility to not only determine minimum bypass flows but also be used in conjunction with a watershed management models to create a more complete representation of the stream system the modeling framework used in this study combines spatially distributed hydrometeorological modeling of unimpaired streamflows with a geospatial water management model to realistically account for the spatial and temporal impacts of water management decisions on instream flows this coupled model structure originally developed by fields et al 2020 comprises a geospatial decision support system geo dss that can be further used to evaluate the system across a variety of hydrologic scenarios and management alternatives within the watershed 2 2 2 hydrometeorological model data synthesis and flow scenarios the hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm was developed by the hydrology laboratory of the national weather service and among other factors fully incorporates the model elements identified by the swrcb as essential for a precipitation based streamflow model nws 2009 hl rdhm uses precipitation and temperature data as the primary model forcings and relies on a geospatially gridded implementation 1 4 hrap or approximately 1 km of the sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma model to generate estimates of surface and subsurface flows these flows are then combined with a system of intracell and intercell flow routing methods to generate a network of unimpaired streamflow estimations at any cell location throughout the modeled basin the gridded nature of the model is advantageous for application within the policy structure of the swrcb regulations given their basis on unimpaired flow estimations at diversion sites with locations varying throughout a basin while many traditional hydrologic models generate flow estimations at a single location which is typically the basin outlet hl rdhm flow estimates are generated throughout a basin at each time step and can be correlated to spatially variable diversion point locations an hl rdhm model has been developed and calibrated for use in the russian river basin as part of the noaa hydrometeorology testbed which has been shown to be capable of generating accurate unimpaired streamflow estimates for both peak flow and low flow conditions which is of critical importance given the high flowrate variability in the basin johnson et al 2016 furthermore the hl rdhm model captures the spatial and temporal variability in flows that are not reflected when applying a scaled data approach to streamflow estimation as described in its final report on the russian river watershed the russian river independent science review panel rrisrp found that a variety of stream characteristics influences the rainfall runoff response relationship in the basin rrisrp 2016 walls 2013 developed a stream typology based on these characteristics that incorporates geomorphological and hydrological characteristics of the stream as well as surface water groundwater interactions to categorize various stream types found in the basin fig 2a when combined with typology data for feliz creek basin the hl rdhm streamflow data that have been normalized by upstream contributing area show agreement between the two models and demonstrates the importance of using a precipitation based streamflow model for flow estimation at points upstream of a basin outlet in the streamflow model stream reaches of the bedrock canyon typology exhibit above average responses to rainfall events and decreased normalized flows during dry periods indicating reduced influence from groundwater on the stream baseflow fig 2b conversely modeled streamflows in alluvial type stream reaches exhibit below average responses to precipitation events but show increased normalized flowrates during dry periods indicating higher groundwater contributions to baseflow in these reaches fig 2b capturing these variations in streamflow response through use of a precipitation based streamflow model such as hl rdhm is essential for accurate flow estimations at spatially locations distributed throughout a basin as applied in the russian river basin hl rdhm has been used to generate streamflow forecasts based on observed precipitation and temperature data in the period prior to model development unfortunately the breadth of available data does not span the variety of hydrologic conditions required for this study as an alternative synthetic hl rdhm datasets were generated for the feliz creek basin based on historical russian river flow data in order to obtain a wider range of water supply scenarios for analysis statistical analysis of hl rdhm model output and corresponding stream gage data reveals good correlation between model results at gaged locations and observed gage data in the basin johnson 2021 additionally hl rdhm flow estimations for cells upstream of the basin outlet can be correlated to outlet flow estimations using a second order polynomial relationship based on flow data normalized by upstream area johnson 2021 using these relationships synthetic hl rdhm datasets are generated using synthetic russian river flow data as the primary input fig 3 natural streamflow patterns in the russian river basin are highly stochastic in nature as by atmospheric rivers which generate intense precipitation events resulting in runoff hydrographs characterized by intense peak flows followed by short recession curves furthermore the basin hydrology can be divided into distinct wet and dry seasons with nearly all precipitation occurring between december and may due to the extreme stochasticity and seasonality of the system statistically based models are generally unable to replicate the streamflow pattern characteristics in the basin as an alternative a markov chain approach that retrieves russian river gage data segments of variable length and combines them into a single synthetic streamflow record was employed to generate synthetic russian river streamflow data using flow measurement data available since 1952 for the usgs russian river gage at ukiah a comprehensive set of flow scenarios were generated that accurately recreate the stochasticity and seasonality of flow patterns prevalent in the basin the resulting streamflow datasets can then be applied to generating synthetic hl rdhm datasets based on the approach detailed in fig 3 2 2 3 river basin management model and management scenarios while hl rdhm provides unimpaired estimates of surface flows throughout the modeled basin a more complete model of the feliz creek surface water system must include impacts of water management decisions such as the location and magnitude of direct stream diversions as well as location size and operation of distributed agricultural ponds for this purpose the hl rdhm model is coupled with geomodsim a gis based implementation of the modsim generalized river basin flow model triana and labadie 2012 through use of geospatially referenced stream network data available from the usgs national hydrography dataset http www horizon systems com nhdplus nhdplusv2 data php geomodsim utilizes the geometric network constructed within arcgis environmental systems research institute inc to create a geo referenced river basin model this network uses connected feature classes such as streams canals reservoirs ponds diversions and consumptive use demands as well as ecological and environmental instream flow requirements to represent the stream system and model the effects of management operations by utilizing hl rdhm data as streamflow input at locations throughout the stream network model and by accounting for water rights and policy based restrictions on system operation the geomodsim model generates estimates of instream flows flow diversions and water use that accurately portray temporal and spatial variability throughout the system each geomodsim model run is a unique combination of state variables forcing data and system management settings in this model construct state variables are used to define storage conditions in the basin by including carryover of existing storage as well as defining supplemental storage availability for existing storage the most conservative approach assumes that ponds are empty at the beginning of the water year this is a common condition in the russian river basin not only because stored water is often fully used for agriculture but the emptying of ponds is commonly required under invasive species plans as regulated by the california department of fish and wildlife to control bullfrog populations deitch et al 2013 for a basis of comparison a second set of state variables was defined to include carryover storage of 50 in existing ponds at the beginning of the water year a key use of the geomodsim is to identify locations where additional storage can be accommodated and where it should be located to be most beneficial within the overall system potential sites for supplemental storage were evaluated in seven regions of the basin that correspond to hl rdhm grid cells fig 4 each of these regions supports agricultural use from direct runoff capture or stream diversions and may benefit from supplemental storage availability accordingly two additional state conditions were defined that represent the availability of supplemental storage scenarios with no supplemental storage represent the system as currently constituted and scenarios with supplemental storage allow water to be stored and utilized to meet agricultural demands initial supplemental storage volumes were set to high values that effectively provide unlimited storage with final recommended volumes determined using an iterative process the resulting combinations of state variables result in four management scenarios which are summarized in table 2 as previously described geomodsim model forcing data are comprised of hl rdhm output streamflow data for the feliz creek basin using methods detailed previously and depicted in fig 3 one hundred sets of synthetic flow data were generated to represent a wide spectrum of hydrologic scenarios three representative examples of synthetic feliz creek flow data are shown in fig 5 depicting dry average and wet hydrologic conditions as is evident in the figure the use of upper russian river gage data as the primary input for data synthesis results in generation of datasets that capture the pronounced stochasticity and seasonality of the flow regime prevalent in the basin furthermore the graphs in fig 5 demonstrate the extreme variability of water supply that can occur in the basin and the resultant need to consider a wide variety of scenarios in the evaluating of water management alternatives finally system management settings include modeling aspects that are consistent across all geomodsim model runs for example agricultural use that includes summer irrigation and frost protection demands water rights settings and environmental flow requirements do not vary between model runs which allows the focus of the model to remain on supplemental storage and carryover storage options and the potential effects and benefits of each modeled agricultural demands including frost protection and summer irrigation demands were modeled as per the assumed average values described in the previous agricultural setting subsection similarly environmental demands in the form of minimum bypass flow restrictions were modeled as detailed in the previous environmental setting subsection lastly water rights data from the california swrcb electronic water rights information management system ewrims including diversion water rights locations quantities and priorities was incorporated into the geomodsim to inform its internal network flow optimization model and assure that flows are appropriately allocated per operational and water rights considerations 3 results in the evaluation of overall system performance and the impacts of various management alternatives pond scenario 1 represents a baseline for management conditions under existing flow diversion and storage practices but with imposition of minimum bypass flow criteria for environmental protection table 2 since carryover storage and supplemental storage are included in the three remaining pond scenarios results of each scenario can be measured against the baseline conditions of pond scenario 1 to determine overall impact on the system one hundred sets of synthetic flow data were divided into three hydrologic groups based on the overall average flowrate in each dataset for more detailed analysis 33 dry datasets 34 average datasets and 33 wet datasets performance results for each pond scenario were evaluated across all hydrologic conditions for agricultural supply instream flow impacts and recommended supplemental storage size and location 3 1 agricultural supply risk risks that environmental regulations pose to agricultural water supply are of critical importance to irrigators for this study the risk of agricultural water supply shortage associated with each water management scenario is quantified as the overall number of irrigation shortages observed in the basin divided by the total number of irrigation events in a scenario while this measure does not differentiate between the magnitudes of the shortage events it is generally indicative of the level of overall system inadequacies caused by a lack of available supply at the time of demand in fig 6 agricultural supply risk is summarized for all hydrologic conditions as well as separately for dry average and wet hydrologic conditions for the baseline pond scenario 1 a 69 risk of agricultural demand shortages was estimated based on system performance across all 100 hydrologic datasets this risk level remains relatively consistent for the baseline scenario regardless of the underlying hydrologic conditions under dry conditions the risk level is slightly higher at 71 and under normal and wet conditions the risk falls to 69 and 67 respectively results for pond scenarios 2 3 and 4 show similar trends to those of the baseline scenario with shortages decreasing as conditions vary from dry to wet however these variations are at reduced magnitudes compared to pond scenario 1 fig 6 the relative results of the pond scenarios can be observed within each set of hydrologic conditions and show that the risk trends remain consistent within each fig 6 as management strategies are implemented in pond scenarios 2 3 and 4 table 2 the risk of agricultural supply shortage decreases furthermore a comparison with the baseline scenario demonstrates the relative effects of adding carryover storage and supplemental storage to the system results for pond scenario 2 carryover storage included indicate a 13 risk reduction across all hydrologic conditions when compared to the baseline scenario and within each set of hydrologic conditions this improvement remains consistent results for pond scenario 3 supplemental storage included indicate a 25 risk reduction of agricultural demand shortage for all hydrologic conditions and decreases of 22 25 and 27 for dry average and wet conditions respectively results for pond scenario 4 indicate that the combination of both management strategies can lead to even greater overall impacts across all conditions pond scenario 4 resulted in a 41 reduction of agricultural demand shortage risk and for dry normal and wet conditions the reductions were 37 40 and 45 respectively an evaluation of the volumetric magnitude of the agricultural shortages provides an indication of the severity of the shortages observed in each management scenario volumetric agricultural demand shortage risk is quantified as the overall volume of irrigation shortages observed throughout the basin divided by the total volume of irrigation demands in a scenario in fig 7 results for volumetric agricultural demand shortage risk are summarized for each pond scenario and are grouped to include all hydrologic conditions additionally separate breakouts are included for dry average and wet hydrologic conditions for the baseline pond scenario 1 the volumetric shortage risk totaled 83 across all 100 hydrologic datasets as was observed previously when assessing the risk of shortage events the volumetric demand shortage risk stays relatively consistent when evaluated for specific hydrologic conditions under dry conditions the risk is slightly higher at 85 and under normal and wet conditions the risk falls to 83 and 81 respectively results for pond scenarios 2 3 and 4 show similar trends as volumetric shortage risk decreases from dry to wet conditions but with greater fluctuation and at reduced magnitudes from those in pond scenario 1 as before the relative results of the pond scenarios can be compared within each set of hydrologic conditions and the trends for the volumetric agricultural demand shortage risk are found to be consistent in each fig 7 as management strategies are implemented in pond scenarios 2 3 and 4 table 2 the volumetric agricultural demand shortage risk decreases furthermore a comparison with the baseline scenario demonstrates the impacts of adding carryover storage and supplemental storage on volumetric agricultural demand shortages with the inclusion of carryover storage pond scenario 2 volumetric agricultural shortage risk is reduced by 28 when evaluating all hydrologic conditions and this reduction remains consistent across dry average and wet conditions results for the inclusion of supplemental storage pond scenario 3 indicate a 19 reduction of volumetric agricultural demand shortage risk across all hydrologic conditions and indicate decreases of 14 19 and 23 for dry average and wet conditions respectively finally when both carryover storage and supplemental storage are included pond scenario 4 results indicate that the combination of strategies has the greatest overall benefits to the system across all hydrologic conditions pond scenario 4 led to a 48 reduction of volumetric agricultural demand shortage risk and across dry normal and wet conditions the reductions were 44 48 and 53 respectively 3 2 results instream flow impacts within the geo modsim model priority structure instream flow demand nodes equal to the minimum bypass flow were included immediately downstream of and with a higher priority than each agricultural point of diversion to ensure that minimum bypass flow restrictions were not violated however given the extreme variability and seasonality of the system instream flow rates naturally fall below minimum bypass flow levels for over 90 of the modeled conditions of particular interest are agricultural instream flow impacts that occur during these periods of naturally low flow and the improvements that can be realized as management options are implemented fig 8 shows an example of modeled flow conditions immediately downstream of an agricultural diversion with minimum bypass flow restrictions in place for both the baseline pond scenario 1 and pond scenario 3 where supplemental storage has been included as shown in the figure in pond scenario 3 supplemental storage fills early in the wet season when instream flow rates exceed the minimum bypass flow subsequently in the spring supplemental storage throughout the system reduces the cumulative demand for direct stream diversions during frost events thereby eliminating the severe drawdowns that occur in the baseline scenario during periods of naturally low instream flow rates in fig 9 the overall number of instream flow improvements during periods of low instream flow conditions below the minimum bypass flow are presented the overall number of instream flow improvements in each management scenario is summarized as a percentage of the total number of timesteps where low instream flow conditions were modeled in the baseline scenario results are summarized for all hydrologic conditions as well as separately for dry average and wet conditions pond scenarios 2 and 4 which include carryover storage exhibit similar trends with overall improvements averaging 25 and 24 respectively as hydrologic conditions vary the overall number of improvements varies as well with a greater number under dry conditions and fewer as conditions grow increasingly wetter results for pond scenario 3 which includes only supplemental storage indicate overall improvement in only three percent of low flow timesteps however as conditions range from dry to wet the trend differs from that observed for pond scenarios 2 and 4 with the number of improvements increasing from one percent in dry conditions to a maximum value of five percent improvement observed in wet conditions as a quantitative assessment of the improvements to instream flow rates each incremental flow rate improvement was calculated as a percentage of the baseline instream flow rate at the same time step as an example for a time step with a baseline instream flow rate of 0 1 m3 s an instream flow rate of 0 2 m3 s in a managed scenario would represent a 100 improvement over baseline conditions an overall summary of these results is presented in fig 10 results for pond scenarios 2 and 4 exhibit similar trends across all conditions as well as for dry average and wet hydrologic conditions for all conditions the average flow improvements for pond scenarios 2 and 4 were 99 and 104 respectively indicating that on average where instream flow rates improved under managed conditions the resulting flow was approximately twice that of baseline conditions under dry and normal conditions these percentages were slightly lower but under wet conditions the improvements averaged more than a 100 improvement over baseline conditions results for pond scenario 3 indicate that improvements are significantly smaller in magnitude than those from the other management scenarios for all conditions instream flow rate improvements in pond scenario 3 averaged 39 over baseline conditions this improvement was most significant under dry conditions where the average improvement was 48 under normal and wet conditions the average improvement was 33 and 44 respectively 3 3 results supplemental storage the usefulness of supplemental storage within a subbasin is tied to two primary factors first there must be a demand for extra storage created by agricultural shortages in the subbasin second local instream flow rates must have periods of sufficiently high flows to supply water to fill the supplemental storage as shown previously in figs 6 and 7 agricultural shortages are prevalent throughout the system in the baseline scenario however the availability of water is more difficult to ascertain since an evaluation of available supply must include existing storage diversions and management impacts in the geomodsim model supplemental storage nodes were added adjacent to existing storage and demand nodes within the model priority structure supplemental storage was given a lower priority value than the associated instream flow demand node the agricultural demand node and the existing storage node where applicable in this way the model guarantees that supplemental storage is only filled when instream flow rates are sufficiently high agricultural demands are satisfied and existing storage has already been filled pond scenario 3 was used to evaluate and calibrate supplemental storage options and did not include carryover storage as in pond scenario 4 initially all supplemental storage ponds were modeled with high storage volumes that effectively provided unlimited storage capacity thereby allowing the maximum amount of storage to be retained in each pond when possible model nodes where supplemental storage was used represented locations in the system where additional storage could be considered and supplemental storage volumes were determined for each pond and for each of the 100 sets of hydrologic conditions by subtracting the final storage volume in a pond from the maximum storage volume attained throughout the water year fig 11 finally a calibrated storage volume for each pond was determined as the largest supplemental storage volume determined across all pond conditions these final calibrated storage volumes were used to determine final model results as previously detailed results indicate that all seven subbasins that were evaluated for supplemental storage potential fig 4 could benefit from and support additional storage optimal storage volume additions in each subbasin are summarized in fig 12 and show that subbasins 1 6 and 7 can support the largest volumes of supplemental storage however when assessed as a percentage of existing storage supplemental storage volume additions for subbasins 1 3 and 6 represent the largest fractional increases in storage over existing conditions with increases of 522 246 and 126 respectively subbasin 4 which currently has no existing agricultural storage capacity could benefit from 15 000 cubic meters of supplemental storage 4 discussion this section expands upon the model results presented previously and discusses the impacts and implications of the various scenarios from the perspectives of agricultural water supply instream flows and supplemental storage 4 1 agricultural supply the use of synthetic hydrologic datasets as the primary inputs to the coupled hl rdhm and geo modsim model structure provides a tool to estimate the impacts of environmental regulations on agricultural surface water supply conditions and allows for the evaluation of management strategies for agricultural water supply across a wide range of hydrologic conditions results indicate that there is a significant risk of agricultural shortages throughout the system when environmental regulations that restrict diversions to periods of flow greater than minimum instream flow targets are employed however agricultural shortage risk can be significantly reduced through the addition of supplemental agricultural storage ponds or by allowing carryover storage from the previous water year but is most significantly reduced by employing both strategies fig 6 the addition of supplemental storage and carryover storage extends storage reserves further into the summer irrigation season thereby significantly reducing the risk of shortages associated with higher frequency lower volume daily demands volumetric agricultural shortage risks can also be mitigated through the addition of supplemental storage and by allowing carryover storage from the previous water year contrary to the results for the risk of agricultural shortage events the model indicates that carryover storage can have a greater impact on volumetric shortage risk than can the addition of supplemental storage fig 7 this discrepancy indicates that carryover storage helps to meet the high volume demands associated with frost protection that occur earlier in the runoff season thereby reducing volumetric shortfalls when frost events occur prior to significant runoff events needed to fill storage ponds carryover storage provides a supply to meet these high volume demands which results in greater reductions of volumetric agricultural shortages and a reduction of volumetric agricultural shortage risk finally the results indicate that as modeled agricultural shortage risk is present across all hydrologic conditions and for all management strategies modeled while significant reductions to these risks can be realized through the addition of supplemental storage and by allowing carryover storage additional management strategies are likely necessary to fully supply the agricultural demands of the system demand management strategies such as deficit irrigation and irrigation efficiency improvements are often used to bridge the gap created by limited water supplies and may be a viable option in the feliz creek basin additionally while the model indicates that the system is generally undersupplied as currently configured it is likely that many of these strategies have already been employed to facilitate agriculture in the region further information on specific irrigation practices would reduce the assumptions needed to complete the model and would further close the gap between supply and demand 4 2 instream flow impacts as detailed throughout this study natural instream flow rates in the russian river and its tributaries including feliz creek frequently fall to levels below the minimum bypass flow consequently these low flow periods are particularly susceptible to impacts due to local agricultural diversions as well as the cumulative effects of coincident upstream diversions such as those that commonly occur during frost events while local diversion effects can be effectively mitigated through the use of environmental protections such as minimum bypass flow regulations the cumulative effects of diversions further upstream can be more difficult to ascertain the use of coupled geo modsim hl rdhm allows the impacts of agricultural diversions on instream flow rates to be evaluated across a broad set of hydrologic conditions and demonstrates the potential benefits that various management strategies can have on instream flow rates fig 8 model results indicate that improvements in low flow conditions can be realized through use of supplemental storage as well as by allowing carryover storage from year to year based on this study carryover storage provided the greatest benefits in both the number of instances where instream flow rates were improved fig 9 as well as the average quantitative instream flow rate improvement associated with each instance fig 10 the addition of carryover storage in pond scenarios 2 4 not only helps satisfy agricultural demands thereby reducing instream flow impacts due to diversions but also increases the overall volume of water in the system as compared with baseline conditions this mechanism ultimately results in greater instream flow rate improvement over what can be achieved with only supplemental storage across all hydrologic conditions not surprisingly the benefits are greatest under dry hydrologic conditions while the overall number of improvements to instream flows in pond scenario 3 supplemental storage only are not as significant as those seen in the scenarios that include carryover storage although the results can still be impactful the feliz creek basin typically experiences low flow conditions i e flow rates below the minimum bypass flow for at least 90 of the year regardless of overall hydrologic conditions based on this rate of occurrence low flow improvements for three percent of these days would represent ten days a year of improved instream flow rates as shown in fig 8 these instream flow improvements can occur during extremely low flow periods and could be instrumental in avoiding potential fish stranding events finally the magnitude of the improvements made to instream flow rates were shown to be significant when evaluated as a percentage of baseline flows since most of the instream flow rate improvements occur during the dry season these percentages represent relatively small volumes of water however as shown in fig 8 these improvements often represent a restoration of instream flows to levels that in line with natural flow rates that provide critical habitat for endangered fish overall supplemental storage and carryover storage can have positive impacts to instream flow rates by providing supplies for upstream agricultural demands and reducing the cumulative impacts of diversions 4 3 supplemental storage in the tributary systems of the russian river basin supplemental off stream storage is commonly cited as a preferred management option for the mitigation of instream flow impacts associated with agricultural diversions however the viability of such options may be limited by agricultural demand constraints instream flow availability and operational impacts of upstream water use by combining the distributed unimpaired flow estimates from hl rdhm with the geomodsim water management model multiple options for supplemental off stream storage ponds were evaluated and optimal sizes determined at each location within the seven subbasins identified for supplemental storage potential fig 4 thirteen alternative pond locations were evaluated of these thirteen four locations were eliminated due to a lack of sufficient water supply for filling and the remaining nine were sized according to water availability and agricultural demands given their downstream location subbasins 6 and 7 generally have more available water supplies and support significant amounts of irrigated agriculture consequently these two subbasins have the greatest potential for adding supplemental storage fig 12 interestingly the model results also indicate that subbasin 1 can accommodate a significant amount of additional storage despite its upstream location while the area of irrigated agriculture in subbasin 1 is smaller than that found locations farther downstream existing storage in the subbasin is inadequate to satisfy the associated demands thereby creating the need for supplemental storage as detailed herein implementation of supplemental storage options in the feliz creek basin is dependent on water resource supply and demand constraints however there may be physical limitations on the feasibility as well in the scope of this study supplemental storage management alternatives may include construction of new off stream storage but may also be accomplished through expansion of storage in existing ponds 5 conclusions as applied in the feliz creek basin the coupled hl rdhm geomodsim model structure demonstrated herein provides an effective tool for evaluating overall system performance and water management options in a tributary scale system containing critical habitat for threatened salmonids and while supporting a thriving agricultural community driven by atmospheric river events precipitation and runoff patterns in the basin are highly stochastic yet follow consistent seasonal patterns which is key to the critical fisheries habitat of the basin as well as ideal viticultural conditions of the region traditional agricultural practices relying on direct stream diversions are shown to negatively impact instream flow rates during low flow periods while the complex regulatory structures in the region present challenges for the implementation of irrigation water management alternatives such as the addition of supplemental storage furthermore it was shown that restrictions on agricultural flow diversions for maintaining environmental instream flow requirements can lead to significant irrigation supply shortages model results indicate that off stream storage of water collected during periods of high flows can provide a significant supply of water for spring frost protection as well as throughout the summer irrigation season reducing the risk of irrigation shortfalls even greater benefits can be achieved through allowance of carryover storage from one year to the next at the same time instream flow conditions can be improved through the addition of supplemental off stream storage thereby providing environmental benefits to the system during periods of low flow instream flowrates were shown to improve significantly over baseline conditions when additional storage was included in the system finally supplemental storage may not be a viable alternative in all areas due to a lack of adequate water supplies or insufficient demands in the area the model provides a tool to identify the subbasins within the tributary system that would benefit from additional storage and determine the optimal storage volume at each location while the final addition of supplemental storage in the system will be dependent on local factors such as water rights approvals and site suitability this type of analysis is key to achieving environmental instream flow goals while continuing to support the agricultural industry of the region the feliz creek case study presents a common challenge for irrigated agriculture in arid and semi arid climates the development and use of irrigation systems often imparts negative impacts on the natural stream ecosystems of a region an increasingly common approach to curbing these impacts is the implementation of regulations focused on maintaining minimum instream flowrates through the limitation of stream diversions as a result agricultural water supply security is often compromised however as demonstrated in this research the development of agricultural water management strategies focused on smaller distributed storage projects throughout a watershed can provide the desired ecological benefits while increasing water supply availability for irrigated agriculture funding this work was supported by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa

10079,tributary stream systems provide an important source of water for sustaining adjacent irrigated agricultural enterprises unfortunately irrigation withdrawals depending on the timing and amounts can have substantial negative impacts on critical aquatic ecosystems in the tributaries current regulatory trends in many regions point to increased restrictions on irrigation diversions for ecosystem protection which could lead to increased risk of shortfalls in agricultural crop production a geospatial decision support system geo dss integrating a spatially gridded hydro meteorological flow estimation model hl rdhm with a gis based river basin management model geomodsim is presented for evaluating water management alternatives for maintaining the viability of irrigated agriculture while mollifying detrimental impacts on aquatic ecosystems and maintaining environmental flow requirements as a case study the geo dss is applied to the feliz creek basin tributary to the russian river of northern coastal california which is home to a thriving viticulture industry while supporting spawning habitat for endangered and threatened fish species the geo dss is applied on spatial 1 km grid size and temporal daily scales that are ecologically relevant for modeling agricultural operations and water rights priorities the geo dss utilizes extensive sets of hydrologic forcing data varying from dry to wet conditions to assess baseline conditions and evaluate management alternatives baseline model results show that with minimum bypass flow restrictions in place for instream flow protection the cumulative effects of upstream diversions can still be significant during low flow periods while creating substantial risk of agricultural irrigation supply shortages the case study application demonstrates that the geo dss is capable of locating sizing and managing off stream farm ponds receiving optimally timed diversions from adjacent streams that are necessary for maintaining agricultural water supply while complying with environmental flow requirements for sustaining aquatic ecosystems keywords stream ecosystems instream flows agricultural water management agricultural storage optimization critical fisheries habitat viticulture 1 introduction agriculture in arid and semi arid regions relies on irrigation to succeed with varying corresponding impacts on related stream ecosystems khan et al 2006 large scale reservoir and irrigation projects have transformed entire river basins often making significant changes to the environmental regime of the basin both directly and indirectly patten 1998 wohl 2018 graf 1999 kingsford 2000 by engineering a river system focused on providing irrigated cropland with necessary water supply at appropriate times many of the natural characteristics of stream systems are negatively impacted for example channelization of rivers provides more efficient conveyance of water but often eliminates wetlands and increases stream velocities and sediment erosion thereby damaging fisheries habitat and reducing the size number and diversity of native fish species schoof 1980 additionally construction and operation of dams for irrigation interrupts riverine natural disturbance regimes which incorporate the geographic variability and time varying streamflow conditions that support stream ecosystems poff et al 1997 this homogenization of river dynamics has been shown to have impacts at regional continental and even global scales poff et al 2007 as an alternative to large scale projects used to satisfy water supply demands on a regional scale water users near tributary streams frequently rely on smaller projects to meet localized needs for flood control water supply and water treatment potter 2006 tiessen et al 2011 while the effects of a single smaller project generally are not as significant on the river basin scale localized and cumulative environmental impacts at the tributary level can be substantial smakhtin 2001 spina et al 2006 pringle 2000 deitch et al 2013 commonly cited effects of small localized storage projects and diversions include reduced downstream supply increased frequency of low flow events and alteration and attenuation of natural streamflow patterns particularly with on stream storage smakhtin 2001 rolls et al 2012 northern california s wine country presents a prime example of a region facing the challenges created by the often disparate needs of agricultural and environmental interests many of the coastal river systems in the region are inhabited by threatened and endangered anadromous fish species in particular the russian river and its tributaries provide critical habitat for endangered coho salmon as well as the threatened chinook salmon and steelhead trout the unique mediterranean climate of the region characterized by high seasonality in both temperature and precipitation supports and informs the variable lifecycle needs of the various fish species bonada and resh 2013 lytle and poff 2004 at the same time the russian river valley supports a thriving agricultural community that is primarily focused on the production of wine grapes while generally requiring relatively lower quantities of irrigation due to widespread use of efficient drip irrigation as compared with other crops grown in the region viticulture still requires irrigation during the usually dry summer growing season smith et al 2004 deitch et al 2009b additionally sprinkler irrigation is often used as a means of protecting grapevine buds against frost and heat damage unfortunately this requires application of large volumes of water over short time durations and can rapidly deplete streamflow in nearby waterways deitch et al 2009b johnson 2015 despite being spatially distributed vineyard demands protecting vine buds are often temporally coincident which can lead to significant short term abstractions from the overall stream system and contribute to fatal stranding events among threatened and endangered fish species swrcb 1997 deitch et al 2009a johnson 2015 in 2008 following one such event the national marine fisheries service nmfs led a multi group effort among a variety of government and non governmental stakeholders to investigate mitigation efforts that would avoid future strandings johnson 2015 in subsequent years the california state water resources control board swrcb approved regulations aimed at protecting fisheries habitat in the russian river basin by maintaining minimum instream flows swrcb 2010 and limiting frost protection diversions swrcb 2011 key to these regulations are the estimation of diversion impacts on unimpaired streamflows and consideration of the cumulative impacts of diversions within a tributary basin accordingly the impacts of tributary diversions in the russian river basin have been the focus of a variety of studies since being highlighted by the nmfs study group in 2008 air temperature and streamflow gage data have been analyzed to document the connection between frost protection and streamflow impacts and the individual and cumulative impacts of diversions on smaller tributary streams have been assessed deitch et al 2009a additionally a gis based model developed that scales streamflow gage data to estimate tributary flows has been extensively used to evaluate water supply and demand throughout the basin merenlender et al 2008 in order to 1 assess the impacts of environmental policies and evaluate off stream storage options grantham et al 2010 2 evaluate the cumulative impacts of small reservoir storage projects deitch et al 2013 and 3 assess the impacts of environmental regulations on streamflows and agricultural water security grantham et al 2014 a key component insufficiently addressed in the referenced research is the incorporation of unimpaired streamflow estimations based on hydrometeorological modeling in the evaluation of water management impacts and alternatives in this study we employ a geospatial decision support system geo dss originally developed by fields et al 2020 that combines a gridded hydrometeorological model hl rdhm with a gis based river basin management model geomodsim to estimate the cumulative effects of agricultural diversions and environmental streamflow regulations on unimpaired streamflow conditions in the feliz creek basin a tributary to the russian river in mendocino county by analyzing agricultural irrigation performance and streamflow impacts across a variety of hydrologic conditions the geo dss is also used to determine the most favorable sizes and locations for supplemental off stream storage development within the basin this type of analysis is key to implementing the goals of the swrcb policy for maintaining instream flows given its reliance on estimates of unimpaired streamflow for setting flow requirements swrcb 2010 2 methods the overall methodology used to examine the water resources characteristics of the feliz creek basin and to develop and optimize agricultural management strategies can be summarized by the following general approach 1 develop geo dss for feliz creek basin based on fields et al 2020 that populates a comprehensive river basin management modeling with spatially distributed unimpaired streamflow input data water rights information demands diversions regulatory constraints and agricultural water management alternatives 2 generate synthetic hydrologic datasets to represent a broad range of water supply conditions for analysis 3 evaluate the existing system of agricultural demands and environmental policies to establish baseline performance metrics across all water supply conditions 4 evaluate the system under various agricultural storage management scenarios and across all water supply conditions for comparison against baseline conditions 5 optimize the size and location of additional agricultural pond storage within the tributary system to maximize environmental benefits and reduce agricultural water supply risk the remainder of this section further details the overall approach and methods of the study and is divided into two larger subsections the first section includes a general overview of the physical agricultural and environmental aspects of the case study area the second section focuses on the modeling aspects of the study and includes a general description of the coupled model and the development of the hydrometeorological model inputs and agricultural management scenarios 2 1 feliz creek case study area as detailed previously the russian river basin and its tributary systems have been the focus of a wide variety of research conservation and regulatory efforts aimed at understanding and improving the overall water resources aspects of the basin the knowledge base established by these previous endeavors provides an ideal framework in which to apply a geo dss to develop management solutions that address the multiple challenges of water management in the basin the feliz creek tributary was selected for a geo dss application based on its ideal combination of relevant features including agricultural ecological and regulatory considerations the availability of hydrologic and typographic data and the practicality of having access to a previously established hl rdhm flow network of the basin this section describes the feliz creek basin in further detail from physical and climatic perspectives and describes the agricultural and environmental aspects of the basin that are considered in the study 2 1 1 characteristics this study focuses on the feliz creek watershed in the upper russian river basin of mendocino county in the northern coastal region of california fig 1 the feliz creek basin generally extends west from its confluence with the mainstem russian river near the town of hopland and drains 108 km2 of total watershed area the climate of the region can be categorized as mediterranean in nature characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers gasith and resh 1999 as a result both precipitation and runoff follow the similar patterns of greater magnitudes of rainfall and streamflows during the wet season dec apr with little to no precipitation and diminishing runoff volumes during the dry season may nov additionally precipitation events during the wet season are primarily driven by atmospheric rivers which generate rainfall patterns that are highly variable in timing duration and intensity dettinger 2013 2 1 2 agricultural setting agriculture in the russian river including the feliz creek subbasin is dominated by viticulture according to 2017 u s department of agriculture data usda nass 2017 approximately 90 of cropland in the russian is devoted to grapevine cultivation with feliz creek similar at 91 of cropland 21 15 ha for grapevine cultivation in 2017 accordingly vineyard based agriculture is the largest water user in the feliz creek watershed and with the absence of a centralized irrigation water supply project in the basin water supplies are generally obtained from direct runoff surface water sources many water users in the basin have developed small storage ponds that are typically less than 200 000 m3 in volume and are used to meet localized demands these ponds are typically filled by either capturing direct surface runoff to the pond or through stream diversions during the wet season and are subsequently relied upon to meet frost protection and summer irrigation demands grantham et al 2014 viticultural irrigation demands can vary significantly depending on local factors such as hydrologic conditions vine types soil types solar radiation levels humidity and temperature among other factors pritchard 2010 furthermore irrigation application rates can vary from full water use to some level of deficit irrigation practice based on localized demands in the absence of specific water use information for each irrigated vineyard parcel an average annual summer irrigation demand of 39 6 cm is appropriate for the north coast region of california pritchard 2010 similarly agricultural water demands for frost protection are generally inconsistent with variations in the number and length of frost events and required application duration while the number of frost events in a particular season can fluctuate between as few as zero events or as many as twenty there are typically four to six frost events in a given year hines et al 2009 furthermore volumetric water demands associated with each frost event also vary but can be approximated as 166 m3 ha per event smith et al 2004 2 1 3 environmental setting northern coastal california provides essential habitat for a variety of threatened and endangered fish species in particular the russian river and many of its tributaries have been listed as critical habitat for coho salmon chinook salmon and steelhead trout since 2005 a designation that recognizes the region as having the physical and biological features essential to conservation of these species u s congress 1973 with respect to anadromous fish species in the russian basin a key component of the critical physical environment is having a requisite amount of instream flows to support the various fish lifecycle stages in recent actions to support this need the swrcb has placed particular emphasis on restriction of streamflow diversions in 2010 the swrcb issued its policy for maintaining instream flows in northern california coastal streams which generally relies on diversion restrictions for maintaining instream flows for protection of fishery resources swrcb 2010 the essence of the policy is that streamflow diversions associated with new water right applications are restricted in time rate and volume in order to mitigate adverse impacts on instream flow rates furthermore the swrcb also adopted the russian river frost protection regulation in 2011 which restricts direct frost protection diversions unless included under an approved water demand management program regardless of the date of the water right swrcb 2011 while additional restrictions meet with some resistance from the agricultural community it is generally recognized that there is a need for better understanding of the impacts of diversions on instream flow rates as well as for methodologies for evaluating viable management alternatives within the basin moreover an increasing number of senior water rights holders in the basin are beginning to adopt operational practices in accordance with the newer environmental flow policies grantham et al 2014 given this trend this study applies the diversion restriction policy set forth by the swrcb as a method of quantifying environmental streamflow demands these policies specify that minimum bypass flows should be based on mean annual unimpaired flows and upstream drainage areas at a point of diversion table 1 2 2 model framework this section provides a brief introduction to the coupled model framework utilized for the feliz creek basin study as well as the hydrometeorological model inputs and agricultural water management scenarios considered for analysis 2 2 1 coupled model description a key component of the swrcb policy for maintaining instream flows is reliance on unimpaired flow estimation for determination of minimum bypass flow regulations table 1 within the policy two general methods for determining unimpaired flows are presented an adjustment of streamflow records method and a precipitation based streamflow modeling method the adjustment of streamflow records method is based on use of existing streamflow gage data from an analog watershed that shares characteristics of the watershed in question as the foundation for analysis characteristics for comparison may include geology soil type topography vegetation land use and precipitation runoff processes among other considerations once streamflow data are obtained they are scaled based on the ratio of upstream drainage area and average annual precipitation at the point of diversion to those at the gage site for estimating unimpaired flows while this method is relatively straightforward it relies on a series of assumptions regarding the watershed characteristics as well as the utilization of streamflow data that may already be considered impaired by upstream diversions and management decisions as a result the accuracy of the unimpaired flow estimations may be compromised the second method for estimation of unimpaired flows as suggested in the swrcb policy is use of precipitation based streamflow models while more technically complex these methods eliminate many of the assumptions associated with the first method that may lead to inaccuracies the policy specifies that such a model should be driven by precipitation data and should incorporate the same watershed characteristics considered in the first method for finding an analog watershed i e geology soil type topography vegetation land use and precipitation runoff processes among other factors after development and calibration a precipitation based model further offers the flexibility to not only determine minimum bypass flows but also be used in conjunction with a watershed management models to create a more complete representation of the stream system the modeling framework used in this study combines spatially distributed hydrometeorological modeling of unimpaired streamflows with a geospatial water management model to realistically account for the spatial and temporal impacts of water management decisions on instream flows this coupled model structure originally developed by fields et al 2020 comprises a geospatial decision support system geo dss that can be further used to evaluate the system across a variety of hydrologic scenarios and management alternatives within the watershed 2 2 2 hydrometeorological model data synthesis and flow scenarios the hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm was developed by the hydrology laboratory of the national weather service and among other factors fully incorporates the model elements identified by the swrcb as essential for a precipitation based streamflow model nws 2009 hl rdhm uses precipitation and temperature data as the primary model forcings and relies on a geospatially gridded implementation 1 4 hrap or approximately 1 km of the sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma model to generate estimates of surface and subsurface flows these flows are then combined with a system of intracell and intercell flow routing methods to generate a network of unimpaired streamflow estimations at any cell location throughout the modeled basin the gridded nature of the model is advantageous for application within the policy structure of the swrcb regulations given their basis on unimpaired flow estimations at diversion sites with locations varying throughout a basin while many traditional hydrologic models generate flow estimations at a single location which is typically the basin outlet hl rdhm flow estimates are generated throughout a basin at each time step and can be correlated to spatially variable diversion point locations an hl rdhm model has been developed and calibrated for use in the russian river basin as part of the noaa hydrometeorology testbed which has been shown to be capable of generating accurate unimpaired streamflow estimates for both peak flow and low flow conditions which is of critical importance given the high flowrate variability in the basin johnson et al 2016 furthermore the hl rdhm model captures the spatial and temporal variability in flows that are not reflected when applying a scaled data approach to streamflow estimation as described in its final report on the russian river watershed the russian river independent science review panel rrisrp found that a variety of stream characteristics influences the rainfall runoff response relationship in the basin rrisrp 2016 walls 2013 developed a stream typology based on these characteristics that incorporates geomorphological and hydrological characteristics of the stream as well as surface water groundwater interactions to categorize various stream types found in the basin fig 2a when combined with typology data for feliz creek basin the hl rdhm streamflow data that have been normalized by upstream contributing area show agreement between the two models and demonstrates the importance of using a precipitation based streamflow model for flow estimation at points upstream of a basin outlet in the streamflow model stream reaches of the bedrock canyon typology exhibit above average responses to rainfall events and decreased normalized flows during dry periods indicating reduced influence from groundwater on the stream baseflow fig 2b conversely modeled streamflows in alluvial type stream reaches exhibit below average responses to precipitation events but show increased normalized flowrates during dry periods indicating higher groundwater contributions to baseflow in these reaches fig 2b capturing these variations in streamflow response through use of a precipitation based streamflow model such as hl rdhm is essential for accurate flow estimations at spatially locations distributed throughout a basin as applied in the russian river basin hl rdhm has been used to generate streamflow forecasts based on observed precipitation and temperature data in the period prior to model development unfortunately the breadth of available data does not span the variety of hydrologic conditions required for this study as an alternative synthetic hl rdhm datasets were generated for the feliz creek basin based on historical russian river flow data in order to obtain a wider range of water supply scenarios for analysis statistical analysis of hl rdhm model output and corresponding stream gage data reveals good correlation between model results at gaged locations and observed gage data in the basin johnson 2021 additionally hl rdhm flow estimations for cells upstream of the basin outlet can be correlated to outlet flow estimations using a second order polynomial relationship based on flow data normalized by upstream area johnson 2021 using these relationships synthetic hl rdhm datasets are generated using synthetic russian river flow data as the primary input fig 3 natural streamflow patterns in the russian river basin are highly stochastic in nature as by atmospheric rivers which generate intense precipitation events resulting in runoff hydrographs characterized by intense peak flows followed by short recession curves furthermore the basin hydrology can be divided into distinct wet and dry seasons with nearly all precipitation occurring between december and may due to the extreme stochasticity and seasonality of the system statistically based models are generally unable to replicate the streamflow pattern characteristics in the basin as an alternative a markov chain approach that retrieves russian river gage data segments of variable length and combines them into a single synthetic streamflow record was employed to generate synthetic russian river streamflow data using flow measurement data available since 1952 for the usgs russian river gage at ukiah a comprehensive set of flow scenarios were generated that accurately recreate the stochasticity and seasonality of flow patterns prevalent in the basin the resulting streamflow datasets can then be applied to generating synthetic hl rdhm datasets based on the approach detailed in fig 3 2 2 3 river basin management model and management scenarios while hl rdhm provides unimpaired estimates of surface flows throughout the modeled basin a more complete model of the feliz creek surface water system must include impacts of water management decisions such as the location and magnitude of direct stream diversions as well as location size and operation of distributed agricultural ponds for this purpose the hl rdhm model is coupled with geomodsim a gis based implementation of the modsim generalized river basin flow model triana and labadie 2012 through use of geospatially referenced stream network data available from the usgs national hydrography dataset http www horizon systems com nhdplus nhdplusv2 data php geomodsim utilizes the geometric network constructed within arcgis environmental systems research institute inc to create a geo referenced river basin model this network uses connected feature classes such as streams canals reservoirs ponds diversions and consumptive use demands as well as ecological and environmental instream flow requirements to represent the stream system and model the effects of management operations by utilizing hl rdhm data as streamflow input at locations throughout the stream network model and by accounting for water rights and policy based restrictions on system operation the geomodsim model generates estimates of instream flows flow diversions and water use that accurately portray temporal and spatial variability throughout the system each geomodsim model run is a unique combination of state variables forcing data and system management settings in this model construct state variables are used to define storage conditions in the basin by including carryover of existing storage as well as defining supplemental storage availability for existing storage the most conservative approach assumes that ponds are empty at the beginning of the water year this is a common condition in the russian river basin not only because stored water is often fully used for agriculture but the emptying of ponds is commonly required under invasive species plans as regulated by the california department of fish and wildlife to control bullfrog populations deitch et al 2013 for a basis of comparison a second set of state variables was defined to include carryover storage of 50 in existing ponds at the beginning of the water year a key use of the geomodsim is to identify locations where additional storage can be accommodated and where it should be located to be most beneficial within the overall system potential sites for supplemental storage were evaluated in seven regions of the basin that correspond to hl rdhm grid cells fig 4 each of these regions supports agricultural use from direct runoff capture or stream diversions and may benefit from supplemental storage availability accordingly two additional state conditions were defined that represent the availability of supplemental storage scenarios with no supplemental storage represent the system as currently constituted and scenarios with supplemental storage allow water to be stored and utilized to meet agricultural demands initial supplemental storage volumes were set to high values that effectively provide unlimited storage with final recommended volumes determined using an iterative process the resulting combinations of state variables result in four management scenarios which are summarized in table 2 as previously described geomodsim model forcing data are comprised of hl rdhm output streamflow data for the feliz creek basin using methods detailed previously and depicted in fig 3 one hundred sets of synthetic flow data were generated to represent a wide spectrum of hydrologic scenarios three representative examples of synthetic feliz creek flow data are shown in fig 5 depicting dry average and wet hydrologic conditions as is evident in the figure the use of upper russian river gage data as the primary input for data synthesis results in generation of datasets that capture the pronounced stochasticity and seasonality of the flow regime prevalent in the basin furthermore the graphs in fig 5 demonstrate the extreme variability of water supply that can occur in the basin and the resultant need to consider a wide variety of scenarios in the evaluating of water management alternatives finally system management settings include modeling aspects that are consistent across all geomodsim model runs for example agricultural use that includes summer irrigation and frost protection demands water rights settings and environmental flow requirements do not vary between model runs which allows the focus of the model to remain on supplemental storage and carryover storage options and the potential effects and benefits of each modeled agricultural demands including frost protection and summer irrigation demands were modeled as per the assumed average values described in the previous agricultural setting subsection similarly environmental demands in the form of minimum bypass flow restrictions were modeled as detailed in the previous environmental setting subsection lastly water rights data from the california swrcb electronic water rights information management system ewrims including diversion water rights locations quantities and priorities was incorporated into the geomodsim to inform its internal network flow optimization model and assure that flows are appropriately allocated per operational and water rights considerations 3 results in the evaluation of overall system performance and the impacts of various management alternatives pond scenario 1 represents a baseline for management conditions under existing flow diversion and storage practices but with imposition of minimum bypass flow criteria for environmental protection table 2 since carryover storage and supplemental storage are included in the three remaining pond scenarios results of each scenario can be measured against the baseline conditions of pond scenario 1 to determine overall impact on the system one hundred sets of synthetic flow data were divided into three hydrologic groups based on the overall average flowrate in each dataset for more detailed analysis 33 dry datasets 34 average datasets and 33 wet datasets performance results for each pond scenario were evaluated across all hydrologic conditions for agricultural supply instream flow impacts and recommended supplemental storage size and location 3 1 agricultural supply risk risks that environmental regulations pose to agricultural water supply are of critical importance to irrigators for this study the risk of agricultural water supply shortage associated with each water management scenario is quantified as the overall number of irrigation shortages observed in the basin divided by the total number of irrigation events in a scenario while this measure does not differentiate between the magnitudes of the shortage events it is generally indicative of the level of overall system inadequacies caused by a lack of available supply at the time of demand in fig 6 agricultural supply risk is summarized for all hydrologic conditions as well as separately for dry average and wet hydrologic conditions for the baseline pond scenario 1 a 69 risk of agricultural demand shortages was estimated based on system performance across all 100 hydrologic datasets this risk level remains relatively consistent for the baseline scenario regardless of the underlying hydrologic conditions under dry conditions the risk level is slightly higher at 71 and under normal and wet conditions the risk falls to 69 and 67 respectively results for pond scenarios 2 3 and 4 show similar trends to those of the baseline scenario with shortages decreasing as conditions vary from dry to wet however these variations are at reduced magnitudes compared to pond scenario 1 fig 6 the relative results of the pond scenarios can be observed within each set of hydrologic conditions and show that the risk trends remain consistent within each fig 6 as management strategies are implemented in pond scenarios 2 3 and 4 table 2 the risk of agricultural supply shortage decreases furthermore a comparison with the baseline scenario demonstrates the relative effects of adding carryover storage and supplemental storage to the system results for pond scenario 2 carryover storage included indicate a 13 risk reduction across all hydrologic conditions when compared to the baseline scenario and within each set of hydrologic conditions this improvement remains consistent results for pond scenario 3 supplemental storage included indicate a 25 risk reduction of agricultural demand shortage for all hydrologic conditions and decreases of 22 25 and 27 for dry average and wet conditions respectively results for pond scenario 4 indicate that the combination of both management strategies can lead to even greater overall impacts across all conditions pond scenario 4 resulted in a 41 reduction of agricultural demand shortage risk and for dry normal and wet conditions the reductions were 37 40 and 45 respectively an evaluation of the volumetric magnitude of the agricultural shortages provides an indication of the severity of the shortages observed in each management scenario volumetric agricultural demand shortage risk is quantified as the overall volume of irrigation shortages observed throughout the basin divided by the total volume of irrigation demands in a scenario in fig 7 results for volumetric agricultural demand shortage risk are summarized for each pond scenario and are grouped to include all hydrologic conditions additionally separate breakouts are included for dry average and wet hydrologic conditions for the baseline pond scenario 1 the volumetric shortage risk totaled 83 across all 100 hydrologic datasets as was observed previously when assessing the risk of shortage events the volumetric demand shortage risk stays relatively consistent when evaluated for specific hydrologic conditions under dry conditions the risk is slightly higher at 85 and under normal and wet conditions the risk falls to 83 and 81 respectively results for pond scenarios 2 3 and 4 show similar trends as volumetric shortage risk decreases from dry to wet conditions but with greater fluctuation and at reduced magnitudes from those in pond scenario 1 as before the relative results of the pond scenarios can be compared within each set of hydrologic conditions and the trends for the volumetric agricultural demand shortage risk are found to be consistent in each fig 7 as management strategies are implemented in pond scenarios 2 3 and 4 table 2 the volumetric agricultural demand shortage risk decreases furthermore a comparison with the baseline scenario demonstrates the impacts of adding carryover storage and supplemental storage on volumetric agricultural demand shortages with the inclusion of carryover storage pond scenario 2 volumetric agricultural shortage risk is reduced by 28 when evaluating all hydrologic conditions and this reduction remains consistent across dry average and wet conditions results for the inclusion of supplemental storage pond scenario 3 indicate a 19 reduction of volumetric agricultural demand shortage risk across all hydrologic conditions and indicate decreases of 14 19 and 23 for dry average and wet conditions respectively finally when both carryover storage and supplemental storage are included pond scenario 4 results indicate that the combination of strategies has the greatest overall benefits to the system across all hydrologic conditions pond scenario 4 led to a 48 reduction of volumetric agricultural demand shortage risk and across dry normal and wet conditions the reductions were 44 48 and 53 respectively 3 2 results instream flow impacts within the geo modsim model priority structure instream flow demand nodes equal to the minimum bypass flow were included immediately downstream of and with a higher priority than each agricultural point of diversion to ensure that minimum bypass flow restrictions were not violated however given the extreme variability and seasonality of the system instream flow rates naturally fall below minimum bypass flow levels for over 90 of the modeled conditions of particular interest are agricultural instream flow impacts that occur during these periods of naturally low flow and the improvements that can be realized as management options are implemented fig 8 shows an example of modeled flow conditions immediately downstream of an agricultural diversion with minimum bypass flow restrictions in place for both the baseline pond scenario 1 and pond scenario 3 where supplemental storage has been included as shown in the figure in pond scenario 3 supplemental storage fills early in the wet season when instream flow rates exceed the minimum bypass flow subsequently in the spring supplemental storage throughout the system reduces the cumulative demand for direct stream diversions during frost events thereby eliminating the severe drawdowns that occur in the baseline scenario during periods of naturally low instream flow rates in fig 9 the overall number of instream flow improvements during periods of low instream flow conditions below the minimum bypass flow are presented the overall number of instream flow improvements in each management scenario is summarized as a percentage of the total number of timesteps where low instream flow conditions were modeled in the baseline scenario results are summarized for all hydrologic conditions as well as separately for dry average and wet conditions pond scenarios 2 and 4 which include carryover storage exhibit similar trends with overall improvements averaging 25 and 24 respectively as hydrologic conditions vary the overall number of improvements varies as well with a greater number under dry conditions and fewer as conditions grow increasingly wetter results for pond scenario 3 which includes only supplemental storage indicate overall improvement in only three percent of low flow timesteps however as conditions range from dry to wet the trend differs from that observed for pond scenarios 2 and 4 with the number of improvements increasing from one percent in dry conditions to a maximum value of five percent improvement observed in wet conditions as a quantitative assessment of the improvements to instream flow rates each incremental flow rate improvement was calculated as a percentage of the baseline instream flow rate at the same time step as an example for a time step with a baseline instream flow rate of 0 1 m3 s an instream flow rate of 0 2 m3 s in a managed scenario would represent a 100 improvement over baseline conditions an overall summary of these results is presented in fig 10 results for pond scenarios 2 and 4 exhibit similar trends across all conditions as well as for dry average and wet hydrologic conditions for all conditions the average flow improvements for pond scenarios 2 and 4 were 99 and 104 respectively indicating that on average where instream flow rates improved under managed conditions the resulting flow was approximately twice that of baseline conditions under dry and normal conditions these percentages were slightly lower but under wet conditions the improvements averaged more than a 100 improvement over baseline conditions results for pond scenario 3 indicate that improvements are significantly smaller in magnitude than those from the other management scenarios for all conditions instream flow rate improvements in pond scenario 3 averaged 39 over baseline conditions this improvement was most significant under dry conditions where the average improvement was 48 under normal and wet conditions the average improvement was 33 and 44 respectively 3 3 results supplemental storage the usefulness of supplemental storage within a subbasin is tied to two primary factors first there must be a demand for extra storage created by agricultural shortages in the subbasin second local instream flow rates must have periods of sufficiently high flows to supply water to fill the supplemental storage as shown previously in figs 6 and 7 agricultural shortages are prevalent throughout the system in the baseline scenario however the availability of water is more difficult to ascertain since an evaluation of available supply must include existing storage diversions and management impacts in the geomodsim model supplemental storage nodes were added adjacent to existing storage and demand nodes within the model priority structure supplemental storage was given a lower priority value than the associated instream flow demand node the agricultural demand node and the existing storage node where applicable in this way the model guarantees that supplemental storage is only filled when instream flow rates are sufficiently high agricultural demands are satisfied and existing storage has already been filled pond scenario 3 was used to evaluate and calibrate supplemental storage options and did not include carryover storage as in pond scenario 4 initially all supplemental storage ponds were modeled with high storage volumes that effectively provided unlimited storage capacity thereby allowing the maximum amount of storage to be retained in each pond when possible model nodes where supplemental storage was used represented locations in the system where additional storage could be considered and supplemental storage volumes were determined for each pond and for each of the 100 sets of hydrologic conditions by subtracting the final storage volume in a pond from the maximum storage volume attained throughout the water year fig 11 finally a calibrated storage volume for each pond was determined as the largest supplemental storage volume determined across all pond conditions these final calibrated storage volumes were used to determine final model results as previously detailed results indicate that all seven subbasins that were evaluated for supplemental storage potential fig 4 could benefit from and support additional storage optimal storage volume additions in each subbasin are summarized in fig 12 and show that subbasins 1 6 and 7 can support the largest volumes of supplemental storage however when assessed as a percentage of existing storage supplemental storage volume additions for subbasins 1 3 and 6 represent the largest fractional increases in storage over existing conditions with increases of 522 246 and 126 respectively subbasin 4 which currently has no existing agricultural storage capacity could benefit from 15 000 cubic meters of supplemental storage 4 discussion this section expands upon the model results presented previously and discusses the impacts and implications of the various scenarios from the perspectives of agricultural water supply instream flows and supplemental storage 4 1 agricultural supply the use of synthetic hydrologic datasets as the primary inputs to the coupled hl rdhm and geo modsim model structure provides a tool to estimate the impacts of environmental regulations on agricultural surface water supply conditions and allows for the evaluation of management strategies for agricultural water supply across a wide range of hydrologic conditions results indicate that there is a significant risk of agricultural shortages throughout the system when environmental regulations that restrict diversions to periods of flow greater than minimum instream flow targets are employed however agricultural shortage risk can be significantly reduced through the addition of supplemental agricultural storage ponds or by allowing carryover storage from the previous water year but is most significantly reduced by employing both strategies fig 6 the addition of supplemental storage and carryover storage extends storage reserves further into the summer irrigation season thereby significantly reducing the risk of shortages associated with higher frequency lower volume daily demands volumetric agricultural shortage risks can also be mitigated through the addition of supplemental storage and by allowing carryover storage from the previous water year contrary to the results for the risk of agricultural shortage events the model indicates that carryover storage can have a greater impact on volumetric shortage risk than can the addition of supplemental storage fig 7 this discrepancy indicates that carryover storage helps to meet the high volume demands associated with frost protection that occur earlier in the runoff season thereby reducing volumetric shortfalls when frost events occur prior to significant runoff events needed to fill storage ponds carryover storage provides a supply to meet these high volume demands which results in greater reductions of volumetric agricultural shortages and a reduction of volumetric agricultural shortage risk finally the results indicate that as modeled agricultural shortage risk is present across all hydrologic conditions and for all management strategies modeled while significant reductions to these risks can be realized through the addition of supplemental storage and by allowing carryover storage additional management strategies are likely necessary to fully supply the agricultural demands of the system demand management strategies such as deficit irrigation and irrigation efficiency improvements are often used to bridge the gap created by limited water supplies and may be a viable option in the feliz creek basin additionally while the model indicates that the system is generally undersupplied as currently configured it is likely that many of these strategies have already been employed to facilitate agriculture in the region further information on specific irrigation practices would reduce the assumptions needed to complete the model and would further close the gap between supply and demand 4 2 instream flow impacts as detailed throughout this study natural instream flow rates in the russian river and its tributaries including feliz creek frequently fall to levels below the minimum bypass flow consequently these low flow periods are particularly susceptible to impacts due to local agricultural diversions as well as the cumulative effects of coincident upstream diversions such as those that commonly occur during frost events while local diversion effects can be effectively mitigated through the use of environmental protections such as minimum bypass flow regulations the cumulative effects of diversions further upstream can be more difficult to ascertain the use of coupled geo modsim hl rdhm allows the impacts of agricultural diversions on instream flow rates to be evaluated across a broad set of hydrologic conditions and demonstrates the potential benefits that various management strategies can have on instream flow rates fig 8 model results indicate that improvements in low flow conditions can be realized through use of supplemental storage as well as by allowing carryover storage from year to year based on this study carryover storage provided the greatest benefits in both the number of instances where instream flow rates were improved fig 9 as well as the average quantitative instream flow rate improvement associated with each instance fig 10 the addition of carryover storage in pond scenarios 2 4 not only helps satisfy agricultural demands thereby reducing instream flow impacts due to diversions but also increases the overall volume of water in the system as compared with baseline conditions this mechanism ultimately results in greater instream flow rate improvement over what can be achieved with only supplemental storage across all hydrologic conditions not surprisingly the benefits are greatest under dry hydrologic conditions while the overall number of improvements to instream flows in pond scenario 3 supplemental storage only are not as significant as those seen in the scenarios that include carryover storage although the results can still be impactful the feliz creek basin typically experiences low flow conditions i e flow rates below the minimum bypass flow for at least 90 of the year regardless of overall hydrologic conditions based on this rate of occurrence low flow improvements for three percent of these days would represent ten days a year of improved instream flow rates as shown in fig 8 these instream flow improvements can occur during extremely low flow periods and could be instrumental in avoiding potential fish stranding events finally the magnitude of the improvements made to instream flow rates were shown to be significant when evaluated as a percentage of baseline flows since most of the instream flow rate improvements occur during the dry season these percentages represent relatively small volumes of water however as shown in fig 8 these improvements often represent a restoration of instream flows to levels that in line with natural flow rates that provide critical habitat for endangered fish overall supplemental storage and carryover storage can have positive impacts to instream flow rates by providing supplies for upstream agricultural demands and reducing the cumulative impacts of diversions 4 3 supplemental storage in the tributary systems of the russian river basin supplemental off stream storage is commonly cited as a preferred management option for the mitigation of instream flow impacts associated with agricultural diversions however the viability of such options may be limited by agricultural demand constraints instream flow availability and operational impacts of upstream water use by combining the distributed unimpaired flow estimates from hl rdhm with the geomodsim water management model multiple options for supplemental off stream storage ponds were evaluated and optimal sizes determined at each location within the seven subbasins identified for supplemental storage potential fig 4 thirteen alternative pond locations were evaluated of these thirteen four locations were eliminated due to a lack of sufficient water supply for filling and the remaining nine were sized according to water availability and agricultural demands given their downstream location subbasins 6 and 7 generally have more available water supplies and support significant amounts of irrigated agriculture consequently these two subbasins have the greatest potential for adding supplemental storage fig 12 interestingly the model results also indicate that subbasin 1 can accommodate a significant amount of additional storage despite its upstream location while the area of irrigated agriculture in subbasin 1 is smaller than that found locations farther downstream existing storage in the subbasin is inadequate to satisfy the associated demands thereby creating the need for supplemental storage as detailed herein implementation of supplemental storage options in the feliz creek basin is dependent on water resource supply and demand constraints however there may be physical limitations on the feasibility as well in the scope of this study supplemental storage management alternatives may include construction of new off stream storage but may also be accomplished through expansion of storage in existing ponds 5 conclusions as applied in the feliz creek basin the coupled hl rdhm geomodsim model structure demonstrated herein provides an effective tool for evaluating overall system performance and water management options in a tributary scale system containing critical habitat for threatened salmonids and while supporting a thriving agricultural community driven by atmospheric river events precipitation and runoff patterns in the basin are highly stochastic yet follow consistent seasonal patterns which is key to the critical fisheries habitat of the basin as well as ideal viticultural conditions of the region traditional agricultural practices relying on direct stream diversions are shown to negatively impact instream flow rates during low flow periods while the complex regulatory structures in the region present challenges for the implementation of irrigation water management alternatives such as the addition of supplemental storage furthermore it was shown that restrictions on agricultural flow diversions for maintaining environmental instream flow requirements can lead to significant irrigation supply shortages model results indicate that off stream storage of water collected during periods of high flows can provide a significant supply of water for spring frost protection as well as throughout the summer irrigation season reducing the risk of irrigation shortfalls even greater benefits can be achieved through allowance of carryover storage from one year to the next at the same time instream flow conditions can be improved through the addition of supplemental off stream storage thereby providing environmental benefits to the system during periods of low flow instream flowrates were shown to improve significantly over baseline conditions when additional storage was included in the system finally supplemental storage may not be a viable alternative in all areas due to a lack of adequate water supplies or insufficient demands in the area the model provides a tool to identify the subbasins within the tributary system that would benefit from additional storage and determine the optimal storage volume at each location while the final addition of supplemental storage in the system will be dependent on local factors such as water rights approvals and site suitability this type of analysis is key to achieving environmental instream flow goals while continuing to support the agricultural industry of the region the feliz creek case study presents a common challenge for irrigated agriculture in arid and semi arid climates the development and use of irrigation systems often imparts negative impacts on the natural stream ecosystems of a region an increasingly common approach to curbing these impacts is the implementation of regulations focused on maintaining minimum instream flowrates through the limitation of stream diversions as a result agricultural water supply security is often compromised however as demonstrated in this research the development of agricultural water management strategies focused on smaller distributed storage projects throughout a watershed can provide the desired ecological benefits while increasing water supply availability for irrigated agriculture funding this work was supported by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa
