13925,in this study the efficacy of a hybrid treatment approach by integrating fenton s oxidation with biological treatment for removal of phenol from synthetic coke oven wastewater was investigated central composite design using response surface methodology was applied to optimize the dose of feso4 and h2o2 with maximum phenol removal and minimum toxicity results indicate that 6 3 mm and 20 mm of feso4 and h2o2 respectively were capable of 74 degradation of 1000 mg l phenol 99 99 of 100 mg l of cyanide with 10 residual toxicity which was acceptable for the next biological treatment step on the basis of biodegradation studies it was found that a mixed consortium of three isolated bacterial strains namely bsps cn bsps phe and bsps phe2 were capable of 98 8 degradation of 300 mg l phenol which was remaining after the fenton treatment bsps phe2 was found to be the most efficient with 92 45 phenol removal efficiency phylogenetic analysis of cultures indicated that isolates bsps phe and bsps phe2 were genetically most closely related to pseudomonas species whereas bsps cn was found to be closely related to enterobacter sp the 2 step sequential treatment was capable of achieving 99 3 degradation of 1000 mg l phenol and complete removal of cyanide 100 mg l from coke oven wastewater harmonization of fenton s oxidation with biodegradation makes the treatment method more economical and was found to be an efficient method for removal of recalcitrant compounds from coke oven wastewater keywords hybrid treatment coke oven wastewater phenol toxicity analysis fenton oxidation 1 introduction phenol is one of the most toxic pollutants emanating from industrial wastewater such as coke oven plants 1 wastewater produced during coking process discharges high concentrations of phenol cyanides thiocyanates sulphides chlorides polyaromatic hydrocarbon and heterocyclic nitrogenous compounds most of which are mutagens and carcinogens 2 3 of these phenolic compounds cause severe environmental damage by virtue of its toxicity and leads to decrease in the oxygen availability in aquatic ecosystems 4 5 moreover due to its lipophilic nature phenol rapidly gains entry into human and animal bodies via inhalation ingestion and dermal contact 6 phenol is also known to affect our central nervous system causing damage to various organs such as kidney liver spleen heart and lungs 6 7 due to the inherent toxicity of phenolic compounds it becomes imperative to effectively treat wastewater containing such compounds conventionally used physico chemical methods for the treatment of coke oven wastewater includes coagulation electrolytic oxidation chlorination and advanced oxidation processes such as photo catalysis most of these technologies are not effective for high concentration of phenolic compounds and fail to deliver results at larger scales moreover methods such as chlorination brings about partial degradation of toxic compounds and generates toxic intermediates 8 due to the aforementioned disadvantages associated with physico chemical methods biological treatment methods are increasingly gaining popularity the low operational cost efficient degradation ability to handle a wide range of wastewater and resilience makes biological treatment of such wastes an attractive proposition biological treatment of coke oven wastewater by pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas stutzeri immobilized on activated charcoal saw dust and fly ash with a removal efficiency of 80 5 has been recently reported by singh et al 2016 9 singh and balomajumder 2016 also previously reported removal of 250 mg l phenol in an aqueous solution by pseudomonas putida with a growth rate of 0 0958 h 1 10 although pseudomonas putida is known to effectively degrade low concentrations of phenol in aqueous solutions it is challenging to achieve similar removal efficiencies in a highly complex and toxic coke oven wastewater the aforementioned biological treatment methods may not be able to completely degrade phenol due to their associated toxicity and unfavorable environmental conditions such as low high ph unavailability of nutrients all or some of which could cause an inhibitory effect on growth of microorganisms 11 12 furthermore the microorganisms which are capable of degrading phenol could be sensitive to high concentrations of cyanide and other phenolic compounds present in coke oven wastewater in such scenarios inclusion of a pretreatment step before the biological treatment could greatly enhance the treatment efficiency 13 the purpose of a pretreatment step is to target the reduction of toxic compounds thereby facilitating subsequent biological degradation 14 in the present study a hybrid treatment scheme consisting of fenton s oxidation followed by biodegradation has been investigated fenton oxidation has been reported to be a popular pretreatment step to improve biodegradability of toxic constituents of wastewater 15 fenton reactions are dependent on the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh which in turn leads to the oxidation of organic and inorganic components eq s 1 7 furthermore the fe3 produced during fenton s oxidation is a powerful coagulant which aid in the removal of high molecular weight constituents of the influent by adsorption onto the surface of fe oh 3 flocs which is formed at a neutral ph 16 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 o o h h 3 o h h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 2 o 4 o h f e 2 f e 3 o h 5 o o h h 2 o 2 o 2 h 2 o o h 6 r h o h r h 2 o 7 r o 2 r o o c o 2 h 2 o the addition of hydrogen peroxide in the fenton oxidation step may impart toxicity to the ensuing biological step 15 for successful implementation of a hybrid treatment involving a biological degradation step it is therefore critical to estimate the toxicity of the fenton treated phase this study employs a dual wavelength toxicity analysis of the fenton treated samples to obtain conditions favoring minimum toxicity in addition a response surface methodology rsm based optimization was performed to evaluate conditions conducive for enhancement in removal efficiency of phenolic compounds rsm based methods provide information about the significant parameters and their interaction effects in least number of experimental runs although fenton s oxidation has been employed for phenol removal a hybrid treatment scheme by integrating an advanced oxidation process fenton with biological oxidation for removal of phenol and cyanide from coke oven wastewater has not been investigated much previously 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals employed in this work including phenol o cresol potassium cyanide kcn potassium ferricyanide potassium di hydrogen phosphate and di potassium hydrogen phosphate 3 hydrate were obtained from merck chemicals used for the analysis of phenol were of hplc grade and those used for analysis of cyanide were of reagent grade ferrous sulphate feso4 7h2o and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 were obtained from merck type i milli q water 18 Ï‰ cm 1 was used for preparation of all solutions 2 2 characterization of wastewater the formulation of the synthetic coke oven wastewater consisted of glucose 833 mg l sodium acetate 2000 mg l sodium chloride 100 mg l calcium chloride cacl2 2h2o 50 mg l potassium chloride 20 mg l ammonium chloride 600 mg l and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate k2hpo4 3 h2o 333 mg l 17 phenol o cresol and cyanide were added to achieve a final concentration of 1000 mg l 300 mg l and 100 mg l respectively for fenton oxidation experiments the physiochemical characteristics of typical coke oven wastewater are summarized in table1 2 3 biodegradation studies 2 3 1 bacterial isolation and biological treatment bacterial consortium was isolated from sludge obtained from secondary clarifier of coke oven plant from a local steel plant for isolation of phenol degrading bacterial species 2500 3000 mg l of sludge was added to 250 ml reactors containing m9 minimal salt with 1 ml l of trace elemental solution 10 mm fecl2 4h2o 0 1 mm cocl2 6h2o 0 1 mm cucl2 2h2o 0 5 mm zncl2 0 1 mm na2moo4 2h2o 1 mm h3bo3 and enriched by the culture enrichment technique 13 bacterial isolates were obtained which were further acclimatized in synthetic coke oven wastewater formulation containing kcn 20 mg l and phenol 100 mg l and was gradually spiked up to 40 mg l and 300 mg l respectively amongst the 13 bacterial isolates 3 bsps phe bsps phe2 and bsps cn were selected for further biodegradation studies on the basis of their phenol tolerance capacity aerobic biodegradation studies were performed in 500 ml batch reactors with a working volume of 200 ml the bioreactors were fed with fenton treated coke oven wastewater supplemented with trace elemental solution the flasks were then inoculated with the bacterial consortium and incubated at 30 c at 150 rpm the bacterial samples were harvested at different time intervals centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was analyzed for phenol concentration ph of the sample was maintained at 7 by using 2 m h2so4 and 2 m naoh 2 3 2 bacterial identification and phylogenetic analyses the three isolated bacterial isolates were sent to national collection of industrial microorganisms pune for dna sequencing and 16 s rrna sequences were obtained the 16 s rrna sequences were submitted to national center for biotechnology information ncbi as enterobacter bsps cn accession no mg952586 pseudomonas strain bsps phe accession no mh595949 and pseudomonas strain bsps phe2 accession no mk685233 followed by construction of neighbor joining phylogenetic tree by mega x 3 fenton s oxidation experiments for all fenton s oxidation experiments 25 ml of synthetic wastewater containing 1000 mg l of phenol 300 mg l of o cresol and 100 mg l of cyanide was taken in 50 ml capacity reactor ph of wastewater samples were adjusted by using sulfuric acid h2so4 2 m and sodium hydroxide naoh 2 m fixed amounts of feso4 and h2o2 30 were then added as per the rsm design matrix the contents were well mixed on a magnetic stirrer and fenton oxidation reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature after completion of reaction ph was adjusted to 7 5 0 5 using 2 m h2so4 or 2 m naoh and the treated samples were sealed and allowed to settle overnight next day the precipitate was separated using a 0 45 Î¼m filter membrane and the supernatant was used for quantification of the remaining phenol concentration cyanide concentration and toxicity analysis of the fenton treated samples 14 after optimization studies fenton oxidation was carried out in 500 ml batch reactors with a sample volume of 200 ml at rsm optimized process conditions this partially treated samples were then employed for the biodegradation studies 4 toxicity analysis fenton reagents may imparts toxicity so there was need to check the toxicity of fenton treated samples for successful implementation of biological treatment an optical toxicity bioassay based on dual wavelength analysis of bacterial ferricyanide reduction kinetics was performed to evaluate the toxicity of fenton treated samples as per method describe by pujol vila et al 2015 with some modifications 18 this method is based on degree of inhibition of bacterial metabolism in the presence of toxic compounds the method enables determination of toxicity at dual wavelengths namely 405 nm ferricyanide and biomass both shows absorbance and 600 nm only biomass shows absorbance in the first step the optimum concentration of model microorganism escherichia coli k 12 mtcc 1304 procured from microbial type culture collection mtcc chandigarh and ferricyanide was determined for optimization of cell concentration escherichia coli k12 was grown in 250 ml flasks containing 100 ml lb broth for 18 h in an incubator shaker maintained at 37 c at 160 rpm cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 15 min and re suspended in phosphate buffer 0 1 m containing 2 glucose bacterial samples were then serially diluted from 10 1 to 10 9 in 0 1 m phosphate buffer pb 1 mm potassium ferricyanide was added to each dilution and the optical density was recorded at 405 nm at 5 min interval for 1 h a graph of time vs optical density was plotted for each dilution and the optimum cell dilution was determined on the basis of its slope 1 mm ferricyanide concentration was selected in this study as it demonstrated absorbance below 1 au and was found to be suitable for the optical bioassay 18 for the toxicity analysis 2 ml of fenton treated sample and 1 mm of potassium ferricyanide was added to 10 ml of the selected dilution of bacteria treated samples and ferricyanide were freshly prepared and added to bacterial suspensions immediately before each assay the samples were then kept in a 96 well plate and readings were recorded simultaneously at 405 nm and 600 nm at 5 min interval for 45 min by using microplate reader using skent software thermo scientific multiskan fc control samples consisted of ferricyanide solution inoculated with e coli without addition of fenton treated samples a second control consisting of ferricyanide without bacteria 4 1 response surface methodology rsm optimization rsm was employed to evaluate optimum conditions for the removal of phenol a three factor five level central composite design ccd was employed for optimization of ph dose of feso4 and h2o2 table 2 provides the range of independent variables ph concentration of feso4 and h2o2 ccd consisted of 20 runs 8 at factorial points 6 at axial and 6 at central points with Î± value of 1 6817 upper and lower limits of these independent variables were selected on the basis of preliminary trial runs data not shown in order to reduce systemic biasness experiments were carried out in a random manner all experiments were conducted at a fixed phenol concentration 1000 mg l at room temperature the adequacy of the developed model was evaluated by the determination coefficient r2 adjusted determination coefficient adjusted r2 and lack of fit test the modeling was performed by adjustment of first or second order polynomial equations to the experimental responses the importance of model and identification of the main and interaction effects of variables were estimated by analysis of variance anova optimum conditions were predicted on the basis of p and f values and three dimensional response surface plots and interaction graphs were plotted to examine the effect of variables on responses two responses namely percent phenol removal and percent toxicity were selected as the fenton treated samples would be subjected to a post biodegradation step it was imperative to include toxicity as one of the responses in rsm any unutilized hydrogen peroxide from fenton treated reactions may lead to oxidation of cellular components thereby manifesting toxicity to living organisms moreover residual h2o2 is known to contribute to increase in cod 1 mg l of h2o2 contributes to 0 25 0 27 mg l of cod 19 4 2 analytical methods 4 2 1 estimation of phenol quantification of phenol was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography dionex ultimate 3000 filtered samples were run on acclaim phenyl i column 4 6 150 mm with acetonitrile water 50 50 mobile phase at a constant flow rate of 1 ml min peaks for phenol were generated at a retention time of 3 1 min which were detected using uv detector at 275 nm 4 2 2 estimation of cyanide the concentration of cyanide were analyzed by using pyridine barbituric acid method using chloramine t pyridine barbituric acid reagent as described in the standard methods 20 the pink colour developed was measured colorimetrically at 578 nm using uv spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu 4 2 3 estimation of parameters of coke oven wastewater the biological oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod suspended solids and ammoniacal nitrogen were estimated as per the standard methods 20 toc was measured by filtering the sample using 0 45 Î¼m filter membrane followed by analysis in toc analyzer shimadzu toc l 5 results and discussion 5 1 biodegradation studies 5 1 1 bacterial identification and phylogenetic analyses phylogenetic lineages of the isolated strains to their closest related strains of same genera was investigated by performing phylogenetic analysis on mega x the 16s rrna sequences of three bacterial isolates obtained from in fasta format was run at ncbi using the blast n program to find out the closest related strains of these isolates their phylogeny was studied by constructing the neighbor joining tree by employing mega x 21 22 the evolutionary distance was computed by using the maximum likelihood method and is in unit of number of base substitutions per site 23 stability amongst the clades of phylogenetic tree was analyzed by performing 1000 runs of bootstrap analysis 24 the numbers shown on the branches of tree represents the percentage of replicates in which associated taxa are clustered together in 1000 runs of the bootstrap analysis from the neighbor joining tree it is evident that enterobacter bsps cn shows closest lineage to enterobacter sp strain clone l2 other related species are enterobacter sp strain dbt4 enterobacter strain lc6 enterobacter aerogenes strain zb enterobacter hormaechei strain tmpst t10 enterobacter sp dc6 enterobacter sp clone njfuslx s54 enterobacter hormaechei strain hn14889 and uncultured enterobacter sp clone njfyslx s142 as depicted in fig 1 the phylogenetic analysis further indicated that the isolated bacterial strain pseudomonas bsps phe is closely related with pseudomonas aeruginosa strain tgr2a1 and pseudomonas bsps phe2 was found to be most closely related with pseudomonas plecoglossicida strain p12 other related species of pseudomonas bsps phe2 are pseudomonas putida atcc17390 pseudomonas entomophila q192 pseudomonas putida dn1 2 pseudomonas monteilii jv pseudomonas sp m9 pseudomonas sp onba 17 pseudomonas putida gd15 and pseudomonas sp tswcw20 all three bacterial isolates bsps phe bsps phe2 bsps cn have shown closest similarity with genus pseudomonas sp pseudomonas sp and enterobacter sp respectively several studies have also reported the ability of phenol removal by pseudomonas species such as pseudomonas putida mtcc1194 25 27 pseudomonas putida dsm548 28 pseudomonas aeruginosa 29 30 pseudomonas citronellolis 31 and pseudomonas pseudomallei 29 however literature review on phenol and catechol removal using enterobacter sp is limited 32 33 5 1 2 effect of cyanide on phenol degradation capability coke oven wastewater contains phenolic compounds along with cyanide moieties which may hinder the biodegradation potential of phenol due to its high toxicity effect of cyanide on isolated bacterial cultures was studied by checking their phenol removal efficiency in the presence and absence of cyanide in synthetic coke oven wastewater experiments were performed in two sets of flasks containing raw coke oven wastewater with cyanide 50 mg l and without cyanide for each bacterial culture as well as mixed culture concentration of phenol and o cresol were both fixed at 300 mg l for all experiments and ph was adjusted to ph7 in absence of cyanide pseudomonas bsps phe was observed to degrade 300 mg l of phenol to 79 mg l within 48 h while the same bacterial strain did not degrade phenol in presence of cyanide with slight growth of bacteria fig 2 a similar trend was observed in pseudomonas bsps phe2 with a residual phenol concentration of 48 mg l in absence of cyanide whereas phenol remained unchanged throughout the experimental time in presence of cyanide fig 2b amongst all three isolates enterobacter bsps cn failed to degrade significant amount of phenol in comparison to other isolated bacterial cultures and around 279 mg l of phenol remained in solution fig 2c in case of mixed bacterial strains higher phenol removal was obtained in comparison to single cultures with a residual phenol of 1 46 mg l fig 2d although bacteria in mixed consortium was also unable to sustain in presence of cyanide thus confirming that cyanide is highly toxic to all bacterial isolates and inhibits its metabolic activity toxicity of cyanide is due to its high affinity to metals leading to the inactivation of metalloenzymes 34 in aerobic microorganisms cyanide inhibits the cytochrome c oxidase which is found on the inner mitochondrial surface of cells and shuts down the respiratory electron transport chain 35 due to the toxicity of cyanide bacterial cultures were unable to survive and there was rapid decline in bacterial phenol removal capacity it was therefore imperative to have in place a pretreatment before biological treatment 5 2 toxicity analysis 5 2 1 optimization of biomass several preliminary trial runs were performed to optimize cell concentration for performing the toxicity analysis selection of biomass needs to be such that there is a quick degradation of ferricyanide less than 1 h without interference from the biomass fig 3 illustrates the effect of cell dilution on ferricyanide reduction kinetics at a wavelength of 405 nm the intent was to select the dilution giving the highest reducing slope as higher slope provides better sensitivities amongst all cell dilutions 10 1 was found to be giving the highest reducing slope and dilution of 10 1 was therefore selected for all toxicity analysis 5 2 2 dual wavelength toxicity analysis a major drawback associated with single wavelength based microbial metabolism toxicity assay is scattering of light by microbial biomass this phenomenon interferes with the accurate determination of ferricyanide metabolism as biomass and ferricyanide both gives absorbance at 405 nm the contribution of biomass light scattering was determined by establishing a relationship between cell scattering at wavelength of interest 405 nm and a wavelength where ferricyanide does not give absorbance 600 nm a linear relationship was obtained between absorbance at 405 nm and 600 nm for samples containing different concentrations of e coli as represented by fig 4 this relationship facilitated removal of interference due to cells 600 nm from the total absorbance 405 nm and the absorbance of ferricyanide metabolism at 405 nm was obtained by employing expression given in eq 8 8 absorbance 405 absorbance 405 absorbance 600 1 478 0 009 dual wavelength toxicity analysis performed for 20 different fenton s reagent treated samples as described in section 2 5 absorbance was recorded at 405 nm ferricyanide and biomass and 600 nm only biomass and the absorbance of ferricyanide at 405 nm was obtained by subtracting the light scattered due to biomass at 600 nm from the total absorbance taken at 405 nm by employing the eq 8 inhibition of bacterial growth was determined by the ferricyanide reduction kinetics slope the slope was determined by plotting a graph between absorbance of samples versus time for samples readings taken at 5 min time intervals for 45 min in ferricyanide reduction kinetics concentration of ferricyanide was observed to decrease with time due to its reduction to ferrocyanide by bacterial metabolism as shown in fig 3 for 10 1 dilution in presence of toxic compounds a concentration dependent inhibition of bacterial metabolism changes the value of slope which typically decreases with increasing toxicity control samples containing bacteria and ferricyanide in absence of fenton treated samples exhibited highest negative slope due to the absence of any toxic compounds which inhibits bacterial metabolism fig 5 moreover control samples consisting of ferricyanide without addition of bacteria did not exhibit any variation in absorbance as there was no change in ferricyanide concentration with time fig 5 depicts slopes of different fenton treated samples which varied on the basis of concentration dependent inhibition of bacterial metabolism toxicity of the ferricyanide reduction kinetics was determined by employing eq 9 9 i 100 slope toxic slope e coli 100 where i i indicates inhibition percentage ii slope toxic corresponds to the slope of absorbance versus time for samples containing the toxic agent e coli and potassium ferricyanide and iii slope e coli represents the slope of control sample containing bacteria and ferricyanide without fenton treated samples 5 3 rsm optimization of fenton s reagents design expert software 7 0 was used to design the rsm experiments and optimize the process a total of 20 experiments were run and the results obtained were used to analyze the effect of variables namely dose of feso4 x1 dose of h2o2 x2 and ph x3 on the experimental responses percent phenol removal and percent toxicity the complete design matrix with the experimental and predicted responses are shown in table 3 the percentage phenol removal and toxicity ranged between 61 62 98 82 and 7 5 55 respectively the predicted and experimental responses obtained were found to be quite close to each other suggesting that a quadratic model best fitted for both response variables table 3 an empirical relationship in terms of coded factors between factor variables dose of feso4 dose of h2o2 and ph and response variables percent phenol removal and toxicity is represented by eq s 10 and 11 10 percent phenol removal 81 57 4 05 x1 7 14 x2 8 59 x3 1 96 x1 x2 1 96 x1 x3 0 19 x2 x3 0 12 x1 2 2 33 x2 2 0 21x3 2 11 percent toxicity 40 48 1 44x1 13 02x2 3 52x3 2 19x1x2 0 31x1x3 5 94x2x3 1 64x1 2 3 40 x2 2 2 52 x3 2 the statistical parameters obtained from the results of anova analysis of variance are presented in table 4 the quality of the model was analyzed by the correlation coefficient wherein the correlation coefficient depicts the amount of variation explained by the model the r2 value for percent phenol removal and toxicity was found to be 0 98 and 0 97 respectively and the adjusted r2 values for both the responses were found within reasonable agreement with predicted r2 value suggesting that the applied model was significant for phenol removal the p values for all three factors were found to be 0 0001 thereby indicating that dose of feso4 dose of h2o2 and ph plays a significant role for toxicity h2o2 appeared to play a key role rather than feso4 and ph which is further confirmed by their p value table 4 amongst the interacting factors the interaction between feso4 and h2o2 x1x2 and interaction between feso4 and ph x1x3 were found to be having the most significant effect on phenol removal whereas for toxicity interaction between h2o2 and ph x2x3 was found to be the most significant the three dimensional response surface plots which were plotted on the basis of the regression model is presented in fig 6 on the basis of these plots the effect of independent factors dose of h2o2 dose of feso4 and ph on experimental responses have been further discussed 5 3 1 effect of dose of ferrous sulphate fe 2 ferrous ion acts as a catalyst during fenton s oxidation process and induces decomposition of h2o2 resulting in the formation of oh which leads to the degradation of phenol fig 6a as the reaction proceeds pores and protuberances are formed on the surfaces of iron powder which is owing to the corrosion of iron powder leading to the formation of iron scruff 36 increasing feso4 in excess of 15 mm does not improve phenol removal efficiency as the additional fe 2 remains unutilized in the system causing scavenging of oh thus bringing up the operational cost eq 12 37 fe 2 does not have much effect on the residual toxicity fig 6b d 12 fe2 oh fe3 oh 5 3 2 effect of dose of hydrogen peroxide during fenton s oxidation hydroxyl free radicals oh are generated by the reaction of fe 3 and h2o2 which plays a key role in the degradation of phenolic compounds 38 phenol degradation was observed to increase with enhancement in the dose of h2o2 fig 6a which is probably due to increase in oh in the system the generation of oh radicals within the system is from the decomposition of h2o2 as presented in eq 13 chu et al 2012 reported that low dose of h2o2 leads to partial degradation of phenol resulting in generation of intermediates of phenolic compounds such as p benzoquinone and 2 methyl p benzoquinone even after 2 5 h of reaction whereas high dose 0 3 m of h2o2 generated more hydroxyl radicals resulting in complete oxidation of phenolic compounds and no intermediate compounds were observed 36 no change in the percent phenol degradation was observed on increasing the dose of h2o2 after 36 mm excessive amount of oh not only increases the reaction cost but also leads to scavenging of oh radicals eq 14 which poses detrimental effect on phenol degradation efficiency 37 similar pattern was observed by kallel et al 2009 where an over dose of h2o2 led to an inhibition of oxidation reaction 39 moreover increased oh radicals is found to have an opposite effect on growth of microorganism fig 4b as oh are known to be highly toxic to living organisms due to inactivation of dna by breaking its sugar phosphate backbone and detaching the bases and synthesizing single stranded apurinic apyrimidinic sites 15 13 h2o ho h e 14 h2o2 oh h2o ho2 5 3 3 effect of ph ph plays a key role in controlling fenton s oxidation process as it in turn affects several factors of oxidation process such as stability and catalytic activity of h2o2 activity of dominant iron species as well as substrate 40 ph was varied from 3 to 9 to analyze the effect of ph on phenol removal fig 6c and e indicates that fenton s oxidation showed maximum catalytic activity at a ph range between 2 4 this is due to the generation of oh at acidic ph which enhanced the oxidation of organic compounds an acidic ph breaks down h2o2 into h2o and o2 and enhances the oxidation process by producing more number of oh moreover acidic ph favored the generation and corrosion of ferrous ions 41 very low ph less than 2 decreases phenol removal efficiency as it causes scavenging of oh as described by eq 15 37 several previous studies have reported an optimum ph range 2 3 for removal of several contaminants using fenton oxidation process 38 42 43 catalytic activity decreases with increase in ph primarily due to precipitation and hydrolysis of fe 3 ph 5 leads to the formation of fe oh 3 precipitate thereby leading to loss of ferrous concentration by forming fe ii complex in addition at ph above 5 ferryl radical feo2 are formed which is more selective in its action than oh eq 16 38 additionally alkaline ph 7 leads to lower oxidation potential of oh decomposition of h2o2 and deactivation of catalysts resulting in reduction in number of oh in the present study ph was finally adjusted to 7 which was conducive for growth of microorganisms 15 h oh e h2o 16 fe2 h2o2 fe iv e g feo2 h2o 5 3 4 process optimization for optimization the percent phenol removal was set at maximize whereas percent toxicity was kept at minimize with maximum importance doses of feso4 and h2o2 were kept at minimize because these compounds imparts toxicity and the intent was successful implementation of a second stage biodegradation step ph was kept in range as it was not found to affect toxicity the optimized values for dose of feso4 h2o2 and ph were found to be 6 31 mm 20 mm and 3 respectively at these conditions the predicted percent phenol removal and percent residual toxicity were found to be 72 4 and 11 96 respectively experiments were conducted at the optimized conditions and 74 69 removal of phenol 99 9 degradation of cyanide with 10 toxicity was observed which was acceptably close to the predicted values fenton oxidation generates highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals in the presence of fe 2 and h2o2 which effectively removed 100 mg l of cyanide within 30 min due to the generation of hydroxyl radicals the oh radicals undergoes reaction 17 and 18 leading to a stepwise reduction in the concentration of cyanide 44 the cyanate ion ocn is less toxic than cyanide and further oxidizes to yield carbon dioxide co2 and n2 as final products eq 18 45 17 cn oh ocn h2o 18 ocn o2 co2 n2 fenton oxidation employed as a pretreatment method led to nearly complete removal of cyanide and reduced phenol concentration so as to make the treated effluent less toxic and suitable for further biological treatment step the fenton treated samples were having approximately 300 mg l of residual phenol at the optimized conditions which was further subjected to a biological degradation step 5 4 proposed mechanism of phenol oxidation via fenton s treatment 5 4 1 formation of aromatic intermediates phenol oxidation starts with hydroxylation of the aromatic ring of phenol by the hydroxyl free radicals oh generated in the system 37 hydroxyl radicals triggers the hydroxylation process resulting in the formation of dihydroxybenzenes such as catechol resorcinol and hydroquinone depending on the position of hydroxylation in the aromatic ring fig 7 catechol is the primary product formed by ortho hydroxylation whereas hydroquinone and resorcinol are produced as a result of para and meta hydroxylation respectively 46 catechol constitutes the primary product of hydroxylation with resorcinol and hydroquinone contributing to 1 10th of catechol 47 hydroxylation is followed by ring opening of the aforementioned aromatic intermediates leading to the formation of several organic acids which further oxidizes to form co2 and h2o these organic acid intermediates are either final product or intermediate product of phenol oxidation 5 4 2 formation of organic acids aromatic intermediates show higher oxidation rate than organic acids and phenol 46 thus have a tendency to immediately oxidize to form muconic acid by c c cleavage 48 muconic acid further oxidizes to maleic acid due to the action of oh these two compounds are large sized organic acids which gets further converted into short chain acids such as oxalic acid formic acid and acetic acid initially complete oxidation of muconic acid into maleic acid takes place which later forms oxalic acid followed by glyoxylic acid malonic acid and formic acid 48 malonic acid further oxidizes into formic acid oxalic acid and acetic acid the rate of production of oxalic acid from maleic acid remains lower than rate of production of formic acid from maleic acid in the initial stages of oxidation maleic acid formic acid and acetic acid forms abundantly whereas oxalic acid is generated initially in trace amounts and its concentration increases as the reaction proceeds 46 acetic acid remains in its native form and exists as a final product of phenol oxidation whereas formic acid and oxalic acid further oxidizes into co2 and h2o 5 5 sequential bio treatment of fenton pretreated effluent 5 5 1 effect of ph on phenol degradation phenol reduction using isolated bacterial strains pseudomonas bsps phe pseudomonas bsps phe2 and enterobacter bsps cn were found to be ph dependent fig 8 clearly depicts that all the isolated bacterial cultures could not withstand the ph change from neutral to acidic or alkaline phenol degradation rate deteriorated at acidic ph 3 with phenol removal of 19 34 19 35 and 11 87 for enterobacter bsps cn pseudomonas bsps phe and pseudomonas bsps phe2 respectively percent phenol removal increased with basic ph and reached a maximum value at ph 7 with 49 9 92 45 and 53 6 phenol removal for pseudomonas bsps phe pseudomonas bsps phe 2 and enterobacter bsps cn respectively rate of phenol degradation declined with further increase in ph up to 9 with 41 34 32 35 and 46 7 for enterobacter bsps cn pseudomonas bsps phe and pseudomonas bsps phe2 respectively maximum phenol removal efficiency was observed at ph7 and this ph was maintained in further biodegradation studies likewise neutral ph was observed to be the optimum ph for biodegradation of phenolic compounds in some previous studies too 26 49 this could be attributed to the fact that phenol hydroxylase which is primarily responsible for phenol removal shows 90 100 activity at ph7 ph8 on adjusting the ph below 7 and above 8 this enzyme demonstrated reduced stability and exhibited only 40 activity at an acidic ph5 and basic ph ph10 50 amongst the isolated bacterial cultures phenol removal capacity was highest for pseudomonas bsps phe2 followed by pseudomonas bsps phe and lastly enterobacter bsps cn for all ph values however when a mixed consortium of all three bacterial strains were employed maximum phenol removal was observed with 25 85 85 32 98 8 and 79 57 efficiency at ph 3 5 7 and 9 respectively it was also observed that enterobacter strain efficiently removed 300 mg l of phenol in fenton treated coke oven wastewater fig 8 but failed to degrade the same amount of phenol in raw wastewater even in the absence of cyanide fig 2c the toxicity of associated aromatics such as o cresol 300 mg l present in raw coke oven waste water may be responsible for this discrepancy however fenton oxidation reduced the concentration of aromatic compounds including o cresol thereby enhancing the biodegradability of wastewater which eventually resulted in efficient degradation of phenol by enterobacter in fenton treated coke oven waste water fig 8 kim and kim 2003 reported inhibitory effects of m cresol above 50 mg l on activated sludge during treatment of coke oven wastewater 51 kim et al 2008 also observed the inhibition of microbial denitrification process due to the inhibitory effect of p cresol present in coke oven wastewater 52 furthermore peroxidase catalyzed oxidative polymerization of phenol also contributes towards phenol removal in neutral to alkaline conditions ph7 to 9 53 peroxidases are released by several microorganisms in presence of hydrogen peroxide wherein hydroxyl radical converts peroxidase into its active intermediate form which further oxidizes phenolic compounds into polymer 54 55 in the present study biodegradation experiments were carried out in fenton treated coke oven wastewater that may contain traces of unutilized h2o2 this h2o2 present in fenton treated wastewater may activate the peroxidase enzyme released by isolated bacterial cultures and further catalyze the phenol polymerization 55 several previous studies have reported the presence of peroxidase enzyme in various strains of pseudomonas 56 57 5 5 2 phenol biodegradation using mixed culture after fenton s treatment process coke oven effluent was further subjected to a biological treatment a mixed bacterial consortium namely pseudomonas strain bsps phe pseudomonas strain bsps phe2 and enterobacter strain bsps cn were added to the fenton s treated effluent and incubated for approximately 40 h at ph7 to attain the steady state conditions as illustrated in fig 9 the inoculated consortia was capable of degrading 99 of the residual phenol concentration this two step hybrid treatment method has proven to be highly successful in treatment of phenol from coke oven wastewater there was stepwise decrement in phenol concentration by 72 4 and 26 9 using fenton treatment and biological treatment respectively achieving an overall 99 3 removal of total phenol concentration 6 conclusion in this work treatment of recalcitrant coke oven waste water was accomplished by employing fenton oxidation coupled with biological degradation results after fenton oxidation process showed that at an optimum ph 3 ferrous sulphate 6 3 mm hydrogen peroxide 20 mm and contact time of 30 min 71 46 of phenol and 99 99 of cyanide was removed with 10 56 of residual toxicity from a synthetic coke oven wastewater containing 1000 mg l of phenol the interaction between ferrous sulphate and hydrogen peroxide was the most significant for phenol removal on the other hand interaction between hydrogen peroxide and ph was found to be most significant for toxicity out of three isolated pure cultures pseudomonas strain bsps phe2 was found to be the most efficient with 92 45 phenol removal 300 mg l but mixed consortium was found to have better phenol removal efficiency i e 99 at ph7 when compared to any of the pure culture of isolates a stepwise decrement in phenol concentration of 72 4 and 26 9 was achieved by employing fenton and biological treatment respectively overall a complete removal of cyanide and 99 3 removal of phenol was achieved and fig 10 depicts the stepwise decline in concentration of toxic compounds this type of hybrid treatment provides new cost effective approach which can be applied on pilot scale for industrial applications future works would aim at carrying out genetic and molecular studies of the isolated cultures responsible for phenol and cyanide removal to better understand the mechanism involved in removal of these recalcitrant

13925,in this study the efficacy of a hybrid treatment approach by integrating fenton s oxidation with biological treatment for removal of phenol from synthetic coke oven wastewater was investigated central composite design using response surface methodology was applied to optimize the dose of feso4 and h2o2 with maximum phenol removal and minimum toxicity results indicate that 6 3 mm and 20 mm of feso4 and h2o2 respectively were capable of 74 degradation of 1000 mg l phenol 99 99 of 100 mg l of cyanide with 10 residual toxicity which was acceptable for the next biological treatment step on the basis of biodegradation studies it was found that a mixed consortium of three isolated bacterial strains namely bsps cn bsps phe and bsps phe2 were capable of 98 8 degradation of 300 mg l phenol which was remaining after the fenton treatment bsps phe2 was found to be the most efficient with 92 45 phenol removal efficiency phylogenetic analysis of cultures indicated that isolates bsps phe and bsps phe2 were genetically most closely related to pseudomonas species whereas bsps cn was found to be closely related to enterobacter sp the 2 step sequential treatment was capable of achieving 99 3 degradation of 1000 mg l phenol and complete removal of cyanide 100 mg l from coke oven wastewater harmonization of fenton s oxidation with biodegradation makes the treatment method more economical and was found to be an efficient method for removal of recalcitrant compounds from coke oven wastewater keywords hybrid treatment coke oven wastewater phenol toxicity analysis fenton oxidation 1 introduction phenol is one of the most toxic pollutants emanating from industrial wastewater such as coke oven plants 1 wastewater produced during coking process discharges high concentrations of phenol cyanides thiocyanates sulphides chlorides polyaromatic hydrocarbon and heterocyclic nitrogenous compounds most of which are mutagens and carcinogens 2 3 of these phenolic compounds cause severe environmental damage by virtue of its toxicity and leads to decrease in the oxygen availability in aquatic ecosystems 4 5 moreover due to its lipophilic nature phenol rapidly gains entry into human and animal bodies via inhalation ingestion and dermal contact 6 phenol is also known to affect our central nervous system causing damage to various organs such as kidney liver spleen heart and lungs 6 7 due to the inherent toxicity of phenolic compounds it becomes imperative to effectively treat wastewater containing such compounds conventionally used physico chemical methods for the treatment of coke oven wastewater includes coagulation electrolytic oxidation chlorination and advanced oxidation processes such as photo catalysis most of these technologies are not effective for high concentration of phenolic compounds and fail to deliver results at larger scales moreover methods such as chlorination brings about partial degradation of toxic compounds and generates toxic intermediates 8 due to the aforementioned disadvantages associated with physico chemical methods biological treatment methods are increasingly gaining popularity the low operational cost efficient degradation ability to handle a wide range of wastewater and resilience makes biological treatment of such wastes an attractive proposition biological treatment of coke oven wastewater by pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas stutzeri immobilized on activated charcoal saw dust and fly ash with a removal efficiency of 80 5 has been recently reported by singh et al 2016 9 singh and balomajumder 2016 also previously reported removal of 250 mg l phenol in an aqueous solution by pseudomonas putida with a growth rate of 0 0958 h 1 10 although pseudomonas putida is known to effectively degrade low concentrations of phenol in aqueous solutions it is challenging to achieve similar removal efficiencies in a highly complex and toxic coke oven wastewater the aforementioned biological treatment methods may not be able to completely degrade phenol due to their associated toxicity and unfavorable environmental conditions such as low high ph unavailability of nutrients all or some of which could cause an inhibitory effect on growth of microorganisms 11 12 furthermore the microorganisms which are capable of degrading phenol could be sensitive to high concentrations of cyanide and other phenolic compounds present in coke oven wastewater in such scenarios inclusion of a pretreatment step before the biological treatment could greatly enhance the treatment efficiency 13 the purpose of a pretreatment step is to target the reduction of toxic compounds thereby facilitating subsequent biological degradation 14 in the present study a hybrid treatment scheme consisting of fenton s oxidation followed by biodegradation has been investigated fenton oxidation has been reported to be a popular pretreatment step to improve biodegradability of toxic constituents of wastewater 15 fenton reactions are dependent on the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh which in turn leads to the oxidation of organic and inorganic components eq s 1 7 furthermore the fe3 produced during fenton s oxidation is a powerful coagulant which aid in the removal of high molecular weight constituents of the influent by adsorption onto the surface of fe oh 3 flocs which is formed at a

addition of hydrogen peroxide in the fenton oxidation step may impart toxicity to the ensuing biological step 15 for successful implementation of a hybrid treatment involving a biological degradation step it is therefore critical to estimate the toxicity of the fenton treated phase this study employs a dual wavelength toxicity analysis of the fenton treated samples to obtain conditions favoring minimum toxicity in addition a response surface methodology rsm based optimization was performed to evaluate conditions conducive for enhancement in removal efficiency of phenolic compounds rsm based methods provide information about the significant parameters and their interaction effects in least number of experimental runs although fenton s oxidation has been employed for phenol removal a hybrid treatment scheme by integrating an advanced oxidation process fenton with biological oxidation for removal of phenol and cyanide from coke oven wastewater has not been investigated much previously 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals employed in this work including phenol o cresol potassium cyanide kcn potassium ferricyanide potassium di hydrogen phosphate and di potassium hydrogen phosphate 3 hydrate were obtained from merck chemicals used for the analysis of phenol were of hplc grade and those used for analysis of cyanide were of reagent grade ferrous sulphate feso4 7h2o and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 were obtained from merck type i milli q water 18 Ï‰ cm 1 was used for preparation of all solutions 2 2 characterization of wastewater the formulation of the synthetic coke oven wastewater consisted of glucose 833 mg l sodium acetate 2000 mg l sodium chloride 100 mg l calcium chloride cacl2 2h2o 50 mg l potassium chloride 20 mg l ammonium chloride 600 mg l and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate k2hpo4 3 h2o 333 mg l 17 phenol o cresol and cyanide were added to achieve a final concentration of 1000 mg l 300 mg l and 100 mg l respectively for fenton oxidation experiments the physiochemical characteristics of typical coke oven wastewater are summarized in table1 2 3 biodegradation studies 2 3 1 bacterial isolation and biological treatment bacterial consortium was isolated from sludge obtained from secondary clarifier of coke oven plant from a local steel plant for isolation of phenol degrading bacterial species 2500 3000 mg l of sludge was added to 250 ml reactors containing m9 minimal salt with 1 ml l of trace elemental solution 10 mm fecl2 4h2o 0 1 mm cocl2 6h2o 0 1 mm cucl2 2h2o 0 5 mm zncl2 0 1 mm na2moo4 2h2o 1 mm h3bo3 and enriched by the culture enrichment technique 13 bacterial isolates were obtained which were further acclimatized in synthetic coke oven wastewater formulation containing kcn 20 mg l and phenol 100 mg l and was gradually spiked up to 40 mg l and 300 mg l respectively amongst the 13 bacterial isolates 3 bsps phe bsps phe2 and bsps cn were selected for further biodegradation studies on the basis of their phenol tolerance capacity aerobic biodegradation studies were performed in 500 ml batch reactors with a working volume of 200 ml the bioreactors were fed with fenton treated coke oven wastewater supplemented with trace elemental solution the flasks were then inoculated with the bacterial consortium and incubated at 30 c at 150 rpm the bacterial samples were harvested at different time intervals centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was analyzed for phenol concentration ph of the sample was maintained at 7 by using 2 m h2so4 and 2 m naoh 2 3 2 bacterial identification and phylogenetic analyses the three isolated bacterial isolates were sent to national collection of industrial microorganisms pune for dna sequencing and 16 s rrna sequences were obtained the 16 s rrna sequences were submitted to national center for biotechnology information ncbi as enterobacter bsps cn accession no mg952586 pseudomonas strain bsps phe accession no mh595949 and pseudomonas strain bsps phe2 accession no mk685233 followed by construction of neighbor joining phylogenetic tree by mega x 3 fenton s oxidation experiments for all fenton s oxidation experiments 25 ml of synthetic wastewater containing 1000 mg l of phenol 300 mg l of o cresol and 100 mg l of cyanide was taken in 50 ml capacity reactor ph of wastewater samples were adjusted by using sulfuric acid h2so4 2 m and sodium hydroxide naoh 2 m fixed amounts of feso4 and h2o2 30 were then added as per the rsm design matrix the contents were well mixed on a magnetic stirrer and fenton oxidation reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature after completion of reaction ph was adjusted to 7 5 0 5 using 2 m h2so4 or 2 m naoh and the treated samples were sealed and allowed to settle overnight next day the precipitate was separated using a 0 45 Î¼m filter membrane and the supernatant was used for quantification of the remaining phenol concentration cyanide concentration and toxicity analysis of the fenton treated samples 14 after optimization studies fenton oxidation was carried out in 500 ml batch reactors with a sample volume of 200 ml at rsm optimized process conditions this partially treated samples were then employed for the biodegradation studies 4 toxicity analysis fenton reagents may imparts toxicity so there was need to check the toxicity of fenton treated samples for successful implementation of biological treatment an optical toxicity bioassay based on dual wavelength analysis of bacterial ferricyanide reduction kinetics was performed to evaluate the toxicity of fenton treated samples as per method describe by pujol vila et al 2015 with some modifications 18 this method is based on degree of inhibition of bacterial metabolism in the presence of toxic compounds the method enables determination of toxicity at dual wavelengths namely 405 nm ferricyanide and biomass both shows absorbance and 600 nm only biomass shows absorbance in the first step the optimum concentration of model microorganism escherichia coli k 12 mtcc 1304 procured from microbial type culture collection mtcc chandigarh and ferricyanide was determined for optimization of cell concentration escherichia coli k12 was grown in 250 ml flasks containing 100 ml lb broth for 18 h in an incubator shaker maintained at 37 c at 160 rpm cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 15 min and re suspended in phosphate buffer 0 1 m containing 2 glucose bacterial samples were then serially diluted from 10 1 to 10 9 in 0 1 m phosphate buffer pb 1 mm potassium ferricyanide was added to each dilution and the optical density was recorded at 405 nm at 5 min interval for 1 h a graph of time vs optical density was plotted for each dilution and the optimum cell dilution was determined on the basis of its slope 1 mm ferricyanide concentration was selected in this study as it demonstrated absorbance below 1 au and was found to be suitable for the optical bioassay 18 for the toxicity analysis 2 ml of fenton treated sample and 1 mm of potassium ferricyanide was added to 10 ml of the selected dilution of bacteria treated samples and ferricyanide were freshly prepared and added to bacterial suspensions immediately before each assay the samples were then kept in a 96 well plate and readings were recorded simultaneously at 405 nm and 600 nm at 5 min interval for 45 min by using microplate reader using skent software thermo scientific multiskan fc control samples consisted of ferricyanide solution inoculated with e coli without addition of fenton treated samples a second control consisting of ferricyanide without bacteria 4 1 response surface methodology rsm optimization rsm was employed to evaluate optimum conditions for the removal of phenol a three factor five level central composite design ccd was employed for optimization of ph dose of feso4 and h2o2 table 2 provides the range of independent variables ph concentration of feso4 and h2o2 ccd consisted of 20 runs 8 at factorial points 6 at axial and 6 at central points with Î± value of 1 6817 upper and lower limits of these independent variables were selected on the basis of preliminary trial runs data not shown in order to reduce systemic biasness experiments were carried out in a random manner all experiments were conducted at a fixed phenol concentration 1000 mg l at room temperature the adequacy of the developed model was evaluated by the determination coefficient r2 adjusted determination coefficient adjusted r2 and lack of fit test the modeling was performed by adjustment of first or second order polynomial equations to the experimental responses the importance of model and identification of the main and interaction effects of variables were estimated by analysis of variance anova optimum conditions were predicted on the basis of p and f values and three dimensional response surface plots and interaction graphs were plotted to examine the effect of variables on responses two responses namely percent phenol removal and percent toxicity were selected as the fenton treated samples would be subjected to a post biodegradation step it was imperative to include toxicity as one of the responses in rsm any unutilized hydrogen peroxide from fenton treated reactions may lead to oxidation of cellular components thereby manifesting toxicity to living organisms moreover residual h2o2 is known to contribute to increase in cod 1 mg l of h2o2 contributes to 0 25 0 27 mg l of cod 19 4 2 analytical methods 4 2 1 estimation of phenol quantification of phenol was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography dionex ultimate 3000 filtered samples were run on acclaim phenyl i column 4 6 150 mm with acetonitrile water 50 50 mobile phase at a constant flow rate of 1 ml min peaks for phenol were generated at a retention time of 3 1 min which were detected using uv detector at 275 nm 4 2 2 estimation of cyanide the concentration of cyanide were analyzed by using pyridine barbituric acid method using chloramine t pyridine barbituric acid reagent as described in the standard methods 20 the pink colour developed was measured colorimetrically at 578 nm using uv spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu 4 2 3 estimation of parameters of coke oven wastewater the biological oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod suspended solids and ammoniacal nitrogen were estimated as per the standard methods 20 toc was measured by filtering the sample using 0 45 Î¼m filter membrane followed by analysis in toc analyzer shimadzu toc l 5 results and discussion 5 1 biodegradation studies 5 1 1 bacterial identification and phylogenetic analyses phylogenetic lineages of the isolated strains to their closest related strains of same genera was investigated by performing phylogenetic analysis on mega x the 16s rrna sequences of three bacterial isolates obtained from in fasta format was run at ncbi using the blast n program to find out the closest related strains of these isolates their phylogeny was studied by constructing the neighbor joining tree by employing mega x 21 22 the evolutionary distance was computed by using the maximum likelihood method and is in unit of number of base substitutions per site 23 stability amongst the clades of phylogenetic tree was analyzed by performing 1000 runs of bootstrap analysis 24 the numbers shown on the branches of tree represents the percentage of replicates in which associated taxa are clustered together in 1000 runs of the bootstrap analysis from the neighbor joining tree it is evident that enterobacter bsps cn shows closest lineage to enterobacter sp strain clone l2 other related species are enterobacter sp strain dbt4 enterobacter strain lc6 enterobacter aerogenes strain zb enterobacter hormaechei strain tmpst t10 enterobacter sp dc6 enterobacter sp clone njfuslx s54 enterobacter hormaechei strain hn14889 and uncultured enterobacter sp clone njfyslx s142 as depicted in fig 1 the phylogenetic analysis further indicated that the isolated bacterial strain pseudomonas bsps phe is closely related with pseudomonas aeruginosa strain tgr2a1 and pseudomonas bsps phe2 was found to be most closely related with pseudomonas plecoglossicida strain p12 other related species of pseudomonas bsps phe2 are pseudomonas putida atcc17390 pseudomonas entomophila q192 pseudomonas putida dn1 2 pseudomonas monteilii jv pseudomonas sp m9 pseudomonas sp onba 17 pseudomonas putida gd15 and pseudomonas sp tswcw20 all three bacterial isolates bsps phe bsps phe2 bsps cn have shown closest similarity with genus pseudomonas sp pseudomonas sp and enterobacter sp respectively several studies have also reported the ability of phenol removal by pseudomonas species such as pseudomonas putida mtcc1194 25 27 pseudomonas putida dsm548 28 pseudomonas aeruginosa 29 30 pseudomonas citronellolis 31 and pseudomonas pseudomallei 29 however literature review on phenol and catechol removal using enterobacter sp is limited 32 33 5 1 2 effect of cyanide on phenol degradation capability coke oven wastewater contains phenolic compounds along with cyanide moieties which may hinder the biodegradation potential of phenol due to its high toxicity effect of cyanide on isolated bacterial cultures was studied by checking their phenol removal efficiency in the presence and absence of cyanide in synthetic coke oven wastewater experiments were performed in two sets of flasks containing raw coke oven wastewater with cyanide 50 mg l and without cyanide for each bacterial culture as well as mixed culture concentration of phenol and o cresol were both fixed at 300 mg l for all experiments and ph was adjusted to ph7 in absence of cyanide pseudomonas bsps phe was observed to degrade 300 mg l of phenol to 79 mg l within 48 h while the same bacterial strain did not degrade phenol in presence of cyanide with slight growth of bacteria fig 2 a similar trend was observed in pseudomonas bsps phe2 with a residual phenol concentration of 48 mg l in absence of cyanide whereas phenol remained unchanged throughout the experimental time in presence of cyanide fig 2b amongst all three isolates enterobacter bsps cn failed to degrade significant amount of phenol in comparison to other isolated bacterial cultures and around 279 mg l of phenol remained in solution fig 2c in case of mixed bacterial strains higher phenol removal was obtained in comparison to single cultures with a residual phenol of 1 46 mg l fig 2d although bacteria in mixed consortium was also unable to sustain in presence of cyanide thus confirming that cyanide is highly toxic to all bacterial isolates and inhibits its metabolic activity toxicity of cyanide is due to its high affinity to metals leading to the inactivation of metalloenzymes 34 in aerobic microorganisms cyanide inhibits the cytochrome c oxidase which is found on the inner mitochondrial surface of cells and shuts down the respiratory electron transport chain 35 due to the toxicity of cyanide bacterial cultures were unable to survive and there was rapid decline in bacterial phenol removal capacity it was therefore imperative to have in place a pretreatment before biological treatment 5 2 toxicity analysis 5 2 1 optimization of biomass several preliminary trial runs were performed to optimize cell concentration for performing the toxicity analysis selection of biomass needs to be such that there is a quick degradation of ferricyanide less than 1 h without interference from the biomass fig 3 illustrates the effect of cell dilution on ferricyanide reduction kinetics at a wavelength of 405 nm the intent was to select the dilution giving the highest reducing slope as higher slope provides better sensitivities amongst all cell dilutions 10 1 was found to be giving the highest reducing slope and dilution of 10 1 was therefore selected for all toxicity analysis 5 2 2 dual wavelength toxicity analysis a major drawback associated with single wavelength based microbial metabolism toxicity assay is scattering of light by microbial biomass this phenomenon interferes with the accurate determination of ferricyanide metabolism as biomass and ferricyanide both gives absorbance at 405 nm the contribution of biomass light scattering was determined by establishing a relationship between cell scattering at wavelength of interest 405 nm and a wavelength where ferricyanide does not give absorbance 600 nm a linear relationship was obtained between absorbance at 405 nm and 600 nm for samples containing different concentrations of e coli as represented by fig 4 this relationship facilitated removal of interference due to cells 600 nm from the total absorbance 405 nm and the absorbance of ferricyanide metabolism at 405 nm was obtained by employing expression given in eq 8 8 absorbance 405 absorbance 405 absorbance 600 1 478 0 009 dual wavelength toxicity analysis performed for 20 different fenton s reagent treated samples as described in section 2 5 absorbance was recorded at 405 nm ferricyanide and biomass and 600 nm only biomass and the absorbance of ferricyanide at 405 nm was obtained by subtracting the light scattered due to biomass at 600 nm from the total absorbance taken at 405 nm by employing the eq 8 inhibition of bacterial growth was determined by the ferricyanide reduction kinetics slope the slope was determined by plotting a graph between absorbance of samples versus time for samples readings taken at 5 min time intervals for 45 min in ferricyanide reduction kinetics concentration of ferricyanide was observed to decrease with time due to its reduction to ferrocyanide by bacterial metabolism as shown in fig 3 for 10 1 dilution in presence of toxic compounds a concentration dependent inhibition of bacterial metabolism changes the value of slope which typically decreases with increasing toxicity control samples containing bacteria and ferricyanide in absence of fenton treated samples exhibited highest negative slope due to the absence of any toxic compounds which inhibits bacterial metabolism fig 5 moreover control samples consisting of ferricyanide without addition of bacteria did not exhibit any variation in absorbance as there was no change in ferricyanide concentration with time fig 5 depicts slopes of different fenton treated samples which varied on the basis of concentration dependent inhibition of bacterial metabolism toxicity of the ferricyanide reduction kinetics was determined by employing eq 9 9 i 100 slope toxic slope e coli 100 where i i indicates inhibition percentage ii slope toxic corresponds to the slope of absorbance versus time for samples containing the toxic agent e coli and potassium ferricyanide and iii slope e coli represents the slope of control sample containing bacteria and ferricyanide without fenton treated samples 5 3 rsm optimization of fenton s reagents design expert software 7 0 was used to design the rsm experiments and optimize the process a total of 20 experiments were run and the results obtained were used to analyze the effect of variables namely dose of feso4 x1 dose of h2o2 x2 and ph x3 on the experimental responses percent phenol removal and percent toxicity the complete design matrix with the experimental and predicted responses are shown in table 3 the percentage phenol removal and toxicity ranged between 61 62 98 82 and 7 5 55 respectively the predicted and experimental responses obtained were found to be quite close to each other suggesting that a quadratic model best fitted for both response variables table 3 an empirical relationship in terms of coded factors between factor variables dose of feso4 dose of h2o2 and ph and response variables percent phenol removal and toxicity is represented by eq s 10 and 11 10 percent phenol removal 81 57 4 05 x1 7 14 x2 8 59 x3 1 96 x1 x2 1 96 x1 x3 0 19 x2 x3 0 12 x1 2 2 33 x2 2 0 21x3 2 11 percent toxicity 40 48 1 44x1 13 02x2 3 52x3 2 19x1x2 0 31x1x3 5 94x2x3 1 64x1 2 3 40 x2 2 2 52 x3 2 the statistical parameters obtained from the results of anova analysis of variance are presented in table 4 the quality of the model was analyzed by the correlation coefficient wherein the correlation coefficient depicts the amount of variation explained by the model the r2 value for percent phenol removal and toxicity was found to be 0 98 and 0 97 respectively and the adjusted r2 values for both the responses were found within reasonable agreement with predicted r2 value suggesting that the applied model was significant for phenol removal the p values for all three factors were found to be 0 0001 thereby indicating that dose of feso4 dose of h2o2 and ph plays a significant role for toxicity h2o2 appeared to play a key role rather than feso4 and ph which is further confirmed by their p value table 4 amongst the interacting factors the interaction between feso4 and h2o2 x1x2 and interaction between feso4 and ph x1x3 were found to be having the most significant effect on phenol removal whereas for toxicity interaction between h2o2 and ph x2x3 was found to be the most significant the three dimensional response surface plots which were plotted on the basis of the regression model is presented in fig 6 on the basis of these plots the effect of independent factors dose of h2o2 dose of feso4 and ph on experimental responses have been further discussed 5 3 1 effect of dose of ferrous sulphate fe 2 ferrous ion acts as a catalyst during fenton s oxidation process and induces decomposition of h2o2 resulting in the formation of oh which leads to the degradation of phenol fig 6a as the reaction proceeds pores and protuberances are formed on the surfaces of iron powder which is owing to the corrosion of iron powder leading to the formation of iron scruff 36 increasing feso4 in excess of 15 mm does not improve phenol removal efficiency as the additional fe 2 remains unutilized in the system causing scavenging of oh thus bringing up the operational cost eq 12 37 fe 2 does not have much effect on the residual toxicity fig 6b d 12 fe2 oh fe3 oh 5 3 2 effect of dose of hydrogen peroxide during fenton s oxidation hydroxyl free radicals oh are generated by the reaction of fe 3 and h2o2 which plays a key role in the degradation of phenolic compounds 38 phenol degradation was observed to increase with enhancement in the dose of h2o2 fig 6a which is probably due to increase in oh in the system the generation of oh radicals within the system is from the decomposition of h2o2 as presented in eq 13 chu et al 2012 reported that low dose of h2o2 leads to partial degradation of phenol resulting in generation of intermediates of phenolic compounds such as p benzoquinone and 2 methyl p benzoquinone even after 2 5 h of reaction whereas high dose 0 3 m of h2o2 generated more hydroxyl radicals resulting in complete oxidation of phenolic compounds and no intermediate compounds were observed 36 no change in the percent phenol degradation was observed on increasing the dose of h2o2 after 36 mm excessive amount of oh not only increases the reaction cost but also leads to scavenging of oh radicals eq 14 which poses detrimental effect on phenol degradation efficiency 37 similar pattern was observed by kallel et al 2009 where an over dose of h2o2 led to an inhibition of oxidation reaction 39 moreover increased oh radicals is found to have an opposite effect on growth of microorganism fig 4b as oh are known to be highly toxic to living organisms due to inactivation of dna by breaking its sugar phosphate backbone and detaching the bases and synthesizing single stranded apurinic apyrimidinic sites 15 13 h2o ho h e 14 h2o2 oh h2o ho2 5 3 3 effect of ph ph plays a key role in controlling fenton s oxidation process as it in turn affects several factors of oxidation process such as stability and catalytic activity of h2o2 activity of dominant iron species as well as substrate 40 ph was varied from 3 to 9 to analyze the effect of ph on phenol removal fig 6c and e indicates that fenton s oxidation showed maximum catalytic activity at a ph range between 2 4 this is due to the generation of oh at acidic ph which enhanced the oxidation of organic compounds an acidic ph breaks down h2o2 into h2o and o2 and enhances the oxidation process by producing more number of oh moreover acidic ph favored the generation and corrosion of ferrous ions 41 very low ph less than 2 decreases phenol removal efficiency as it causes scavenging of oh as described by eq 15 37 several previous studies have reported an optimum ph range 2 3 for removal of several contaminants using fenton oxidation process 38 42 43 catalytic activity decreases with increase in ph primarily due to precipitation and hydrolysis of fe 3 ph 5 leads to the formation of fe oh 3 precipitate thereby leading to loss of ferrous concentration by forming fe ii complex in addition at ph above 5 ferryl radical feo2 are formed which is more selective in its action than oh eq 16 38 additionally alkaline ph 7 leads to lower oxidation potential of oh decomposition of h2o2 and deactivation of catalysts resulting in reduction in number of oh in the present study ph was finally adjusted to 7 which was conducive for growth of microorganisms 15 h oh e h2o 16 fe2 h2o2 fe iv e g feo2 h2o 5 3 4 process optimization for optimization the percent phenol removal was set at maximize whereas percent toxicity was kept at minimize with maximum importance doses of feso4 and h2o2 were kept at minimize because these compounds imparts toxicity and the intent was successful implementation of a second stage biodegradation step ph was kept in range as it was not found to affect toxicity the optimized values for dose of feso4 h2o2 and ph were found to be 6 31 mm 20 mm and 3 respectively at these conditions the predicted percent phenol removal and percent residual toxicity were found to be 72 4 and 11 96 respectively experiments were conducted at the optimized conditions and 74 69 removal of phenol 99 9 degradation of cyanide with 10 toxicity was observed which was acceptably close to the predicted values fenton oxidation generates highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals in the presence of fe 2 and h2o2 which effectively removed 100 mg l of cyanide within 30 min due to the generation of hydroxyl radicals the oh radicals undergoes reaction 17 and 18 leading to a stepwise reduction in the concentration of cyanide 44 the cyanate ion ocn is less toxic than cyanide and further oxidizes to yield carbon dioxide co2 and n2 as final products eq 18 45 17 cn oh ocn h2o 18 ocn o2 co2 n2 fenton oxidation employed as a pretreatment method led to nearly complete removal of cyanide and reduced phenol concentration so as to make the treated effluent less toxic and suitable for further biological treatment step the fenton treated samples were having approximately 300 mg l of residual phenol at the optimized conditions which was further subjected to a biological degradation step 5 4 proposed mechanism of phenol oxidation via fenton s treatment 5 4 1 formation of aromatic intermediates phenol oxidation starts with hydroxylation of the aromatic ring of phenol by the hydroxyl free radicals oh generated in the system 37 hydroxyl radicals triggers the hydroxylation process resulting in the formation of dihydroxybenzenes such as catechol resorcinol and hydroquinone depending on the position of hydroxylation in the aromatic ring fig 7 catechol is the primary product formed by ortho hydroxylation whereas hydroquinone and resorcinol are produced as a result of para and meta hydroxylation respectively 46 catechol constitutes the primary product of hydroxylation with resorcinol and hydroquinone contributing to 1 10th of catechol 47 hydroxylation is followed by ring opening of the aforementioned aromatic intermediates leading to the formation of several organic acids which further oxidizes to form co2 and h2o these organic acid intermediates are either final product or intermediate product of phenol oxidation 5 4 2 formation of organic acids aromatic intermediates show higher oxidation rate than organic acids and phenol 46 thus have a tendency to immediately oxidize to form muconic acid by c c cleavage 48 muconic acid further oxidizes to maleic acid due to the action of oh these two compounds are large sized organic acids which gets further converted into short chain acids such as oxalic acid formic acid and acetic acid initially complete oxidation of muconic acid into maleic acid takes place which later forms oxalic acid followed by glyoxylic acid malonic acid and formic acid 48 malonic acid further oxidizes into formic acid oxalic acid and acetic acid the rate of production of oxalic acid from maleic acid remains lower than rate of production of formic acid from maleic acid in the initial stages of oxidation maleic acid formic acid and acetic acid forms abundantly whereas oxalic acid is generated initially in trace amounts and its concentration increases as the reaction proceeds 46 acetic acid remains in its native form and exists as a final product of phenol oxidation whereas formic acid and oxalic acid further oxidizes into co2 and h2o 5 5 sequential bio treatment of fenton pretreated effluent 5 5 1 effect of ph on phenol degradation phenol reduction using isolated bacterial strains pseudomonas bsps phe pseudomonas bsps phe2 and enterobacter bsps cn were found to be ph dependent fig 8 clearly depicts that all the isolated bacterial cultures could not withstand the ph change from neutral to acidic or alkaline phenol degradation rate deteriorated at acidic ph 3 with phenol removal of 19 34 19 35 and 11 87 for enterobacter bsps cn pseudomonas bsps phe and pseudomonas bsps phe2 respectively percent phenol removal increased with basic ph and reached a maximum value at ph 7 with 49 9 92 45 and 53 6 phenol removal for pseudomonas bsps phe pseudomonas bsps phe 2 and enterobacter bsps cn respectively rate of phenol degradation declined with further increase in ph up to 9 with 41 34 32 35 and 46 7 for enterobacter bsps cn pseudomonas bsps phe and pseudomonas bsps phe2 respectively maximum phenol removal efficiency was observed at ph7 and this ph was maintained in further biodegradation studies likewise neutral ph was observed to be the optimum ph for biodegradation of phenolic compounds in some previous studies too 26 49 this could be attributed to the fact that phenol hydroxylase which is primarily responsible for phenol removal shows 90 100 activity at ph7 ph8 on adjusting the ph below 7 and above 8 this enzyme demonstrated reduced stability and exhibited only 40 activity at an acidic ph5 and basic ph ph10 50 amongst the isolated bacterial cultures phenol removal capacity was highest for pseudomonas bsps phe2 followed by pseudomonas bsps phe and lastly enterobacter bsps cn for all ph values however when a mixed consortium of all three bacterial strains were employed maximum phenol removal was observed with 25 85 85 32 98 8 and 79 57 efficiency at ph 3 5 7 and 9 respectively it was also observed that enterobacter strain efficiently removed 300 mg l of phenol in fenton treated coke oven wastewater fig 8 but failed to degrade the same amount of phenol in raw wastewater even in the absence of cyanide fig 2c the toxicity of associated aromatics such as o cresol 300 mg l present in raw coke oven waste water may be responsible for this discrepancy however fenton oxidation reduced the concentration of aromatic compounds including o cresol thereby enhancing the biodegradability of wastewater which eventually resulted in efficient degradation of phenol by enterobacter in fenton treated coke oven waste water fig 8 kim and kim 2003 reported inhibitory effects of m cresol above 50 mg l on activated sludge during treatment of coke oven wastewater 51 kim et al 2008 also observed the inhibition of microbial denitrification process due to the inhibitory effect of p cresol present in coke oven wastewater 52 furthermore peroxidase catalyzed oxidative polymerization of phenol also contributes towards phenol removal in neutral to alkaline conditions ph7 to 9 53 peroxidases are released by several microorganisms in presence of hydrogen peroxide wherein hydroxyl radical converts peroxidase into its active intermediate form which further oxidizes phenolic compounds into polymer 54 55 in the present study biodegradation experiments were carried out in fenton treated coke oven wastewater that may contain traces of unutilized h2o2 this h2o2 present in fenton treated wastewater may activate the peroxidase enzyme released by isolated bacterial cultures and further catalyze the phenol polymerization 55 several previous studies have reported the presence of peroxidase enzyme in various strains of pseudomonas 56 57 5 5 2 phenol biodegradation using mixed culture after fenton s treatment process coke oven effluent was further subjected to a biological treatment a mixed bacterial consortium namely pseudomonas strain bsps phe pseudomonas strain bsps phe2 and enterobacter strain bsps cn were added to the fenton s treated effluent and incubated for approximately 40 h at ph7 to attain the steady state conditions as illustrated in fig 9 the inoculated consortia was capable of degrading 99 of the residual phenol concentration this two step hybrid treatment method has proven to be highly successful in treatment of phenol from coke oven wastewater there was stepwise decrement in phenol concentration by 72 4 and 26 9 using fenton treatment and biological treatment respectively achieving an overall 99 3 removal of total phenol concentration 6 conclusion in this work treatment of recalcitrant coke oven waste water was accomplished by employing fenton oxidation coupled with biological degradation results after fenton oxidation process showed that at an optimum ph 3 ferrous sulphate 6 3 mm hydrogen peroxide 20 mm and contact time of 30 min 71 46 of phenol and 99 99 of cyanide was removed with 10 56 of residual toxicity from a synthetic coke oven wastewater containing 1000 mg l of phenol the interaction between ferrous sulphate and hydrogen peroxide was the most significant for phenol removal on the other hand interaction between hydrogen peroxide and ph was found to be most significant for toxicity out of three isolated pure cultures pseudomonas strain bsps phe2 was found to be the most efficient with 92 45 phenol removal 300 mg l but mixed consortium was found to have better phenol removal efficiency i e 99 at ph7 when compared to any of the pure culture of isolates a stepwise decrement in phenol concentration of 72 4 and 26 9 was achieved by employing fenton and biological treatment respectively overall a complete removal of cyanide and 99 3 removal of phenol was achieved and fig 10 depicts the stepwise decline in concentration of toxic compounds this type of hybrid treatment provides new cost effective approach which can be applied on pilot scale for industrial applications future works would aim at carrying out genetic and molecular studies of the isolated cultures responsible for phenol and cyanide removal to better understand the mechanism involved in removal of these recalcitrant

13926,in this study sludge derived biochar sdbc loaded with metal oxides was successfully synthesized via a simple impregnation method including monometallic based sdbc fe f sdbc mn m sdbc and bimetallic based sdbc fe and mn fm sdbc results demonstrated that fm sdbc possessed higher activation capacity than f m sdbc the degradation of orange g og under different ph were explored leaching of metal ions and cycling test showed that fm sdbc possess extraordinary stability and reusability during repeated activation of persulfate ps it was evidenced by quenching studies that both so4 and oh were generated in fm sdbc ps the xps spectra of fe 2p and mn 2p before and after reactions indicated that the activation of ps on fm sdbc was in company with the redox cycling of fe and mn species through the kinetics study the contribution of mn occupied the dominant position at the beginning and fe did in subsequent activation process in fm sdbc ps system synergistic mechanism between fe and mn in fm sdbc could be attributed to 1 mutual electron transfer between fe and mn 2 the formation of fe mn bonds which facilitated electron transfer between fe and mn to some extent based on the synergistic mechanism aforementioned bimetallic based biochar especially fm sdbc prepared in this study had the benefits of high efficiency stability reusability and waste control by waste which provided new insights into sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes in practical application keywords biochar iron manganese oxides persulfate synergistic mechanism orange g 1 introduction for the past few years advanced oxidation processes aops based on sulfate radicals so4 as the main active species have attracted widely scientific interests in the field of environmental remediation compared with traditional hydroxyl radical based advanced oxidation processes the processes have numerous advantages 1 higher reduction potential of 2 5 3 1 v 1 8 2 7 v for oh 2 stronger reactivity of ph independent 3 longer lifetime t1 2 30 40 Î¼s 10 3 Î¼s for oh 4 high selectivity to attack organic contaminant 1 persulfate ps as a common oxidant in the processes 2 present the strength in safe storage and delivery modest cost and no possibility to form chlorinated byproducts as is known to all the oxidation capacity of ps is not glaring in the absence of activator nevertheless ps can be activated by thermal 3 alkaline 4 ultraviolet light 5 transition metal ultrasound 6 to form the strong oxidant sulfate radical so4 7 hence an efficient and feasible activation method is required in practice to produce highly active oxidizing species among ps activation strategies transition metal can be identified as an appropriate activator owing to the low energy consumption and high efficiency 1 lately studies demonstrated that transition metal based such as fe0 fe2 cu2 co2 heterogeneous catalysts with better activation performance and economic benefits for instance liu et al proved that fe0 activating ps was an efficient convenient and environmental friendly technology for fenitrothion degradation under the optimal conditions 10 mg l 1 of fenitrothion could be completely degraded in 45 min and 20 Î¼g l 1 fenitrothion was removed 96 07 in 12 h du et al 8 reported that copper oxide as the heterogeneous activator could spur persulfate to be more active which oxidized p chloroaniline and achieved 71 50 removal rate in aqueous after 5 h surprisingly bimetallic catalysts have exhibited greater reactivity in activating ps than their corresponding single metal containing oxides probably due to the interactive effect between bimetallic especially fe mn binary oxides have attracted extensive attention because of the performance of rich valence state high reactivity and low environmental toxicity dong et al 9 synthesized fe3o4 Î± mno2 nanoflower like catalyst to degrade bisphenol a with ps as the oxidant results indicated that the mixed valence of fe3o4 Î± mno2 was favorable to electron transfer between fe and mn elements which increased the effectiveness of the catalyst to activate the ps huang et al 10 reported that mn1 8fe1 2o4 nanospheres showed better catalytic performance than that of the mn fe monometallic oxides mn was inferred to be the primary active site while fe acted as the main adsorption site in the reaction however most studies only focused on the difference in catalytic performance between bimetallic oxides and two corresponding single metal oxides and the mechanism of bimetals interactions was still insufficient synergistic mechanism between bimetals and the detail degradation process remains unknown and deserves further investigations and explanation in depth exploration of synergistic mechanism can reveal the catalytic potential of composite materials better optimize the existing metal activation system and provide theoretical basis for practical application of engineering unfortunately the dissolution of metal ions is inevitable in the activation process resulting in potential environmental toxicity and restricting its practical application remarkably consequently it is critical to develop a carrier material that can effectively limit dissolution of metals on the other side introduction of carrier can increase the contact area of the material and then enhance the reactivity in recent years biochar has presented as a green low cost material with sufficient suitability and selectivity biochar is the solid by product derived from the thermochemical conversion of organic materials straw bark wood sludge peat etc under oxygen limited conditions due to its large specific surface area high degree of porosity and certain adsorption capacity biochar usually acts as the carrier of alloy to reduce metal ion leaching and increase the possibility between reactants 11 in the case of that it is necessary to select an appropriate feedstock in 2018 approximately 55 million tons of sewage sludge was being produced from municipal wastewater treatment plants and the disposal was urgent for solution in china the way of treating the sludge economically and energy conservation has caused widespread concern sludge is a viable option for biochar because it contains a large amount of biomass and a certain quantity of reactive species which may provide a portion of contribution in the activation of ps it also might be applied to treat complex wastewater to achieve using waste to treat waste strategy in this work orang g og was chosen as the representative azo dye 12 which manifested definite resistance to biodegradation in conventional aerobic treatment processes sludge derived biochar sdbc loaded with manganese iron oxide was synthesized by the impregnation method and used to activate ps the specific research contents were to 1 synthesize three catalysts and compare their activation performance 2 assess the degradation of og and the leaching of metal ions under various ph conditions 3 explore the synergy between fe and mn in fm sdbc and 4 investigate the role of mn and fe in the activation process 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals orange g was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd sodium persulfate na2s2o8 ps manganese dichloride tetrahydrate mncl2 4h2o ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o hydrochloric acid hcl sodium hydroxide naoh were provided by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china all stock solutions were prepared with ultrapure water 18 2 mÏ‰ cm which provided by the ultra pure water purifier millipore co guangzhou china all of these chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification 2 2 preparation of sdbc sludge was collected as biochar feedstock from a municipal wastewater plant in wuhan china as received the raw sludge was dried in air ground and sieved to 0 8 mm then it was pyrolyzed at 600 for 2 h under n2 atmosphere in a muffle furnace after being cooled to room temperature it was washed with ultrapure water to remove ash and then oven dried the resulting biochar was denoted as sdbc 2 3 modification of sdbc modification of sdbc was mainly based on the impregnation method referred to wang et al the specific steps were as follows firstly 20 g sdbc were added into the 40 mm fecl3 6h2o mncl2 4h2o aqueous solution shaking for 24 h to form a homogeneous solution after oven dried it was secondary pyrolyzed at 600 for 0 5 h under anaerobic atmosphere in a muffle furnace after that the mixture was cooled under ambient temperature the obtained product was washed with ultrapure water and dried in oven in the end the final products were grinded using ball mill for simplicity the product after grounded was labeled as f m sdbc the equivalent mole ratio of fe and mn loading on sdbc fm sdbc was prepared by fecl3 20 mm and mncl2 20 mm and the other steps were the same as above all preparation and experimental conditions mentioned above have been reported in our previous study the ball milled samples production method based on a previous study 13 was as follows in brief 1 8 g of each biochar was added into a 500 ml agate jar with 180 g of grinding balls diameter 6 mm and mass ratio of ball biochar 100 1 the jars were then placed in a planetary ball mill pq n2 across international products nj usa which was operated at 300 rpm for 12 h with a rotation direction change every 3 h 2 4 degradation experiments batch experiments were carried out in a shaker with 160 rpm at temperature 25 in 150 ml conical flask 50 ml of 1500 mg l og and 0 4 g l fm sdbc were added into mixture followed by the addition of 1 5 ml of 200 mm l ps the suspension was sampled at a certain time interval then filtrated through a 0 22 Î¼m polyethersulfone pes membrane for og analysis the adjustment of ph was achieved with 0 1 mm naoh and hcl all the ph value was 9 except for series ph batch experiment effect of various parameters on og degradation was investigated including the different systems solution ph and leaching of metal ions all the experiences were run with duplicate samples and the mean values were used in data analysis 2 5 analytical methods the og concentration was detected using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer at 476 nm uv lambda 750s perkin elmer usa x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance bruker germany measurement was carried out to determine the crystalline structure of the catalysts by using cu kÎ± radiation with a scanning speed of 2 min in the 2Î¸ range between 10 and 80 the relative content of elements was determined by x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf s4 pioneer bruker axs gmbh karlsruhe germany the functional groups on the surface were measured with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir nicolet 6700 thermo electron scientific usa valences of elements in the fm sdbc were determined using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific usa the concentration of leaching metal ions after reaction was measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms pq ms german the point of zero charge phpzc of samples was measured with the following procedure first 50 ml deionized water was placed into 100 ml glass bottle the initial solution ph was adjusted to 3 5 7 9 11 and 0 4 g l of the sample was added to the glass bottle then the final solution ph was measured after glass bottle after shaking at 298 k for 48 h finally difference between the final ph and the initial ph denoted as Î´ph was plotted against the initial ph the solution ph at Î´ph 0 was taken as the phpzc of sample 14 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of og in different systems fig 1 a indicated the degradation efficiency of og in various systems the degradation of og maintained at a low level 1 65 in sdbc system revealing the adsorption capacity of sdbc was less than satisfactory which could be ignored in subsequent experiments og degradation in the yielded f sdbc m sdbc and fm sdbc system were 3 15 2 64 and 6 32 respectively undesirable og degradation property of catalysts might result from the surface charge which was highly dependent on the relation between the ph of solution and the phpzc of catalyst ph at the point of zero charge according to fig s1 the phpzc of f sdbc m sdbc fm sdbc were 6 02 7 41 and 6 86 respectively the catalysts were charged negatively since the solution ph ph 9 was higher than phpzc which was unfavorable for the adsorption of og anions 14 the og exhibited higher degradation rate surprisingly when ps was added the degradation efficiency could achieve 10 46 45 63 32 79 and 75 23 within 24 h by sdbc f sdbc m sdbc and fm sdbc respectively correspondingly fig 1b shows that apparent rate constant kobs of og removal increased from 4 6 10 3 min 1 sdbc ps and 1 66 10 2 min 1 m sdbc ps to 2 54 10 2 min 1 f sdbc ps and 5 81 10 3 min 1 fm sdbc ps based on the experimental results above it was found that the activation capacity and kobs of fm sdbc was superior to f sdbc and m sdbc when loaded with equivalent amounts of metal therefore a hypothesis synergistic interaction exisiting between fe and mn in fm sdbc was proposed to verify this assumption fm sdbc was selected for the succedent study and the synergy was elaborated in section 3 4 3 2 effect of ph on og degradation as is known to all ph value is one of the vital factors in the advanced oxidation process to disclose the influence of solution ph on the fm sdbc ps system the og degradation at initial ph values ranging from 3 to 11 was studied as illustrated in fig 1c the degradation of og decreased slightly from 85 64 75 23 with the ph increased from 3 to 9 which manifested that fm sdbc could maintain high efficiency under a wide range of ph value correspondingly kobs in fig 1d reduced from 8 09 10 2 min 1 in ph 3 to 6 57 10 2 min 1 in ph 5 6 15 10 2 min 1 in ph 7 and 5 81 10 2 min 1 in ph 9 while the best removal rate of og was acquired at acidic condition the reasons could be listed as follows i it was conducive to the formation of so4 according to the following equations eqs 1 and 2 and ii positively charged fm sdbc adsorbed og anion and s2o8 2 through electrostatic attraction under alkaline conditions ph 9 ps could be activated by slight base to form so4 15 so4 was prone to transform into oh in the meantime as known oh was inferior to so 4 no matter oxidation capacity or half life 16 eq 3 1 h s 2 o 8 2 h s 2 o 8 2 h s 2 o 8 s o 4 s o 4 2 h 3 s o 4 o h s o 4 2 o h different from the smooth trend of og degradation when ph ranged from 3 to 9 it declined precipitously at ph 11 this probably suggested that a passivation phenomenon on the fm sdbc surface occurred under extremely alkaline condition the valid activation of ps was hindered by passivation which led to the sharp decline of degradation although passivation slowed the og degradation it was also observed that passivation only offered limited inhibition since the overall removal rate of og still existed as depicted in fig 1c solution ph gradually declined from11 to 7 18 as the reaction proceeded and the inhibition of passivation was weakened slowly along with solution acidification additionally except for extremely alkaline condition ph 11 solution ph from 3 to 9 would eventually drop to around 2 2 which was coincided with the result of previous study the decrease of solution ph might be ascribed to 1 the generation of acidic intermediates 2 the liberation of h during ps decomposition eq 3 in short ps activation with fm sdbc could be carried out under acidic neutral and sub alkaline conditions by comparing f sdbc and m sdbc fm sdbc kept high activation capacity under various ph fig s2 this interesting observation might be due to the synergy consequently fm sdbc had promising potential for various kinds of practical wastewaters 3 3 stability and reusability of fm sdbc as displayed in fig 1c the solution became acidified gradually with the activation process moving on which inevitably led to the release of metal ions consequently the activation capacity of catalyst was heavily discounted fm sdbc was chosen to conduct the leaching experiment at various ph 3 11 to investigate the stability as shown in fig 2 a the amount of leaching metal ions from fm sdbc decreased with the rising of ph which was common knowledge that fe and mn ions released under acidic environment under alkaline conditions the leaching fe and mn could be mitigated and the reasons could be concluded as follows a the formation of hydroxide precipitation 17 and b the passivation of the metal oxides 18 compared with other studies table 1 the amount of leaching fe and mn ions met the national standards 9 10 19 21 in conclusion ph 9 was selected for subsequent experiments considering the upper degradation efficiency of og and the minor the leaching of metal ions to investigate the contribution of the leaching fe and mn to og degradation homogeneous tests were carried out the highest concentration of leaching fe and mn ions was detected to be 0 076 and 0 113 mg l at ph 3 respectively hence 0 1 mg l fe and 0 15 mg l mn were used to maximize the homogeneous degradation the results manifested that negligible og could be degraded fig s4 compared with heterogeneous tests the dissolved metal ions activated ps for generation of free radicals to degrade og inconspicuously accordingly og degradation mainly took place on the surface of fm sdbc through a series of heterogeneous reactions in the meantime the leaching fe and mn ions were also detected in f sdbc and m sdbc fig s3 when loaded with equal amounts of metal the total leaching amount of metal ions from f sdbc and m sdbc were much lower than those in fm sdbc system the results indicated that fm sdbc could reduce the release of fe and mn ions which might be contributed to the synergy section 3 3 what s more mn species dissolved notably more than fe regardless of ph similar study had reported that mn species were more soluble than fe species as a result of high activity 22 as discussion above m sdbc was less activated than f sdbc or fm sdbc fig s2 which was related to the largest of leaching metal ions xrf analysis was carried out to determine the relative content of elements in sdbc and fm sdbc the results were summarized in table s1 a fraction of mn 0 193 was detected while fe 4 3 represented a considerable proportion of all the metals in sdbc the results suggested that sludge contains various metal species which may be beneficial to the reaction before reaction the relative content of fe and mn in fm sdbc were 8 749 2 76 respectively after reaction the mnox was found dramatically decreased 0 659 vs 2 76 however fe component increased slightly which may be contributed to the significant decrease of other soluble components such as mn declined substantially which made the relative content of fe increased slightly to evaluate the reusability of fm sdbc for ps activation cycling tests were further conducted with recycled catalysts collecting spent catalysts with a magnet and dried it before the next runs as shown in fig 2b the removal efficiency of og was gradually decreased after three times reuse og degradation after each run were 75 23 69 57 61 41 respectively the reason for the decrease of og degradation possibly because the adsorbed organic intermediates hindered the mass transfer between fm sdbc and ps and the leaching of metal ions during the reaction it should be noted that the concentration of dissolved metal ions was lower than the national emission standard after each run in the fm sdbc ps system the low level metal ions leaching and good reusability indicated that fm sdbc could maintain excellent stability during ps activation 3 4 degradation mechanism and process study 3 4 1 radicals in the fm sdbc ps system to identify the radical species involved in og degradation radical scavenger experiments were carried out tert butyl alcohol tba and methanol meoh were used as radical scavengers reaction rate of tba with oh k oh 3 8 7 6 108 was 1000 times than that of so4 k so4 4 0 9 1 105 and meoh possesses higher reactivity with both oh k oh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 k so4 1 6 107 m 1 s 1 23 24 in the quenching experiments although concentration of these two kinds of quenchers was 20 times than ps in fm sdbc ps system tba and meoh hardly had a significant effect on bpa degradation efficiency fig 3 similar result has been reported that the generated radicals mainly attached to the surface of catalyst which would hardly be quenched by tba and meoh it is hard to approach the surface of fm sdbc because tba and meoh are hydrophilic compounds 9 in consequence phenol was chosen to quench free radicals on the catalyst surface due to its hydrophobic properties and high rate constant with oh and so4 25 as stated in fig 3 when phenol was added the removal of og reduced obviously indicating that phenol could effectively quench free radicals on the catalyst surface these results indicate that on the one hand both oh and so4 were identified responsible for og degradation on the other hand the generated radicals mainly adhered to the catalyst surface which could be hardly cleaned up by tba and meoh even at the ultrahigh concentration 3 4 2 possible activation mechanism in the fm sdbc ps system x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was adopted to analyze the elements valence states of fm sdbc the valence of fe and mn in fm sdbc pre and post reaction were depicted in fig 4 after peak deconvolution there were two major peaks of fe 2p corresponded to fe ii and fe iii at 710 8 ev 712 8 ev 26 the percentage ratio of fe ii decreased 61 43 to 22 5 and fe iii increased 38 57 77 5 after reaction indicating that a part of fe ii transformed into fe iii fig 4 a b from the deconvolution peak of mn 2p in xps spectrum fig 5 c d the peaks of binding energies at 641 0 642 4 and 642 5 ev corresponded to mn ii mn iii and mn iv with atomic ratio of 37 07 34 90 and 28 03 respectively 27 after the reaction the proportion of mn ii mn iii and mn iv were 29 89 27 51 and 42 60 respectively these results indicated that mn ii and mn iii were oxidized to mn iv by ps the potential reactions in fm sdbc ps system were listed as follows 4 f e i i s 2 o 8 2 f e i i i s o 4 s o 4 2 5 m n i i s 2 o 8 2 m n i i i s o 4 s o 4 2 6 m n i i i s 2 o 8 2 m n i v s o 4 s o 4 2 7 f e i i i s 2 o 8 2 f e i i s 2 o 8 8 m n i v s 2 o 8 2 m n i i i s 2 o 8 at first ps was activated by fe ii mn ii and mn iii to generate so4 and then fe iii and mn iv were concurrently produced through electron transfer eqs 4 6 subsequently fe and mn with high valence states would convert into fe ii and mn iii via ps eqs 7 and 8 ultimately these reactions constructed the fe mn transformation cycle 3 4 3 degradation process kinetics was employed to lucubrate the activation mechanism in fm sdbc ps system fig 5a og degradation process could be split into three phases according to different rate constants comprising 0 3 h phase 1 3 36 h phase 2 and 36 72 h phase 3 respectively to be specific the degradation in the first 3 h was quite remarkable and the reaction was slightly sluggish at the stage of 3 36 h in the last 36 h it gradually reached the equilibrium with a tardy increment each phase would be elaborated as follows within the first 3 h ps was activated by fe ii mn iii to generate so4 through donating electrons along with the transformation of fe iii mn iv in monometallic based sdbc eqs 4 and 5 ps would react with fe ii and mn iii on fm sdbc surface to generate so4 fe iii and mn iv fig 5a exhibited interesting results that m sdbc was superior to f sdbc during 0 0 25 h while it had been disappointed ever since for further analysis phase 1 was divided into two stages 0 0 25 h phase 1 1 and 0 25 h 3 h phase 1 2 phase 1 1 from the perspective of redox potential the oxidation of mn iii was thermodynamically favorable compared with fe ii for the fact that reduction potential of mn iv mn iii 0 15 v was much lower than that of fe iii fe ii 0 77 v from the point of electron transfer the amount of electron transformation of m sdbc was more than f sdbc eqs 4 6 in the meantime the ph of m sdbc 5 2 was lower than f sdbc 5 59 at 0 25 h in fig 5b m sdbc reacted faster with ps than f sdbc owing to the fact that the decomposition of ps was the process of producing h eq 2 all the evidence indicated that the activation performance of m sdbc was better than f sdbc the conclusion drew that og degradation in phase 1 1 benefited from mn species in fm sdbc ps system phase 1 2 the activation capacity of f sdbc was better than that of m sdbc according to og degradation profiles as seen from fig 5b the continuous decomposition ps resulted the solution acidification a small amount of fe was released due to relative stability of fe species which made the heterogeneous reaction dominant in f sdbc unfortunately heterogeneous reaction in m sdbc was impeded because a number of mn ions were leached based on the above discussion phase 1 2 was dominated by fe species in fm sdbc ps system in phase 2 higher valence states of fe mn were generated gradually which had lower activity for ps activation fe iii mn iv converted into fe ii mn iii through interacting with ps eqs 7 and 8 while it was a time consuming process as a result og degradation rate in phase 2 was apparently slower than that of phase 1 m sdbc was still less effective than f sdbc at this phase apart from more mn ions leaching due to solution acidification it was more important that the reduction potential of mn iii mn iv 0 15 v was higher than fe ii fe iii 0 77 v which made the cycle of mn thermodynamically unfavorable summarily the excellent activation property of fm sdbc was attributed to fe species in subsequently experiments in phase 3 regeneration of the active sites of fm sdbc made the activation cycle continue until ps was completely consumed the yielded so4 attacked og and various intermediate products were generated which made og ultimately mineralize into co2 and h2o 3 5 synergy between fe and mn based on aforementioned the activation capability of fm sdbc preceded f sdbc and m sdbc however the activation performance of fm sdbc should be between that of f sdbc and m sdbc when the same amount of metal was embedded in sdbc theoretically maybe the extraordinary behavior of fm sdbc was attributed to the potential synergy between fe and mn the mutual electron transfer between fe and mn was thermodynamically feasible based on the standard reduction potentials fig 6 mn iii could be reduced by fe ii since the standard redox potential of mn iii mn ii 1 51 v is higher than that of fe iii fe ii 0 77 v eq 9 10 28 in the meantime the reduction potential of mn iv mn iii 0 51 v is more positive than that of fe iii fe ii 0 77 v thus fe iii could oxidize mn iii to generate mn iv and fe ii eq 10 29 30 electron transfer between fe and mn was accounted for the synergy in fm sdbc in particular both ps and mn iii could react with fe ii generated in eq 9 to produce so4 eq 4 and mn ii simultaneously eq 8 for which the redox potential of s2o8 2 so4 1 45 v was similar to mn ii mn iii 1 51 v in brief ps and mn iii could reacted synchronously with fe ii which acted as an elicitor to generate active species for og degradation 9 m n i i i f e i i f e i i i m n i i 10 m n i i i f e i i i f e i i m n i v the circulation of fe iii fe ii mn iv mn iii mn ii speeded up the continuous decomposition of ps as well as the production of sufficient radicals mutual electron transfer between fe and mn made the activation of fm sdbc work continuously which further interpreted the obvious degradation difference among f sdbc m sdbc and fm sdbc yang et al proved that the degradation of polluant could be maximized due to the existence of metal support co ti 31 the formation of co ti bonds promoted electron transfer between co and ti and accelerated og degradation therefore ftir and xrd were employed to confirm the existence of fe mn bonds in fm sdbc as observed from fig 4e for f sdbc m sdbc and fm sdbc there were several major peaks at 3423 1621 and 1039 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of oh c c and co respectively 32 besides fe o mn o bonds were observed in fm sdbc the peak at 690 cm 1 was likely to be the stretching of mn o 33 and the peak at 578 cm 1 might be ascribed to fe o 34 by comparing with the spectra of f sdbc and m sdbc a slight change of fm sdbc lay in the appearance of a new peak at 425 cm 1 35 which might be attributed to the fe mn bond stretching x ray powder diffraction xrd was introduced to further identify the crystal structure of catalysts the xrd spectrum of fm sdbc was shown in fig 4f a sharp peak at around 26 66 was observed corresponding to the silicon dioxide that often appeared in sludge biochar 36 the peaks of 29 35 and 35 67 corresponded to feox 9 37 the diffraction peaks at 50 15 54 02 and 59 96 could be identified as mnox 38 39 the extra diffraction peaks at 35 64 and 59 96 were detected in the pattern of fm sdbc which could be ascribed to the 1 11 2 20 diffractions of fe mn bimetal oxide jcpds no 77 2358 fe mn bonds might form during high temperature pyrolysis in this study in general the synergy between fe and mn in fm sdbc was identified through analysis above which was mainly attributed to the following factors 1 the mutual electron transfer between fe and mn and 2 the formation of fe mn bonds 4 conclusions to sum up fe mn bimetallic oxides supported by sludge derived biochar was synthesized successfully and applied for the activation of ps high efficiently og degradation could achieve 75 23 in fm sdbc ps system which was significantly higher than f sdbc ps and m sdbc ps system moreover fm sdbc ps system had a wide range of ph adaptability the concentrations of fe and mn ions leaching from fm sdbc was mostly maintained at a low level og removal can reach 61 41 after 3 runs of reaction radical quenching tests indicated that both oh and so4 were able to react with og resulting in its effective degradation the cycle of fe iii fe ii mn iv mn iii mn ii made the activation of the fm sdbc work continuously thereinto mn occupied the dominant position at first and then fe did in subsequent process in fm sdbc ps system synergistic mechanism between fe and mn in fm sdbc was assigned to mutual electron transfer between fe and mn and the formation of fe mn bonds in conclusion fm sdbc exhibited promising potential for practical application in wastewater due to its strong pollutant degradation efficiency and suitability for a wide range of ph conditions which could bring valuable insights

13926,in this study sludge derived biochar sdbc loaded with metal oxides was successfully synthesized via a simple impregnation method including monometallic based sdbc fe f sdbc mn m sdbc and bimetallic based sdbc fe and mn fm sdbc results demonstrated that fm sdbc possessed higher activation capacity than f m sdbc the degradation of orange g og under different ph were explored leaching of metal ions and cycling test showed that fm sdbc possess extraordinary stability and reusability during repeated activation of persulfate ps it was evidenced by quenching studies that both so4 and oh were generated in fm sdbc ps the xps spectra of fe 2p and mn 2p before and after reactions indicated that the activation of ps on fm sdbc was in company with the redox cycling of fe and mn species through the kinetics study the contribution of mn occupied the dominant position at the beginning and fe did in subsequent activation process in fm sdbc ps system synergistic mechanism between fe and mn in fm sdbc could be attributed to 1 mutual electron transfer between fe and mn 2 the formation of fe mn bonds which facilitated electron transfer between fe and mn to some extent based on the synergistic mechanism aforementioned bimetallic based biochar especially fm sdbc prepared in this study had the benefits of high efficiency stability reusability and waste control by waste which provided new insights into sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes in practical application keywords biochar iron manganese oxides persulfate synergistic mechanism orange g 1 introduction for the past few years advanced oxidation processes aops based on sulfate radicals so4 as the main active species have attracted widely scientific interests in the field of environmental remediation compared with traditional hydroxyl radical based advanced oxidation processes the processes have numerous advantages 1 higher reduction potential of 2 5 3 1 v 1 8 2 7 v for oh 2 stronger reactivity of ph independent 3 longer lifetime t1 2 30 40 Î¼s 10 3 Î¼s for oh 4 high selectivity to attack organic contaminant 1 persulfate ps as a common oxidant in the processes 2 present the strength in safe storage and delivery modest cost and no possibility to form chlorinated byproducts as is known to all the oxidation capacity of ps is not glaring in the absence of activator nevertheless ps can be activated by thermal 3 alkaline 4 ultraviolet light 5 transition metal ultrasound 6 to form the strong oxidant sulfate radical so4 7 hence an efficient and feasible activation method is required in practice to produce highly active oxidizing species among ps activation strategies transition metal can be identified as an appropriate activator owing to the low energy consumption and high efficiency 1 lately studies demonstrated that transition metal based such as fe0 fe2 cu2 co2 heterogeneous catalysts with better activation performance and economic benefits for instance liu et al proved that fe0 activating ps was an efficient convenient and environmental friendly technology for fenitrothion degradation under the optimal conditions 10 mg l 1 of fenitrothion could be completely degraded in 45 min and 20 Î¼g l 1 fenitrothion was removed 96 07 in 12 h du et al 8 reported that copper oxide as the heterogeneous activator could spur persulfate to be more active which oxidized p chloroaniline and achieved 71 50 removal rate in aqueous after 5 h surprisingly bimetallic catalysts have exhibited greater reactivity in activating ps than their corresponding single metal containing oxides probably due to the interactive effect between bimetallic especially fe mn binary oxides have attracted extensive attention because of the performance of rich valence state high reactivity and low environmental toxicity dong et al 9 synthesized fe3o4 Î± mno2 nanoflower like catalyst to degrade bisphenol a with ps as the oxidant results indicated that the mixed valence of fe3o4 Î± mno2 was favorable to electron transfer between fe and mn elements which increased the effectiveness of the catalyst to activate the ps huang et al 10 reported that mn1 8fe1 2o4 nanospheres showed better catalytic performance than that of the mn fe monometallic oxides mn was inferred to be the primary active site while fe acted as the main adsorption site in the reaction however most studies only focused on the difference in catalytic performance between bimetallic oxides and two corresponding single metal oxides and the mechanism of bimetals interactions was still insufficient synergistic mechanism between bimetals and the detail degradation process remains unknown and deserves further investigations and explanation in depth exploration of synergistic mechanism can reveal the catalytic potential of composite materials better optimize the existing metal activation system and provide theoretical basis for practical application of engineering unfortunately the dissolution of metal ions is inevitable in the activation process resulting in potential environmental toxicity and restricting its practical application remarkably consequently it is critical to develop a carrier material that can effectively limit dissolution of metals on the other side introduction of carrier can increase the contact area of the material and then enhance the reactivity in recent years biochar has presented as a green low cost material with sufficient suitability and selectivity biochar is the solid by product derived from the thermochemical conversion of organic materials straw bark wood sludge peat etc under oxygen limited conditions due to its large specific surface area high degree of porosity and certain adsorption capacity biochar usually acts as the carrier of alloy to reduce metal ion leaching and increase the possibility between reactants 11 in the case of that it is necessary to select an appropriate feedstock in 2018 approximately 55 million tons of sewage sludge was being produced from municipal wastewater treatment plants and the disposal was urgent for solution in china the way of treating the sludge economically and energy conservation has caused widespread concern sludge is a viable option for biochar because it contains a large amount of biomass and a certain quantity of reactive species which may provide a portion of contribution in the activation of ps it also might be applied to treat complex wastewater to achieve using waste to treat waste strategy in this work orang g og was chosen as the representative azo dye 12 which manifested definite resistance to biodegradation in conventional aerobic treatment processes sludge derived biochar sdbc loaded with manganese iron oxide was synthesized by the impregnation method and used to activate ps the specific research contents were to 1 synthesize three catalysts and compare their activation performance 2 assess the degradation of og and the leaching of metal ions under various ph conditions 3 explore the synergy between fe and mn in fm sdbc and 4 investigate the role of mn and fe in the activation process 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals orange g was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd sodium persulfate na2s2o8 ps manganese dichloride tetrahydrate mncl2 4h2o ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o hydrochloric acid hcl sodium hydroxide naoh were provided by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china all stock solutions were prepared with ultrapure water 18 2 mÏ‰ cm which provided by the ultra pure water purifier millipore co guangzhou china all of these chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification 2 2 preparation of sdbc sludge was collected as biochar feedstock from a municipal wastewater plant in wuhan china as received the raw sludge was dried in air ground and sieved to 0 8 mm then it was pyrolyzed at 600 for 2 h under n2 atmosphere in a muffle furnace after being cooled to room temperature it was washed with ultrapure water to remove ash and then oven dried the resulting biochar was denoted as sdbc 2 3 modification of sdbc modification of sdbc was mainly based on the impregnation method referred to wang et al the specific steps were as follows firstly 20 g sdbc were added into the 40 mm fecl3 6h2o mncl2 4h2o aqueous solution shaking for 24 h to form a homogeneous solution after oven dried it was secondary pyrolyzed at 600 for 0 5 h under anaerobic atmosphere in a muffle furnace after that the mixture was cooled under ambient temperature the obtained product was washed with ultrapure water and dried in oven in the end the final products were grinded using ball mill for simplicity the product after grounded was labeled as f m sdbc the equivalent mole ratio of fe and mn loading on sdbc fm sdbc was prepared by fecl3 20 mm and mncl2 20 mm and the other steps were the same as above all preparation and experimental conditions mentioned above have been reported in our previous study the ball milled samples production method based on a previous study 13 was as follows in brief 1 8 g of each biochar was added into a 500 ml agate jar with 180 g of grinding balls diameter 6 mm and mass ratio of ball biochar 100 1 the jars were then placed in a planetary ball mill pq n2 across international products nj usa which was operated at 300 rpm for 12 h with a rotation direction change every 3 h 2 4 degradation experiments batch experiments were carried out in a shaker with 160 rpm at temperature 25 in 150 ml conical flask 50 ml of 1500 mg l og and 0 4 g l fm sdbc were added into mixture followed by the addition of 1 5 ml of 200 mm l ps the suspension was sampled at a certain time interval then filtrated through a 0 22 Î¼m polyethersulfone pes membrane for og analysis the adjustment of ph was achieved with 0 1 mm naoh and hcl all the ph value was 9 except for series ph batch experiment effect of various parameters on og degradation was investigated including the different systems solution ph and leaching of metal ions all the experiences were run with duplicate samples and the mean values were used in data analysis 2 5 analytical methods the og concentration was detected using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer at 476 nm uv lambda 750s perkin elmer usa x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance bruker germany measurement was carried out to determine the crystalline structure of the catalysts by using cu kÎ± radiation with a scanning speed of 2 min in the 2Î¸ range between 10 and 80 the relative content of elements was determined by x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf s4 pioneer bruker axs gmbh karlsruhe germany the functional groups on the surface were measured with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir nicolet 6700 thermo electron scientific usa valences of elements in the fm sdbc were determined using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific usa the concentration of leaching metal ions after reaction was measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms pq ms german the point of zero charge phpzc of samples was measured with the following procedure first 50 ml deionized water was placed into 100 ml glass bottle the initial solution ph was adjusted to 3 5 7 9 11 and 0 4 g l of the sample was added to the glass bottle then the final solution ph was measured after glass bottle after shaking at 298 k for 48 h finally difference between the final ph and the initial ph denoted as Î´ph was plotted against the initial ph the solution ph at Î´ph 0 was taken as the phpzc of sample 14 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of og in different systems fig 1 a indicated the degradation efficiency of og in various systems the degradation of og maintained at a low level 1 65 in sdbc system revealing the adsorption capacity of sdbc was less than satisfactory which could be ignored in subsequent experiments og degradation in the yielded f sdbc m sdbc and fm sdbc system were 3 15 2 64 and 6 32 respectively undesirable og degradation property of catalysts might result from the surface charge which was highly dependent on the relation between the ph of solution and the phpzc of catalyst ph at the point of zero charge according to fig s1 the phpzc of f sdbc m sdbc fm sdbc were 6 02 7 41 and 6 86 respectively the catalysts were charged negatively since the solution ph ph 9 was higher than phpzc which was unfavorable for the adsorption of og anions 14 the og exhibited higher degradation rate surprisingly when ps was added the degradation efficiency could achieve 10 46 45 63 32 79 and 75 23 within 24 h by sdbc f sdbc m sdbc and fm sdbc respectively correspondingly fig 1b shows that apparent rate constant kobs of og removal increased from 4 6 10 3 min 1 sdbc ps and 1 66 10 2 min 1 m sdbc ps to 2 54 10 2 min 1 f sdbc ps and 5 81 10 3 min 1 fm sdbc ps based on the experimental results above it was found that the activation capacity and kobs of fm sdbc was superior to f sdbc and m sdbc when loaded with equivalent amounts of metal therefore a hypothesis synergistic interaction exisiting between fe and mn in fm sdbc was proposed to verify this assumption fm sdbc was selected for the succedent study and the synergy was elaborated in section 3 4 3 2 effect of ph on og degradation as is known to all ph value is one of the vital factors in the advanced oxidation process to disclose the influence of solution ph on the fm sdbc ps system the og degradation at initial ph values ranging from 3 to 11 was studied as illustrated in fig 1c the degradation of og decreased slightly from 85 64 75 23 with the ph increased from 3 to 9 which manifested that fm sdbc could maintain high efficiency under a wide range of ph value correspondingly kobs in fig 1d reduced from 8 09 10 2 min 1 in ph 3 to 6 57 10 2 min 1 in ph 5 6 15 10 2 min 1 in ph 7 and 5 81 10 2 min 1 in ph 9 while the best removal rate of og was acquired at acidic condition the reasons could be listed as follows i it was conducive to the formation of so4 according to the following equations eqs 1 and 2 and ii positively charged fm sdbc adsorbed og anion and s2o8 2 through electrostatic attraction under alkaline conditions ph 9 ps could be activated by slight base to form so4 15 so4 was prone to transform into oh in the meantime as known oh was inferior to so 4 no matter oxidation capacity or half life 16 eq 3 1 h s 2 o 8 2 h s 2 o 8 2 h s 2 o 8 s o 4 s o 4 2 h 3 s o 4 o h s o 4 2 o h different from the smooth trend of og degradation when ph ranged from 3 to 9 it declined precipitously at ph 11 this probably suggested that a passivation phenomenon on the fm sdbc surface occurred under extremely alkaline condition the valid activation of ps was hindered by passivation which led to the sharp decline of degradation although passivation slowed the og degradation it was also observed that passivation only offered limited inhibition since the overall removal rate of og still existed as depicted in fig 1c solution ph gradually declined from11 to 7 18 as the reaction proceeded and the inhibition of passivation was weakened slowly along with solution acidification additionally except for extremely alkaline condition ph 11 solution ph from 3 to 9 would eventually drop to around 2 2 which was coincided with the result of previous study the decrease of solution ph might be ascribed to 1 the generation of acidic intermediates 2 the liberation of h during ps decomposition eq 3 in short ps activation with fm sdbc could be carried out under acidic neutral and sub alkaline conditions by comparing f sdbc and m sdbc fm sdbc kept high activation capacity under various ph fig s2 this interesting observation might be due to the synergy consequently fm sdbc had promising potential for various kinds of practical wastewaters 3 3 stability and reusability of fm sdbc as displayed in fig 1c the solution became acidified gradually with the activation process moving on which inevitably led to the release of metal ions consequently the activation capacity of catalyst was heavily discounted fm sdbc was chosen to conduct the leaching experiment at various ph 3 11 to investigate the stability as shown in fig 2 a the amount of leaching metal ions from fm sdbc decreased with the rising of ph which was common knowledge that fe and mn ions released under acidic environment under alkaline conditions the leaching fe and mn could be mitigated and the reasons could be concluded as follows a the formation of hydroxide precipitation 17 and b the passivation of the metal oxides 18 compared with other studies table 1 the amount of leaching fe and mn ions met the national standards 9 10 19 21 in conclusion ph 9 was selected for subsequent experiments considering the upper degradation efficiency of og and the minor the leaching of metal ions to investigate the contribution of the leaching fe and mn to og degradation homogeneous tests were carried out the highest concentration of leaching fe and mn ions was detected to be 0 076 and 0 113 mg l at ph 3 respectively hence 0 1 mg l fe and 0 15 mg l mn were used to maximize the homogeneous degradation the results manifested that negligible og could be degraded fig s4 compared with heterogeneous tests the dissolved metal ions activated ps for generation of free radicals to degrade og inconspicuously accordingly og degradation mainly took place on the surface of fm sdbc through a series of heterogeneous reactions in the meantime the leaching fe and mn ions were also detected in f sdbc and m sdbc fig s3 when loaded with equal amounts of metal the total leaching amount of metal ions from f sdbc and m sdbc were much lower than those in fm sdbc system the results indicated that fm sdbc could reduce the release of fe and mn ions which might be contributed to the synergy section 3 3 what s more mn species dissolved notably more than fe regardless of ph similar study had reported that mn species were more soluble than fe species as a result of high activity 22 as discussion above m sdbc was less activated than f sdbc or fm sdbc fig s2 which was related to the largest of leaching metal ions xrf analysis was carried out to determine the relative content of elements in sdbc and fm sdbc the results were summarized in table s1 a fraction of mn 0 193 was detected while fe 4 3 represented a considerable proportion of all the metals in sdbc the results suggested that sludge contains various metal species which may be beneficial to the reaction before reaction the relative content of fe and mn in fm sdbc were 8 749 2 76 respectively after reaction the mnox was found dramatically decreased 0 659 vs 2 76 however fe component increased slightly which may be contributed to the significant decrease of other soluble components such as mn declined substantially which made the relative content of fe increased slightly to evaluate the reusability of fm sdbc for ps activation cycling tests were further conducted with recycled catalysts collecting spent catalysts with a magnet and dried it before the next runs as shown in fig 2b the removal efficiency of og was gradually decreased after three times reuse og degradation after each run were 75 23 69 57 61 41 respectively the reason for the decrease of og degradation possibly because the adsorbed organic intermediates hindered the mass transfer between fm sdbc and ps and the leaching of metal ions during the reaction it should be noted that the concentration of dissolved metal ions was lower than the national emission standard after each run in the fm sdbc ps system the low level metal ions leaching and good reusability indicated that fm sdbc could maintain excellent stability during ps activation 3 4 degradation mechanism and process study 3 4 1 radicals in the fm sdbc ps system to identify the radical species involved in og degradation radical scavenger experiments were carried out tert butyl alcohol tba and methanol meoh were used as radical scavengers reaction rate of tba with oh k oh 3 8 7 6 108 was 1000 times than that of so4 k so4 4 0 9 1 105 and meoh possesses higher reactivity with both oh k oh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 k so4 1 6 107 m 1 s 1 23 24 in the quenching experiments although concentration of these two kinds of quenchers was 20 times than ps in fm sdbc ps system tba and meoh hardly had a significant effect on bpa degradation efficiency fig 3 similar result has been reported that the generated radicals mainly attached to the surface of catalyst which would hardly be quenched by tba and meoh it is hard to approach the surface of fm sdbc because tba and meoh are hydrophilic compounds 9 in consequence phenol was chosen to quench free radicals on the catalyst surface due to its hydrophobic properties and high rate constant with oh and so4 25 as stated in fig 3 when phenol was added the removal of og reduced obviously indicating that phenol could effectively quench free radicals on the catalyst surface these results indicate that on the one hand both oh and so4 were identified responsible for og degradation on the other hand the generated radicals mainly adhered to the catalyst surface which could be hardly cleaned up by tba and meoh even at the ultrahigh concentration 3 4 2 possible activation mechanism in the fm sdbc ps system x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was adopted to analyze the elements valence states of fm sdbc the valence of fe and mn in fm sdbc pre and post reaction were depicted in fig 4 after peak deconvolution there were two major peaks of fe 2p corresponded to fe ii and fe iii at 710 8 ev 712 8 ev 26 the percentage ratio of fe ii decreased 61 43 to 22 5 and fe iii increased 38 57 77 5 after reaction indicating that a part of fe ii transformed into fe iii fig 4 a b from the deconvolution peak of mn 2p in xps spectrum fig 5 c d the peaks of binding energies at 641 0 642 4 and 642 5 ev corresponded to mn ii mn iii and mn iv with atomic ratio of 37 07 34 90 and 28 03 respectively 27 after the reaction the proportion of mn ii mn iii and mn iv were 29 89 27 51 and 42 60 respectively these results indicated that mn ii and mn iii were oxidized to mn iv by ps the potential reactions in fm sdbc ps system were listed as follows 4 f e i i s 2 o 8 2 f e i i i s o 4 s o 4 2 5 m n i i s 2 o 8 2 m n i i i s o 4 s o 4 2 6 m n i i i s 2 o 8 2 m n i v s o 4 s o 4 2 7 f e i i i s 2 o 8 2 f e i i s 2 o 8 8 m n i v s 2 o 8 2 m n i i i s 2 o 8 at first ps was activated by fe ii mn ii and mn iii to generate so4 and then fe iii and mn iv were concurrently produced through electron transfer eqs 4 6 subsequently fe and mn with high valence states would convert into fe ii and mn iii via ps eqs 7 and 8 ultimately these reactions constructed the fe mn transformation cycle 3 4 3 degradation process kinetics was employed to lucubrate the activation mechanism in fm sdbc ps system fig 5a og degradation process could be split into three phases according to different rate constants comprising 0 3 h phase 1 3 36 h phase 2 and 36 72 h phase 3 respectively to be specific the degradation in the first 3 h was quite remarkable and the reaction was slightly sluggish at the stage of 3 36 h in the last 36 h it gradually reached the equilibrium with a tardy increment each phase would be elaborated as follows within the first 3 h ps was activated by fe ii mn iii to generate so4 through donating electrons along with the transformation of fe iii mn iv in monometallic based sdbc eqs 4 and 5 ps would react with fe ii and mn iii on fm sdbc surface to generate so4 fe iii and mn iv fig 5a exhibited interesting results that m sdbc was superior to f sdbc during 0 0 25 h while it had been disappointed ever since for further analysis phase 1 was divided into two stages 0 0 25 h phase 1 1 and 0 25 h 3 h phase 1 2 phase 1 1 from the perspective of redox potential the oxidation of mn iii was thermodynamically favorable compared with fe ii for the fact that reduction potential of mn iv mn iii 0 15 v was much lower than that of fe iii fe ii 0 77 v from the point of electron transfer the amount of electron transformation of m sdbc was more than f sdbc eqs 4 6 in the meantime the ph of m sdbc 5 2 was lower than f sdbc 5 59 at 0 25 h in fig 5b m sdbc reacted faster with ps than f sdbc owing to the fact that the decomposition of ps was the process of producing h eq 2 all the evidence indicated that the activation performance of m sdbc was better than f sdbc the conclusion drew that og degradation in phase 1 1 benefited from mn species in fm sdbc ps system phase 1 2 the activation capacity of f sdbc was better than that of m sdbc according to og degradation profiles as seen from fig 5b the continuous decomposition ps resulted the solution acidification a small amount of fe was released due to relative stability of fe species which made the heterogeneous reaction dominant in f sdbc unfortunately heterogeneous reaction in m sdbc was impeded because a number of mn ions were leached based on the above discussion phase 1 2 was dominated by fe species in fm sdbc ps system in phase 2 higher valence states of fe mn were generated gradually which had lower activity for ps activation fe iii mn iv converted into fe ii mn iii through interacting with ps eqs 7 and 8 while it was a time consuming process as a result og degradation rate in phase 2 was apparently slower than that of phase 1 m sdbc was still less effective than f sdbc at this phase apart from more mn ions leaching due to solution acidification it was more important that the reduction potential of mn iii mn iv 0 15 v was higher than fe ii fe iii 0 77 v which made the cycle of mn thermodynamically unfavorable summarily the excellent activation property of fm sdbc was attributed to fe species in subsequently experiments in phase 3 regeneration of the active sites of fm sdbc made the activation cycle continue until ps was completely consumed the yielded so4 attacked og and various intermediate products were generated which made og ultimately mineralize into co2 and h2o 3 5 synergy between fe and mn based on aforementioned the activation capability of fm sdbc preceded f sdbc and m sdbc however the activation performance of fm sdbc should be between that of f sdbc and m sdbc when the same amount of metal was embedded in sdbc theoretically maybe the extraordinary behavior of fm sdbc was attributed to the potential synergy between fe and mn the mutual electron transfer between fe and mn was thermodynamically feasible based on the standard reduction potentials fig 6 mn iii could be reduced by fe ii since the standard redox potential of mn iii mn ii 1 51 v is higher than that of fe iii fe ii 0 77 v eq 9 10 28 in the meantime the reduction potential of mn iv mn iii 0 51 v is more positive than that of fe iii fe ii 0 77 v thus fe iii could oxidize mn iii to generate mn iv and fe ii eq 10 29 30 electron transfer between fe and mn was accounted for the synergy in fm sdbc in particular both ps and mn iii could react with fe ii generated in eq 9 to produce so4 eq 4 and mn ii simultaneously eq 8 for which the redox potential of s2o8 2 so4 1 45 v was similar to mn ii mn iii 1 51 v in brief ps and mn iii could reacted synchronously with fe ii which acted as an elicitor to generate active species for og degradation 9 m n i i i f e i i f e i i i m n i i 10 m n i i i f e i i i f e i i m n i v the circulation of fe iii fe ii mn iv mn iii mn ii speeded up the continuous decomposition of ps as well as the production of sufficient radicals mutual electron transfer between fe and mn made the activation of fm sdbc work continuously which further interpreted the obvious degradation difference among f sdbc m sdbc and fm sdbc yang et al proved that the degradation of polluant could be maximized due to the existence of metal support co ti 31 the formation of co ti bonds promoted electron transfer between co and ti and accelerated og degradation therefore ftir and xrd were employed to confirm the existence of fe mn bonds in fm sdbc as observed from fig 4e for f sdbc m sdbc and fm sdbc there were several major peaks at 3423 1621 and 1039 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of oh c c and co respectively 32 besides fe o mn o bonds were observed in fm sdbc the peak at 690 cm 1 was likely to be the stretching of mn o 33 and the peak at 578 cm 1 might be ascribed to fe o 34 by comparing with the spectra of f sdbc and m sdbc a slight change of fm sdbc lay in the appearance of a new peak at 425 cm 1 35 which might be attributed to the fe mn bond stretching x ray powder diffraction xrd was introduced to further identify the crystal structure of catalysts the xrd spectrum of fm sdbc was shown in fig 4f a sharp peak at around 26 66 was observed corresponding to the silicon dioxide that often appeared in sludge biochar 36 the peaks of 29 35 and 35 67 corresponded to feox 9 37 the diffraction peaks at 50 15 54 02 and 59 96 could be identified as mnox 38 39 the extra diffraction peaks at 35 64 and 59 96 were detected in the pattern of fm sdbc which could be ascribed to the 1 11 2 20 diffractions of fe mn bimetal oxide jcpds no 77 2358 fe mn bonds might form during high temperature pyrolysis in this study in general the synergy between fe and mn in fm sdbc was identified through analysis above which was mainly attributed to the following factors 1 the mutual electron transfer between fe and mn and 2 the formation of fe mn bonds 4 conclusions to sum up fe mn bimetallic oxides supported by sludge derived biochar was synthesized successfully and applied for the activation of ps high efficiently og degradation could achieve 75 23 in fm sdbc ps system which was significantly higher than f sdbc ps and m sdbc ps system moreover fm sdbc ps system had a wide range of ph adaptability the concentrations of fe and mn ions leaching from fm sdbc was mostly maintained at a low level og removal can reach 61 41 after 3 runs of reaction radical quenching tests indicated that both oh and so4 were able to react with og resulting in its effective degradation the cycle of fe iii fe ii mn iv mn iii mn ii made the activation of the fm sdbc work continuously thereinto mn occupied the dominant position at first and then fe did in subsequent process in fm sdbc ps system synergistic mechanism between fe and mn in fm sdbc was assigned to mutual electron transfer between fe and mn and the formation of fe mn bonds in conclusion fm sdbc exhibited promising potential for practical application in wastewater due to its strong pollutant degradation efficiency and suitability for a wide range of ph conditions which could bring valuable insights

use dried gcw 100 g was added into a 2 l flask containing 1 l of 3 m mgcl2 solution and mixed in a rotating incubator at 300 rpm for 8 h after filtering and drying mg2 loaded gcw was thermally treated

aldrich usa solution was used as a standard solution and appropriate dilution was used for the experiments for phosphate adsorption kinetics 0 2 g of mg biochar and 100 ml of 1 mm phosphate solution were mixed in a flask at 500 rpm for 48 h during the experiment phosphate concentration in the solution was periodically measured to calculate the adsorbed phosphate qe as follows 1 q e c o c e v w where co and ce are the initial and final phosphate concentrations mg l w is the biochar concentration g l v is the solution volume l and qe is the adsorbed phosphate mg g biochar for the phosphate adsorption isotherm of mg biochar 0 4 64 mm phosphate solutions were used at 20 0 5 c by measuring the equilibrium phosphate concentration and calculating the adsorbed phosphates as follows 2 q e q c e 1 k c e where qe represents p adsorbed per g adsorbent mg p g biochar ce is p concentration at equilibrium mg l q is maximum p adsorption capacity mg p g biochar and k represents langmuir constant l mg p the higher k value the higher adsorption affinity of the adsorbate phosphate which means the adsorbent has high affinity to phosphate even at low concentration 2 3 phosphate desorption and bioavailability of p saturated mg biochar desorption kinetics and bioavailability of the adsorbed p are the important characteristics of a biochar to be used as a fertilizer appropriate rate of p release is crucial in agricultural soils where too slow or too fast release of p lowers its value as a fertilizer for determining the p desorption kinetics 2 g of p saturated mg biochar was suspended in 1 l distilled water dw and 2 citric acid solution and the desorbed p was measured for the p bioavailability analysis four different test methods were used and their results were compared 1 p

at 121 c and for the icp oes analysis 20 all the analytical measurements were carried out in duplicates and the average values were used for the result analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mg biochar mg2 content of the mg biochar determines the potential capacity of phosphate adsorption mgo content of the mg biochar increased almost linearly with the mg2 concentration up to 3 m fig 1 mgo content reached 13 5 of the biochar when a 3 m solution was used while the mgo content in the control biochar was less than 0 1 metal impregnation is reported to increase the biochar surface area and pore volume 21 in this study mg impregnation was very effective in surface modification and pore development of the gcw biochar the sem image of the control biochar showed smooth surfaces fig 2 a in contrast the sem image of the mg biochar showed the development of particles deposit on the surface fig 2 b these particles are mainly magnesium minerals as confirmed by the eds spectra it was reported that the mg biochar composite from the sugarcane residue was also homogeneously deposited with mgo flakes on the entire biochar surface with rough and flaky morphology 22 bet analysis showed that the surface area and pore volume of the mg biochar has increased 182 and 797 times respectively from the control biochar table 1 this indicates that higher surface area and pore volume of the mg biochar can give more phosphate adsorption opportunity than the control biochar since they provide more space to accommodate the phosphates therefore more phosphates can adsorb to mg biochar by electro chemical interactions when more mg2 is impregnated 3 2 phosphate adsorption kinetics and isotherm of mg biochar phosphate adsorption drastically increased in the gcw mg biochar while the control biochar showed negligible phosphate adsorption gcw mg biochar adsorbed phosphate steadily until 12 h and reached saturation 14 mg p g biochar in 24 h when the adsorption kinetics was carried out and compared with 1 mm phosphate solution fig 3 a on the contrary the control biochar did not adsorb any phosphates but the phosphate concentration in the solution increased a little bit which was a result from the dissolution of phosphate in the control biochar the gcw contained phosphorus and it was enriched in the control biochar from the pyrolysis and it was dissolved in the solution as phosphate the control biochar does not adsorb negatively charged phosphates because the surface of the control biochar also has a negative charge 23 the gcw mg biochar adsorbed 89 4 of the phosphate in the solution it is similar to the previous result where the mg impregnated tomato tissues biochar adsorbing 88 5 of the phosphate in 24 h 12 phosphate adsorption is closely related to the phpzc point of zero charge of the adsorbent surface and the solution ph the charge of the biochar surface remains positive when the solution ph is less than the phpzc of the biochar surface and the phpzc of mgo in the biochar was 12 due to pyrolysis at high temperature 16 therefore anions are adsorbed on the surface of positively charged mg biochar by electrostatic attraction since the solution ph was adjusted to 7 the kinetic adsorption data were fitted and compared with many models 1st order 2nd order richie nth order elovich to find the best fit model the analysis showed that 1st order kinetics was the best fit model with k1 first order kinetic coefficient being 0 12 l h and qe adsorption equilibrium to 14 33 mg g fig 3 a adsorption kinetics describes the rate of retention or release of a solute at a given operational condition adsorbents dose flow rate temperature and ph and it determines the retention time of the adsorption unit to achieve required solute concentration when design the process phosphate adsorption isotherm of the gcw mg biochar was carried out to investigate the adsorption equilibrium with the phosphate solutions ranging from 0 4 64 mm 12 4 1984 mg p l maximum phosphate adsorption reached 56 mg p g biochar at 1800 mg p l fig 3 b among the isotherm models freundlich langmuir langmuir freundlich redlich peterson and temkin langmuir was the best fit model by regression of the isotherm data regression data not shown when the data were fitted to the langmuir isotherm model q of 63 5 mg p g mg biochar and k 1 k is similar to half saturation constant of 0 123 were found from the curve fitting adsorption isotherms describe how pollutants interact with the adsorbent and they are critical for the capacity of adsorbent and effective design of the adsorption systems for the p treatment in domestic wastewater mg biochar can achieve less than 0 2 mg p l from the langmuir isotherm in eq 2 in this case adsorbed p is 1 525 mg g biochar in order to achieve 2 mg p l in the effluent adsorbed p is 12 537 mg g biochar it needs more biochar to achieve lower p concentration in the effluent mg biochar had a very high phosphate affinity when compared to other metals such as al3 ca2 and fe3 24 ph is one of the critical factors for the phosphate adsorption equilibrium as discussed earlier in this study 3 different ph conditions 4 7 10 were compared to determine the effect of ph on phosphate adsorption on mg biochar for 48 h with 2 g mg biochar in 1 l phosphate solution 1 mm phosphate adsorption equilibrium of mg biochar at ph 4 7 and 10 were 14 64 14 35 and 9 43 mg g biochar respectively fig 4 decrease of phosphate adsorption on mg biochar at higher ph alkaline can be explained in several ways firstly the surface electric charge of the biochar may be responsible for this the surface of gcw mg biochar is positively charged to adsorb the negatively charged phosphate when the phpzc of the mgo is higher than the solution ph when the solution ph is higher than the phpzc of the mgo on a biochar however mg biochar has a negative charge and phosphate adsorption decreases by electrostatic repulsion 21 secondly phosphate adsorption on mg biochar can decrease at a higher ph since increased hydroxyl ion oh competes with phosphate for the adsorption sites on the positively charged mg biochar 25 thirdly phosphate exists in many forms depending on the solution ph h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 with pka values of 2 12 7 21 and 12 67 the main form of phosphates is hpo4 2 at ph 10 and it exchanges more oh than h2po4 due to different negative charges between hpo4 2 and h2po4 therefore phosphate adsorption decreases on mg biochar in higher ph alkaline condition 26 in this experiment phosphate adsorption on biochar was performed at ph 7 considering the ph of wastewater even though the phosphate adsorption was a little bit higher at ph 4 surface structure and elemental composition of the mg biochar were investigated by sem eds before and after the phosphate adsorption fig 2 carbon and oxygen were the dominant elements of the control gcw biochar before the phosphate adsorption sem eds spectrum of the mg biochar showed higher mg and cl contents than the control biochar fig 2 a and b which represents impregnation of biochar with mgcl2 it also showed very little p peak after the phosphate adsorption sem eds spectrum of mg biochar showed high peak intensities of mg and p whereas the cl peak had disappeared fig 2 c the result clearly demonstrates that the phosphate was adsorbed on mg biochar and cl was partly washed out in aqueous solution and partly replaced by other anions phosphates xrd also shows the existence of crystalline structure in the biochar during the pyrolysis process the impregnated mgcl2 underwent dehydration process to form crystalline mgo while the gcw turned into carbonaceous particles fig 5 a diffraction peaks at 37 1 43 1 62 5 74 7 and 78 6 degree were the indication of the crystalline structure of mgo 20 the formation of mgo also enhanced the porosity of the biochar and provided the surface area to adsorb the phosphate as shown in fig 2 in an aqueous solution mgo in biochar undergo the following reaction resulting in attaining a positive charge on the surface which attracts negatively charged anions 3 mgo h2o mgoh oh after the phosphate adsorption mg p crystals mg3 po4 2 were observed on the surface of the mg biochar from the xrd spectrum fig 5 a it strongly suggests that the phosphate not only adsorbs on the surface of mg biochar but also reacts with mg to form crystalline precipitates as far as the authors are aware this is the first report to find the phosphate binding to mg2 to form mg p crystals mg3 po4 2 during the adsorption process on biochar li et al observed struvite formation on mg biochar during the treatment of swine wastewater but did not find mg3 po4 2 20 other than biochar the formation of mg3 po4 2 was found on mg decorated carbon nanocomposites material during the phosphate adsorption 27 the slow dissolution of mg3 po4 2 may be advantageous for water environment protection by preventing p run off ft ir spectrum is useful to investigate the interactions of mg biochar and specific functional groups responsible for the adsorption of phosphate positional fluctuations are commonly found in the ir spectra of specific compound under the influence of different environmental factors i e ph temperature concentrations of neighbor chemicals it is also caused by the change in the population of different chemical species nearby ft ir spectra of mg biochar before and after phosphate adsorption are displayed in fig 5 b the ft ir spectrum of mg biochar before the phosphate adsorption showed relatively broad absorption peaks at 586 1059 and 1567 cm 1 the peaks at 500 800 cm 1 are assigned as an inherent absorption bands of metal oxides and mg o specific bands are found at 557 630 683 cm 1 22 24 28 therefore the band at 586 cm 1 in this spectrum is thought to be a sign of mg o band at 1059 cm 1 is due to co of the secondary alcohol 29 band at 1567 cm 1 is due to the cc stretching peak of aromatic rings which is originated from the lignin in the biomass 22 after adsorption the ft ir spectrum of the mg biochar showed drastic changes as compared to the mg biochar before adsorption there are many sharp bands found at 844 895 and 1437 1620 cm 1 and a big broad band at 3000 3600 cm 1 phosphate has absorption bands at 830 1140 cm 1 it has been reported that stretching vibrations of Î± mg2p2o7 and mg3 po4 2 showed absorption bands at 980 1120 and 730 1200 cm 1 respectively 30 from the bands of this study at 844 895 1158 cm 1 the bindings of mg and po4 3 is confirmed strong band around 1658 cm 1 may be ascribed to hpo4 2 or crystal water and the bands at 1437 and 1476 cm 1 may be assigned as stretching vibration of ch 28 29 band at 1560 cm 1 is ascribed to cc stretching peak of aromatic rings and 1620 cm 1 to oh stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups or adsorbed water or po of phosphate 22 28 the clear bands of ch and cc in the after phosphate adsorption spectrum are originated from the biochar however it is unclear why the bands were not apparently shown in the before phosphate adsorption spectrum the broad bands near 3100 3700 cm 1 and the peak centered at 3310 cm 1 are ascribed as oh or stretching vibration of adsorbed or bound water summarizing the ft ir spectra the mg biochar had functional groups of mgo ch co cc of aromatic rings and the interaction and binding of mg and phosphate adsorbed or bound water to the mg biochar were also found after the phosphate adsorption 3 3 desorption and bioavailability of phosphate adsorbed on gcw mg biochar for the practical application of p loaded mg biochar as a fertilizer growing crops p release dissolution kinetics at the target soil ph weather precipitation and chemical and physical properties of the soils are need to be investigated for effective fertilizer application p release from the saturated biochar is one of the most important characteristics of the biochar to be used as a fertilizer in order to estimate the p release characteristics of the phosphate saturated gcw mg biochar as a p fertilizer p desorption kinetics and bioavailability analyses were carried out the phosphate desorption was very fast for the first 3 h in both dw and 2 citric acid solutions and the desorption rate decreased slowly afterwards fig 6 in dw the mg biochar released about 70 of their total phosphate in 12 h on the other hand more and faster phosphate desorption occurred in 2 citric acid by releasing 90 of the total adsorbed phosphate in 12 h the result indicates that acidic condition 2 citric acid ph 2 5 is better than neutral condition dw ph 6 8 for phosphate desorption and it is due to the higher solubility of mg p mg3 po4 2 mghpo4 at acidic ph the environmental conditions in soils are diverse in contrast to dw and it depends on the mineral composition and the crops in the soil in order to take this into account four different p bioavailability test protocols were adopted and the results were compared fig 7 in general mehlich and citric acid 2 methods showed better p bioavailability than others mehlich ph 2 2 and 2 citric acid ph 2 5 methods showed 43 2 and 28 8 of p bioavailability respectively alkaline ph 9 4 and neutral ph 7 0 methods showed the same p bioavailability of 8 74 which is less than the two previous methods mehlich and 2 citric acid the results are in agreement with the previous p desorption kinetics with dw and citric acid the result shows that the p bioavailability of mg biochar heavily depends on the ph where the lower the ph achieves the higher p bioavailability it is due to the higher solubility of mg p mgh na k po4 mg3 po4 2 at acidic conditions and lower solubility at neutral and alkaline conditions 31 for comparison the p bioavailability of wood biochar in 2 citric acid is reported as 6 78 18 28 32 whereas the p bioavailability of this study is 28 8 by 2 citric acid it is higher than the wood biochar but much less than that of mg p 76 8 and struvite 98 4 which were the precipitates from the recovered phosphate 31 even though p bioavailability of mg p mg3 po4 2 mghpo4 mgna k po4 have not been reported yet it is thought to have similar or less than that of struvite the lower p bioavailability of this study than that of mg p from ssa is rather surprising since phosphate in both systems exist in mg p forms 33 it is speculated that mg p in biochar may have a lower p bioavailability than the mg p precipitated from the solution without biochar mass transfer limitation resistance in the porous structure of mg biochar may slow down p release therefore phosphate adsorbed or precipitated in the mg biochar micropores may take longer time for dissolution nevertheless it is not clear at this stage of how much p desorption rate or bioavailability is effective for agriculture since it mostly depends on the type of crops and the stage of its growth slow p desorption low p bioavailability may limit the p uptake and the growth of crops if the p release is too fast however p may be lost by run off from the agricultural soils 34 36 therefore further research on p desorption and bioavailability from biochar is necessary for its sustainability and economical application 4 conclusions mg impregnation of the gcw biochar mg biochar was very effective in the phosphate removal via adsorption the adsorption kinetics of the mg biochar followed the first order kinetics and the isotherm showed the phosphate adsorption capacity 63 5 mg p g biochar by langmuir model spectroscopic xrd sem eds ft ir studies showed not only the adsorption of phosphate on the mg biochar but also the formation of mg p compounds such as mg3 po4 2 phosphate adsorbed mg biochar showed p bioavailability of 8 74 43 2 depending on the assay methods

mg2 concentrations 0 1 0 2 0 4 1 and 3 m for 8 h and pyrolyzed to examine the effect of mg2 concentration on the mg2 content in the biochar surface area and pore size of the biochar were measured by bet specific surface area analyzer 3 flex micromeritics usa x ray diffraction xrd spectrometer was used for the characterization of crystalline structures in the mg biochar before and after phosphate

japan was used for the analysis of surface structure and elemental composition of the mg biochar before and after phosphate adsorption for the sem analysis the samples were pulverized and carbon polished with the double coated carbon tape pelco usa 2 2 phosphate adsorption on mg biochar adsorption kinetics and isotherms of phosphate were carried out with the gcw mg biochar kh2po4 99 sigma aldrich usa solution was used as a standard solution and appropriate dilution was used for the experiments for phosphate adsorption kinetics 0 2 g of mg biochar and 100 ml of 1 mm phosphate solution were mixed in a flask at 500 rpm for 48 h during the experiment phosphate concentration in the solution was periodically measured to calculate the adsorbed phosphate qe as follows 1 q e c o c e v w where co and ce are the initial and final phosphate concentrations mg l w is the biochar concentration g l v is the solution volume l and qe is the adsorbed phosphate mg g biochar for the phosphate adsorption isotherm of mg biochar 0 4 64 mm phosphate solutions were used at 20 0 5 c by measuring the equilibrium phosphate concentration and calculating the adsorbed phosphates as follows 2 q e q c e 1 k c e where qe represents p adsorbed per g adsorbent mg p g biochar ce is p concentration at equilibrium mg l q is maximum p adsorption capacity mg p g biochar and k represents langmuir constant l mg p the higher k value the higher adsorption affinity of the adsorbate phosphate which means the adsorbent has high affinity to phosphate even at low concentration 2 3 phosphate desorption and bioavailability of p saturated mg biochar desorption kinetics and bioavailability of the adsorbed p are the important characteristics of a biochar to be used as a fertilizer appropriate rate of p release is crucial in agricultural soils where too slow or too fast release of p lowers its value as a fertilizer for determining the p desorption kinetics 2 g of p saturated mg biochar was suspended in 1 l distilled water dw and 2 citric acid solution and the desorbed p was measured for the p bioavailability analysis four different test methods were used and their results were compared 1 p

at 121 c and for the icp oes analysis 20 all the analytical measurements were carried out in duplicates and the average values were used for the result analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mg biochar mg2 content of the mg biochar determines the potential capacity of phosphate adsorption mgo content of the mg biochar increased almost linearly with the mg2 concentration up to 3 m fig 1 mgo content reached 13 5 of the biochar when a 3 m solution was used while the mgo content in the control biochar was less than 0 1 metal impregnation is reported to increase the biochar surface area and pore volume 21 in this study mg impregnation was very effective in surface modification and pore development of the gcw biochar the sem image of the control biochar showed smooth surfaces fig 2 a in contrast the sem image of the mg biochar showed the development of particles deposit on the surface fig 2 b these particles are mainly magnesium minerals as confirmed by the eds spectra it was reported that the mg biochar composite from the sugarcane residue was also homogeneously deposited with mgo flakes on the entire biochar surface with rough and flaky morphology 22 bet analysis showed that the surface area and pore volume of the mg biochar has increased 182 and 797 times respectively from the control biochar table 1 this indicates that higher surface area and pore volume of the mg biochar can give more phosphate adsorption opportunity than the control biochar since they provide more space to accommodate the phosphates therefore more phosphates can adsorb to mg biochar by electro chemical interactions when more mg2 is impregnated 3 2 phosphate adsorption kinetics and isotherm of mg biochar phosphate adsorption drastically increased in the gcw mg biochar while the control biochar showed negligible phosphate adsorption gcw mg biochar adsorbed phosphate steadily until 12 h and reached saturation 14 mg p g biochar in 24 h when the adsorption kinetics was carried out and compared with 1 mm phosphate solution fig 3 a on the contrary the control biochar did not adsorb any phosphates but the phosphate concentration in the solution increased a little bit which was a result from the dissolution of phosphate in the control biochar the gcw contained phosphorus and it was enriched in the control biochar from the pyrolysis and it was dissolved in the solution as phosphate the control biochar does not adsorb negatively charged phosphates because the surface of the control biochar also has a negative charge 23 the gcw mg biochar adsorbed 89 4 of the phosphate in the solution it is similar to the previous result where the mg impregnated tomato tissues biochar adsorbing 88 5 of the phosphate in 24 h 12 phosphate adsorption is closely related to the phpzc point of zero charge of the adsorbent surface and the solution ph the charge of the biochar surface remains positive when the solution ph is less than the phpzc of the biochar surface and the phpzc of mgo in the biochar was 12 due to pyrolysis at high temperature 16 therefore anions are adsorbed on the surface of positively charged mg biochar by electrostatic attraction since the solution ph was adjusted to 7 the kinetic adsorption data were fitted and compared with many models 1st order 2nd order richie nth order elovich to find the best fit model the analysis showed that 1st order kinetics was the best fit model with k1 first order kinetic coefficient being 0 12 l h and qe adsorption equilibrium to 14 33 mg g fig 3 a adsorption kinetics describes the rate of retention or release of a solute at a given operational condition adsorbents dose flow rate temperature and ph and it determines the retention time of the adsorption unit to achieve required solute concentration when design the process phosphate adsorption isotherm of the gcw mg biochar was carried out to investigate the adsorption equilibrium with the phosphate solutions ranging from 0 4 64 mm 12 4 1984 mg p l maximum phosphate adsorption reached 56 mg p g biochar at 1800 mg p l fig 3 b among the isotherm models freundlich langmuir langmuir freundlich redlich peterson and temkin langmuir was the best fit model by regression of the isotherm data regression data not shown when the data were fitted to the langmuir isotherm model q of 63 5 mg p g mg biochar and k 1 k is similar to half saturation constant of 0 123 were found from the curve fitting adsorption isotherms describe how pollutants interact with the adsorbent and they are critical for the capacity of adsorbent and effective design of the adsorption systems for the p treatment in domestic wastewater mg biochar can achieve less than 0 2 mg p l from the langmuir isotherm in eq 2 in this case adsorbed p is 1 525 mg g biochar in order to achieve 2 mg p l in the effluent adsorbed p is 12 537 mg g biochar it needs more biochar to achieve lower p concentration in the effluent mg biochar had a very high phosphate affinity when compared to other metals such as al3 ca2 and fe3 24 ph is one of the critical factors for the phosphate adsorption equilibrium as discussed earlier in this study 3 different ph conditions 4 7 10 were compared to determine the effect of ph on phosphate adsorption on mg biochar for 48 h with 2 g mg biochar in 1 l phosphate solution 1 mm phosphate adsorption equilibrium of mg biochar at ph 4 7 and 10 were 14 64 14 35 and 9 43 mg g biochar respectively fig 4 decrease of phosphate adsorption on mg biochar at higher ph alkaline can be explained in several ways firstly the surface electric charge of the biochar may be responsible for this the surface of gcw mg biochar is positively charged to adsorb the negatively charged phosphate when the phpzc of the mgo is higher than the solution ph when the solution ph is higher than the phpzc of the mgo on a biochar however mg biochar has a negative charge and phosphate adsorption decreases by electrostatic repulsion 21 secondly phosphate adsorption on mg biochar can decrease at a higher ph since increased hydroxyl ion oh competes with phosphate for the adsorption sites on the positively charged mg biochar 25 thirdly phosphate exists in many forms depending on the solution ph h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 with pka values of 2 12 7 21 and 12 67 the main form of phosphates is hpo4 2 at ph 10 and it exchanges more oh than h2po4 due to different negative charges between hpo4 2 and h2po4 therefore phosphate adsorption decreases on mg biochar in higher ph alkaline condition 26 in this experiment phosphate adsorption on biochar was performed at ph 7 considering the ph of wastewater even though the phosphate adsorption was a little bit higher at ph 4 surface structure and elemental composition of the mg biochar were investigated by sem eds before and after the phosphate adsorption fig 2 carbon and oxygen were the dominant elements of the control gcw biochar before the phosphate adsorption sem eds spectrum of the mg biochar showed higher mg and cl contents than the control biochar fig 2 a and b which represents impregnation of biochar with mgcl2 it also showed very little p peak after the phosphate adsorption sem eds spectrum of mg biochar showed high peak intensities of mg and p whereas the cl peak had disappeared fig 2 c the result clearly demonstrates that the phosphate was adsorbed on mg biochar and cl was partly washed out in aqueous solution and partly replaced by other anions phosphates xrd also shows the existence of crystalline structure in the biochar during the pyrolysis process the impregnated mgcl2 underwent dehydration process to form crystalline mgo while the gcw turned into carbonaceous particles fig 5 a diffraction peaks at 37 1 43 1 62 5 74 7 and 78 6 degree were the indication of the crystalline structure of mgo 20 the formation of mgo also enhanced the porosity of the biochar and provided the surface area to adsorb the phosphate as shown in fig 2 in an aqueous solution mgo in biochar undergo the following reaction resulting in attaining a positive charge on the surface which attracts negatively charged anions 3 mgo h2o mgoh oh after the phosphate adsorption mg p crystals mg3 po4 2 were observed on the surface of the mg biochar from the xrd spectrum fig 5 a it strongly suggests that the phosphate not only adsorbs on the surface of mg biochar but also reacts with mg to form crystalline precipitates as far as the authors are aware this is the first report to find the phosphate binding to mg2 to form mg p crystals mg3 po4 2 during the adsorption process on biochar li et al observed struvite formation on mg biochar during the treatment of swine wastewater but did not find mg3 po4 2 20 other than biochar the formation of mg3 po4 2 was found on mg decorated carbon nanocomposites material during the phosphate adsorption 27 the slow dissolution of mg3 po4 2 may be advantageous for water environment protection by preventing p run off ft ir spectrum is useful to investigate the interactions of mg biochar and specific functional groups responsible for the adsorption of phosphate positional fluctuations are commonly found in the ir spectra of specific compound under the influence of different environmental factors i e ph temperature concentrations of neighbor chemicals it is also caused by the change in the population of different chemical species nearby ft ir spectra of mg biochar before and after phosphate adsorption are displayed in fig 5 b the ft ir spectrum of mg biochar before the phosphate adsorption showed relatively broad absorption peaks at 586 1059 and 1567 cm 1 the peaks at 500 800 cm 1 are assigned as an inherent absorption bands of metal oxides and mg o specific bands are found at 557 630 683 cm 1 22 24 28 therefore the band at 586 cm 1 in this spectrum is thought to be a sign of mg o band at 1059 cm 1 is due to co of the secondary alcohol 29 band at 1567 cm 1 is due to the cc stretching peak of aromatic rings which is originated from the lignin in the biomass 22 after adsorption the ft ir spectrum of the mg biochar showed drastic changes as compared to the mg biochar before adsorption there are many sharp bands found at 844 895 and 1437 1620 cm 1 and a big broad band at 3000 3600 cm 1 phosphate has absorption bands at 830 1140 cm 1 it has been reported that stretching vibrations of Î± mg2p2o7 and mg3 po4 2 showed absorption bands at 980 1120 and 730 1200 cm 1 respectively 30 from the bands of this study at 844 895 1158 cm 1 the bindings of mg and po4 3 is confirmed strong band around 1658 cm 1 may be ascribed to hpo4 2 or crystal water and the bands at 1437 and 1476 cm 1 may be assigned as stretching vibration of ch 28 29 band at 1560 cm 1 is ascribed to cc stretching peak of aromatic rings and 1620 cm 1 to oh stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups or adsorbed water or po of phosphate 22 28 the clear bands of ch and cc in the after phosphate adsorption spectrum are originated from the biochar however it is unclear why the bands were not apparently shown in the before phosphate adsorption spectrum the broad bands near 3100 3700 cm 1 and the peak centered at 3310 cm 1 are ascribed as oh or stretching vibration of adsorbed or bound water summarizing the ft ir spectra the mg biochar had functional groups of mgo ch co cc of aromatic rings and the interaction and binding of mg and phosphate adsorbed or bound water to the mg biochar were also found after the phosphate adsorption 3 3 desorption and bioavailability of phosphate adsorbed on gcw mg biochar for the practical application of p loaded mg biochar as a fertilizer growing crops p release dissolution kinetics at the target soil ph weather precipitation and chemical and physical properties of the soils are need to be investigated for effective fertilizer application p release from the saturated biochar is one of the most important characteristics of the biochar to be used as a fertilizer in order to estimate the p release characteristics of the phosphate saturated gcw mg biochar as a p fertilizer p desorption kinetics and bioavailability analyses were carried out the phosphate desorption was very fast for the first 3 h in both dw and 2 citric acid solutions and the desorption rate decreased slowly afterwards fig 6 in dw the mg biochar released about 70 of their total phosphate in 12 h on the other hand more and faster phosphate desorption occurred in 2 citric acid by releasing 90 of the total adsorbed phosphate in 12 h the result indicates that acidic condition 2 citric acid ph 2 5 is better than neutral condition dw ph 6 8 for phosphate desorption and it is due to the higher solubility of mg p mg3 po4 2 mghpo4 at acidic ph the environmental conditions in soils are diverse in contrast to dw and it depends on the mineral composition and the crops in the soil in order to take this into account four different p bioavailability test protocols were adopted and the results were compared fig 7 in general mehlich and citric acid 2 methods showed better p bioavailability than others mehlich ph 2 2 and 2 citric acid ph 2 5 methods showed 43 2 and 28 8 of p bioavailability respectively alkaline ph 9 4 and neutral ph 7 0 methods showed the same p bioavailability of 8 74 which is less than the two previous methods mehlich and 2 citric acid the results are in agreement with the previous p desorption kinetics with dw and citric acid the result shows that the p bioavailability of mg biochar heavily depends on the ph where the lower the ph achieves the higher p bioavailability it is due to the higher solubility of mg p mgh na k po4 mg3 po4 2 at acidic conditions and lower solubility at neutral and alkaline conditions 31 for comparison the p bioavailability of wood biochar in 2 citric acid is reported as 6 78 18 28 32 whereas the p bioavailability of this study is 28 8 by 2 citric acid it is higher than the wood biochar but much less than that of mg p 76 8 and struvite 98 4 which were the precipitates from the recovered phosphate 31 even though p bioavailability of mg p mg3 po4 2 mghpo4 mgna k po4 have not been reported yet it is thought to have similar or less than that of struvite the lower p bioavailability of this study than that of mg p from ssa is rather surprising since phosphate in both systems exist in mg p forms 33 it is speculated that mg p in biochar may have a lower p bioavailability than the mg p precipitated from the solution without biochar mass transfer limitation resistance in the porous structure of mg biochar may slow down p release therefore phosphate adsorbed or precipitated in the mg biochar micropores may take longer time for dissolution nevertheless it is not clear at this stage of how much p desorption rate or bioavailability is effective for agriculture since it mostly depends on the type of crops and the stage of its growth slow p desorption low p bioavailability may limit the p uptake and the growth of crops if the p release is too fast however p may be lost by run off from the agricultural soils 34 36 therefore further research on p desorption and bioavailability from biochar is necessary for its sustainability and economical application 4 conclusions mg impregnation of the gcw biochar mg biochar was very effective in the phosphate removal via adsorption the adsorption kinetics of the mg biochar followed the first order kinetics and the isotherm showed the phosphate adsorption capacity 63 5 mg p g biochar by langmuir model spectroscopic xrd sem eds ft ir studies showed not only the adsorption of phosphate on the mg biochar but also the formation of mg p compounds such as mg3 po4 2 phosphate adsorbed mg biochar showed p bioavailability of 8 74 43 2 depending on the assay methods

13928,tetracycline c22h24n2o8 is a well known emerging contaminant that is generally used in pharmaceuticals and personal care products traditional biological treatment technologies are inadequate for quickly and completely removing tetracycline from wastewater hence the ozonation investigated in this study is preferable the effects of several reaction parameters such as tetracycline concentration ph temperature addition of oh radical scavengers gas type and bubble size were investigated experimental results indicated that the connection of air or pure oxygen gas with a millibubble or ultrafine bubble compressor could not remove tetracycline as the ozonation was carried out the degradation of tetracycline exceeded 99 5 followed by approximately 40 mineralization with 60 min treatment a lower ph level or a higher reaction temperature was practical to increase the degradation of tetracycline also the increase in the formation of oh radicals was impressive to mineralize further the organic compound according to the experimental results shown in this study ultrafine bubble ozonation is a feasible way to degrade the antibiotics effectively and decrease the toxicity in water within a short treatment duration and with low ozone gas consumption keywords antibiotics mineralization tetracycline toxicity ultrafine bubble ozonation 1 introduction in recent decades many derivative emerging contaminants ecs such as artificial sweeteners pesticides cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have been manufactured to improve the quality of environmental safety sanitary conditions public health agricultural harvests and so on 1 2 these chemicals are widely used in most countries and have become indispensable items in modern society at the same time these chemicals often exist in wastes sewage wastewater and rivers most ecs are present in the environment at generally low concentrations nanogram per liter to microgram per liter not only in wastewater and rivers but also in drinking water 3 however because the ecs are concentrated in sediment and sludge the risk for human health is still important ppcps are widely used as medicines for humans and other animals for nutritional supplements in feed and in cosmetics 4 these ppcps are not all newly designed compounds some have been stably dispersed in the environment for a long duration because of the problem of aging populations in many countries the consumption of ppcps has increased year by year and the amounts of ppcps in the environment are also increasing 5 6 tetracycline is one kind of ppcps which is the second most widely used antibiotic in the world and is one kind of stable and drug resistant chemicals it causes significant toxic effects to threaten aquatic organisms 7 the excreted tetracycline in urine after ingestion is 60 of the original intake 8 which indicates that the intake of not all tetracycline can be reduced by humans and animals therefore high concentrations of tetracycline can be detected in the aquatic environment because of the cumulative effects 9 generally traditional techniques such as filtration precipitation coagulation and gelation cannot effectively remove the tetracycline 10 12 therefore the importance of figuring out an effective technique to degrade and detoxify the tetracycline in an aqueous phase is increasing many techniques like well known advanced oxidation processes aops such as the sonolysis ultrasound ultrasound o3 and ultrasound fe3o4 o3 fenton like method the photocatalytic method corona discharge plasma nano tio2 method or physio chemical methods such as the nano tio2 carbon electrocatalytic membranes fe ni bimetallic nanoparticles and granular activated carbon adsorption have been investigated to degrade tetracycline 10 13 16 as the adsorption methods are used to remove tetracycline it is understood that the tetracycline molecules in aqueous phase are concentrated on the surface of the adsorbent leading to the reduction of tetracycline concentration in solution 15 however this concentrated effect on the surface of the adsorbent is not a real degradation mechanism which indicates that the tetracycline is still present in the environment and needs to be treated further therefore oxidation or degradation of tetracycline by chemical methods is an optimal consideration to remove the tetracycline fully and effectively from the solution phase especially to reduce the toxicity of tetracycline 10 during the operation of aops for removing tetracycline many researchers tried to add different kinds of metal elements or cations in the reaction to enhance the treatment efficiency and obtained satisfactory results 16 18 however based on the idea of green treatment or green technology decreasing the usage of chemicals especially the chemicals that still exist in solution after treatment in the oxidation process should be prioritized therefore ozone has been applied in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater because the use of ozone can meet the requirements of green technology 19 21 generally there are two well known oxidation mechanisms that take place in the degradation of target compounds during the ozonation process direct oxidation by ozone molecules and indirect oxidation by hydroxyl free radicals oh 22 in addition enhancing the solubility and stability of ozone gas molecules in solution is the key mechanism to increase the treatment efficiency of refractory compounds because the half life of ozone gas molecules in solution is 20 min only 23 therefore if the diameter of ozone gas molecules can be reduced to less than 50 Î¼m then the mass transfer between the gas and solution phases can be enhanced through the higher specific interfacial area slower rising velocity and larger inner pressure of ozone gas bubbles to improve the solubility and treatment efficiency of target compounds in water 14 based on the above description the objectives of this study are to use the ozone as the oxidant to degrade the tetracycline and investigate the effect of reaction parameters including the bubble size ph temperature initial tetracycline concentration and addition of tert butanol further the profiles of toxicity of tetracycline solution based on the calculation of cell viability were investigated to realize the feasibility of ozonation in the treatment of tetracycline 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents an analytical tetracycline standard sigma aldrich purity of 98 was used as the target compound other chemical reagents used in this study such as sulfuric acid h2so4 phosphoric acid h3po4 sodium hydroxide naoh potassium hydrogen phthalate c8h5ko4 and tert butanol ch3 3coh were of the purest commercially available grade from merck or ferak and were used without further purification 2 2 experimental apparatus and treatment designs fig 1 shows the experimental apparatus used in this study including an ozone generator triogen lab2b uk temperature controller ultra fine bubble compressor ph and oxidation reduction potential orp monitoring meters and a cylinder reactor the lab2b ozone generator is specifically designed for bench use and it consists of a small air cooled unit function indicators a feed gas flowmeter and variable output control the maximum produced o3 dosage is 10 g h to adjust the suitable o3 dosage in the reactor an external feed flow rate control device bronkhortst el flow select f 201 cv f 211 cv taiwan was used in this study in addition to the ozone generator so that the flow rate could be maintained at 40 ml min which is equivalent to the ozone production rate of 0 08 g h an ultrafine bubble generating device fluid metering inc usa was installed behind the flow meter to transfer the ozone gas bubbles in solution as in an ultrafine bubble scale where the diameters of ozone gas bubbles were approximately 0 5 3 Î¼m the ph and orp meters eutech cyberscan ph 510 taiwan were placed in the 1 l reactor to measure the profiles of ph and orp data solutions of 1 n h2so4 or naoh were added to the solution to adjust adequate ph levels before the reactions the dissolved ozone concentration was obtained by an ozone concentration monitor zezawa oz 301 taiwan the reaction temperature was controlled with a constant temperature water bath tank 2 3 tetracycline degradation and mineralization the uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific genesys 10s usa was used to measure the concentration of tetracycline based on the maximum absorption wavelength of 357 nm 24 prior to the experiments a calibration line with a satisfactory linear regression r2 value of 1 0 was purchased for obtaining the tetracycline concentration during the reactions mineralization of tetracycline was investigated by determining the concentration of total organic carbon toc using a toc analyzer toc 500 shimadzu japan to understand the effect of reaction parameters on the degradation of tetracycline the concentrations of tetracycline were initiated from 50 to 500 mg l other parameters such as ph levels 3 11 temperatures 15 c 55 c and tert butanol dosage 50 400 mg l were also investigated each sample was analyzed for three times and the results shown in figures and tables in this study were the averages 2 4 dissolved ozone concentration prior to the tetracycline degradation experiments by ozonation ozone gas was introduced into the distilled and deionized water di water its resistivity was 16 3 mo cm by two purging processes millibubble and ultrafine bubble ozonation at 25 c with a flow rate of 30 ml min the measured dissolved ozone concentrations are shown in fig 2 the increase in dissolved ozone concentration in the ultrafine bubble mode was faster than in the millibubble mode after a 10 min ozone gas introducing step the maximum dissolved ozone concentrations in ultrafine bubble mode and millibubble mode were 8 3 and 3 5 mg l respectively which indicated that lowering the size of ozone gas bubbles was profitable for increasing the dissolved ozone concentration 2 5 toxicity analysis the steps used for the analysis of the solution toxicity followed an earlier study 24 in all experiments the cells were treated with tetracycline water samples for 24 h before and after oxidation the toxicities of the tetracycline samples before and after treatment were determined based on the rate of the liver cell viability confirmed by cell counting using a blue formazan assay in which colorless 3 4 5 dimethyl thiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide was metabolized to a blue product by mitochondrial dehydrogenases the absorbance at 540 nm was recorded using a spectramax 340 reader the data were expressed as the mean percentages of the viable cells compared with the control 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of gas types and bubble scales in the beginning of the experiments three types of gas air pure oxygen and ozone with two kinds of bubble compressor millibubble and ultrafine bubble were individually introduced into a reactor containing 1 l of di water and the profiles of ph and orp values were monitored during the reaction based on a combination of three types of gas with two kinds of bubble scale there were six experiments that could be performed the flow rates of gas introduction in the six experiments were all 40 ml min the changes of ph values were insignificant with the six combinations of experiments while the ph levels were initiated at ph 6 5 and the final ph values were between 6 3 and 6 6 after 60 min reaction data were not shown however the profiles of orp values in the ozonation experiments including millibubble and ultra fine bubble were different from those in other experiments fig 3 a shows that the initial orp values were approximately 250 mv and rapidly increased to more than 1100 mv after 5 min reaction as the ozone was introduced since the increase of orp values is estimated as the increase in oxidation power or performance 25 introduction of ozone can provide stronger oxidation power than other gases when the air or pure oxygen gas was purging into the reactor for 60 min the final orp values were both approximately 400 mv where the increments were 150 mv only as indicated in fig 3 b because of the higher oxidation power provided by the ozone gas the degradations of tetracycline were all lower than 5 in the air or pure oxygen introduction experiments when the ozone was introduced degradation of tetracycline reached 50 with millibubble ozonation and 95 with ultrafine bubble ozonation after 20 min reaction even though the introduction flow rate of ozone in millibubble and ultrafine bubble ozonation was also 40 ml min the ultrafine bubble ozonation showed better performance in the degradation of tetracycline these results can be first discussed by the effect of dissolved ozone concentration during the reaction fig 3 c shows that the dissolved ozone concentration in millibubble ozonation slightly increased from 0 to 6 5 mg l in the di water test however when the tetracycline solution test was carried out the appearance of dissolved ozone was not detected which indicated that the dissolved ozone was all used in the degradation of tetracycline so that the residual of ozone in solution phase was not detected when the ultrafine bubble compressor was used dissolved ozone concentration significantly increased to approximately 10 mg l within 5 min reaction in the di water test in the tetracycline degradation experiment the dissolved ozone concentration was also zero in the first 20 min and then rapidly increased to 10 mg l the result shown in fig 3 b indicates that the degradation of tetracycline reached 95 at 20 min ultrafine bubble ozonation and then slightly increased to the maximum level 98 7 with a further 40 min reaction based on the results shown in figs 3 b and c introduction of ozone can be terminated after 20 min so that the operational cost can be reduced in addition in millibubble ozonation the degradation of tetracycline gently increased to 87 3 within 60 min reaction which indicated that the introduced ozone may not have been dissolved and consumed for degrading tetracycline therefore because the reduction of ozone gas bubble size can effectively increase the remaining time and concentration of ozone 14 26 it is proved that lowering the ozone gas bubble size is useful to shorten the necessary treatment duration and increase the treatment efficiency in addition increasing the concentration of dissolved ozone in solution is effective on the increase of oh radicals for the oxidation of organic compounds 27 therefore when the ultra fine bubble compressor was carried out in the experiment degradation of tetracycline can be enhanced by the higher dissolved ozone concentration 3 2 effect of ph there are two major oxidation mechanisms direct ozone molecule attack and indirect oh radical attack that take place between the ozone and organic compounds in addition the ph level of the solution affects the formation of oh radicals and decides which is the major oxidation mechanism during ozonation at lower ph levels or in acidic conditions direct ozone molecule attack is the dominant oxidation mechanism and at higher ph levels or in basic condition oh radical attack is the major one 27 28 therefore in this study the ph levels were initialized at 3 11 and the ph effect on the degradation and mineralization of tetracycline was investigated fig 4 a shows the degradation results of tetracycline by ultrafine bubble ozonation where the data indicate that the lower ph level assisted the increase in organic compound degradation 29 30 however the differences between ph 3 and ph 9 were insignificant after 20 min degradation of tetracycline reached more than 95 and all slightly increased to approximately 99 only one curve shown in fig 4 a ph 11 is different from those of other experiments this can be explained by the concentration of dissolved ozone which are shown in fig 4 b and related to the formation of oh radicals during the reaction tetracycline could be easily degraded by indirect ozonation oh produced by ozone and h2o and direct ozonation o3 molecule so that the difference of tetracycline degradation with varying ph levels were insignificant in addition in fig 4 b it is shown that no dissolved ozone could be detected in the first 10 min at ph 3 to ph 9 and then it increased to 6 6 10 9 mg o3 l at the end of reactions at ph 11 the concentration of dissolved ozone was still zero at 20 min reaction and then slightly increased to 1 mg l at 30 min after the further 30 min reaction the dissolved ozone concentration steadily increased to 6 3 mg l this profile corresponds to fig 4 a where the degradation of tetracycline at ph 11 was slower than at other ph levels because of the lower dissolved ozone concentration in the solution however degradation of tetracycline reached its maximum at ph 11 after 30 min reaction so that the accumulation of ozone in solution phase increased fig 5 shows the results of tetracycline degradation toc removal and the change of cell viability as the 50 mg l tetracycline solution was oxidized by ultrafine bubble ozonation the reaction time was 60 min this figure shows that the degradation efficiencies from ph 3 to ph 11 were comparable where the results of tetracycline degradation after 60 min reaction at these five ph levels were all around 99 however removal of toc and change of cell viability were different from tetracycline degradation at ph 11 mineralization of tetracycline presented as toc removal was 32 which was higher than other ph levels in addition toc removal decreased with decreasing ph levels a comparable trend was observed in cell viability before ozonation the cell viability of raw tetracycline water solution was 55 which indicated that 45 of cells were inactivated when the cells were incubated in the tetracycline solution for 24 h in addition to obtain better sensitivity in cell viability the incubated tetracycline solution needed to be ten times dilution otherwise all cells were inactivated as the 50 mg l tetracycline solution was used when the ultrafine bubble ozonation was carried out cell viability increased to 90 at ph 3 and decreased to 76 71 68 and 66 at ph 5 ph 7 ph 9 and ph 11 respectively when the organic compounds were oxidized at lower ph levels ozone molecules could effectively attack the compound and then further oxidize and mineralize the compound to co2 25 27 hence the higher mineralization of tetracycline led to a better reduction of toxicity or increase of cell viability however in this study the maximum toc removal is 32 which indicates that 68 of degraded tetracycline cannot be fully mineralized to co2 and may form the intermediates so that the cell viability cannot reach 100 3 3 effect of tetracycline concentration fig 4 a shows that more than 99 of tetracycline could be degraded within 20 min reaction if the initial tetracycline concentration was 50 mg l only therefore it is interesting to determine how much tetracycline can be degraded when an ultrafine bubble ozonation is carried out in this study four different initial tetracycline concentrations 50 100 200 and 500 mg l were investigated to understand the performance of ultrafine bubble ozonation ozone gas flow rate was 40 ml min table 1 shows the results of tetracycline degradation and mineralization not only the percentage but also the amount so that the real degradation and mineralization can be investigated if the initial tetracycline concentration was 200 mg l and 99 of it could be degraded this revealed that the real degradation amount of tetracycline was 198 1 mg when the tetracycline concentration increased to 500 mg l even the degradation percentage decreased to 90 8 the real removal amount was 454 mg this indicates that continued introduction of the ozone gas into the solution with an ultrafine bubble compressor not only can be used in the treatment of solution with a low initial tetracycline concentration but also in that with a high one this can be explained by fig 6 which shows that the dissolved ozone concentration was detected at 10 min when the initial tetracycline concentration was 50 mg l if the tetracycline concentration increased to 100 and 200 mg l most dissolved ozone was fully used in the early 30 and 40 min respectively so that the dissolved ozone could be first detected after 30 and 40 min reaction for 500 mg l tetracycline solution the dissolved ozone was not detected in the entire 60 min reaction which indicated that the introduced ozone in the solution phase was all used to degrade the tetracycline mineralization of tetracycline showed comparable results increasing the initial tetracycline concentrations decreased the removal efficiency of toc but the real removal amount of toc increased however as the initial tetracycline concentration reached 500 mg l removal of toc was lower than that at 200 mg l in other words even the ultrafine bubble compressor can enhance the solubility of dissolved ozone and extend the resident time of ozone gas bubbles and these fine ozone gas bubbles can degrade organic compounds very soon however fully destroying the structure of the organic compound and transferring it to co2 is not easy and partial mineralization took place 29 31 hence if a higher initial tetracycline concentration needs to be degraded enhancing the ozone dosage or gas flow rate may be useful to achieve it 3 4 effect of temperature because ozone gas is difficult to store in a tank and easy to transfer from solution phase to air phase understanding how to use the dissolved ozone effectively to oxidize the refractory compound or how to increase the solubility and stability of dissolved ozone gas in solution phase is key to enhancing the treatment efficiency by ozonation 30 32 hence controlling the suitable reaction temperature is an important operational parameter during ozonation in this study five reaction temperatures were used to investigate the effect of temperature on the degradation of tetracycline by ultrafine bubble ozonation and the results are shown in fig 7 the degradations of tetracycline after 60 min at five reaction temperatures were comparable the degradation percentages were all greater than 99 in fact to achieve this high treatment performance only a 20 min reaction was needed based on the results shown in fig 4 a therefore it is estimated that the ultrafine bubble ozonation can effectively degrade the tetracycline at varying reaction temperatures so that controlling the temperature may not be necessary however the results of toc removal and change of cell viability show different trends from tetracycline degradation as the reaction temperature increased from 15 c to 55 c toc removal increased from 11 3 36 2 the cell viability simultaneously increased from 62 3 87 5 this indicates that the higher reaction temperatures contributed to increasing the performance in organic molecular structure destruction and then transferring the organic compound to co2 and reducing the toxicity generally increasing the reaction temperature would reduce the solubility of dissolved ozone and the mass transfer of ozone gas between the gas and solution phases therefore lower reaction temperatures are suitable to increase the treatment efficiency 33 34 even if the mass transfer is inhibited by the increase of reaction temperature the reactivity between the organic compound and ozone gas molecules or dissolved ozone could be increased in addition the contribution of reactivity enhancement is greater than the reduction of mass transfer so the treatment efficiency at higher reaction temperatures is better than at lower ones 32 35 an attempt was made to use the integration by time and dissolved ozone concentration to calculate the usage of ozone in the degradation of tetracycline as shown in figs 8 a and b the solid circle in fig 8 shows the data of detected dissolved ozone concentration as the ultrafine bubble ozonation reacted with di water and the empty circle shows the results with tetracycline solution therefore the gray area can be defined as the real ozone usage during the ozonation based on the calculations the gray area in figs 8 a and b were 222 and 228 respectively which can be considered a comparable result that is the real usages of ozone in tetracycline degradation in different reaction temperatures were similar therefore even the dissolved ozone concentrations in warmer conditions are lower than those in cooler ones in fig 7 one can see similar degradation results at all reaction temperatures 3 5 effect of oh radical scavenger the reaction between tert butanol and oh radicals is violent so many researchers have used it as a scavenger of the oh radicals in oxidation tests to understand the effects of direct and indirect oxidation mechanisms 36 38 to investigate the contribution of direct ozone molecule oxidation and indirect oh radical oxidation mechanisms on the degradation of tetracycline four concentrations of tert butanol were added at the beginning of the reaction so that the formation of oh radicals by ozonation could be estimated as completely scavenged fig 9 shows that the degradation of tetracycline at different tert butanol additions was greater than 99 and the cell viability approximately ranged from 66 3 70 5 which indicated that the difference among the four tert butanol additions was insignificant however the toc removal was different from the tetracycline degradation and cell viability as the tetracycline was oxidized without tert butanol addition toc removal reached approximately 20 when the tert butanol was added toc removal decreased to around 7 8 only which indicated that the mineralization of tetracycline was inhibited by the scavenge effect of oh radicals by tert butanol that is the oh radical was the major contributor in this study also this fact can be used to prove why the toc removal is higher in basic condition which is shown in fig 5 based on the above observations it is estimated that the degradation of tetracycline can be easily achieved by the presence of ozone molecules in solution so the effect of tert butanol addition is insignificant to achieve better mineralization of refractory compounds avoiding the presence of oh radical scavengers is useful to enhance the treatment efficiency because the oh radicals play an important role in destroying the molecular structures and transferring them to co2 4 conclusions although antibiotics such as tetracycline are important to humans and animals for preventing disease and enhancing health the problems caused by the chemical and biological characteristics such as the non biodegradable nature and bio resistance of tetracycline is a concern if the concentration and toxicity of tetracycline can be chemically or biologically reduced prior to the discharge of the effluent damage to the environment can be prevented in this study the degradation of tetracycline by ozonation was investigated with different operational parameters and it was found that ultrafine bubble ozonation at a lower ph level and higher reaction temperature exhibits a better oxidation capability and more favorable tetracycline degradation and mineralization than the other combinations the toxicity of water samples also decreases to a greater extent because of the treatment reduction of the ozone bubble size to ultrafine bubbles shows better performance in tetracycline treatment because of the longer bubble residence time in the water the ultrafine bubble ozonation can treat high concentration solution so it may be feasible to use this process in a real wastewater treatment plant also avoiding the presence of oh radical scavengers such as tert butanol is useful for maintaining the high potential of ozonation because the oh radical oxidation mechanism is the key step to mineralize the organic compounds acknowledgments the financial support from the ministry of science and technology republic of china grant nos 101 2221 e 264 005 and 103 2221 e 264 001 my2 is gratefully acknowledged 
13928,tetracycline c22h24n2o8 is a well known emerging contaminant that is generally used in pharmaceuticals and personal care products traditional biological treatment technologies are inadequate for quickly and completely removing tetracycline from wastewater hence the ozonation investigated in this study is preferable the effects of several reaction parameters such as tetracycline concentration ph temperature addition of oh radical scavengers gas type and bubble size were investigated experimental results indicated that the connection of air or pure oxygen gas with a millibubble or ultrafine bubble compressor could not remove tetracycline as the ozonation was carried out the degradation of tetracycline exceeded 99 5 followed by approximately 40 mineralization with 60 min treatment a lower ph level or a higher reaction temperature was practical to increase the degradation of tetracycline also the increase in the formation of oh radicals was impressive to mineralize further the organic compound according to the experimental results shown in this study ultrafine bubble ozonation is a feasible way to degrade the antibiotics effectively and decrease the toxicity in water within a short treatment duration and with low ozone gas consumption keywords antibiotics mineralization tetracycline toxicity ultrafine bubble ozonation 1 introduction in recent decades many derivative emerging contaminants ecs such as artificial sweeteners pesticides cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have been manufactured to improve the quality of environmental safety sanitary conditions public health agricultural harvests and so on 1 2 these chemicals are widely used in most countries and have become indispensable items in modern society at the same time these chemicals often exist in wastes sewage wastewater and rivers most ecs are present in the environment at generally low concentrations nanogram per liter to microgram per liter not only in wastewater and rivers but also in drinking water 3 however because the ecs are concentrated in sediment and sludge the risk for human health is still important ppcps are widely used as medicines for humans and other animals for nutritional supplements in feed and in cosmetics 4 these ppcps are not all newly designed compounds some have been stably dispersed in the environment for a long duration because of the problem of aging populations in many countries the consumption of ppcps has increased year by year and the amounts of ppcps in the environment are also increasing 5 6 tetracycline is one kind of ppcps which is the second most widely used antibiotic in the world and is one kind of stable and drug resistant chemicals it causes significant toxic effects to threaten aquatic organisms 7 the excreted tetracycline in urine after ingestion is 60 of the original intake 8 which indicates that the intake of not all tetracycline can be reduced by humans and animals therefore high concentrations of tetracycline can be detected in the aquatic environment because of the cumulative effects 9 generally traditional techniques such as filtration precipitation coagulation and gelation cannot effectively remove the tetracycline 10 12 therefore the importance of figuring out an effective technique to degrade and detoxify the tetracycline in an aqueous phase is increasing many techniques like well known advanced oxidation processes aops such as the sonolysis ultrasound ultrasound o3 and ultrasound fe3o4 o3 fenton like method the photocatalytic method corona discharge plasma nano tio2 method or physio chemical methods such as the nano tio2 carbon electrocatalytic membranes fe ni bimetallic nanoparticles and granular activated carbon adsorption have been investigated to degrade tetracycline 10 13 16 as the adsorption methods are used to remove tetracycline it is understood that the tetracycline molecules in aqueous phase are concentrated on the surface of the adsorbent leading to the reduction of tetracycline concentration in solution 15 however this concentrated effect on the surface of the adsorbent is not a real degradation mechanism which indicates that the tetracycline is still present in the environment and needs to be treated further therefore oxidation or degradation of tetracycline by chemical methods is an optimal consideration to remove the tetracycline fully and effectively from the solution phase especially to reduce the toxicity of tetracycline 10 during the operation of aops for removing tetracycline many researchers tried to add different kinds of metal elements or cations in the reaction to enhance the treatment efficiency and obtained satisfactory results 16 18 however based on the idea of green treatment or green technology decreasing the usage of chemicals especially the chemicals that still exist in solution after treatment in the oxidation process should be prioritized therefore ozone has been applied in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater because the use of ozone can meet the requirements of green technology 19 21 generally there are two well known oxidation mechanisms that take place in the degradation of target compounds during the ozonation process direct oxidation by ozone molecules and indirect oxidation by hydroxyl free radicals oh 22 in addition enhancing the solubility and stability of ozone gas molecules in solution is the key mechanism to increase the treatment efficiency of refractory compounds because the half life of ozone gas molecules in solution is 20 min only 23 therefore if the diameter of ozone gas molecules can be reduced to less than 50 Î¼m then the mass transfer between the gas and solution phases can be enhanced through the higher specific interfacial area slower rising velocity and larger inner pressure of ozone gas bubbles to improve the solubility and treatment efficiency of target compounds in water 14 based on the above description the objectives of this study are to use the ozone as the oxidant to degrade the tetracycline and investigate the effect of reaction parameters including the bubble size ph temperature initial tetracycline concentration and addition of tert butanol further the profiles of toxicity of tetracycline solution based on the calculation of cell viability were investigated to realize the feasibility of ozonation in the treatment of tetracycline 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents an analytical tetracycline standard sigma aldrich purity of 98 was used as the target compound other chemical reagents used in this study such as sulfuric acid h2so4 phosphoric acid h3po4 sodium hydroxide naoh potassium hydrogen phthalate c8h5ko4 and tert butanol ch3 3coh were of the purest commercially available grade from merck or ferak and were used without further purification 2 2 experimental apparatus and treatment designs fig 1 shows the experimental apparatus used in this study including an ozone generator triogen lab2b uk temperature controller ultra fine bubble compressor ph and oxidation reduction potential orp monitoring meters and a cylinder reactor the lab2b ozone generator is specifically designed for bench use and it consists of a small air cooled unit function indicators a feed gas flowmeter and variable output control the maximum produced o3 dosage is 10 g h to adjust the suitable o3 dosage in the reactor an external feed flow rate control device bronkhortst el flow select f 201 cv f 211 cv taiwan was used in this study in addition to the ozone generator so that the flow rate could be maintained at 40 ml min which is equivalent to the ozone production rate of 0 08 g h an ultrafine bubble generating device fluid metering inc usa was installed behind the flow meter to transfer the ozone gas bubbles in solution as in an ultrafine bubble scale where the diameters of ozone gas bubbles were approximately 0 5 3 Î¼m the ph and orp meters eutech cyberscan ph 510 taiwan were placed in the 1 l reactor to measure the profiles of ph and orp data solutions of 1 n h2so4 or naoh were added to the solution to adjust adequate ph levels before the reactions the dissolved ozone concentration was obtained by an ozone concentration monitor zezawa oz 301 taiwan the reaction temperature was controlled with a constant temperature water bath tank 2 3 tetracycline degradation and mineralization the uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific genesys 10s usa was used to measure the concentration of tetracycline based on the maximum absorption wavelength of 357 nm 24 prior to the experiments a calibration line with a satisfactory linear regression r2 value of 1 0 was purchased for obtaining the tetracycline concentration during the reactions mineralization of tetracycline was investigated by determining the concentration of total organic carbon toc using a toc analyzer toc 500 shimadzu japan to understand the effect of reaction parameters on the degradation of tetracycline the concentrations of tetracycline were initiated from 50 to 500 mg l other parameters such as ph levels 3 11 temperatures 15 c 55 c and tert butanol dosage 50 400 mg l were also investigated each sample was analyzed for three times and the results shown in figures and tables in this study were the averages 2 4 dissolved ozone concentration prior to the tetracycline degradation experiments by ozonation ozone gas was introduced into the distilled and deionized water di water its resistivity was 16 3 mo cm by two purging processes millibubble and ultrafine bubble ozonation at 25 c with a flow rate of 30 ml min the measured dissolved ozone concentrations are shown in fig 2 the increase in dissolved ozone concentration in the ultrafine bubble mode was faster than in the millibubble mode after a 10 min ozone gas introducing step the maximum dissolved ozone concentrations in ultrafine bubble mode and millibubble mode were 8 3 and 3 5 mg l respectively which indicated that lowering the size of ozone gas bubbles was profitable for increasing the dissolved ozone concentration 2 5 toxicity analysis the steps used for the analysis of the solution toxicity followed an earlier study 24 in all experiments the cells were treated with tetracycline water samples for 24 h before and after oxidation the toxicities of the tetracycline samples before and after treatment were determined based on the rate of the liver cell viability confirmed by cell counting using a blue formazan assay in which colorless 3 4 5 dimethyl thiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide was metabolized to a blue product by mitochondrial dehydrogenases the absorbance at 540 nm was recorded using a spectramax 340 reader the data were expressed as the mean percentages of the viable cells compared with the control 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of gas types and bubble scales in the beginning of the experiments three types of gas air pure oxygen and ozone with two kinds of bubble compressor millibubble and ultrafine bubble were individually introduced into a reactor containing 1 l of di water and the profiles of ph and orp values were monitored during the reaction based on a combination of three types of gas with two kinds of bubble scale there were six experiments that could be performed the flow rates of gas introduction in the six experiments were all 40 ml min the changes of ph values were insignificant with the six combinations of experiments while the ph levels were initiated at ph 6 5 and the final ph values were between 6 3 and 6 6 after 60 min reaction data were not shown however the profiles of orp values in the ozonation experiments including millibubble and ultra fine bubble were different from those in other experiments fig 3 a shows that the initial orp values were approximately 250 mv and rapidly increased to more than 1100 mv after 5 min reaction as the ozone was introduced since the increase of orp values is estimated as the increase in oxidation power or performance 25 introduction of ozone can provide stronger oxidation power than other gases when the air or pure oxygen gas was purging into the reactor for 60 min the final orp values were both approximately 400 mv where the increments were 150 mv only as indicated in fig 3 b because of the higher oxidation power provided by the ozone gas the degradations of tetracycline were all lower than 5 in the air or pure oxygen introduction experiments when the ozone was introduced degradation of tetracycline reached 50 with millibubble ozonation and 95 with ultrafine bubble ozonation after 20 min reaction even though the introduction flow rate of ozone in millibubble and ultrafine bubble ozonation was also 40 ml min the ultrafine bubble ozonation showed better performance in the degradation of tetracycline these results can be first discussed by the effect of dissolved ozone concentration during the reaction fig 3 c shows that the dissolved ozone concentration in millibubble ozonation slightly increased from 0 to 6 5 mg l in the di water test however when the tetracycline solution test was carried out the appearance of dissolved ozone was not detected which indicated that the dissolved ozone was all used in the degradation of tetracycline so that the residual of ozone in solution phase was not detected when the ultrafine bubble compressor was used dissolved ozone concentration significantly increased to approximately 10 mg l within 5 min reaction in the di water test in the tetracycline degradation experiment the dissolved ozone concentration was also zero in the first 20 min and then rapidly increased to 10 mg l the result shown in fig 3 b indicates that the degradation of tetracycline reached 95 at 20 min ultrafine bubble ozonation and then slightly increased to the maximum level 98 7 with a further 40 min reaction based on the results shown in figs 3 b and c introduction of ozone can be terminated after 20 min so that the operational cost can be reduced in addition in millibubble ozonation the degradation of tetracycline gently increased to 87 3 within 60 min reaction which indicated that the introduced ozone may not have been dissolved and consumed for degrading tetracycline therefore because the reduction of ozone gas bubble size can effectively increase the remaining time and concentration of ozone 14 26 it is proved that lowering the ozone gas bubble size is useful to shorten the necessary treatment duration and increase the treatment efficiency in addition increasing the concentration of dissolved ozone in solution is effective on the increase of oh radicals for the oxidation of organic compounds 27 therefore when the ultra fine bubble compressor was carried out in the experiment degradation of tetracycline can be enhanced by the higher dissolved ozone concentration 3 2 effect of ph there are two major oxidation mechanisms direct ozone molecule attack and indirect oh radical attack that take place between the ozone and organic compounds in addition the ph level of the solution affects the formation of oh radicals and decides which is the major oxidation mechanism during ozonation at lower ph levels or in acidic conditions direct ozone molecule attack is the dominant oxidation mechanism and at higher ph levels or in basic condition oh radical attack is the major one 27 28 therefore in this study the ph levels were initialized at 3 11 and the ph effect on the degradation and mineralization of tetracycline was investigated fig 4 a shows the degradation results of tetracycline by ultrafine bubble ozonation where the data indicate that the lower ph level assisted the increase in organic compound degradation 29 30 however the differences between ph 3 and ph 9 were insignificant after 20 min degradation of tetracycline reached more than 95 and all slightly increased to approximately 99 only one curve shown in fig 4 a ph 11 is different from those of other experiments this can be explained by the concentration of dissolved ozone which are shown in fig 4 b and related to the formation of oh radicals during the reaction tetracycline could be easily degraded by indirect ozonation oh produced by ozone and h2o and direct ozonation o3 molecule so that the difference of tetracycline degradation with varying ph levels were insignificant in addition in fig 4 b it is shown that no dissolved ozone could be detected in the first 10 min at ph 3 to ph 9 and then it increased to 6 6 10 9 mg o3 l at the end of reactions at ph 11 the concentration of dissolved ozone was still zero at 20 min reaction and then slightly increased to 1 mg l at 30 min after the further 30 min reaction the dissolved ozone concentration steadily increased to 6 3 mg l this profile corresponds to fig 4 a where the degradation of tetracycline at ph 11 was slower than at other ph levels because of the lower dissolved ozone concentration in the solution however degradation of tetracycline reached its maximum at ph 11 after 30 min reaction so that the accumulation of ozone in solution phase increased fig 5 shows the results of tetracycline degradation toc removal and the change of cell viability as the 50 mg l tetracycline solution was oxidized by ultrafine bubble ozonation the reaction time was 60 min this figure shows that the degradation efficiencies from ph 3 to ph 11 were comparable where the results of tetracycline degradation after 60 min reaction at these five ph levels were all around 99 however removal of toc and change of cell viability were different from tetracycline degradation at ph 11 mineralization of tetracycline presented as toc removal was 32 which was higher than other ph levels in addition toc removal decreased with decreasing ph levels a comparable trend was observed in cell viability before ozonation the cell viability of raw tetracycline water solution was 55 which indicated that 45 of cells were inactivated when the cells were incubated in the tetracycline solution for 24 h in addition to obtain better sensitivity in cell viability the incubated tetracycline solution needed to be ten times dilution otherwise all cells were inactivated as the 50 mg l tetracycline solution was used when the ultrafine bubble ozonation was carried out cell viability increased to 90 at ph 3 and decreased to 76 71 68 and 66 at ph 5 ph 7 ph 9 and ph 11 respectively when the organic compounds were oxidized at lower ph levels ozone molecules could effectively attack the compound and then further oxidize and mineralize the compound to co2 25 27 hence the higher mineralization of tetracycline led to a better reduction of toxicity or increase of cell viability however in this study the maximum toc removal is 32 which indicates that 68 of degraded tetracycline cannot be fully mineralized to co2 and may form the intermediates so that the cell viability cannot reach 100 3 3 effect of tetracycline concentration fig 4 a shows that more than 99 of tetracycline could be degraded within 20 min reaction if the initial tetracycline concentration was 50 mg l only therefore it is interesting to determine how much tetracycline can be degraded when an ultrafine bubble ozonation is carried out in this study four different initial tetracycline concentrations 50 100 200 and 500 mg l were investigated to understand the performance of ultrafine bubble ozonation ozone gas flow rate was 40 ml min table 1 shows the results of tetracycline degradation and mineralization not only the percentage but also the amount so that the real degradation and mineralization can be investigated if the initial tetracycline concentration was 200 mg l and 99 of it could be degraded this revealed that the real degradation amount of tetracycline was 198 1 mg when the tetracycline concentration increased to 500 mg l even the degradation percentage decreased to 90 8 the real removal amount was 454 mg this indicates that continued introduction of the ozone gas into the solution with an ultrafine bubble compressor not only can be used in the treatment of solution with a low initial tetracycline concentration but also in that with a high one this can be explained by fig 6 which shows that the dissolved ozone concentration was detected at 10 min when the initial tetracycline concentration was 50 mg l if the tetracycline concentration increased to 100 and 200 mg l most dissolved ozone was fully used in the early 30 and 40 min respectively so that the dissolved ozone could be first detected after 30 and 40 min reaction for 500 mg l tetracycline solution the dissolved ozone was not detected in the entire 60 min reaction which indicated that the introduced ozone in the solution phase was all used to degrade the tetracycline mineralization of tetracycline showed comparable results increasing the initial tetracycline concentrations decreased the removal efficiency of toc but the real removal amount of toc increased however as the initial tetracycline concentration reached 500 mg l removal of toc was lower than that at 200 mg l in other words even the ultrafine bubble compressor can enhance the solubility of dissolved ozone and extend the resident time of ozone gas bubbles and these fine ozone gas bubbles can degrade organic compounds very soon however fully destroying the structure of the organic compound and transferring it to co2 is not easy and partial mineralization took place 29 31 hence if a higher initial tetracycline concentration needs to be degraded enhancing the ozone dosage or gas flow rate may be useful to achieve it 3 4 effect of temperature because ozone gas is difficult to store in a tank and easy to transfer from solution phase to air phase understanding how to use the dissolved ozone effectively to oxidize the refractory compound or how to increase the solubility and stability of dissolved ozone gas in solution phase is key to enhancing the treatment efficiency by ozonation 30 32 hence controlling the suitable reaction temperature is an important operational parameter during ozonation in this study five reaction temperatures were used to investigate the effect of temperature on the degradation of tetracycline by ultrafine bubble ozonation and the results are shown in fig 7 the degradations of tetracycline after 60 min at five reaction temperatures were comparable the degradation percentages were all greater than 99 in fact to achieve this high treatment performance only a 20 min reaction was needed based on the results shown in fig 4 a therefore it is estimated that the ultrafine bubble ozonation can effectively degrade the tetracycline at varying reaction temperatures so that controlling the temperature may not be necessary however the results of toc removal and change of cell viability show different trends from tetracycline degradation as the reaction temperature increased from 15 c to 55 c toc removal increased from 11 3 36 2 the cell viability simultaneously increased from 62 3 87 5 this indicates that the higher reaction temperatures contributed to increasing the performance in organic molecular structure destruction and then transferring the organic compound to co2 and reducing the toxicity generally increasing the reaction temperature would reduce the solubility of dissolved ozone and the mass transfer of ozone gas between the gas and solution phases therefore lower reaction temperatures are suitable to increase the treatment efficiency 33 34 even if the mass transfer is inhibited by the increase of reaction temperature the reactivity between the organic compound and ozone gas molecules or dissolved ozone could be increased in addition the contribution of reactivity enhancement is greater than the reduction of mass transfer so the treatment efficiency at higher reaction temperatures is better than at lower ones 32 35 an attempt was made to use the integration by time and dissolved ozone concentration to calculate the usage of ozone in the degradation of tetracycline as shown in figs 8 a and b the solid circle in fig 8 shows the data of detected dissolved ozone concentration as the ultrafine bubble ozonation reacted with di water and the empty circle shows the results with tetracycline solution therefore the gray area can be defined as the real ozone usage during the ozonation based on the calculations the gray area in figs 8 a and b were 222 and 228 respectively which can be considered a comparable result that is the real usages of ozone in tetracycline degradation in different reaction temperatures were similar therefore even the dissolved ozone concentrations in warmer conditions are lower than those in cooler ones in fig 7 one can see similar degradation results at all reaction temperatures 3 5 effect of oh radical scavenger the reaction between tert butanol and oh radicals is violent so many researchers have used it as a scavenger of the oh radicals in oxidation tests to understand the effects of direct and indirect oxidation mechanisms 36 38 to investigate the contribution of direct ozone molecule oxidation and indirect oh radical oxidation mechanisms on the degradation of tetracycline four concentrations of tert butanol were added at the beginning of the reaction so that the formation of oh radicals by ozonation could be estimated as completely scavenged fig 9 shows that the degradation of tetracycline at different tert butanol additions was greater than 99 and the cell viability approximately ranged from 66 3 70 5 which indicated that the difference among the four tert butanol additions was insignificant however the toc removal was different from the tetracycline degradation and cell viability as the tetracycline was oxidized without tert butanol addition toc removal reached approximately 20 when the tert butanol was added toc removal decreased to around 7 8 only which indicated that the mineralization of tetracycline was inhibited by the scavenge effect of oh radicals by tert butanol that is the oh radical was the major contributor in this study also this fact can be used to prove why the toc removal is higher in basic condition which is shown in fig 5 based on the above observations it is estimated that the degradation of tetracycline can be easily achieved by the presence of ozone molecules in solution so the effect of tert butanol addition is insignificant to achieve better mineralization of refractory compounds avoiding the presence of oh radical scavengers is useful to enhance the treatment efficiency because the oh radicals play an important role in destroying the molecular structures and transferring them to co2 4 conclusions although antibiotics such as tetracycline are important to humans and animals for preventing disease and enhancing health the problems caused by the chemical and biological characteristics such as the non biodegradable nature and bio resistance of tetracycline is a concern if the concentration and toxicity of tetracycline can be chemically or biologically reduced prior to the discharge of the effluent damage to the environment can be prevented in this study the degradation of tetracycline by ozonation was investigated with different operational parameters and it was found that ultrafine bubble ozonation at a lower ph level and higher reaction temperature exhibits a better oxidation capability and more favorable tetracycline degradation and mineralization than the other combinations the toxicity of water samples also decreases to a greater extent because of the treatment reduction of the ozone bubble size to ultrafine bubbles shows better performance in tetracycline treatment because of the longer bubble residence time in the water the ultrafine bubble ozonation can treat high concentration solution so it may be feasible to use this process in a real wastewater treatment plant also avoiding the presence of oh radical scavengers such as tert butanol is useful for maintaining the high potential of ozonation because the oh radical oxidation mechanism is the key step to mineralize the organic

which can mineralize phenolic compounds in the liquid phase adding dissolved iron into the mixture promotes the classical fenton reaction improving the degradation process low dosages of dissolved iron added to the carbon nitride photocatalytic system can enhance 1 2 times the mineralization of resorcinol phenol gallic acid and benzoic acid phenolic compounds at its natural ph the system is

c3n4 advanced oxidation processes fenton hydrogen peroxide 1 introduction poor water management and quality fomented the establishment of goal 6 among the sustainable development goals adopted by the united nations to ensure clean water and sanitation worldwide 1 water treatment technologies are of increasing importance in this domain particularly in the mediterranean region the olive oil industry generates a large volume of effluents known as olive mill waste waters omww which are rich in organic matter some of the most recalcitrant substances are phenolic compounds which persist in the treated effluents and must endure tertiary treatment some technologies are under study for omww valorisation for instance recovering added value compounds such as antioxidants by using adsorption and membrane technologies among other 2 3 however these valorisation approaches are still under development and some recalcitrant substances which are harmful to the environment and aquatic ecosystems and may affect the food chain and human health 4 can persist in the effluent and the resulting concentrate possible separation technologies are forward osmosis 5 or the combination of different filtrations methods 6 reaction processes that can be employed are advanced oxidation processes such as photocatalysis and the fenton process conceptually based on the generation of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl ho radicals real omww can show total phenolic contents from tens to thousands of mg l 1 7 9 thus our advanced oxidation approach should follow a primary or secondary treatment to effectively bring down the phenolic content of the omww the removal of pollutants via photocatalysis has been thoroughly investigated using metal oxide catalysts such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide 10 14 latterly graphite like polymeric carbon nitride materials commonly referred as g c3n4 and here labelled as gcn exhibited much attention from the scientific community since these materials can be activated with visible light radiation and are produced from earth abundant elements constituting a more sustainable alternative than pre established metal based photocatalysts 15 photoactivated gcn in oxygenated conditions can lead to the evolution of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the presence of a proton donor 16 17 the gcn can also be used for photocatalytic abatement of target pollutants with some papers already reporting the simultaneous formation of h2o2 and ho radicals 18 23 research has shown that gcn can lead to the subsequent reduction of h2o2 to ho radicals mimicking the fenton reaction in the presence of dissolved iron 20 22 24 it is well known that the presence of ferrous ions fe2 can promote the reduction of h2o2 to yield ho radicals in the fenton process the dissolved iron undergoes periodical oxidation to ferric ions fe3 by reacting with h2o2 and reduction back to fe2 is possible with an excess of h2o2 or even accelerated with visible light in the process known as photo fenton 25 26 however despite the efficacy of oxidation there are some critical drawbacks associated to the fenton process namely i the disposal of iron loaded sludge ii the operating ph limitation acidic owing to the solubility of iron which hinders scalability and iii the h2o2 storage transportation and acquisition costs 27 we aim to overcome these limitations in the present study by investigating i low concentrations of iron confined to typical legal values allowed for waste water discharges in europe ii the usage of natural ph and iii the in situ evolution of h2o2 by photocatalysis with gcn in this way we propose the combination of a gcn photocatalytic system capable of in situ h2o2 production at neutral ph with the addition of homogeneous iron to promote the process of pollutant degradation the heterogeneous photocatalytic production of h2o2 and its direct application in a fenton like reaction i e activation of h2o2 to generate ho radicals was already reported in the literature using several photo and electro catalysts for the degradation of pollutants however these studies dealt with either metal oxide materials in the presence of dissolved iron 28 30 or with heterogeneous iron containing composites 31 34 to overcome typical issues associated with metal based catalysts metal free carbon materials such as gcn have been thoroughly studied for pollutant degradation 35 36 and are emerging as efficient photocatalysts for h2o2 formation 37 recent work has been published concerning the use of metal free gcn for photo fenton degradation of an organic dye with in situ formation of h2o2 38 however to the best of the authors knowledge no other publication mentions the simultaneous in situ photocatalytic h2o2 production using gcn and its direct transformation to ho using fe ii for degradation of pollutants under natural ph this work will offer new insights into the remarkable applicability of gcn for water remediation technologies by the combination of two advanced oxidation processes gcn photocatalysis and fenton reactions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals dicyandiamide c2h4n4 99 phenol c6h5oh 99 titanium iv oxysulphate tio5s

characterisation carbon nitride was synthesised by thermal decomposition of dicyandiamide according to a previously reported procedure 39 as follows the precursor was placed in a muffle furnace inside a semi closed crucible under static air at 550 c the resulting powder bulk gcn was grounded washed filtered and dried at 100 c then gcn was spread in open crucibles in a muffle furnace the temperature was raised at 500 c and maintained for 2 h originating a partially exfoliated material referred as gcn t our group has thoroughly characterised gcn and gcn t by different techniques and previously shown that the thermal exfoliation allowed for 22 times higher specific surface area and greater photocatalytic efficiency for the selective synthesis of highadded value compounds and the degradation of aromatic compounds without dissolved iron in solution 39 41 from the n2 adsorption isotherms experimentally obtained at 196 c in a quantachrome nova 4200e apparatus we calculated the specific surface area s bet by the brunauer emmett teller method in the 0 05 to 0 2 relative pressure range the s bet values of the gcn t material revealed a marked increase with the exfoliation treatment compared to gcn 87 and 4 m2 g 1 respectively for the optical characterisation of the gcn t material we used ultraviolet visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in a jasco v 560 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment jasco isv 469 the resulting spectrum in equivalent to absorption kubelka munk units fig si1a was used to construct the respective tauc plot fig si1b from which we calculated the indirect optical band gap energy to be 2 73 ev 2 3 pollutant oxidation reactions a glass reactor with a maximum capacity of 80 ml was employed for the degradation reactions gcn t was the material used for all heterogeneous photocatalytic experiments the reactions occurred under magnetic stirring with or without incidence of visible light the radiation source consisted on four 10 w leds located symmetrically at 4 0 cm from the reactor wall with a maximum emission at 417 nm fig si2 and an average irradiance of ca 450 w m 2 each determined by using an oceanoptics usb2000 uv vis spectrometer the reactions were performed under continuous air saturation with 15 min of air bubbling done in dark conditions to achieve adsorption desorption equilibrium a simplified scheme of the experimental setup is given in fig si3 the apparent first order reaction rate constants k app were obtained by fitting an exponential decay model based on the langmuir hinshelwood mechanism to the normalized concentration of the aromatics as a function of the reaction time 12 42 aqueous solutions were prepared to contain selected concentrations of certain pollutants individually or in mixtures the initial concentration of these molecules both individually and in the mixture was set at 0 640 mmol l 1 e g 71 7 mg l 1 of resorcinol different operating conditions were investigated the presence of light the presence of dispersed gcn t the addition of ferrous ion the variation of initial ph by adding hcl and the initial concentration of h2o2 the gcn t load was kept at 1 00 g l 1 since it was found to be the optimal amount for higher mineralization rates when employing this material for the degradation of aromatic compounds 40 2 4 analytical techniques samples were periodically withdrawn

visible spectroscopy in a jasco v 560 spectrophotometer phenol Î» max 270 nm resorcinol Î» max 272 nm gallic acid Î» max 264 nm and benzoic acid Î» max 270 nm an important aspect to consider is the typical use of na2so3 to stop h2o2 activation especially when the iron is present it was observed that some compounds were immensely affected by the presence of na2so3 in solution with their quantification in hplc being suppressed the bucherer reaction occurs by complexation of the phenolics with na2so3 43 to avoid the analytical interference catalase was added as h2o2 quencher instead of na2so3 44 therefore all retrieved samples from h2o2 assisted fenton reactions for hplc analysis were mixed with excess catalase to decompose h2o2 and stop the reaction without interfering in the analysis 44 the mineralization was followed by determination of the total organic carbon toc content using a shimadzu toc 5000a apparatus after filtration i e toc corresponding to dissolved organic content in this case and addition of an excess of na2so3 2 mg in order to decompose some remained h2o2 for each sample toc values were obtained through the difference between the total carbon and inorganic carbon contents total carbon was determined by heat combustion of the sample that releases carbon dioxide which is quantified in a non dispersive infrared gas analyser inorganic carbon such as dissolved carbon dioxide carbonic acid carbonates and bicarbonates was acidified with phosphoric acid to release carbon dioxide to be quantified in the gas analyser the colourimetric method was used for the determination of the amount of h2o2 produced during the photocatalytic reactions 45 briefly 300 Î¼l of the filtered sample 300 Î¼l of 0 5 m h2so4 and 10 Î¼l of titanium iv oxysulphate were mixed in a polystyrene cuvette and the absorbance read at a wavelength of 405 nm by an oceanoptics usb2000 uv vis spectrometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 photodegradation of resorcinol phenol ph typically used as a probe molecule has been thoroughly employed in photodegradation studies however resorcinol rc is much more reactive than ph and yields a higher h2o2 production rate during its photocatalytic oxidation with gcn t 40 since the focus of this study is on the use of the evolved h2o2 as a source of hydroxyl radicals we selected rc for the initial photodegradation studies always under air saturation since under an argon atmosphere the photocatalytic degradation is negligible fig si4 we employed a rc aqueous solution to evaluate the ph interference in both the heterogeneous photocatalytic rc oxidation and h2o2 production rates fig 1 a and b respectively two sets of ph were tested i naturally occurring ph starting at approximately 6 1 control photocatalysis and ii a forced acidic ph with an initial value of 2 8 the 2 8 ph value was chosen since it is well known that the classical fenton process best performs in acidic media 46 photolysis at natural ph fig si4 revealed that the concentration of rc never decreased more than 10 0 under these conditions k 42 5 10 5 min 1 in the presence of the photoactivated gcn t catalyst there is a much faster and pronounced degradation k app 0 032 0 002 min 1 with complete removal of rc reached after 90 min of irradiation fig 1 a moreover in the presence of this catalyst but under dark conditions the concentration of rc remained unaltered indicating that the removal of rc does not occur by adsorption on the catalyst surface fig si4 the photocatalytic mechanism of degradative oxidation of rc results from the action of reactive oxygen species and holes generated by the photocatalyst the generation of o2 radicals occurs via one electron reduction and h2o2 is formed by a two electron reduction pathway as shown in eqs 1 and 2 respectively 16 h2o2 can be further reduced to ho radicals according to eq 3 20 22 24 1 o2 e o2 2 o2 2 e 2 h h2o2 3 h2o2 e ho ho in an acidic environment ph0 2 8 the reaction decelerates probably owing to the excess of protons available in the solution which caused the surface of gcn t to be more positively charged phpzc 6 0 coincidently rc shows a pk a value of 9 2 47 and therefore at low ph is mostly in its protonated state reducing the interaction with the catalyst i e lower adsorption since heterogeneous photocatalysis depends on the adsorption of molecules in the catalyst surface 48 this degradation reaction hinders when the solution is very acidic in the absence of organic substrate h is the main ho scavenger species 49 50 and therefore in this case the excess of h ions can also present a quenching effect on ho radicals eq 4 hindering the degradation process 4 h ho e h2o the h2o2 production is seemingly unaltered by raising the initial ph fig 1 b within the acidic range however a slightly higher concentration occurs at ph 2 8 ca 2 2 mmol l 1 probably owing to the greater availability of h the concentration of h2o2 increases while there is sufficient rc in solution and starts decreasing when there is no rc which acts as a proton donor the consumption of h2o2 is owed to the decomposition into ho radicals following eq 3 these radicals together with other oxidative species e g superoxide and photogenerated holes attack the contaminant molecules initial aromatic and aliphatic intermediates promoting mineralization quantified in terms of toc content the mineralization was very similar in both neutral and acidic ph 64 decrease of the toc content furthermore the variation of ph was followed over the reaction time fig si5 for an initial ph 6 1 the value went down to 4 0 after 120 min and for an initial ph 2 8 it slightly reduced to 2 6 this decrease in ph owns to the acidic nature of the intermediates generated during the reaction such as low molecular weight aliphatic acids like maleic and oxalic acids 40 51 3 2 effect of fe ii addition as rc is consumed h2o2 is simultaneously generated and it fuels the self assisted fenton reaction to test the combination of gcn t heterogeneous photocatalysis with the fenton reaction we investigated the effect of the addition of a ferrous ion to the solution fig 2 besides the common photocatalysis pathway described above dissolved iron will expectedly promote a more significant formation of ho radicals by the reaction between initial fe2 ions with h2o2 eq 5 resulting in fe3 species the latter can be reduced back to fe2 by the remaining h2o2 eq 6 and under visible light irradiation eq 7 25 26 5 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho ho 6 fe3 h2o2 fe2 h ho2 7 f e 3 h o hv f e 2 h o by employing similar photocatalytic experimental conditions the degradation of rc was studied at both natural and forced acidic ph and in the presence or absence of initially added fe2 the concentration range of the fe2 species was selected according to the portuguese legislation for discharged treated waters highest permitted being 2 0 mg l 1 52 the concentration of rc was followed over time and the apparent rate constants k app obtained are shown in fig 2 a and listed in table si1 the simultaneous evolution of h2o2 was not quantified when iron was present due to its colourimetric interference in general faster degradation rates are obtained under natural ph in comparison to those at acidic conditions fig 2 a which may be considered an advantage since no acidification is needed for the reactions under natural ph conditions low concentrations of iron resulted in a decrease of the k app in comparison with the system without dissolved iron suggesting that fe3 ions resulting from fe2 may absorb visible light and hinder the photoactivation of the heterogeneous photocatalyst 53 or that fe2 and fe3 could act as electron acceptors towards gcn t 54 moreover fe3 is very labile in the presence of water molecules leading to the ferric hydroxide complex that may interfere with the iron redox cycle eq 8 55 at either ph 2 8 or 6 1 continually increase in the iron load leads to a faster degradation peaking at 1 0 ppm over the maximum at 2 0 ppm iron load a deceleration of the reaction occurs because the excess of fe2 leads to the unwanted trapping of ho radicals according to eq 9 49 50 56 8 fe3 ho fe oh 3 9 fe2 ho fe3 ho the degree of mineralization can be expressed in terms of toc removal fig 2 b the increase of iron load leads to augmented mineralization until the maximum toc removal at 1 0 ppm the difference between the toc content obtained in fenton assisted and non assisted photocatalysis 83 vs 64 demonstrates the benefit of adding fe2 in this gcn t system with in situ evolved h2o2 3 3 degradation of a mixture of phenolic compounds four representative phenolic compounds were selected to evaluate the performance of fenton assisted photocatalysis the selection relied upon the knowledge that along with resorcinol rc and phenol ph gallic acid ga could lead to high h2o2 productivity during its photocatalytic degradative oxidation in the presence of gcn t 40 benzoic acid ba was also selected because of its refractive nature towards the photocatalytic treatment 40 using the mixture of four phenolic compounds increases the complexity of the matrix and better simulates real wastewater each compound s concentration was 0 160 mmol l 1 which represents a fourth of the total mixture molarity of 0 640 mmol l 1 i e the total concentration of compounds in the mixture is equal to the individual solution of rc the concentration value was kept constant to assess any synergy between molecules that might occur during oxidation control experiments either dark adsorption or photolysis led to less than 10 0 mineralization measured up to 120 min fig si4 shows these results for the experiments with rc then as described in the previous sections the photocatalytic degradative oxidation of the aqueous solution containing the mixture took place at natural and acidified ph with or without the addition of 1 0 ppm of fe2 comparing the toc removals at both initial ph and after 120 min fig si6 no meaningful differences were observed it is worth mention that similarly to the rc degradation faster mineralization of the compounds in the mixture occurs in the presence of dissolved iron another critical parameter in the fenton reaction is h2o2 concentration the system in study employs gcn t as the photocatalyst for h2o2 production however no h2o2 is present at the beginning of the experiments as h2o2 is formed simultaneously with the degradation of the pollutants which act as proton donors during the photocatalytic degradation of the pollutants in the mixture it was difficult to quantify the h2o2 production since there are intermediate products that present colour and interfere with the colourimetric method for h2o2 detection 57 for comparison purposes we performed a set of experiments by adding h2o2 at two initial concentrations 1 25 and 2 50 mmol l 1 comparable to maxima values obtained with rc fig 1 b the toc removal after 120 min increased with the initial h2o2 concentration fig si7 demonstrating the beneficial impact of h2o2 in the oxidation of the pollutant molecules from 1 25 2 50 mmol l 1 in both the presence and absence of dissolved iron there was an increase of 12 in toc removal because the purpose of this work is to take advantage of the in situ generated h2o2 rather than adding it the maximum concentration was limited to 2 50 mmol l 1 furthermore the annihilation of ho radicals by recombination equations 10 11 is likely to occur in the presence of high concentrations of h2o2 26 thus we decided for an initial h2o2 concentration of 2 50 mmol l 1 maintained through the subsequent experiments when this oxidizing agent was added for comparison purposes 10 h2o2 ho ho2 h2o 11 ho2 ho h2o o2 a comparative study was undertaken using six reaction systems table 1 differing in the application of radiation vis photocatalyst cn iron fe ii and h2o2 the performance of the system is assessed in terms of the percentage of removal after 30 min fig 3 a the degradation was followed over time in terms of the evolution of normalized equivalent total carbon etc content fig 3 b the etc was calculated by the parent compounds stoichiometric amount of carbon input to the system according to their molecular formula and molar mass finally the mineralization was assessed in terms of toc removal at the end of 120 min reaction fig 3 c under dark conditions the fenton reaction fe ii h2o2 resulted only in 12 8 mineralization after 120 min fig 3 c the application of visible light photo fenton improved the degradation suggesting that the redox cycle of iron is accelerated i e eq 7 and subsequently eq 5 both yielding ho radicals this photo fenton approach leads to enhanced removal of each parent pollutant fig 3 a and a higher toc removal of 30 1 fig 3 c more than two times than the fenton route the heterogeneous photocatalytic route using gcn t vis cn shows itself as a much better alternative to fenton or photo fenton processes fig 3 a owing to much faster depletion of the carbon content due to the parent compounds fig 3 b and the remarkable mineralization of 70 8 of toc removal fig 3 c the h2o2 assisted photocatalysis vis cn h2o2 yields slightly better results in terms of mineralization 78 6 of toc removal fig 3 c but similar results in terms of the degradation of the parent pollutants fig 3 a and b in comparison with heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation vis cn in photocatalysis with gcn t the formation of h2o2 ceases when the proton source becomes scarce i e when the aromatics concentration is shallow when h2o2 is initially added the depletion on the concentration of the aromatics may be similar but the mineralization rates are ultimately increased this may reflect the saturation of the catalyst since and the fact that there is no induction period to the formation of h2o2 when iron is loaded into the system in the absence of added h2o2 vis cn fe ii but in the presence of the photocatalyst a much faster degradation is observed fig 3 b the molecules removal and mineralization increases compared to heterogeneous photocatalysis vis cn presumably due to the combination with the fenton route to generate ho radicals interestingly the most recalcitrant compound ba was more easily removed in the presence of dissolved iron and comparing all experiments in fig 3 a the degradation of ba was always lower when fe ii was not present in the system lastly the toc removal after 120 min slightly increased from 85 4 vis cn fe ii to 88 8 when h2o2 was added vis cn fe ii h2o2 as shown in fig 3 c and together with the other set of results fig 3 a and b it seems that the addition of surplus h2o2 may not be justifiable in short heterogeneous photocatalysis with gcn t performs more efficiently than both fenton and photo fenton processes exception made for ba suggesting that this compound is a weak proton donor the addition of iron to the heterogeneous photocatalytic system i e vis cn fe ii enhances the mineralization and no additional h2o2 is necessary 3 4 reactive species in oxidation process it is interesting to notice that in anoxic conditions argon saturation the formation of h2o2 is inhibited owing to the lack of dissolved oxygen molecular oxygen reduction is the sole source of h2o2 as gcn t does not thermodynamically favour water oxidation therefore the impact of h can be observed under argon saturation 70 rc removal after 120 min not shown and has already been reported to be essential for the oxidation process with this photocatalyst 40 to probe the oxidative channels of the reaction we used ph since it is widely employed in degradation studies and the different mechanisms of its degradative oxidation are extensively reported in the literature mainly using metal oxide photocatalysts 58 60 surprisingly the addition of hole or ho scavengers leads to an increase in the rate of phenol removal these results suggest that protons resulting from the oxidation of the scavenging molecules may also contribute to further h2o2 generation for instance isopropyl alcohol is used for ho scavenging 61 and at the same time is employed as a sacrificial agent for photocatalytic h2o2 production 62 in the presence of gcn t and isopropyl alcohol an incredibly higher concentration of evolved h2o2 was already reported 40 other molecules archetypal of ho quenching experiments were investigated such as coumarin and terephthalic acid 63 and the degradation of phenol was accelerated due to this same effect examples in the supplemental information fig si8 the iron role in assisting the photocatalytic oxidation and the pathway for generation of the ho radicals is established in the following experiments we confirmed that visible light alone does not decompose h2o2 while its concentration only decreases in the presence of either photoactivated gcn t or fe ii fig si9a the homogeneous reaction with iron and h2o2 under irradiation corresponds to the well known photo fenton system with the production of ho radicals in the case of carbon nitride the mechanism is necessarily different with the decrease in the h2o2 concentration resulting from the conversion in ho or decomposition into h2o the degradation of ph was tested using gcn t with and without initially added h2o2 fig si9b the photocatalytic removal of ph with simultaneous h2o2 generation is slower when h2o2 is not initially present in the system suggesting that h2o2 is transformed into ho radicals the redox potentials shown in fig 4 of the o2 h2o2 o2 o2 and h2o2 ho reduction semireactions are respectively 0 33 0 28 and 0 38 v vs she at ph 7 64 the band levels of gcn t were calculated in our previous work and defined as 1 22 and 1 76 ev for the conduction cb and valence vb bands respectively 40 therefore the previous reactions are prone to occur on gcn t the effect that dissolved iron has on this system also proves the importance of ho so allied with the fenton promoted reactions we propose the pathway depicted in fig 4 that demonstrates the thermodynamically favourable redox reactions that follow during gcn t photocatalysis in the presence of homogeneous iron 4 conclusions the integration of new technological solutions requires versatile materials in this work a reasonably known and easy to obtain carbon nitride based material designated as gcn t photocatalytically produces h2o2 simultaneously to the degradation of phenolic compounds this combination enables to envisage a more self sustained water treatment solution the need for only relatively low iron concentrations 0 2 2 0 mg l 1 brought the typical photo fenton reaction to a new level of requirements and performances an observed increase in toc removal makes the process 20 more efficient than the photo assisted fenton heterogeneous process alone in all the described photocatalytic system can productively generate reactive oxygen species mainly ho using visible light emitting diodes leds low dosages of iron under natural ph and in situ generation of h2o2 to mineralize a mixture of aromatic hazardous substances a system of this typecould mitigate the environmental burdens associated with the production transportation storage and usage of i other artificial non economic light sources ii consumptions of high volumes of h2o2 the oxidizing agent in the photo fenton

the fenton reaction in the presence of dissolved iron 20 22 24 it is well known that the presence of ferrous ions fe2 can promote the reduction of h2o2 to yield ho radicals in the fenton process the dissolved iron undergoes periodical oxidation to ferric ions fe3 by reacting with h2o2 and reduction back to fe2 is possible with an excess of h2o2 or even accelerated with visible light in the process known as photo fenton 25 26 however despite the efficacy of oxidation there are some critical drawbacks associated to the fenton process namely i the disposal of iron loaded sludge ii the

organic dye with in situ formation of h2o2 38 however to the best of the authors knowledge no other publication mentions the simultaneous in situ photocatalytic h2o2 production using gcn and its direct transformation to ho using fe ii for degradation of pollutants under natural ph this work will offer new insights into the remarkable applicability of gcn for water remediation technologies by the combination of two advanced oxidation processes gcn photocatalysis and fenton reactions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals dicyandiamide c2h4n4 99 phenol c6h5oh 99 titanium iv oxysulphate tio5s

characterisation carbon nitride was synthesised by thermal decomposition of dicyandiamide according to a previously reported procedure 39 as follows the precursor was placed in a muffle furnace inside a semi closed crucible under static air at 550 c the resulting powder bulk gcn was grounded washed filtered and dried at 100 c then gcn was spread in open crucibles in a muffle furnace the temperature was raised at 500 c and maintained for 2 h originating a partially exfoliated material referred as gcn t our group has thoroughly characterised gcn and gcn t by different techniques and previously shown that the thermal exfoliation allowed for 22 times higher specific surface area and greater photocatalytic efficiency for the selective synthesis of highadded value compounds and the degradation of aromatic compounds without dissolved iron in solution 39 41 from the n2 adsorption isotherms experimentally obtained at 196 c in a quantachrome nova 4200e apparatus we calculated the specific surface area s bet by the brunauer emmett teller method in the 0 05 to 0 2 relative pressure range the s bet values of the gcn t material revealed a marked increase with the exfoliation treatment compared to gcn 87 and 4 m2 g 1 respectively for the optical characterisation of the gcn t material we used ultraviolet visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in a jasco v 560 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment jasco isv 469 the resulting spectrum in equivalent to absorption kubelka munk units fig si1a was used to construct the respective tauc plot fig si1b from which we calculated the indirect optical band gap energy to be 2 73 ev 2 3 pollutant oxidation reactions a glass reactor with a maximum capacity of 80 ml was employed for the degradation reactions gcn t was the material used for all heterogeneous photocatalytic experiments the reactions occurred under magnetic stirring with or without incidence of visible light the radiation source consisted on four 10 w leds located symmetrically at 4 0 cm from the reactor wall with a maximum emission at 417 nm fig si2 and an average irradiance of ca 450 w m 2 each determined by using an oceanoptics usb2000 uv vis spectrometer the reactions were performed under continuous air saturation with 15 min of air bubbling done in dark conditions to achieve adsorption desorption equilibrium a simplified scheme of the experimental setup is given in fig si3 the apparent first order reaction rate constants k app were obtained by fitting an exponential decay model based on the langmuir hinshelwood mechanism to the normalized concentration of the aromatics as a function of the reaction time 12 42 aqueous solutions were prepared to contain selected concentrations of certain pollutants individually or in mixtures the initial concentration of these molecules both individually and in the mixture was set at 0 640 mmol l 1 e g 71 7 mg l 1 of resorcinol different operating conditions were investigated the presence of light the presence of dispersed gcn t the addition of ferrous ion the variation of initial ph by adding hcl and the initial concentration of h2o2 the gcn t load was kept at 1 00 g l 1 since it was found to be the optimal amount for higher mineralization rates when employing this material for the degradation of aromatic compounds 40 2 4 analytical techniques samples were periodically withdrawn

visible spectroscopy in a jasco v 560 spectrophotometer phenol Î» max 270 nm resorcinol Î» max 272 nm gallic acid Î» max 264 nm and benzoic acid Î» max 270 nm an important aspect to consider is the typical use of na2so3 to stop h2o2 activation especially when the iron is present it was observed that some compounds were immensely affected by the presence of na2so3 in solution with their quantification in hplc being suppressed the bucherer reaction occurs by complexation of the phenolics with na2so3 43 to avoid the analytical interference catalase was added as h2o2 quencher instead of na2so3 44 therefore all retrieved samples from h2o2 assisted fenton reactions for hplc analysis were mixed with excess catalase to decompose h2o2 and stop the reaction without interfering in the analysis 44 the mineralization was followed by determination of the total organic carbon toc content using a shimadzu toc 5000a apparatus after filtration i e toc corresponding to dissolved organic content in this case and addition of an excess of na2so3 2 mg in order to decompose some remained h2o2 for each sample toc values were obtained through the difference between the total carbon and inorganic carbon contents total carbon was determined by heat combustion of the sample that releases carbon dioxide which is quantified in a non dispersive infrared gas analyser inorganic carbon such as dissolved carbon dioxide carbonic acid carbonates and bicarbonates was acidified with phosphoric acid to release carbon dioxide to be quantified in the gas analyser the colourimetric method was used for the determination of the amount of h2o2 produced during the photocatalytic reactions 45 briefly 300 Î¼l of the filtered sample 300 Î¼l of 0 5 m h2so4 and 10 Î¼l of titanium iv oxysulphate were mixed in a polystyrene cuvette and the absorbance read at a wavelength of 405 nm by an oceanoptics usb2000 uv vis spectrometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 photodegradation of resorcinol phenol ph typically used as a probe molecule has been thoroughly employed in photodegradation studies however resorcinol rc is much more reactive than ph and yields a higher h2o2 production rate during its photocatalytic oxidation with gcn t 40 since the focus of this study is on the use of the evolved h2o2 as a source of hydroxyl radicals we selected rc for the initial photodegradation studies always under air saturation since under an argon atmosphere the photocatalytic degradation is negligible fig si4 we employed a rc aqueous solution to evaluate the ph interference in both the heterogeneous photocatalytic rc oxidation and h2o2 production rates fig 1 a and b respectively two sets of ph were tested i naturally occurring ph starting at approximately 6 1 control photocatalysis and ii a forced acidic ph with an initial value of 2 8 the 2 8 ph value was chosen since it is well known that the classical fenton process best performs in acidic media 46 photolysis at natural ph fig si4 revealed that the concentration of rc never decreased more than 10 0 under these conditions k 42 5 10 5 min 1 in the presence of the photoactivated gcn t catalyst there is a much faster and pronounced degradation k app 0 032 0 002 min 1 with complete removal of rc reached after 90 min of irradiation fig 1 a moreover in the presence of this catalyst but under dark conditions the concentration of rc remained unaltered indicating that the removal of rc does not occur by adsorption on the catalyst surface fig si4 the photocatalytic mechanism of degradative oxidation of rc results from the action of reactive oxygen species and holes generated by the photocatalyst the generation of o2 radicals occurs via one electron reduction and h2o2 is formed by a two electron reduction pathway as shown in eqs 1 and 2 respectively 16 h2o2 can be further reduced to ho radicals according to eq 3 20 22 24 1 o2 e o2 2 o2 2 e 2 h h2o2 3 h2o2 e ho ho in an acidic environment ph0 2 8 the reaction decelerates probably owing to the excess of protons available in the solution which caused the surface of gcn t to be more positively charged phpzc 6 0 coincidently rc shows a pk a value of 9 2 47 and therefore at low ph is mostly in its protonated state reducing the interaction with the catalyst i e lower adsorption since heterogeneous photocatalysis depends on the adsorption of molecules in the catalyst surface 48 this degradation reaction hinders when the solution is very acidic in the absence of organic substrate h is the main ho scavenger species 49 50 and therefore in this case the excess of h ions can also present a quenching effect on ho radicals eq 4 hindering the degradation process 4 h ho e h2o the h2o2 production is seemingly unaltered by raising the initial ph fig 1 b within the acidic range however a slightly higher concentration occurs at ph 2 8 ca 2 2 mmol l 1 probably owing to the greater availability of h the concentration of h2o2 increases while there is sufficient rc in solution and starts decreasing when there is no rc which acts as a proton donor the consumption of h2o2 is owed to the decomposition into ho radicals following eq 3 these radicals together with other oxidative species e g superoxide and photogenerated holes attack the contaminant molecules initial aromatic and aliphatic intermediates promoting mineralization quantified in terms of toc content the mineralization was very similar in both neutral and acidic ph 64 decrease of the toc content furthermore the variation of ph was followed over the reaction time fig si5 for an initial ph 6 1 the value went down to 4 0 after 120 min and for an initial ph 2 8 it slightly reduced to 2 6 this decrease in ph owns to the acidic nature of the intermediates generated during the reaction such as low molecular weight aliphatic acids like maleic and oxalic acids 40 51 3 2 effect of fe ii addition as rc is consumed h2o2 is simultaneously generated and it fuels the self assisted fenton reaction to test the combination of gcn t heterogeneous photocatalysis with the fenton reaction we investigated the effect of the addition of a ferrous ion to the solution fig 2 besides the common photocatalysis pathway described above dissolved iron will expectedly promote a more significant formation of ho radicals by the reaction between initial fe2 ions with h2o2 eq 5 resulting in fe3 species the latter can be reduced back to fe2 by the remaining h2o2 eq 6 and under visible light irradiation eq 7 25 26 5 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho ho 6 fe3 h2o2 fe2 h ho2 7 f e 3 h o hv f e 2 h o by employing similar photocatalytic experimental conditions the degradation of rc was studied at both natural and forced acidic ph and in the presence or absence of initially added fe2 the concentration range of the fe2 species was selected according to the portuguese legislation for discharged treated waters highest permitted being 2 0 mg l 1 52 the concentration of rc was followed over time and the apparent rate constants k app obtained are shown in fig 2 a and listed in table si1 the simultaneous evolution of h2o2 was not quantified when iron was present due to its colourimetric interference in general faster degradation rates are obtained under natural ph in comparison to those at acidic conditions fig 2 a which may be considered an advantage since no acidification is needed for the reactions under natural ph conditions low concentrations of iron resulted in a decrease of the k app in comparison with the system without dissolved iron suggesting that fe3 ions resulting from fe2 may absorb visible light and hinder the photoactivation of the heterogeneous photocatalyst 53 or that fe2 and fe3 could act as electron acceptors towards gcn t 54 moreover fe3 is very labile in the presence of water molecules leading to the ferric hydroxide complex that may interfere with the iron redox cycle eq 8 55 at either ph 2 8 or 6 1 continually increase in the iron load leads to a faster degradation peaking at 1 0 ppm over the maximum at 2 0 ppm iron load a deceleration of the reaction occurs because the excess of fe2 leads to the unwanted trapping of ho radicals according to eq 9 49 50 56 8 fe3 ho fe oh 3 9 fe2 ho fe3 ho the degree of mineralization can be expressed in terms of toc removal fig 2 b the increase of iron load leads to augmented mineralization until the maximum toc removal at 1 0 ppm the difference between the toc content obtained in fenton assisted and non assisted photocatalysis 83 vs 64 demonstrates the benefit of adding fe2 in this gcn t system with in situ evolved h2o2 3 3 degradation of a mixture of phenolic compounds four representative phenolic compounds were selected to evaluate the performance of fenton assisted photocatalysis the selection relied upon the knowledge that along with resorcinol rc and phenol ph gallic acid ga could lead to high h2o2 productivity during its photocatalytic degradative oxidation in the presence of gcn t 40 benzoic acid ba was also selected because of its refractive nature towards the photocatalytic treatment 40 using the mixture of four phenolic compounds increases the complexity of the matrix and better simulates real wastewater each compound s concentration was 0 160 mmol l 1 which represents a fourth of the total mixture molarity of 0 640 mmol l 1 i e the total concentration of compounds in the mixture is equal to the individual solution of rc the concentration value was kept constant to assess any synergy between molecules that might occur during oxidation control experiments either dark adsorption or photolysis led to less than 10 0 mineralization measured up to 120 min fig si4 shows these results for the experiments with rc then as described in the previous sections the photocatalytic degradative oxidation of the aqueous solution containing the mixture took place at natural and acidified ph with or without the addition of 1 0 ppm of fe2 comparing the toc removals at both initial ph and after 120 min fig si6 no meaningful differences were observed it is worth mention that similarly to the rc degradation faster mineralization of the compounds in the mixture occurs in the presence of dissolved iron another critical parameter in the fenton reaction is h2o2 concentration the system in study employs gcn t as the photocatalyst for h2o2 production however no h2o2 is present at the beginning of the experiments as h2o2 is formed simultaneously with the degradation of the pollutants which act as proton donors during the photocatalytic degradation of the pollutants in the mixture it was difficult to quantify the h2o2 production since there are intermediate products that present colour and interfere with the colourimetric method for h2o2 detection 57 for comparison purposes we performed a set of experiments by adding h2o2 at two initial concentrations 1 25 and 2 50 mmol l 1 comparable to maxima values obtained with rc fig 1 b the toc removal after 120 min increased with the initial h2o2 concentration fig si7 demonstrating the beneficial impact of h2o2 in the oxidation of the pollutant molecules from 1 25 2 50 mmol l 1 in both the presence and absence of dissolved iron there was an increase of 12 in toc removal because the purpose of this work is to take advantage of the in situ generated h2o2 rather than adding it the maximum concentration was limited to 2 50 mmol l 1 furthermore the annihilation of ho radicals by recombination equations 10 11 is likely to occur in the presence of high concentrations of h2o2 26 thus we decided for an initial h2o2 concentration of 2 50 mmol l 1 maintained through the subsequent experiments when this oxidizing agent was added for comparison purposes 10 h2o2 ho ho2 h2o 11 ho2 ho h2o o2 a comparative study was undertaken using six reaction systems table 1 differing in the application of radiation vis photocatalyst cn iron fe ii and h2o2 the performance of the system is assessed in terms of the percentage of removal after 30 min fig 3 a the degradation was followed over time in terms of the evolution of normalized equivalent total carbon etc content fig 3 b the etc was calculated by the parent compounds stoichiometric amount of carbon input to the system according to their molecular formula and molar mass finally the mineralization was assessed in terms of toc removal at the end of 120 min reaction fig 3 c under dark conditions the fenton reaction fe ii h2o2 resulted only in 12 8 mineralization after 120 min fig 3 c the application of visible light photo fenton improved the degradation suggesting that the redox cycle of iron is accelerated i e eq 7 and subsequently eq 5 both yielding ho radicals this photo fenton approach leads to enhanced removal of each parent pollutant fig 3 a and a higher toc removal of 30 1 fig 3 c more than two times than the fenton route the heterogeneous photocatalytic route using gcn t vis cn shows itself as a much better alternative to fenton or photo fenton processes fig 3 a owing to much faster depletion of the carbon content due to the parent compounds fig 3 b and the remarkable mineralization of 70 8 of toc removal fig 3 c the h2o2 assisted photocatalysis vis cn h2o2 yields slightly better results in terms of mineralization 78 6 of toc removal fig 3 c but similar results in terms of the degradation of the parent pollutants fig 3 a and b in comparison with heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation vis cn in photocatalysis with gcn t the formation of h2o2 ceases when the proton source becomes scarce i e when the aromatics concentration is shallow when h2o2 is initially added the depletion on the concentration of the aromatics may be similar but the mineralization rates are ultimately increased this may reflect the saturation of the catalyst since and the fact that there is no induction period to the formation of h2o2 when iron is loaded into the system in the absence of added h2o2 vis cn fe ii but in the presence of the photocatalyst a much faster degradation is observed fig 3 b the molecules removal and mineralization increases compared to heterogeneous photocatalysis vis cn presumably due to the combination with the fenton route to generate ho radicals interestingly the most recalcitrant compound ba was more easily removed in the presence of dissolved iron and comparing all experiments in fig 3 a the degradation of ba was always lower when fe ii was not present in the system lastly the toc removal after 120 min slightly increased from 85 4 vis cn fe ii to 88 8 when h2o2 was added vis cn fe ii h2o2 as shown in fig 3 c and together with the other set of results fig 3 a and b it seems that the addition of surplus h2o2 may not be justifiable in short heterogeneous photocatalysis with gcn t performs more efficiently than both fenton and photo fenton processes exception made for ba suggesting that this compound is a weak proton donor the addition of iron to the heterogeneous photocatalytic system i e vis cn fe ii enhances the mineralization and no additional h2o2 is necessary 3 4 reactive species in oxidation process it is interesting to notice that in anoxic conditions argon saturation the formation of h2o2 is inhibited owing to the lack of dissolved oxygen molecular oxygen reduction is the sole source of h2o2 as gcn t does not thermodynamically favour water oxidation therefore the impact of h can be observed under argon saturation 70 rc removal after 120 min not shown and has already been reported to be essential for the oxidation process with this photocatalyst 40 to probe the oxidative channels of the reaction we used ph since it is widely employed in degradation studies and the different mechanisms of its degradative oxidation are extensively reported in the literature mainly using metal oxide photocatalysts 58 60 surprisingly the addition of hole or ho scavengers leads to an increase in the rate of phenol removal these results suggest that protons resulting from the oxidation of the scavenging molecules may also contribute to further h2o2 generation for instance isopropyl alcohol is used for ho scavenging 61 and at the same time is employed as a sacrificial agent for photocatalytic h2o2 production 62 in the presence of gcn t and isopropyl alcohol an incredibly higher concentration of evolved h2o2 was already reported 40 other molecules archetypal of ho quenching experiments were investigated such as coumarin and terephthalic acid 63 and the degradation of phenol was accelerated due to this same effect examples in the supplemental information fig si8 the iron role in assisting the photocatalytic oxidation and the pathway for generation of the ho radicals is established in the following experiments we confirmed that visible light alone does not decompose h2o2 while its concentration only decreases in the presence of either photoactivated gcn t or fe ii fig si9a the homogeneous reaction with iron and h2o2 under irradiation corresponds to the well known photo fenton system with the production of ho radicals in the case of carbon nitride the mechanism is necessarily different with the decrease in the h2o2 concentration resulting from the conversion in ho or decomposition into h2o the degradation of ph was tested using gcn t with and without initially added h2o2 fig si9b the photocatalytic removal of ph with simultaneous h2o2 generation is slower when h2o2 is not initially present in the system suggesting that h2o2 is transformed into ho radicals the redox potentials shown in fig 4 of the o2 h2o2 o2 o2 and h2o2 ho reduction semireactions are respectively 0 33 0 28 and 0 38 v vs she at ph 7 64 the band levels of gcn t were calculated in our previous work and defined as 1 22 and 1 76 ev for the conduction cb and valence vb bands respectively 40 therefore the previous reactions are prone to occur on gcn t the effect that dissolved iron has on this system also proves the importance of ho so allied with the fenton promoted reactions we propose the pathway depicted in fig 4 that demonstrates the thermodynamically favourable redox reactions that follow during gcn t photocatalysis in the presence of homogeneous iron 4 conclusions the integration of new technological solutions requires versatile materials in this work a reasonably known and easy to obtain carbon nitride based material designated as gcn t photocatalytically produces h2o2 simultaneously to the degradation of phenolic compounds this combination enables to envisage a more self sustained water treatment solution the need for only relatively low iron concentrations 0 2 2 0 mg l 1 brought the typical photo fenton reaction to a new level of requirements and performances an observed increase in toc removal makes the process 20 more efficient than the photo assisted fenton heterogeneous process alone in all the described photocatalytic system can productively generate reactive oxygen species mainly ho using visible light emitting diodes leds low dosages of iron under natural ph and in situ generation of h2o2 to mineralize a mixture of aromatic hazardous substances a system of this typecould mitigate the environmental burdens associated with the production transportation storage and usage of i other artificial non economic light sources ii consumptions of high volumes of h2o2 the oxidizing agent in the photo fenton
