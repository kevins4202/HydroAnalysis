2690,on large scales runoff changes are complex due to the regional differences in basin characteristics and interactions among multiple influencing factors accurately and quantitatively decomposing the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes in large basins with significant spatial heterogeneity remains a challenge in this paper the fuzzy c means fcm algorithm was used to identify the regional differences in hydrological processes of the yangtze river basin yzrb based on multiple factors then regional budyko equations with synthetic parameters were constructed for runoff decomposition using the hierarchical bayesian model considering the spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins results showed that 44 subbasins in the yzrb can be clustered into five clusters based on 10 factors including precipitation temperature precipitation seasonality vegetation coverage saturated hydraulic conductivity elevation slope topographic wetness index irrigation water consumption and proportion of built up area per unit area from cluster 1 to 5 p t irr and b decreased from about 1400 mm 17 c 57 9 mm and 1 59 to about 870 mm 12 c 15 6 mm and 0 40 respectively while elev and slp increased from about 300 m and 3 to about 3500 m and 10 respectively hierarchical bayesian models can improve the performance of budyko equations by better simulating n compared with linear regression models their r 2 rb and rmse for the whole yzrb were as follows 0 9104 versus 0 7591 4 33 versus 8 21 and 0 06 versus 0 11 respectively runoff decomposition from 1982 to 2018 showed that precipitation led to more than 34 change in runoff in cluster 2 while the influence of potential evapotranspiration on runoff changes was less than 3 00 in each cluster rising temperature caused runoff to decrease by more than 7 90 in cluster 1 3 and 4 in addition precipitation seasonality vegetation and irrigation water consumption had different influences in different clusters this study improves the ability of the budyko equation to quantitatively decompose the impacts of multiple factors on regional runoff changes and provides more reasonable suggestions for water resource management keywords budyko equations regional differences spatial correlations multiple factors runoff changes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally runoff is experiencing unprecedented changes which have caused significant adverse effects on regional water resource management and utilization as well as on ecological environment protection cong et al 2017 huang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 runoff changes as studies have found are affected by multiple factors such as climate underlying surfaces and human activities cai et al 2022 han et al 2019 at the same time their impacts on runoff are region specific due to the heterogeneity of basin environment and characteristics li and quiring 2021 liang et al 2015 therefore understanding how and to what extent they affect runoff changes are some of the emphases of current hydrological research hydrological processes are significantly different among regions due to the spatial heterogeneity of their influencing factors li et al li and quiring 2021 surveyed about 900 watersheds in the united states and found that in the regions with less human activities snowfall and vegetation cover had greater impacts on runoff while in other regions relative cumulative moisture surplus dam storage and developed land in riparian areas were the main factors luo et al luo et al 2020 considered that the runoff reduction caused by vegetation greening in arid regions was significantly greater than that in humid regions on a global scale yang et al yang et al 2014 found that the contributions of climate to runoff changes had large regional differences in china with positive values in the northwest region and negative values in north china in addition the impacts of spatial correlations and interactions of multiple factors among basins also deserves attention which are often ignored due to the continuity of the climate system and the hydrological system climate geology human activities and other factors affect not only the local hydrological processes but also the hydrological processes in adjacent or distant regions that is factors affecting hydrological processes are spatially correlated for example falling water levels in the dead sea rift have caused changes in groundwater flow patterns and the displacement of springs in the eastern aquifers of the neighboring judea and samaria mountains levy et al 2020 the three gorges dam has changed the patterns of runoff fluctuations at all downstream stations guo et al 2021 based on these two points mentioned above it s important to accurately identify the main causes affecting runoff changes regionally and quantitatively decompose their impacts with the consideration of spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins numerous methods have been used to decompose the impacts of multiple factors on runoff changes including hydrological models statistical methods and the budyko approach hydrological models can be used to simulate runoff over a short time and at a small spatial scale physically based hydrological models can explain the physical mechanism of runoff changes well tang and wang 2021 however the requirements of high precision data and the calibration of abundant parameters limit the use of the models statistical methods achieve this goal by separating variations in hydrological series for example breakpoint detection can be used to attribute runoff changes to natural factors and anthropogenic factors when the runoff series has obvious change points lv et al 2022 and wavelet analysis can be used to understand connections between runoff and environmental factors in different periodicities to help decompose the impacts of factors yang et al 2021a statistical methods can make full use of data information but do not explain enough the physical mechanisms of hydrological processes compared to hydrological models and statistical methods the budyko approach is simple in structure and meets the water energy balance in the process of hydrological cycles budyko 1974 on the mean annual timescale the change of water storage in the basin approaches zero and precipitation p is partitioned into evapotranspiration e and runoff r as follows 1 p e r based on this premise budyko considered that the water supply i e precipitation p and evapotranspiration demand i e potential evapotranspiration et 0 of the atmosphere controlled the long term water balance at the basin scale the process was described by the equation as follows 2 e p e t 0 p tanh p e t 0 1 exp e t 0 p in addition to precipitation and evapotranspiration many researchers have found that other factors such as temperature and vegetation coverage are also important to the process of long term water balance donohue et al 2007 yang et al 2009 therefore budyko equations with synthetic parameters i e ω in the fu s function fu 1981 and n in the choudhury yang s function yang et al 2008 encoding impacts of all other factors were derived since it is not observable much research has been devoted to obtaining the empirical relationships between the budyko parameter and its control factors donohue et al 2011 ning et al 2019 wang et al 2022 budyko equations with synthetic parameters have been widely used in impact factor decomposition of runoff changes however most previous studies assumed the relative influences of factors on runoff changes are spatially consistent that is they ignored the regional differences in the influence of factors on runoff reflected by the fixed budyko parameter or the fixed relationships between budyko parameters and influencing factors liang et al 2015 at the same time they treated basins as independent systems when constructing budyko equations cheng et al 2019 li et al 2019 which ignored the spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins to overcome these problems firstly a clustering method called fuzzy c means fcm which can separate regions into several clusters that have the same features was used in this paper to catch the spatial patterns of hydrologic related factors as well as comprehensively understand the characteristic differences among clusters liu et al 2021a yang et al 2020 then the hierarchical bayesian model which can estimate the impact of the spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins zhang et al 2019b zhou et al 2022 was employed to construct the empirical equation of budyko parameter n of each cluster and the region specific budyko equations were obtained this paper took the runoff of 1982 2018 in the yangtze river basin yzrb as the research target and aimed 1 to analyze the spatial patterns and regional differences of hydrologic related factors by fcm clustering 2 to construct budyko equations with synthetic parameters for each region and encode the impacts of multiple factors as well as their spatial correlations among basins by the hierarchical bayesian model and 3 to quantitatively decompose the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes regionally it s worth noting that based on the space time symmetry in water balance found by carmona carmona et al 2014 the above processes used an important assumption called space for time substitutable the flow chart of this study is shown in fig 1 this study emphasizes the importance of regional differences and spatial correlations of multiple factors to impact factor decomposition of runoff changes and provides theoretical support for regional water resource management and protection 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yzrb covers an area of approximately 1 8 million km2 yang et al 2021c and consists of more than 3000 tributaries due to its vast area there is great spatial heterogeneity in climate topography vegetation soil etc from its upstream to downstream reaches the source of the yzrb lies on the qinghai tibet plateau which has an average elevation of more than 4 000 m it is the plateau mountain climate here and the mean annual precipitation and temperature are approximately 300 mm and 4 c respectively yang et al 2021b the middle and lower reaches are located in the subtropical monsoon climate zone where precipitation and heat are mainly concentrated in summer land use in the yzrb is dominated by natural vegetation and farmland above and below the middle regions respectively zhang et al 2008 in this study 44 subbasins that covered the whole yzrb were selected as the study target fig 2 except for the xiangjiang and dahebian basins each basin covered an area greater than 5 000 km2 and some of them have subordinate relationships factors such as climate vegetation soil topography and human activities which are spatially heterogeneous were selected to study the causes of runoff changes among them which can well describe regional climate characteristics are mean annual precipitation mean annual temperature and precipitation seasonality fu and wang 2019 wu et al 2020b regional vegetation status is generally expressed by the vegetation coverage index ning et al 2020 as to soil characteristics saturated hydraulic conductivity is closely related to the hydrological cycle vigo et al 2021 regarding topographic factors in addition to elevation and slope the topographic wetness index also has an impact on runoff grabs et al 2009 agricultural irrigation and urban construction are two human activities that have a direct impact on runoff wang et al 2021 xin et al 2019 and they can be reflected by the irrigation water consumption and the proportion of built up area per unit area respectively they are introduced in table 1 as well as other relevant variables specific values are shown in the appendix 1 2 2 data source the daily runoff

river a cross validation method was used to verify the consistency of the data from different sources policelli et al 2019 2 3 the budyko approach there are many forms of the budyko equation here the equation of choudhury yang was applied choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 3 e p e t 0 p n e t 0 n 1 n where n is a synthetic parameter that encodes all factors that may affect runoff including underlying surfaces climate human activities etc in this paper n for four periods 1982 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and 2011 2018 in each basin was calculated and considered that they could be used when constructing empirical formulas across space based on the assumption of space for time substitutable using the partial correlation analysis and linear regression method empirical equations between n and its influencing factors were constructed ning et al 2019 2 4 the fuzzy c means fcm algorithm the fcm algorithm is a clustering algorithm based on membership degree chu et al 2021 its objective function is

input sample and c c1 c2 ck refers to the clustering centers u uij t k and uij represents the degree to which sample j belongs to cluster i its objective is to maximize the sum of squares between clusters 5 f max h 1 p d h i 1 k j 1 t u ij m x jh c ih 2 6 d h j 1 t x jh x h 2 7 x h 1 t j 1 t x jh where p represents the dimension and h represents the h th dimension 2 5 the hierarchical bayesian model the hierarchical bayesian model is a method that can effectively utilize prior knowledge and sample information zhang et al 2019b and it can also consider the spatial correlation ossandon et al 2021 and heterogeneity of variables ahn et al 2017 the basic framework of the hierarchical bayesian model is as follows 8 φ θ it α a i b t δ it 9 a i u i v i 10 b t r t s t where θ is the parameter to be estimated i and t are marks of space and time respectively δit is the value of the parameter to be estimated at time t and space i φ is a transformation equation α is the intercept ai is the spatial effect which can be divided into the spatial correlation ui and spatial heterogeneity vi bi is the temporal effect which can be divided into temporal correlation rt and temporal heterogeneity st it is necessary to know the prior distributions of each term of the model which can be obtained from accumulated experience over a long period or from reasonable assumptions in this paper the hierarchical bayesian model was used to estimate the empirical formula of the expected value of n according to the calculated n values since the prior distributions of n are unavailable donohue et al 2011 it can be assumed to be normally distributed due to the patterns itself 11 n i n μ i σ 2 where i means the number of basins μi is the expected value of n while σ 2 is the variances of the n methods of normality test are shown in appendix 2 for comparison a linear model was used here and the variables were consistent with those of the linear regression model 12 μ i α 0 α 1 x 1 α 2 x 2 α k

was repeated 5000 times by iterative weighted least squares shyu et al 2009 and averaged as the final value 2 6 attribution of runoff changes to quantitatively decompose the impacts of multiple factors on runoff r changes a sensitivity method developed by roderick and farquhar donohue et al 2011 roderick and farquhar 2011 was used changes in r can be decomposed as follows 16 dr d p d e 1 e p d p e e t 0 d e t 0 e n d n the last three terms represent changes in r caused by p et0 and n respectively their coefficients shown as follows represent the sensitivity of r to p sr p et0 s r e t 0 and n sr n respectively 17 s r p 1 e t 0 n 1 p n e t 0 n 1 1 n 18 s r e t 0 p n 1 p n e t 0 n 1 1 n 19 s r n pe t 0 n p n e t 0 n 1 n specific calculation processes are shown in the appendix 3 furthermore changes in n can be written as follows 20 dn n v i d v i s n v i d v i where vi represents factors that have impacts on runoff encoded by n according to the assumption of space for time substitutable the sensitivity of n to each factor could be derived from the cross space empirical formulas of n therefore changes in r can be written as follows 21 dr s r p d p s r e t 0 d e t 0 s r n s n v i d v i 3 results 3 1 spatial distributions of multiple factors affecting runoff in the yzrb spatial distributions of multiple factors that influence runoff are shown in fig 3 p and t were higher in the east and south over 2000 mm and 20 c and lower in the west and north less than 500 mm and 0 c but the distribution of si was opposite them it exceeded 3 in the northwest and approaches 0 in the southeast these suggest that the precipitation and heat were rich in the east and south of yzrb but poor in the west and north seasonal changes in precipitation were more pronounced in the western and northern regions from the upstream to the downstream p and t increased gradually except in the sichuan basin while si decreased gradually it indicated that the climatic characteristics of the yzrb were significantly different between the west and the east and between the upper and lower reaches m was higher in the middle reaches over 0 75 of the yzrb but lower in other areas less than 0 5 it indicated relatively poor vegetation coverage in the upper and lower reaches kc was discontinuous and unevenly distributed in space the minimum kc was 3 7 cm d and the maximum was 209 cm d but in general kc was higher in the upper reaches than in the lower reaches of the yzrb it can be concluded that soil upstream had better hydraulic conductivity elev slp and twi presented an obvious cascade distribution from west to east elev and slp were higher in the west than east while twi was opposite them from west to east they were mountains hills and plains and there was a drop of more than 7300 m slp was over 47 at the steepest point twi ranged from 3 1 to 42 8 and it was high in flat areas but low in steep areas irr was less than 40 mm in most areas of the yzrb but it exceeded 120 mm in some regions of the middle and lower reaches it was significantly higher in flat areas than elsewhere and its distribution was consistent with the distributions of p and t the distribution of b was similar to that of irr b was over 0 5 in some regions of the lower and middle reaches and it even exceeded 0 8 in parts of the yangtze river delta but for most regions of the yzrb especially the upper reaches b was close to 0 it indicated that human activities were more frequent in the plain area of the yzrb and showed aggregated patterns 3 2 spatial characteristics of the budyko parameter n each basin s n calculated by the measured data is shown in fig 4 n values ranged from 0 380 to 1 360 and they mainly distributed around 1 000 n values were smaller in the upper reaches of the yzrb and were bigger in the north shore of the middle reaches as well as the lower reaches in the south shore of the middle reaches n values were about 1 000 in terms of secondary basins n values in the jinsha river basin above shigu were about 0 920 in the jinsha river basin below shigu they ranged from 0 685 to 1 147 they were 0 376 and 0 976 in the mintuo river basin n values in the yibin to yichang basin were about 1 000 in the jialing river basin they ranged from 0 704 to 1 363 n values in the wu river basin and han river basin ranged from 0 834 to 1 134 and 0 895 to 1 288 respectively they ranged from 0 691 to 1 200 and 0 809 to 1 074 in the dongting lake basin and the poyang lake basin respectively in general n values were similar in the same or adjacent regions that was n values were spatially aggregated to some extent according to the distributions of factors it can be inferred that n values were controlled by the same factors and their interactions in the same or adjacent regions the normality of n values was tested in this paper and it was shown in table 2 and fig 5 in this paper k s test was adopted to verify the normality of n in the yzrb due to the samples were over 50 the sig 0 200 greater than 0 05 we can infer that n followed the normal distribution according to the q q plot quantiles of n and the normal distribution were approximately distributed on a straight line it showed that the distribution of n was linearly related to the normal distribution so its distribution also obeyed the normal distribution 3 3 regional characteristics analysis of multiple factors based on fcm clustering by using fcm basins were clustered into 5 clusters based on 10 factors see appendix 4 for the discrimination process of the clustering number basins with similar characteristics were clustered together results were shown in fig 6 table 3 all subbasins of the poyang lake basin and three subbasins of the dongting lake basin were clustered into cluster 1 they were all in the lower reaches of the yzrb cluster 2 consisted of six subbasins of the dongting lake basin the wuca basin of yibin to yichang basin and the dahebian basin of the wu river basin all subbasins of the han river basin six subbasins of the wu river basin two subbasins of the jialing river basin and the chishui basin in the yinbin to yichang basin constituted cluster 3 cluster 4 included the hongjiadu basin of the wu river basin the tanjiaba basin of the jialing river basin jiajiang river basin of the mintuo river basin and two subbasins of jinsha river basin below the shigu basins of cluster 2 3 and 4 were mainly located in the middle reaches of the yzrb two subbasins of the jinsha river basin above the shigu and six subbasins of jinsha river basin below the shigu made up cluster 5 they were all located in the upper reaches of the yzrb scatters of evapotranspiration ratio e p versus dryness index et0 p and their clustering results were plotted in fig 7 as shown ranges of n evapotranspiration ratios and dryness indexes differed from clusters for cluster 1 n evapotranspiration ratios and dryness indexes ranged from 0 72 to 1 40 0 31 to 0 57 and 0 69 to 1 01 respectively for cluster 2 they ranged from 0 68 to 1 20 0 32 to 0 59 and 0 79 to 1 26 respectively compared with cluster 1 the basins of cluster 2 were drier n evapotranspiration ratios and dryness indexes for cluster 3 were 0 68 1 53 0 38 0 7 and 0 98 2 01 respectively which were large than the first two clusters in the five clusters ranges of n and evapotranspiration ratios for cluster 4 were the largest and they were 0 32 1 42 and 0 11 0 84 respectively and dryness indexes ranged from 0 84 to 2 39 n range for cluster 5 was the smallest and it was 0 62 1 05 but evapotranspiration ratios which ranged from 0 43 to 0 71 were larger than those of cluster 1 and 2 and dryness indexes were the largest in the 5 clusters which ranged from 1 19 to 3 11 from cluster 1 to 5 dryness indexes showed significant increasing trends it suggested that our clustering based on runoff influencing factors can reflect regional differences in hydrological characteristics in the yzrb statistics of factors for cluster 1 to 5 were shown in fig 8 as shown p decreased from 1400 mm to 870 mm and t varied from over 17 c to less than 12 c from cluster 1 to 5 they both showed significant decrease trends from cluster 1 to 5 si increased gradually from cluster 1 to 5 it suggested that annual precipitation fluctuations of cluster 5 were much more intense than that of cluster 1 m of cluster 1 3 was close at 0 7 and it was lower in the basins of cluster 4 and 5 kc of cluster 1 4 was about 15 to 40 cm d and they were about 30 to 50 cm d in basins of cluster 5 from cluster 1 to 5 elev and slp gradually increased elev of five clusters was about 300 m 800 m 1200 m 2000 m and 3500 m respectively slp ranged from 3 to 10 in basins from cluster 1 to 5 and twi gradually decreased from 8 5 to 6 0 these results showed that underlying surface characteristics of the yzrb were significantly different among cluster 1 to 5 irr was about 57 9 mm 35 6 mm 26 0 mm 27 8 mm and 15 6 mm of the five clusters respectively and b was about 1 59 0 78 0 70 0 61 and 0 40 respectively it reflected the significant difference in the degree of human activities among the basins of five clusters 3 4 estimations of budyko parameter n 3 4 1 identification of main factors controlling n regionally partial correlation analysis was used to identify the main control factors of n according to clustering results as shown in fig 9 for cluster 1 there were large partial correlation coefficients between n and t kc elev twi and irr partial correlation coefficients were all over 0 48 and they all passed the significance test for cluster 2 partial correlation coefficients of p kc slp twi and irr were all more than 0 48 and they all passed the significance test for cluster 3 partial correlation coefficients of t and si were 0 49 and 0 68 and they were significant for cluster 4 although partial correlation coefficients of p t slp and twi were all over 0 48 only p and t were significant for cluster 5 only correlations between n and m and twi were large and significant in general the main factors controlling n of cluster 1 were t kc elev twi and irr the main factors controlling n of cluster 2 were p kc slp twi and irr for cluster 3 the main control factors were t and si for cluster 4 and 5 they were p t and m twi respectively the control factors of n varied with regions suggesting that there were regional differences between impacts of factors on runoff in the yzrb and it is necessary to identify them 3 4 2 regional estimations of n by the hierarchical bayesian model the hierarchical bayesian model was employed to construct empirical equations between n and the main control factors based on clustering and comparing the results with that of linear regression results were shown in fig 10 three evaluation metrics were used here they were coefficient of determination r 2 relative bias rb and root means square error rmse results showed that hierarchical bayesian models considering spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins can better simulate n improvement effects of hierarchical bayesian models were especially obvious in cluster 1 and cluster 2 compared with linear regression models for cluster 1 performances of linear regression and hierarchical bayesian models were r 2 0 7986 versus 0 9759 rb 6 15 versus 2 00 rmse 0 08 versus 0 03 for cluster 2 comparison results were r 2 0 7155 versus 0 9873 rb 7 44 versus 1 22 rmse 0 09 versus 0 02 linear regression models performed terribly in clusters 3 and 5 their r 2 were 0 4613 and 0 6369 respectively but r 2 of hierarchical bayesian models were 0 7618 and 0 7574 respectively for cluster 4 by considering factor spatial correlations r 2 increased from 0 8740 to 0 9488 rb decreased from 9 95 to 5 88 and rmse decreased from 0 13 to 0 08 respectively for the whole yzrb performances of linear regression and hierarchical bayesian models were r 2 0 7591 versus 0 9104 rb 8 21 versus 4 33 rmse 0 11 and 0 06 performances of linear regression models varied greatly in different clusters while hierarchical bayesian models performed well in all clusters it illustrated that considering the effect of spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins can improve the performance of the budyko framework due to better estimations of n 3 5 decomposing the impacts of multiple factors on runoff changes in each region runoff trends of each hydrological station were investigated in fig 11 it could be found that runoff increased most at the jingping station and its trend was 4 2 mm year runoff decreased most at the yuping station and its trend was 5 27 mm year runoff trends were between 2 mm year and 2 mm year at most stations runoff in the han river basin and wu river basin reduced most significantly at the same time trends of main factors affecting runoff changes in the yzrb were examined fig 12 among the main factors affecting runoff topography and soil were not time varying therefore changes in climate p et 0 t si vegetation m and human activities irr were analyzed in this paper the trend of p ranged from 2 88 mm year to 5 74 mm year it increased in the upper and lower reaches but decreased in the middle reaches et0 increased most in the north region of the middle reaches and its trend was 14 1 mm year it decreased most in the lower reaches and the trend was 12 0 mm year the trend of t ranged from 0 002 c year to 0 057 c year it increased significantly in the lower and upper reaches and the northern region of the middle reaches the trend of si ranged from 0 053 year to 0 022 year it was discontinuously distributed in space m increased in most regions of the middle and lower reaches and it decreased in some regions of the lower reaches and most regions in the upper reaches and the decreasing trend 0 011 year was greater than the increasing trend 0 001 year the trend of irr ranged from 2 mm year to 2 mm year in most regions the trends of increase and decrease in irr were spatially clustered regional budyko equations considering spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins were used to decompose the impacts of multiple factors on runoff changes in the yzrb from 1982 to 2018 the average values of each cluster were calculated as shown in fig 13 for basins of cluster 1 from 1982 to 2018 the increase in p resulted in a significant increase in runoff of about 9 80 the reduction in et0 also led to a slight increase in runoff by about 1 15 increases in t and irr reduced runoff by 10 66 and 2 70 respectively p et0 and irr caused 34 69 2 21 and 5 57 changes in the runoff in basins of cluster 2 respectively p et0 t and si resulted in 3 27 2 94 7 92 and 8 30 reductions in the runoff in basins of cluster 3 respectively for basins of cluster 4 the decrease in p and the increase in t led to 3 93 and 9 20 reductions in the runoff respectively the increase in p in cluster 5 basins increased runoff by 7 68 however increases in et0 and m caused decreases in the runoff by about 2 85 and 4 31 respectively to sum up the main factors leading to runoff changes in different regions of the yzrb were different and their effects on runoff were also different 4 discussion 4 1 spatial heterogeneity of factors in the yzrb and its influence natural and anthropic factors in the yzrb have significant spatial heterogeneity firstly it was crustal movements formed the topographic features of the yzrb wang and he 2012 the yangtze river originates from the tibetan plateau under joint actions of topography and climate there are abundant glaciers here liu et al 2020 which formed the tuotuo river the source of the yangtze river from here the yangtze river flows through plateaus mountains hills and plains from the upper reaches to the lower reaches another remarkable geographical feature of the yzrb is its land and sea location running from the west to the east and through more than half of the areas of china the yangtze river finally reaches the ocean due to topography and distances from the ocean amounts of water and heat in the yzrb from the east to the west showed a downward trend jiang et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 as a result it forms the climatic characteristics of wet and warm in the east and dry and cold in the west vegetation coverages are affected by combinations of topography climate and human activities in general vegetation is suitable for growing in warm and humid plain areas under natural conditions gao et al 2019 so there are larger vegetation coverages here but less on the cold and dry plateau however vegetation coverages are low in the yangtze river delta due to frequent human activities zhang et al 2019a soil hydraulic characteristics are mainly affected by soil texture which is formed by combinations of vegetation climate and hydrology chen et al 2021 the data set provided by data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn showed that the soil texture in the lower reaches of the yzrb is mainly clay while it is sand in the upper reaches research showed that soils with larger porosity are more conducive to water transport liu et al 2021b therefore there is a larger saturated hydraulic conductivity in upper reaches than in lower reaches it is the joint actions of all the above factors that form human activity patterns in the yzrb high altitude low temperature low precipitation and low vegetation coverage in source areas are reasons that lead to less human activities here ji et al 2021 climate vegetation and human activities in the middle reaches are all at the middle level nie et al 2021 frequent human activities in the lower reaches are the result of suitable climate terrain and land wu et al 2020a furthermore regional patterns of hydrological processes are formed by combinations and interactions of hydrological related factors the existing studies often divide the hydrological space according to the regional differences of hydrological related factors such as humid regions and arid regions based on climate characteristics shi and wang 2020 plains and mountains based on landforms li et al 2020 and the yangtze river economic belt and bohai rim economic zone based on economic and social development lu 2014 etc from the perspective of climate the runoff depth in the subtropical monsoon climate region is significantly higher than that in the temperate continental climate region and the temperate monsoon climate region in china huo et al 2021 influenced by topographic differences the water flow speed is slow in the plain area but fast in the steep area bin ghomash et al 2019 in addition natural runoff has changed a lot in areas with frequent human activities wang et al 2019 in this paper the hydrological space was divided based on synthesizing multiple factors this division is more conducive to the identification of comprehensive attribute differences among regions it showed that the influencing factors controlling the budyko parameter were different in different regions in this study that is the influencing factors of runoff were different in different regions see fig 9 4 2 impacts of spatial correlations of multiple factors it is considered that the available water quantity of a single basin is affected not only by its hydrological process but also by the input of adjacent basins spence and woo 2006 that is hydrological processes of adjacent basins will affect each other this has been proved by plenty of research douglas et al 2000 feldmann and levermann 2015 macian sorribes et al 2021 but the impacts of spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins on runoff are difficult to describe directly one of the solutions is to build comparative models that consider and do not consider spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins zhang et al 2019b this paper compared the estimations of n by hierarchical bayesian model and linear regression model and confirmed that spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins will change the relationship between n and its control factors in this paper the spatial correlation matrix was constructed in the hierarchical bayesian model to characterize the spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins in the spatial correlation matrix the weight of adjacent basins was set as 1 and others were set as 0 that is only the interactions between adjacent basins were considered in this paper which is the same as numerous previous studies gao and bradley 2019 phillips 2013 like other influencing factors the spatial correlation matrix is incorporated into the n s hierarchical bayesian model as a variable thus verifying the importance of considering the influence of spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins on runoff from the perspective of parameter estimation 4 3 impact mechanisms of climate change and human activities on runoff changes the results of impact factor decomposition of runoff showed that there were different impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes in different regions of the yzrb as numerous studies have shown bai et al 2019 ning et al 2017 ning et al 2019 the main climate factors affecting runoff changes include precipitation potential evapotranspiration temperature and precipitation seasonality among them precipitation is the direct source of surface runoff so runoff is often positively correlated with precipitation wu et al 2020b the results of the trend analysis which were consistent with the findings reported by liu liu et al 2018 showed that the precipitation in the source areas of the yzrb dongting lake basin and poyang lake basin had a significant increasing trend while the precipitation in other areas showed a decreasing trend accordingly precipitation led to an increase or decrease in runoff in these regions precipitation seasonality reflected the annual distribution of precipitation with frequent occurrences of extreme drought and extreme precipitation seasonal characteristics of precipitation were enhanced which has a great impact on runoff consistent with fang s fang et al 2018 research this paper shows that the increase in precipitation seasonality led to the decrease of runoff in some regions of the middle reaches of the yzrb under the background of global warming temperature affects runoff by changing evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration generally speaking increases in temperature will increase evapotranspiration resulting in decreases in runoff similar to the research of wang wang et al 2016 this paper reported the negative impacts of temperature on runoff in the yzrb in addition increases in potential evapotranspiration generally lead to decreases in runoff which is consistent with the research of ji ji et al 2021 and yang yang et al 2022 in terms of human activities this paper mainly discussed the effects of agricultural irrigation in the lower reaches and afforestation in the upper reaches on runoff in the yzrb constructions of agricultural water conservancy engineering facilities and the drawing of water from rivers have reduced the runoff of natural rivers wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 as it showed in this paper increased water use for agricultural irrigation has reduced runoff in the dongting lake basin and poyang lake basin vegetation restoration activities have increased vegetation coverages in the source region of the yzrb since the 1980 s as reported zhang et al 2020 however according to previous studies bai et al 2020 li et al 2017 increases in vegetation coverage would decrease the runoff due to the increase in evapotranspiration for dry areas although the increasing trend of m in the upper reaches of the yzrb was not obvious in this paper it still led to the reduction of runoff in this region and it does not conflict with previous research 4 4 limitations and uncertainties in this study the budyko approach considering the spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins was used to decompose the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes however there are some uncertainties and limitations in this study that deserve attention firstly this paper assumed that n followed a normal distribution few studies can determine the prior distribution of n bai et al 2019 donohue et al 2011 therefore the determination of n s prior distribution is still one of the main limitations of current research and will bring uncertainty to its estimation secondly in this paper the temporal variations of the budyko parameter were ignored however more and more studies have confirmed that it varies with time under the background of climate change and human activities jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2022 the time invariant parameter makes the application of the budyko framework simple but it cannot accurately reflect the time varying law of runoff therefore the budyko framework with the time varying parameter is more desirable for some basins that are undergoing drastic changes in addition the selection of influencing factors is one of the sources of uncertainty in the results of impact factor decomposition of runoff change overall further study is needed to overcome these limitations and reduce the uncertainties 5 conclusion considering the impacts of regional differences of multiple factors on runoff changes this paper first used the fcm algorithm to cluster 44 subbasins of the yzrb based on 10 hydrological related factors the hierarchical bayesian model which can estimate the impact of spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins was used to construct regional empirical equations of the budyko parameter n then the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes in the yzrb were decomposed based on the regional budyko equations the main conclusions are as follows 1 based on factors of precipitation temperature precipitation seasonality vegetation coverage saturated hydraulic conductivity elevation slope topographic wetness index irrigation water consumption and proportion of built up area per unit area 44 subbasins of the yzrb were clustered into 5 clusters factors showed significant differences between clusters and the dryness indexes increased from cluster 1 to 5 with the ranges changed from 0 69 1 01 to 1 19 3 11 the main factors control n in 5 clusters were t kc elev twi irr p kc slp twi t si p t and m twi respectively 2 the hierarchical bayesian model can accurately estimate the budyko parameter compared with the linear regression model for each cluster r 2 of hierarchical bayesian models was greater than 0 75 while it ranged from 0 4613 and 0 8740 in linear regression models rb of hierarchical bayesian models was less than 6 5 while it exceeded 6 15 of linear regression models rmse of hierarchical bayesian models was about 0 03 0 09 which was also smaller than 0 07 0 14 of linear regression models it can be concluded that considering the impacts of factor spatial correlations can improve the performance of the budyko framework 3 results of impact factor decomposition showed that runoff changes of each cluster caused by precipitation changes were about 9 80 34 69 3 27 3 93 and 7 68 respectively runoff changes caused by potential evapotranspiration were less than 3 rising temperature caused about 10 66 7 92 and 9 20 decreases in runoff in basins of cluster 1 3 and 4 respectively precipitation seasonality had a significant effect and reduced the runoff by 8 30 in basins of cluster 3 in terms of human activities irrigation water consumption resulted in reductions in the runoff by approximately 2 70 and 5 57 in the basins of cluster 1 and 2 respectively and the runoff decreased by approximately 4 31 due to vegetation restoration in the basins of cluster 5 declaration of competing interest the authors

2690,on large scales runoff changes are complex due to the regional differences in basin characteristics and interactions among multiple influencing factors accurately and quantitatively decomposing the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes in large basins with significant spatial heterogeneity remains a challenge in this paper the fuzzy c means fcm algorithm was used to identify the regional differences in hydrological processes of the yangtze river basin yzrb based on multiple factors then regional budyko equations with synthetic parameters were constructed for runoff decomposition using the hierarchical bayesian model considering the spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins results showed that 44 subbasins in the yzrb can be clustered into five clusters based on 10 factors including precipitation temperature precipitation seasonality vegetation coverage saturated hydraulic conductivity elevation slope topographic wetness index irrigation water consumption and proportion of built up area per unit area from cluster 1 to 5 p t irr and b decreased from about 1400 mm 17 c 57 9 mm and 1 59 to about 870 mm 12 c 15 6 mm and 0 40 respectively while elev and slp increased from about 300 m and 3 to about 3500 m and 10 respectively hierarchical bayesian models can improve the performance of budyko equations by better simulating n compared with linear regression models their r 2 rb and rmse for the whole yzrb were as follows 0 9104 versus 0 7591 4 33 versus 8 21 and 0 06 versus 0 11 respectively runoff decomposition from 1982 to 2018 showed that precipitation led to more than 34 change in runoff in cluster 2 while the influence of potential evapotranspiration on runoff changes was less than 3 00 in each cluster rising temperature caused runoff to decrease by more than 7 90 in cluster 1 3 and 4 in addition precipitation seasonality vegetation and irrigation water consumption had different influences in different clusters this study improves the ability of the budyko equation to quantitatively decompose the impacts of multiple factors on regional runoff changes and provides more reasonable suggestions for water resource management keywords budyko equations regional differences spatial correlations multiple factors runoff changes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally runoff is experiencing unprecedented changes which have caused significant adverse effects on regional water resource management and utilization as well as on ecological environment protection cong et al 2017 huang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 runoff changes as studies have found are affected by multiple factors such as climate underlying surfaces and human activities cai et al 2022 han et al 2019 at the same time their impacts on runoff are region specific due to the heterogeneity of basin environment and characteristics li and quiring 2021 liang et al 2015 therefore understanding how and to what extent they affect runoff changes are some of the emphases of current hydrological research hydrological processes are significantly different among regions due to the spatial heterogeneity of their influencing factors li et al li and quiring 2021 surveyed about 900 watersheds in the united states and found that in the regions with less human activities snowfall and vegetation cover had greater impacts on runoff while in other regions relative cumulative moisture surplus dam storage and developed land in riparian areas were the main factors luo et al luo et al 2020 considered that the runoff reduction caused by vegetation greening in arid regions was significantly greater than that in humid regions on a global scale yang et al yang et al 2014 found that the contributions of climate to runoff changes had large regional differences in china with positive values in the northwest region and negative values in north china in addition the impacts of spatial correlations and interactions of multiple factors among basins also deserves attention which are often ignored due to the continuity of the climate system and the hydrological system climate geology human activities and other factors affect not only the local hydrological processes but also the hydrological processes in adjacent or distant regions that is factors affecting hydrological processes are spatially correlated for example falling water levels in the dead sea rift have caused changes in groundwater flow patterns and the displacement of springs in the eastern aquifers of the neighboring judea and samaria mountains levy et al 2020 the three gorges dam has changed the patterns of runoff fluctuations at all downstream stations guo et al 2021 based on these two points mentioned above it s important to accurately identify the main causes affecting runoff changes regionally and quantitatively decompose their impacts with the consideration of spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins numerous methods have been used to decompose the impacts of multiple factors on runoff changes including hydrological models statistical methods and the budyko approach hydrological models can be used to simulate runoff over a short time and at a small spatial scale physically based hydrological models can explain the physical mechanism of runoff changes well tang and wang 2021 however the requirements of high precision data and the calibration of abundant parameters limit the use of the models statistical methods achieve this goal by separating variations in hydrological series for example breakpoint detection can be used to attribute runoff changes to natural factors and anthropogenic factors when the runoff series has obvious change points lv et al 2022 and wavelet analysis can be used to understand connections between runoff and environmental factors in different periodicities to help decompose the impacts of factors yang et al 2021a statistical methods can make full use of data information but do not explain enough the physical mechanisms of hydrological processes compared to hydrological models and statistical methods the budyko approach is simple in structure and meets the water energy balance in the process of hydrological cycles budyko 1974 on the mean annual timescale the change of water storage in the basin approaches zero and precipitation p is partitioned into evapotranspiration e and runoff r as follows 1 p e r based on this premise budyko considered that the water supply i e precipitation p and evapotranspiration demand i e potential evapotranspiration et 0 of the atmosphere controlled the long term water balance at the basin scale the process was described by the equation as follows 2 e p e t 0 p tanh p e t 0 1 exp e t 0 p in addition to precipitation and evapotranspiration many researchers have found that other factors such as temperature and vegetation coverage are also important to the process of long term water balance donohue et al 2007 yang et al 2009 therefore budyko equations with synthetic parameters i e ω in the fu s function fu 1981 and n in the choudhury yang s function yang et al 2008 encoding impacts of all other factors were derived since it is not observable much research has been devoted to obtaining the empirical relationships between the budyko parameter and its control factors donohue et al 2011 ning et al 2019 wang et al 2022 budyko equations with synthetic parameters have been widely used in impact factor decomposition of runoff changes however most previous studies assumed the relative influences of factors on runoff changes are spatially consistent that is they ignored the regional differences in the influence of factors on runoff reflected by the fixed budyko parameter or the fixed relationships between budyko parameters and influencing factors liang et al 2015 at the same time they treated basins as independent systems when constructing budyko equations cheng et al 2019 li et al 2019 which ignored the spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins to overcome these problems firstly a clustering method called fuzzy c means fcm which can separate regions into several clusters that have the same features was used in this paper to catch the spatial patterns of hydrologic related factors as well as comprehensively understand the characteristic differences among clusters liu et al 2021a yang et al 2020 then the hierarchical bayesian model which can estimate the impact of the spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins zhang et al 2019b zhou et al 2022 was employed to construct the empirical equation of budyko parameter n of each cluster and the region specific budyko equations were obtained this paper took the runoff of 1982 2018 in the yangtze river basin yzrb as the research target and aimed 1 to analyze the spatial patterns and regional differences of hydrologic related factors by fcm clustering 2 to construct budyko equations with synthetic parameters for each region and encode the impacts of multiple factors as well as their spatial correlations among basins by the hierarchical bayesian model and 3 to quantitatively decompose the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes regionally it s worth noting that based on the space time symmetry in water balance found by carmona carmona et al 2014 the above processes used an important assumption called space for time substitutable the flow chart of this study is shown in fig 1 this study emphasizes the importance of regional differences and spatial correlations of multiple factors to impact factor decomposition of runoff changes and provides theoretical support for regional water resource management and protection 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yzrb covers an area of approximately 1 8 million km2 yang et al 2021c and consists of more than 3000 tributaries due to its vast area there is great spatial heterogeneity in climate topography vegetation soil etc from its upstream to downstream reaches the source of the yzrb lies on the qinghai tibet plateau which has an average elevation of more than 4 000 m it is the plateau mountain climate here and the mean annual precipitation and temperature are approximately 300 mm and 4 c respectively yang et al 2021b the middle and lower reaches are located in the subtropical monsoon climate zone where precipitation and heat are mainly concentrated in summer land use in the yzrb is dominated by natural vegetation and farmland above and below the middle regions respectively zhang et al 2008 in this study 44 subbasins that covered the whole yzrb were selected as the study target fig 2 except for the xiangjiang and dahebian basins each basin covered an area greater than 5 000 km2 and some of them have subordinate relationships factors such as climate vegetation soil topography and human activities which are spatially heterogeneous were selected to study the causes of runoff changes among them which can well describe regional climate characteristics are mean annual precipitation mean annual temperature and precipitation seasonality fu and wang 2019 wu et al 2020b regional vegetation status is generally expressed by the vegetation coverage index ning et al 2020 as to soil characteristics saturated hydraulic conductivity is closely related to the hydrological cycle vigo et al 2021 regarding topographic factors in addition to elevation and slope the topographic wetness index also has an impact on runoff grabs et al 2009 agricultural irrigation and urban construction are two human activities that have a direct impact on runoff wang et al 2021 xin et al 2019 and they can be reflected by the irrigation water consumption and the proportion of built up area per unit area respectively they are introduced in table 1 as well as other relevant variables specific values are shown in the appendix 1 2 2 data source the daily runoff

river a cross validation method was used to verify the consistency of the data from different sources policelli et al 2019 2 3 the budyko approach there are many forms of the budyko equation here the equation of choudhury yang was applied choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 3 e p e t 0 p n e t 0 n 1 n where n is a synthetic parameter that encodes all factors that may affect runoff including underlying surfaces climate human activities etc in this paper n for four periods 1982 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and 2011 2018 in each basin was calculated and considered that they could be used when constructing empirical formulas across space based on the assumption of space for time substitutable using the partial correlation analysis and linear regression method empirical equations between n and its influencing factors were constructed ning et al 2019 2 4 the fuzzy c means fcm algorithm the fcm algorithm is a clustering algorithm based on membership degree chu et al 2021 its objective function is

model the hierarchical bayesian model is a method that can effectively utilize prior knowledge and sample information zhang et al 2019b and it can also consider the spatial correlation ossandon et al 2021 and heterogeneity of variables ahn et al 2017 the basic framework of the hierarchical bayesian model is as follows 8 φ θ it α a i b t δ it 9 a i u i v i 10 b t r t s t where θ is the parameter to be estimated i and t are marks of space and time respectively δit is the value of the parameter to be estimated at time t and space i φ is a transformation equation α is the intercept ai is the spatial effect which can be divided into the spatial correlation ui and spatial heterogeneity vi bi is the temporal effect which can be divided into temporal correlation rt and temporal heterogeneity st it is necessary to know the prior distributions of each term of the model which can be obtained from accumulated experience over a long period or from reasonable assumptions in this paper the hierarchical bayesian model was used to estimate the empirical formula of the expected value of n according to the calculated n values since the prior distributions of n are unavailable donohue et al 2011 it can be assumed to be normally distributed due to the patterns itself 11 n i n μ i σ 2 where i means the number of basins μi is the expected value of n while σ 2 is the variances of the n methods of normality test are shown in appendix 2 for comparison a linear model was used here and the variables were consistent with those of the linear regression model 12 μ i α 0 α 1 x 1 α 2 x 2 α k

was repeated 5000 times by iterative weighted least squares shyu et al 2009 and averaged as the final value 2 6 attribution of runoff changes to quantitatively decompose the impacts of multiple factors on runoff r changes a sensitivity method developed by roderick and farquhar donohue et al 2011 roderick and farquhar 2011 was used changes in r can be decomposed as follows 16 dr d p d e 1 e p d p e e t 0 d e t 0 e n d n the last three terms represent changes in r caused by p et0 and n respectively their coefficients shown as follows represent the sensitivity of r to p sr p et0 s r e t 0 and n sr n respectively 17 s r p 1 e t 0 n 1 p n e t 0 n 1 1 n 18 s r e t 0 p n 1 p n e t 0 n 1 1 n 19 s r n pe t 0 n p n e t 0 n 1 n specific calculation processes are shown in the appendix 3 furthermore changes in n can be written as follows 20 dn n v i d v i s n v i d v i where vi represents factors that have impacts on runoff encoded by n according to the assumption of space for time substitutable the sensitivity of n to each factor could be derived from the cross space empirical formulas of n therefore changes in r can be written as follows 21 dr s r p d p s r e t 0 d e t 0 s r n s n v i d v i 3 results 3 1 spatial distributions of multiple factors affecting runoff in the yzrb spatial distributions of multiple factors that influence runoff are shown in fig 3 p and t were higher in the east and south over 2000 mm and 20 c and lower in the west and north less than 500 mm and 0 c but the distribution of si was opposite them it exceeded 3 in the northwest and approaches 0 in the southeast these suggest that the precipitation and heat were rich in the east and south of yzrb but poor in the west and north seasonal changes in precipitation were more pronounced in the western and northern regions from the upstream to the downstream p and t increased gradually except in the sichuan basin while si decreased gradually it indicated that the climatic characteristics of the yzrb were significantly different between the west and the east and between the upper and lower reaches m was higher in the middle reaches over 0 75 of the yzrb but lower in other areas less than 0 5 it indicated relatively poor vegetation coverage in the upper and lower reaches kc was discontinuous and unevenly distributed in space the minimum kc was 3 7 cm d and the maximum was 209 cm d but in general kc was higher in the upper reaches than in the lower reaches of the yzrb it can be concluded that soil upstream had better hydraulic conductivity elev slp and twi presented an obvious cascade distribution from west to east elev and slp were higher in the west than east while twi was opposite them from west to east they were mountains hills and plains and there was a drop of more than 7300 m slp was over 47 at the steepest point twi ranged from 3 1 to 42 8 and it was high in flat areas but low in steep areas irr was less than 40 mm in most areas of the yzrb but it exceeded 120 mm in some regions of the middle and lower reaches it was significantly higher in flat areas than elsewhere and its distribution was consistent with the distributions of p and t the distribution of b was similar to that of irr b was over 0 5 in some regions of the lower and middle reaches and it even exceeded 0 8 in parts of the yangtze river delta but for most regions of the yzrb especially the upper reaches b was close to 0 it indicated that human activities were more frequent in the plain area of the yzrb and showed aggregated patterns 3 2 spatial characteristics of the budyko parameter n each basin s n calculated by the measured data is shown in fig 4 n values ranged from 0 380 to 1 360 and they mainly distributed around 1 000 n values were smaller in the upper reaches of the yzrb and were bigger in the north shore of the middle reaches as well as the lower reaches in the south shore of the middle reaches n values were about 1 000 in terms of secondary basins n values in the jinsha river basin above shigu were about 0 920 in the jinsha river basin below shigu they ranged from 0 685 to 1 147 they were 0 376 and 0 976 in the mintuo river basin n values in the yibin to yichang basin were about 1 000 in the jialing river basin they ranged from 0 704 to 1 363 n values in the wu river basin and han river basin ranged from 0 834 to 1 134 and 0 895 to 1 288 respectively they ranged from 0 691 to 1 200 and 0 809 to 1 074 in the dongting lake basin and the poyang lake basin respectively in general n values were similar in the same or adjacent regions that was n values were spatially aggregated to some extent according to the distributions of factors it can be inferred that n values were controlled by the same factors and their interactions in the same or adjacent regions the normality of n values was tested in this paper and it was shown in table 2 and fig 5 in this paper k s test was adopted to verify the normality of n in the yzrb due to the samples were over 50 the sig 0 200 greater than 0 05 we can infer that n followed the normal distribution according to the q q plot quantiles of n and the normal distribution were approximately distributed on a straight line it showed that the distribution of n was linearly related to the normal distribution so its distribution also obeyed the normal distribution 3 3 regional characteristics analysis of multiple factors based on fcm clustering by using fcm basins were clustered into 5 clusters based on 10 factors see appendix 4 for the discrimination process of the clustering number basins with similar characteristics were clustered together results were shown in fig 6 table 3 all subbasins of the poyang lake basin and three subbasins of the dongting lake basin were clustered into cluster 1 they were all in the lower reaches of the yzrb cluster 2 consisted of six subbasins of the dongting lake basin the wuca basin of yibin to yichang basin and the dahebian basin of the wu river basin all subbasins of the han river basin six subbasins of the wu river basin two subbasins of the jialing river basin and the chishui basin in the yinbin to yichang basin constituted cluster 3 cluster 4 included the hongjiadu basin of the wu river basin the tanjiaba basin of the jialing river basin jiajiang river basin of the mintuo river basin and two subbasins of jinsha river basin below the shigu basins of cluster 2 3 and 4 were mainly located in the middle reaches of the yzrb two subbasins of the jinsha river basin above the shigu and six subbasins of jinsha river basin below the shigu made up cluster 5 they were all located in the upper reaches of the yzrb scatters of evapotranspiration ratio e p versus dryness index et0 p and their clustering results were plotted in fig 7 as shown ranges of n evapotranspiration ratios and dryness indexes differed from clusters for cluster 1 n evapotranspiration ratios and dryness indexes ranged from 0 72 to 1 40 0 31 to 0 57 and 0 69 to 1 01 respectively for cluster 2 they ranged from 0 68 to 1 20 0 32 to 0 59 and 0 79 to 1 26 respectively compared with cluster 1 the basins of cluster 2 were drier n evapotranspiration ratios and dryness indexes for cluster 3 were 0 68 1 53 0 38 0 7 and 0 98 2 01 respectively which were large than the first two clusters in the five clusters ranges of n and evapotranspiration ratios for cluster 4 were the largest and they were 0 32 1 42 and 0 11 0 84 respectively and dryness indexes ranged from 0 84 to 2 39 n range for cluster 5 was the smallest and it was 0 62 1 05 but evapotranspiration ratios which ranged from 0 43 to 0 71 were larger than those of cluster 1 and 2 and dryness indexes were the largest in the 5 clusters which ranged from 1 19 to 3 11 from cluster 1 to 5 dryness indexes showed significant increasing trends it suggested that our clustering based on runoff influencing factors can reflect regional differences in hydrological characteristics in the yzrb statistics of factors for cluster 1 to 5 were shown in fig 8 as shown p decreased from 1400 mm to 870 mm and t varied from over 17 c to less than 12 c from cluster 1 to 5 they both showed significant decrease trends from cluster 1 to 5 si increased gradually from cluster 1 to 5 it suggested that annual precipitation fluctuations of cluster 5 were much more intense than that of cluster 1 m of cluster 1 3 was close at 0 7 and it was lower in the basins of cluster 4 and 5 kc of cluster 1 4 was about 15 to 40 cm d and they were about 30 to 50 cm d in basins of cluster 5 from cluster 1 to 5 elev and slp gradually increased elev of five clusters was about 300 m 800 m 1200 m 2000 m and 3500 m respectively slp ranged from 3 to 10 in basins from cluster 1 to 5 and twi gradually decreased from 8 5 to 6 0 these results showed that underlying surface characteristics of the yzrb were significantly different among cluster 1 to 5 irr was about 57 9 mm 35 6 mm 26 0 mm 27 8 mm and 15 6 mm of the five clusters respectively and b was about 1 59 0 78 0 70 0 61 and 0 40 respectively it reflected the significant difference in the degree of human activities among the basins of five clusters 3 4 estimations of budyko parameter n 3 4 1 identification of main factors controlling n regionally partial correlation analysis was used to identify the main control factors of n according to clustering results as shown in fig 9 for cluster 1 there were large partial correlation coefficients between n and t kc elev twi and irr partial correlation coefficients were all over 0 48 and they all passed the significance test for cluster 2 partial correlation coefficients of p kc slp twi and irr were all more than 0 48 and they all passed the significance test for cluster 3 partial correlation coefficients of t and si were 0 49 and 0 68 and they were significant for cluster 4 although partial correlation coefficients of p t slp and twi were all over 0 48 only p and t were significant for cluster 5 only correlations between n and m and twi were large and significant in general the main factors controlling n of cluster 1 were t kc elev twi and irr the main factors controlling n of cluster 2 were p kc slp twi and irr for cluster 3 the main control factors were t and si for cluster 4 and 5 they were p t and m twi respectively the control factors of n varied with regions suggesting that there were regional differences between impacts of factors on runoff in the yzrb and it is necessary to identify them 3 4 2 regional estimations of n by the hierarchical bayesian model the hierarchical bayesian model was employed to construct empirical equations between n and the main control factors based on clustering and comparing the results with that of linear regression results were shown in fig 10 three evaluation metrics were used here they were coefficient of determination r 2 relative bias rb and root means square error rmse results showed that hierarchical bayesian models considering spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins can better simulate n improvement effects of hierarchical bayesian models were especially obvious in cluster 1 and cluster 2 compared with linear regression models for cluster 1 performances of linear regression and hierarchical bayesian models were r 2 0 7986 versus 0 9759 rb 6 15 versus 2 00 rmse 0 08 versus 0 03 for cluster 2 comparison results were r 2 0 7155 versus 0 9873 rb 7 44 versus 1 22 rmse 0 09 versus 0 02 linear regression models performed terribly in clusters 3 and 5 their r 2 were 0 4613 and 0 6369 respectively but r 2 of hierarchical bayesian models were 0 7618 and 0 7574 respectively for cluster 4 by considering factor spatial correlations r 2 increased from 0 8740 to 0 9488 rb decreased from 9 95 to 5 88 and rmse decreased from 0 13 to 0 08 respectively for the whole yzrb performances of linear regression and hierarchical bayesian models were r 2 0 7591 versus 0 9104 rb 8 21 versus 4 33 rmse 0 11 and 0 06 performances of linear regression models varied greatly in different clusters while hierarchical bayesian models performed well in all clusters it illustrated that considering the effect of spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins can improve the performance of the budyko framework due to better estimations of n 3 5 decomposing the impacts of multiple factors on runoff changes in each region runoff trends of each hydrological station were investigated in fig 11 it could be found that runoff increased most at the jingping station and its trend was 4 2 mm year runoff decreased most at the yuping station and its trend was 5 27 mm year runoff trends were between 2 mm year and 2 mm year at most stations runoff in the han river basin and wu river basin reduced most significantly at the same time trends of main factors affecting runoff changes in the yzrb were examined fig 12 among the main factors affecting runoff topography and soil were not time varying therefore changes in climate p et 0 t si vegetation m and human activities irr were analyzed in this paper the trend of p ranged from 2 88 mm year to 5 74 mm year it increased in the upper and lower reaches but decreased in the middle reaches et0 increased most in the north region of the middle reaches and its trend was 14 1 mm year it decreased most in the lower reaches and the trend was 12 0 mm year the trend of t ranged from 0 002 c year to 0 057 c year it increased significantly in the lower and upper reaches and the northern region of the middle reaches the trend of si ranged from 0 053 year to 0 022 year it was discontinuously distributed in space m increased in most regions of the middle and lower reaches and it decreased in some regions of the lower reaches and most regions in the upper reaches and the decreasing trend 0 011 year was greater than the increasing trend 0 001 year the trend of irr ranged from 2 mm year to 2 mm year in most regions the trends of increase and decrease in irr were spatially clustered regional budyko equations considering spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins were used to decompose the impacts of multiple factors on runoff changes in the yzrb from 1982 to 2018 the average values of each cluster were calculated as shown in fig 13 for basins of cluster 1 from 1982 to 2018 the increase in p resulted in a significant increase in runoff of about 9 80 the reduction in et0 also led to a slight increase in runoff by about 1 15 increases in t and irr reduced runoff by 10 66 and 2 70 respectively p et0 and irr caused 34 69 2 21 and 5 57 changes in the runoff in basins of cluster 2 respectively p et0 t and si resulted in 3 27 2 94 7 92 and 8 30 reductions in the runoff in basins of cluster 3 respectively for basins of cluster 4 the decrease in p and the increase in t led to 3 93 and 9 20 reductions in the runoff respectively the increase in p in cluster 5 basins increased runoff by 7 68 however increases in et0 and m caused decreases in the runoff by about 2 85 and 4 31 respectively to sum up the main factors leading to runoff changes in different regions of the yzrb were different and their effects on runoff were also different 4 discussion 4 1 spatial heterogeneity of factors in the yzrb and its influence natural and anthropic factors in the yzrb have significant spatial heterogeneity firstly it was crustal movements formed the topographic features of the yzrb wang and he 2012 the yangtze river originates from the tibetan plateau under joint actions of topography and climate there are abundant glaciers here liu et al 2020 which formed the tuotuo river the source of the yangtze river from here the yangtze river flows through plateaus mountains hills and plains from the upper reaches to the lower reaches another remarkable geographical feature of the yzrb is its land and sea location running from the west to the east and through more than half of the areas of china the yangtze river finally reaches the ocean due to topography and distances from the ocean amounts of water and heat in the yzrb from the east to the west showed a downward trend jiang et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 as a result it forms the climatic characteristics of wet and warm in the east and dry and cold in the west vegetation coverages are affected by combinations of topography climate and human activities in general vegetation is suitable for growing in warm and humid plain areas under natural conditions gao et al 2019 so there are larger vegetation coverages here but less on the cold and dry plateau however vegetation coverages are low in the yangtze river delta due to frequent human activities zhang et al 2019a soil hydraulic characteristics are mainly affected by soil texture which is formed by combinations of vegetation climate and hydrology chen et al 2021 the data set provided by data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn showed that the soil texture in the lower reaches of the yzrb is mainly clay while it is sand in the upper reaches research showed that soils with larger porosity are more conducive to water transport liu et al 2021b therefore there is a larger saturated hydraulic conductivity in upper reaches than in lower reaches it is the joint actions of all the above factors that form human activity patterns in the yzrb high altitude low temperature low precipitation and low vegetation coverage in source areas are reasons that lead to less human activities here ji et al 2021 climate vegetation and human activities in the middle reaches are all at the middle level nie et al 2021 frequent human activities in the lower reaches are the result of suitable climate terrain and land wu et al 2020a furthermore regional patterns of hydrological processes are formed by combinations and interactions of hydrological related factors the existing studies often divide the hydrological space according to the regional differences of hydrological related factors such as humid regions and arid regions based on climate characteristics shi and wang 2020 plains and mountains based on landforms li et al 2020 and the yangtze river economic belt and bohai rim economic zone based on economic and social development lu 2014 etc from the perspective of climate the runoff depth in the subtropical monsoon climate region is significantly higher than that in the temperate continental climate region and the temperate monsoon climate region in china huo et al 2021 influenced by topographic differences the water flow speed is slow in the plain area but fast in the steep area bin ghomash et al 2019 in addition natural runoff has changed a lot in areas with frequent human activities wang et al 2019 in this paper the hydrological space was divided based on synthesizing multiple factors this division is more conducive to the identification of comprehensive attribute differences among regions it showed that the influencing factors controlling the budyko parameter were different in different regions in this study that is the influencing factors of runoff were different in different regions see fig 9 4 2 impacts of spatial correlations of multiple factors it is considered that the available water quantity of a single basin is affected not only by its hydrological process but also by the input of adjacent basins spence and woo 2006 that is hydrological processes of adjacent basins will affect each other this has been proved by plenty of research douglas et al 2000 feldmann and levermann 2015 macian sorribes et al 2021 but the impacts of spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins on runoff are difficult to describe directly one of the solutions is to build comparative models that consider and do not consider spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins zhang et al 2019b this paper compared the estimations of n by hierarchical bayesian model and linear regression model and confirmed that spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins will change the relationship between n and its control factors in this paper the spatial correlation matrix was constructed in the hierarchical bayesian model to characterize the spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins in the spatial correlation matrix the weight of adjacent basins was set as 1 and others were set as 0 that is only the interactions between adjacent basins were considered in this paper which is the same as numerous previous studies gao and bradley 2019 phillips 2013 like other influencing factors the spatial correlation matrix is incorporated into the n s hierarchical bayesian model as a variable thus verifying the importance of considering the influence of spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins on runoff from the perspective of parameter estimation 4 3 impact mechanisms of climate change and human activities on runoff changes the results of impact factor decomposition of runoff showed that there were different impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes in different regions of the yzrb as numerous studies have shown bai et al 2019 ning et al 2017 ning et al 2019 the main climate factors affecting runoff changes include precipitation potential evapotranspiration temperature and precipitation seasonality among them precipitation is the direct source of surface runoff so runoff is often positively correlated with precipitation wu et al 2020b the results of the trend analysis which were consistent with the findings reported by liu liu et al 2018 showed that the precipitation in the source areas of the yzrb dongting lake basin and poyang lake basin had a significant increasing trend while the precipitation in other areas showed a decreasing trend accordingly precipitation led to an increase or decrease in runoff in these regions precipitation seasonality reflected the annual distribution of precipitation with frequent occurrences of extreme drought and extreme precipitation seasonal characteristics of precipitation were enhanced which has a great impact on runoff consistent with fang s fang et al 2018 research this paper shows that the increase in precipitation seasonality led to the decrease of runoff in some regions of the middle reaches of the yzrb under the background of global warming temperature affects runoff by changing evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration generally speaking increases in temperature will increase evapotranspiration resulting in decreases in runoff similar to the research of wang wang et al 2016 this paper reported the negative impacts of temperature on runoff in the yzrb in addition increases in potential evapotranspiration generally lead to decreases in runoff which is consistent with the research of ji ji et al 2021 and yang yang et al 2022 in terms of human activities this paper mainly discussed the effects of agricultural irrigation in the lower reaches and afforestation in the upper reaches on runoff in the yzrb constructions of agricultural water conservancy engineering facilities and the drawing of water from rivers have reduced the runoff of natural rivers wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 as it showed in this paper increased water use for agricultural irrigation has reduced runoff in the dongting lake basin and poyang lake basin vegetation restoration activities have increased vegetation coverages in the source region of the yzrb since the 1980 s as reported zhang et al 2020 however according to previous studies bai et al 2020 li et al 2017 increases in vegetation coverage would decrease the runoff due to the increase in evapotranspiration for dry areas although the increasing trend of m in the upper reaches of the yzrb was not obvious in this paper it still led to the reduction of runoff in this region and it does not conflict with previous research 4 4 limitations and uncertainties in this study the budyko approach considering the spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins was used to decompose the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes however there are some uncertainties and limitations in this study that deserve attention firstly this paper assumed that n followed a normal distribution few studies can determine the prior distribution of n bai et al 2019 donohue et al 2011 therefore the determination of n s prior distribution is still one of the main limitations of current research and will bring uncertainty to its estimation secondly in this paper the temporal variations of the budyko parameter were ignored however more and more studies have confirmed that it varies with time under the background of climate change and human activities jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2022 the time invariant parameter makes the application of the budyko framework simple but it cannot accurately reflect the time varying law of runoff therefore the budyko framework with the time varying parameter is more desirable for some basins that are undergoing drastic changes in addition the selection of influencing factors is one of the sources of uncertainty in the results of impact factor decomposition of runoff change overall further study is needed to overcome these limitations and reduce the uncertainties 5 conclusion considering the impacts of regional differences of multiple factors on runoff changes this paper first used the fcm algorithm to cluster 44 subbasins of the yzrb based on 10 hydrological related factors the hierarchical bayesian model which can estimate the impact of spatial correlations of multiple factors among basins was used to construct regional empirical equations of the budyko parameter n then the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes in the yzrb were decomposed based on the regional budyko equations the main conclusions are as follows 1 based on factors of precipitation temperature precipitation seasonality vegetation coverage saturated hydraulic conductivity elevation slope topographic wetness index irrigation water consumption and proportion of built up area per unit area 44 subbasins of the yzrb were clustered into 5 clusters factors showed significant differences between clusters and the dryness indexes increased from cluster 1 to 5 with the ranges changed from 0 69 1 01 to 1 19 3 11 the main factors control n in 5 clusters were t kc elev twi irr p kc slp twi t si p t and m twi respectively 2 the hierarchical bayesian model can accurately estimate the budyko parameter compared with the linear regression model for each cluster r 2 of hierarchical bayesian models was greater than 0 75 while it ranged from 0 4613 and 0 8740 in linear regression models rb of hierarchical bayesian models was less than 6 5 while it exceeded 6 15 of linear regression models rmse of hierarchical bayesian models was about 0 03 0 09 which was also smaller than 0 07 0 14 of linear regression models it can be concluded that considering the impacts of factor spatial correlations can improve the performance of the budyko framework 3 results of impact factor decomposition showed that runoff changes of each cluster caused by precipitation changes were about 9 80 34 69 3 27 3 93 and 7 68 respectively runoff changes caused by potential evapotranspiration were less than 3 rising temperature caused about 10 66 7 92 and 9 20 decreases in runoff in basins of cluster 1 3 and 4 respectively precipitation seasonality had a significant effect and reduced the runoff by 8 30 in basins of cluster 3 in terms of human activities irrigation water consumption resulted in reductions in the runoff by approximately 2 70 and 5 57 in the basins of cluster 1 and 2 respectively and the runoff decreased by approximately 4 31 due to vegetation restoration in the basins of cluster 5 declaration of competing interest the authors

2691,the present work aims to address the issue of the delineation of subsurface pathways carved in sedimentary aquifers from a stochastic perspective a probabilistic approach to recognize preferential alluvial pathways is proposed relying only upon borehole data these data can be employed to identify locations where the surficial aquifer is characterized by highly permeable alluvial hydrofacies a monte carlo mc approach is set up to simulate stochastic realizations of local alluvial soil ratios in a bi dimensional regularly gridded domain alluvial pathways are defined as the collection of cells whose simulated alluvial ratios are greater or equal to a first threshold imposed on the simulated sediments ratio and sharing a minimum occurrence probability equal to a second probabilistic threshold then probable highly permeable subsurface pathways throughout the domain for a real case study application within the province of lecco lombardy northern italy are appraised subsurface alluvial pathways delineated upon geological data show channel like patterns like their surface counterparts subsurface discharge peaks in the central portion of these pathways where permeable sediment probability is higher than elsewhere moreover subsurface alluvial pathways features are consistent with available hydrogeological and piezometric information the present approach has been also compared with a multiple points statistics approach proving better at capturing the spatial patterns of connected subsurface pathways therefore the present approach seems promising to be employed in the preliminarily understanding of large scale groundwater circulation patterns in particular for poorly monitored areas or serving as further analysis background keywords aquifers alluvial pathways groundwater subsurface connectivity geostatistics data availability data are freely available and their source is reported in the dedicated section 1 introduction most freshwater supply systems rely on groundwater as a primary source the management of groundwater resources strongly relies upon the understanding of subsurface hydraulic regimes water circulation in subsurface alluvial aquifers follows preferential flow paths paleochannels such as connected structures within sediment deposits thayer and ashmore 2016 which may occur both in saturated and unsaturated soils anderson et al 1997 playing a critical role in flow and transport processes mulligan et al 2007 samadder et al 2011 the delineation of connected subsurface pathways has been proposed for a wide range of applications in riparian areas zuecco et al 2019 assessed subsurface hydrological connectivity in headwater catchments consistently with data obtained from rain gauges as well as hester and fox 2020 highlighted the importance of preferential subsurface flow detection in watershed management while critical zones connected structures are strongly dependent on recharge intensity han et al 2020 groundwater pathways are mainly dependent on the connections between permeable sediment areas hence through the identification of main geological structures viaroli et al 2018 keesstra et al 2018 underlined how the issue of subsurface connectivity is critical for the spatial delineation of subsurface pathways within this context one of the most challenging issues is the identification and the possible quantification of subsurface connections between surface water bodies such as lakes or rivers and neighboring aquifers e g brunner et al 2009 lehr et al 2015 as an example mulligan et al 2007 underlined the importance of alluvial pathways in the characterization and quantification of discharge fluxes between coastal groundwater and seawater in coastal environments subsurface pathways in alluvial aquifers usually carve highly permeable fluvioglacial sedimentary areas as well as those located within the po river basin northern italy as described by fontana et al 2014 goebel et al 2017 pointed out that preferential subsurface pathways develop in complex networks of connected flow conduits in which spatial extension and geometric variability may be significant in different parts of an alluvial sedimentary area hester and fox 2020 assessed that the extension of these connected areas can widely extend in the proximity of surface water bodies or riparian areas having an important role in large scale pollution processes in water controlled systems as well as discussed by dhivert et al 2014 the recognition of these flow patterns into mostly bidimensional structures is therefore consistent with the nature of most alluvial aquifers in which planar extension is much larger than their modest thickness often measured a few tens of meters cavallin et al 1983 beretta et al 1984 fontana et al 2014 thayer and ashmore 2016 of course highly permeable sediments extensions in alluvial areas are not always connected to others the identification of local disconnections is as important as that of connected highly permeable structures toward the understanding of local flow patterns schmitt et al 2016 within the subsurface as well as underlined for surface catchments cislaghi et al 2018 where surface probabilistic connectivity models are dependent on the recognition of their subsurface connected counterparts upon available geological information the delineation of spatially organized subsurface pathways as tree like bidimensional structures is consistent with other methodologies proposed upon concepts of networked topologies e g zuecco et al 2019 which have been recently investigated relying on surface topography based methodologies e g zhang et al 2020 for shallow soils furthermore the spatial position of flow pathways within the subsurface seems to be intimately correlated with energetic features of groundwater flow e g local hydraulic gradient or discharge for phreatic aquifers zehe et al 2021 suggested that the thermodynamic based investigation of preferential pathways for flow and solute transport is critical to understanding complex heterogeneous groundwater systems moreover schiavo et al 2022 recently proposed a novel energy based methodology to delineate subsurface flow directions from a probabilistic perspective xu et al 2021 reconstructed subsurface preferential pathways through stochastic simulations of alluvial permeable facies sand ratios in a layered aquifer but this operation is limited to the context of the prior modeling of sediments transport in river deltas which is not the case of the present work one of the most important goals of stochastic modeling in groundwater applications is the quantification of the uncertainty associated with the estimation of soil properties e g bianchi janetti et al 2019 or contaminants molinari et al 2019 such as soil texture and water retention capacity abdu et al 2008 miltenberger et al 2021 suggested the role of the uncertainty related to highly permeable soil extensions although at the laboratory scale nevertheless stochastic simulations of permeable hydrofacies in highly heterogeneous aquifers performed upon the knowledge of few data such as borehole data in foothill or densely forested areas seems to be a promising way of studying subsurface connections such recently as proposed by jorreto zaguirre et al 2020 and bubnova et al 2020 however former studies do not provide a unique identification criterion of subsurface connections between water bodies and at least a preliminary analysis of subsurface discharges and the latter is limited to an automatic procedure to determine local sedimentary units from well data the knowledge of preferential pathways spatial distribution within an alluvial domain plays therefore a key role in each subsequent numerical modeling activity or analysis the determination of highly permeable flow corridors let one be able to properly understand the subsurface circulation patterns flow directions and a qualitative appraisal of locations where groundwater flow would probably convey or not this information is fundamental also when fixing numerical models boundary conditions which strongly constrain water flow main directions for example the choice of a constant or general head boundary in a certain location abruptly affects model results de filippis and giudici 2017 peeters and turnadge 2019 coelho et al 2017 pejman tahmasebi 2022 furthermore many areas under hydrogeological study are poorly monitored such as those located in arid and semi arid environments or forested and mountainous ones quay et al 2020 the need for prior information sources to choose proper conceptual models to be subsequently implemented in numerical ones seems both a relevant and a challenging issue candela et al 2014 thakur 2017 moreover many of these areas are under climate change effects radelyuk et al 2021 then improving the assessment of water resources even in a lack of data is a need of our times in addition the need for the delineation of preferential pathways within saturated soils is confirmed by the latest research via experimental techniques like infrared imaging and dye tracking at the laboratory scale chen et al 2022 these approaches are not possible at large scales of investigation e g at the municipality or regional scale and this strengthens the desirability of an approach reliable both at large scales and in absence of further models or a wide variety of data the present work aims to address these issues by proposing a novel and stochastic based methodology to identify where preferential pathways within aquifers are located and to evaluate their uncertain position and extension by only relying upon geological data a real application of the proposed methodology is offered by investigating aquifers within the province of lecco lombardy northern italy although subsurface channelization structures evidence had been already noticed for this study area neither an uncertain modeling of their spatial distribution nor at least a preliminary estimation of subsurface discharge they convey has been given moreover their drainage or recharge role in respect of surface water bodies through their permeable alluvial beds must be deepened too because of the lack of information in some areas or the intrinsic limits in classical geological models beretta et al 1984 the paper is organized in the following way sections 2 1 and 2 2 report how to prepare real available data and how to perform conditional sequential simulations respectively and how to delineate the most probable alluvial pathways from borehole data the area of interest where the latter locates is briefly introduced as well as the description of available data in section 3 1 results regarding the real case study application are reported within section 3 and subsections therein each for a different type of result a comparison of the present results with a multiple point statistics mps application i e the single normal equation simulation method snesim deutsch and journel 1997 remy and boucher 2009 is offered as a supplementary comparison methodology within the section 3 6 section 4 is dedicated to the discussion of the present approach limitations and further research opportunities and perspectives while major conclusions of the present work are summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 data preparation the current methodology relies on a dataset of n 1 n boreholes each one defined by its geographical coordinates x n x n y n each borehole information provides stratigraphic and facies description along its vertical extension see those employed in the present application within the data sources section and illustrated in fig 2 later on in section 3 the study of highly permeable pathways residing in the surficial aquifer starts from the analysis of geomaterials located between domain ground level and the bottom of the surficial aquifer surface geological facies within the surficial aquifer are divided into a certain number of classes conglomerate see later on in the manuscript the classification for the proposed application in fig 1 s righter side panel borehole facies are distinguished into most permeable called alluvial ones which may correspond to gravels and sands and non alluvial facies each borehole s prevalent geological nature is classified upon the prevalence of alluvial facies or non alluvial ones by averaging their volumetric ratios on local aquifer thickness as well as provided by borehole data then if a borehole is characterized by the prevalence of alluvial facies along its depth i e a volumetric ratio called f of alluvial facies higher than 0 50 its associated location identifies the position of a mostly alluvial surficial aquifer soil location otherwise the borehole is classified with a prevalent non alluvial facies composition i e it is characterized by a scarce volumetric ratio of permeable geomaterials 2 2 sequential simulations of large scale alluvial patterns the spatial organization of alluvial facies is modeled as a bi dimensional spatial random field and characterized in terms of a given structure of the associated variogram γ isaaks and srivastava 1989 for the present study an isotropic omnidirectional variogram model deutsch and journel 1997 remy and boucher 2009 has been employed to reproduce the spatial correlation of alluvial facies variogram parameter estimation is achieved through a maximum likelihood ml approach the present work aims to assess the probable spatial position and extension of highly permeable aquifer locations by relying on geological data only thus the uncertainty there is considered for further calculations regards aquifer local properties this consists of the depth averaged ratio of alluvial soil that can be simulated in a domain location therefore the geological uncertainty source here analyzed comes from the sequential simulation of many possible and equiprobable realizations of local alluvial soil ratios in line with this idea a monte carlo mc approach is employed to collect simulations of surficial aquifer alluvial soil spatial distribution under the geological uncertainty that a certain map location is associated with mostly alluvial soil or not alluvial pathways delineation can be achieved through a few steps a graph of the complete procedure is offered in fig 1 sequential simulations are performed starting from alluvial soil distribution i e alluvial ratio thresholds f described in section 2 1 and spatially described by variogram function γ see e g gomez hernandez et al 1999 gomez hernandez 2012 sanchez vila et al 2004 liu and pyrcz 2020 respectively illustrated in fig 1 s panels 1 and 2 such an mc approach returns r realizations of alluvial soil ratio thus embedding each domain cell i with as many simulated ratios of alluvial soil mc realizations are panel 3 fig 1 once r realizations are achieved two orders of thresholds must be employed the first threshold is imposed on alluvial soil ratios f within the unit interval local simulated ratio f x i is then classified as a prevalently alluvial or non alluvial aquifer location whether exceeding the prescribed threshold f or not this operation must be performed for each cell i for each realization r if this requirement is met then the f x i local value is rounded to 1 and the cell is classified as an alluvial soil otherwise f x i is rounded to 0 and local soil is classified as non alluvial as illustrated by fig 1 s panel 4 then the mean across alluvial non alluvial soil features i e cells embedded with 1 or 0 must be performed to achieve the probability χ x i of having an alluvial aquifer in cell i with a minimum alluvial sediments ratio f fig 1 s panel 5 the higher the probability χ x i in a cell the higher the probability of a location belonging to a highly permeable aquifer location adjacent cells sharing a minimum probability χ x i to simulate an alluvial soil ratio greater or equal to f are connected and therefore compose a preferential alluvial pathway fig 2 s panel 6 3 results 3 1 real case study area and available data the domain of interest is a 25 km 25 km area located in lombardy region northern italy see fig 2 and is mostly enclosed within the province of lecco the site is encased between rivers lambro and adda which are tributaries of the po river in this area 222 boreholes are available providing geological and stratigraphic information furthermore 8 hydrogeological sections for this area are available the study of each borehole stratigraphy lets one be able to identify which facies belong to the surficial phreatic aquifer surficial aquifer bottom depth identified as a mostly continuous poorly permeable rocky clayey horizon i e an aquitard can be identified at each borehole this enables one to identify which facies reside in the surficial rather than in deeper aquifer bodies fig 1 illustrates domain location and available data in particular borehole locations highlighted by yellow circles and provides information about the lithologic classification of borehole data belonging to the surficial aquifer in volumetric percentages as well as reported by the righter side panel in the latter a two ways lithological classification of hydrofacies i e alluvial and non alluvial ones is given the preparation of borehole data is treated in section 2 3 a piezometric map of the area dated 2013 already employed in schiavo et al 2022 currently used by local authorities is available and used for results interpretation moreover a continuous surface aquifer bottom surface has been obtained from boreholes illustrated in fig 2 for further details not included in the present study see schiavo et al 2022 all involved data are freely available and reported in data source section the analysis here proposed refers to the phreatic aquifer s saturated part relying upon borehole data and hydrogeological sections illustrated in fig 2 the former ones colored upon the prevalent facies the latter ones as black lines geological facies within the surficial aquifer are divided into 5 classes gravels sands clays compact conglomerates and fractured conglomerates illustrated in fig 2 s righter side panel then borehole facies are distinguished into most permeable called alluvial ones which correspond to gravels and sands and non alluvial facies alluvial and non alluvial facies are employed within the stochastic methodology presented in section 2 2 3 2 geological and hydrogeological framework the hydrogeology of the domain is mostly characterized by alluvial sandy soils of fluvioglacial nature consisting of a surficial alluvial aquifer while semi confined or locally confined others are delimited by mostly continuous clayey or rocky layers cavallin et al 1983 beretta et al 1984 surface water bodies are carved into quaternary fluvioglacial sedimentary extensions which mainly develop from the region of lakes in the northern part of the domain to the southern one alluvial sediments mainly retain high permeability properties as well as many paleochannels have been detected as subsurface counterparts of surface rivers or creeks such as those below river adda and molgora stream see fontana et al 2014 these paleochannels carve subsurface permeable layers whose thickness may be in the order of meters in the proximity of riparian areas fontana et al 2014 where the aquifer tends to adhere to rivers seepage face in the present study the average borehole depth is around 50 m while the domain planar extension is 25 km 25 km the present analysis refers to the phreatic aquifer s saturated part since domain extension is more than 2 orders of magnitude larger than a vertical one the latter is considered as well as a bi dimensional lattice to be discretized by regularly gridded cells of dimension l 100 m and a negligible vertical extension this approximation seems acceptable if one considers the thickness domain side ratio of 0 002 which is lower than other study cases where subsurface flow is considered mostly bidimensional see e g zuecco et al 2019 thus the domain under study counts a total of 62 500 cells the analysis starts from the knowledge of alluvial ratios located in cells hosting a borehole and embedded with a real number corresponding to the depth averaged ratio of alluvial soil 3 3 probabilistic delineation of subsurface alluvial pathways under geological uncertainty a collection of conditional realizations of alluvial soil are based on the dataset described in section 2 2 relying upon the variogram function described in section 2 3 sequential gaussian simulations i e sgsims see e g deutsch and journel 1997 gomez hernandez et al 1999 abdu et al 2008 remy and boucher 2009 have been employed as widely known and tested methodology to achieve conditional simulations of alluvial soil ratios alluvial facies spatial organization is achieved through an exponential zero nugget variogram with a range a 2 3 km where lower and upper ml confidence interval bounds are 2 0 and 2 6 km respectively some source of anisotropy in the correlated structure of subsurface pathways might be found if considering only the boreholes along rivers such as those along the adda river on the contrary the omnidirectional variogram approach has been chosen to delineate subsurface pathways not only along surface water bodies but across the whole domain fig 3 shows an example of 4 alluvial soil simulations in panels a b c and d respectively randomly chosen among r realizations each sgsim embeds every domain cell with a different alluvial soil ratio f x i within the unit interval fig 3 illustrates four random realizations of alluvial soil ratios for the domain of interest the classification of prevalent alluvial or non alluvial domain locations can be performed upon the use of thresholds based on a required ratio of alluvial soil f fig 4 illustrates the use of four different alluvial soil ratios for thresholding the mc realization depicted in fig 3 s panel a in fig 5 the mean across mc realizations in each domain cell i offers the probability χ x i of embedding a location with a minimum ratio of permeable sediments equal to f which is reported at the top of each fig 5 s panel results numerical stability not shown is assured through the numerical stability of the first statistical moments of the variable χ x i across r 2000 realizations this number of realizations is sufficient to provide the numerical stability of the local mean and variance of the variable χ x i the higher the threshold on alluvial sediments f the lower the number of cells fulfilling this condition thus the narrower the extension of most probable subsurface pathways like comparing the probabilistic assessment of pathways depicted in panel a f 0 50 and panel d f 0 95 an appraisal of the extension of these areas is given in fig 6 where four probability thresholds χ respectively 0 50 0 75 0 90 and 0 95 have been employed in combination with a single alluvial soil threshold f 0 75 delineating subsurface pathways juxtaposed to a piezometric map dated 2013 currently used by local authorities lower probability thresholds χ favor the delineation of highly continuous subsurface pathways while larger ones return highly discontinuous permeable extension prevalent alluvial pathways depicted in fig 4 s panels are mostly located in the proximity of surface river bodies where alluvial sediments are highly concentrated the orientation and direction of sediment structures are furthermore consistent with available piezometric reconstructions of the area as well as highlighted by red arrows interpreting mean subsurface flow directions moreover continuous subsurface connections can be identified between garlate lake and river adda banks and between pusiano and annone lakes and river adda see also fig 2 these findings are consistent with previous literature available about the hydrogeology of this area e g beretta et al 1984 fontana et al 2014 and introduce a novel probabilistic estimation of each subsurface pathway spatial extension 3 4 subsurface pathways and the relationship with preliminarily assessed subsurface discharge the probabilistic delineation of subsurface pathways in fig 8 offers the possibility to deepen the relationship between probability χ x i and local groundwater discharge q x i l s three subsurface sections have been chosen dashed black lines across main alluvial pathways depicted in fig 7 threshold with a sediment ratio of f 0 75 for each section s 1 s 2 and s 3 an enlargement is provided enabling one to visualize the position of each section in respect of alluvial pathways and piezometric map information on fig 7 righter side the spatial distribution of probability χ x i and surficial aquifer steady discharge q q x i are compared in panels a section s 1 b section s 2 and c section s 3 local discharge has been preliminarily calculated upon the local hydraulic gradient h i estimated from an available piezometric reconstruction the one juxtaposed to fig 8 s panels the subsurface wetted section a w i m2 and the average homogeneous saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat 1 84 10 4 m s through darcy s law q x i k sat h i a w i the use of a homogeneous k sat gives an overall appraisal of discharge spatial distribution and is consistent with other preliminary numerical results not shown the wetted section a w i is calculated as the product between cell width l introduced in section 2 2 and the difference between local water table h i m asl and local aquifer bottom elevation z i m asl while k sat has been estimated as the mean of each facies ratio conductivity upon the knowledge of volumetric facies distribution as reported in fig 2 hence k sat has been calculated through assigning reasonable average saturated conductivities to each facies ratio k1 10 5 m s k2 10 7 m s k3 10 4 m s k4 10 8 m s k5 5 10 3 m s yellow arrows indicate mean flow directions inferred from the piezometric map and are consistent with the simulated water table not shown fig 7 illustrates how spatial distributions of variables q x i and χ x i across sections follow a similar trend in all three sections enlarged the larger the probability of having an alluvial soil in a cell greater or equal to f the higher the estimated discharge both peak in the central part of hydraulic sections and are characterized by lower values in the proximity of hydraulic sections ends this is consistent with the idea of channelization in alluvial riverbeds suggesting that subsurface discharge fluxes are conveyed through main alluvial corridors moreover since a large alluvial ratio f in a cell means a large saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat those cells embedded with large discharges are more favorable to reside along the most probable permeable pathways at this point one may note that alluvial pathways have been identified upon the knowledge of geological data and not upon topographic ones which are usually employed to extract river networks for surface catchments this proof must be regarded as an overall indicator of the consistency between the spatial extension of discharge peaks and the most permeable aquifer pathways in fig 8 the alluvial pathway crossing hydraulic section s 1 black dashed line is illustrated using four thresholds f on permeable sediment ratio respectively f 0 50 panel a f 0 75 panel b f 0 90 panel c and f 0 95 panel d the collection of cells embedded in the highest values exhibits a clear channel like spatial pattern spatial distribution of probability χ x i tends to abruptly decrease by increasing the distance from cells with the highest values of χ x i as well as discharge spatial distribution offered in fig 7 s panel a as well as preliminarily discussed in fig 5 the width of pathways with sediment ratio exceeding threshold f is related to f itself the higher the ratio f the narrower the width of alluvial channels depicted in fig 8 s panels cells embedded with lower values of χ x i e g orange colored ones 0 6 χ x i 0 8 retain a spatial structure strikingly similar to that of alluvial sedimentary fans schmitt et al 2016 and consistent with geological reconstructions provided by fontana et al 2014 although these latter ones are investigated at a larger scale these channel like features emerge by an appraisal of local subsurface discharge along section s 1 the narrower the alluvial pathway composed of cells embedded with the highest values of χ x i the less uniform is local discharge across the section such as illustrated in fig 6 s panels a b c and d local subsurface discharge peaks in the central portion of the hydraulic section at the change of threshold f indicating that spatial features of cells embedded with the highest χ x i do not change local discharges simulated on the alluvial channel s righter side decrease when the sediment ratio threshold increases in addition the main directions of channel like most probable alluvial pathways are consistent for each one of fig 8 s panels with available piezometric information as well as highlighted by water table heads and yellow arrows similar results have been obtained for other relevant hydraulic sections such as those reported in fig 5 denoting a precise pattern of subsurface pathways as preferential corridors for subsurface fluxes 3 5 hydrogeologic consistency of subsurface pathways in alluvial aquifers the consistency of preferential subsurface pathways with other kinds of information can be appraised if permeable pathways spatial probability distribution χ x i is compared with hydrogeological sections as an example surface water bodies e g pusiano and garlate lakes treated in detail are acknowledged to lie over alluvial permeable beds which is confirmed by the hydrogeological setting of the area see section 2 1 and previously cited studies e g cavallin et al 1983 beretta et al 1984 fontana et al 2014 fig 9 illustrates one hydrogeological section sections a among the eight available ones which tracks are depicted in fig 1 section a already present in schiavo et al 2022 has been chosen because of its position alongside the river adda subsurface pathway section a s hydrogeological interpretation can be coupled with values of probability χ x i evaluated across the complete collection of mc based realizations of alluvial soil extracted upon four different alluvial sediment thresholds f hence one can appreciate whether the position of permeable groundwater bodies matches most of the locations with high values of probability χ f i e local maxima of the random variable χ x i for pathways thresholded by alluvial sediment ratio f along each hydrogeological section furthermore the higher the threshold imposed on sediment ratio f the less uniform the spatial distribution of variables along the section locations with the highest values over section a in fig 9 match those of phreatic wells with filters within the surficial aquifer enclosed in red dashed boxes this enables the identification of surficial aquifers circulation patterns since most alluvial phreatic aquifers highlighted by fig 9 s red dashed boxes can be appraised in correspondence to the highest probable pathway locations 3 6 comparison with a multiple points statistics approach the present work has been based on two points statistics through sgsims employment as defined within the methodology section and the use of the realizations ensemble to delineate the most probable subsurface pathways in this section a comparison with a single normal equation algorithm i e snesim see for details deutsch and journel 1997 remy and boucher 2009 is proposed this algorithm s procedure is applied to the same dataset described in section 3 1 fig 4 being alluvial non alluvial classified boreholes prevalent lithology assumed as hard data illustrated in fig 10 s panel a this way snesim simulations share the same starting point of the present methodology employing sgsims thus after step no 1 in fig 1 snesim simulations also need a soft probability distribution and a proper training image to avoid using a variogram based approach see fig 1 step 2 as further sources of information a continuous soft probability distribution is employed as the probability of identifying an alluvial location upon a minimum alluvial soil fraction of f 0 75 as well as illustrated in fig 10 panel b a zoom of this spatial distribution has been also illustrated in fig 8 panel b a proper training image is defined as the alluvial pathway carved upon a minimum alluvial fraction f 0 75 and a minimum occurrence probability of χ 0 75 which is illustrated in fig 10 panel c this image serves to train snesim s simulations to spatially predict alluvial or non alluvial features the employment of such a soft probability map and a so carved training image should return a result as similar as possible to those illustrated in figs 6 7 and 8 therefore a numerically stable ensemble of 500 snesim simulations has been achieved from aforementioned input data each simulation returns a continuous alluvial non alluvial spatial distribution whose total probabilities resemble those of alluvial and non alluvial training image locations being 0 2 and 0 8 respectively the final achievement is snesim s probability map obtained as the mean across snesim s simulations ensemble the latter is illustrated in the following fig 11 panel a while fig 5 panel b one is reported in figure s 10 panel b as a reference both these two panels have been thresholded upon a probability χ 0 75 to achieve the delineation of preferential pathways and respectively illustrated in fig 13 panels c and d snesim s simulations ensemble probability distribution of the variable χ appears to be highly constraint to borehole data location in predicting highly permeable subsurface pathways the highest values of χ therefore are located in proximity of borehole locations while other locations retain medium or low values of χ if compared with their mean across sgsims counterparts as one can appraise panels a s features of χ are much more channel like than panel b s ones the most interesting result can be noted if these probability fields are carved upon a probability threshold e g χ 0 75 this way fig 11 s panels a and b return panels c and d respectively the comparison between the latter two highlines very different spatial characterization of preferential pathways channel like features are not clearly highlighted from snesims ensemble panel d while just few locations retain alluvial like features but they are highly disconnected the two main ones are located in proximity of the lake of lecco in the northern part of the domain and in the southern domain area although these areas are embedded by the lowest elevations of the water table as one can appraise from contours in fig 11 s panels they do not be properly regarded as pathways connecting different domain areas thus the sgsim based approach seems more useful to delineate the most probable subsurface pathways throughout a whole inspection domain 4 discussion the present methodology is simple and reliable needing few geological data for the appraisal of large scale groundwater circulation pathways via understanding the probable location of preferential subsurface pathways the identification of mostly probable pathways within the subsurface may play a key role in the preliminary assessment of where the water goes and to appraise subsurface connections and disconnections this task performed upon the sole knowledge of geological data provides novel and useful insights toward a deeper comprehension of groundwater circulation systems however this methodology cannot replace a proper groundwater modeling activity but may be significantly helpful to the latter for several reasons i to have a clearer comprehension of the hydrogeological setting of an inspection domain and therefore to positively affect a conceptual modeling phase ii to enrich the available information to be employed in a numerical model thus giving the probable extension of highly permeable pathways whose cells to be embedded by high permeability values iii to return a spatial distribution of soil properties e g local depth averaged permeabilities priorly constrained to respect the hydrogeological nature of the aquifer hence complaining with borehole data and hydrogeologic sections information the present work proposes a bi dimensional approach which of course consists of a strong limitation to fully exploiting subsurface pathways the present approach offers feasible results and seems to perform better than other mps methods see section 3 6 in order to delineate subsurface connected pathways although the starting hard dataset is the same between the two methodologies the snesim approach does require i a prior knowledge of preferential alluvial pathways and ii a soft probability spatial distribution to be run which is not granted in conclusion the present approach requires fewer data and performs better in capturing preferential connected pathways than a mps one however a large scale appraisal of the latter ones may treat the problem by neglecting the vertical direction this does not mean that vertical fluxes through preferential pathways are not important but that the main information one might come up with is the planar assessment of their directions and spatial extension this point is strengthened by the fact that if on one side it is true that layer s permeability may significantly vary along the vertical direction phreatic aquifers may be preliminarily regarded as vertically homogeneous water bodies further research work should be conveyed to extend the present methodology to a 3d case the latter task seems reasonable whereas it might not significantly improve the large scale assessment of preferential pathways since surficial aquifers thickness is usually several orders of magnitude lower than aquifers extension as well as in the real case study offered in this paper another point of the discussion is the nature of subsurface water bodies those are generally considered heterogeneous volumes of different kinds of materials this work concludes with a novel way of thinking of them as counterparts of surface rivers not only from a water budget perspective but from a physical based viewpoint this conclusion is supported by the most recent research works while zehe et al 2021 underline the importance of preferential pathways both in flow and transport problems schiavo et al 2022 propose a novel methodology to treat subsurface pathways as river like elements from an energetic viewpoint in this sense the present work may be significantly helpful to underline the perspective on surface water and groundwater which seem not so dissimilar and may be regarded as two sides of the same water world thus the author proposes further attention to considering surface water and groundwater not only as two different water worlds see berkowitz and zehe 2020 but as two sides of a unique one the present work opens the way to a wide range of future research vectors the latter may consist in employing different geostatistical techniques to reproduce variogram functions such as co simulated realizations upon employing spatially continuous data or regarding conditioned stochastic fields of the variable of interest e g the effect of the mesh side dimension or the number of kriging conditioning points other opportunities may be provided through the usage of information related to other processes like surface ones provided by satellite data within water balance frameworks between surface and groundwater moreover a deeper investigation of energy related quantities and their probabilistic spatial assessment seems a promising path toward the detection of preferential pathways in complex groundwater systems 5 conclusions the proposed framework leads toward a novel way of approaching groundwater circulation in complex alluvial systems major results of the present study can be summarized as follows probable subsurface pathways throughout subsurface domains may be investigated upon a geostatistical methodology whose simulations are framed within an mc framework stochastic realizations of alluvial sediment ratios have been achieved by relying upon borehole data through proper variogram modeling moreover this kind of approach enables quantifying the probability of a subsurface connection among different aquifer locations alluvial soil realizations are thresholded on simulated sediment s ratio f to delineate locations embedded with a minimum ratio of permeable sediments preferential alluvial pathways can be delineated by using a probability threshold hence identifying the most probable pathways and their spatial features this enables to identify the extension of a preferential pathway and the probability associated with its delineation hence answering the issue of its uncertainty delineation this way a threshold χ returns the likelihood that groundwater flow follows that preferential pathway through alluvial sediments with a minimum f ratio therefore f may vary on the aquifer s hydrogeology thus one may require a high or low minimum ratio of alluvial sediments to carve a flow pathway throughout the subsurface most probable aquifer pathways locations appear as connected tongues of highly permeable sediments these are mostly located in the proximity of surface water bodies the most probable alluvial pathways retain clear channel like spatial features suggesting that the spatial organization of subsurface sediments follows oriented patterns driving conveying flow in a similar way to their surface counterparts the preliminary quantification of subsurface discharges across hydraulic sections reveals that discharge conveys in subsurface corridors peaking where more permeable sediments are more likely to be located the appraisal of preferential alluvial pathways spatial position is consistent with borehole data and information provided by available hydrogeological sections the results show that the highest probabilities of having a subsurface pathway are located where subsurface sedimentary water bodies are carved moreover preferential alluvial pathways resemble groundwater circulation patterns within the phreatic aquifer being consistent with the piezometric ones appraised for a currently used piezometric map data sources data repositories

2691,the present work aims to address the issue of the delineation of subsurface pathways carved in sedimentary aquifers from a stochastic perspective a probabilistic approach to recognize preferential alluvial pathways is proposed relying only upon borehole data these data can be employed to identify locations where the surficial aquifer is characterized by highly permeable alluvial hydrofacies a monte carlo mc approach is set up to simulate stochastic realizations of local alluvial soil ratios in a bi dimensional regularly gridded domain alluvial pathways are defined as the collection of cells whose simulated alluvial ratios are greater or equal to a first threshold imposed on the simulated sediments ratio and sharing a minimum occurrence probability equal to a second probabilistic threshold then probable highly permeable subsurface pathways throughout the domain for a real case study application within the province of lecco lombardy northern italy are appraised subsurface alluvial pathways delineated upon geological data show channel like patterns like their surface counterparts subsurface discharge peaks in the central portion of these pathways where permeable sediment probability is higher than elsewhere moreover subsurface alluvial pathways features are consistent with available hydrogeological and piezometric information the present approach has been also compared with a multiple points statistics approach proving better at capturing the spatial patterns of connected subsurface pathways therefore the present approach seems promising to be employed in the preliminarily understanding of large scale groundwater circulation patterns in particular for poorly monitored areas or serving as further analysis background keywords aquifers alluvial pathways groundwater subsurface connectivity geostatistics data availability data are freely available and their source is reported in the dedicated section 1 introduction most freshwater supply systems rely on groundwater as a primary source the management of groundwater resources strongly relies upon the understanding of subsurface hydraulic regimes water circulation in subsurface alluvial aquifers follows preferential flow paths paleochannels such as connected structures within sediment deposits thayer and ashmore 2016 which may occur both in saturated and unsaturated soils anderson et al 1997 playing a critical role in flow and transport processes mulligan et al 2007 samadder et al 2011 the delineation of connected subsurface pathways has been proposed for a wide range of applications in riparian areas zuecco et al 2019 assessed subsurface hydrological connectivity in headwater catchments consistently with data obtained from rain gauges as well as hester and fox 2020 highlighted the importance of preferential subsurface flow detection in watershed management while critical zones connected structures are strongly dependent on recharge intensity han et al 2020 groundwater pathways are mainly dependent on the connections between permeable sediment areas hence through the identification of main geological structures viaroli et al 2018 keesstra et al 2018 underlined how the issue of subsurface connectivity is critical for the spatial delineation of subsurface pathways within this context one of the most challenging issues is the identification and the possible quantification of subsurface connections between surface water bodies such as lakes or rivers and neighboring aquifers e g brunner et al 2009 lehr et al 2015 as an example mulligan et al 2007 underlined the importance of alluvial pathways in the characterization and quantification of discharge fluxes between coastal groundwater and seawater in coastal environments subsurface pathways in alluvial aquifers usually carve highly permeable fluvioglacial sedimentary areas as well as those located within the po river basin northern italy as described by fontana et al 2014 goebel et al 2017 pointed out that preferential subsurface pathways develop in complex networks of connected flow conduits in which spatial extension and geometric variability may be significant in different parts of an alluvial sedimentary area hester and fox 2020 assessed that the extension of these connected areas can widely extend in the proximity of surface water bodies or riparian areas having an important role in large scale pollution processes in water controlled systems as well as discussed by dhivert et al 2014 the recognition of these flow patterns into mostly bidimensional structures is therefore consistent with the nature of most alluvial aquifers in which planar extension is much larger than their modest thickness often measured a few tens of meters cavallin et al 1983 beretta et al 1984 fontana et al 2014 thayer and ashmore 2016 of course highly permeable sediments extensions in alluvial areas are not always connected to others the identification of local disconnections is as important as that of connected highly permeable structures toward the understanding of local flow patterns schmitt et al 2016 within the subsurface as well as underlined for surface catchments cislaghi et al 2018 where surface probabilistic connectivity models are dependent on the recognition of their subsurface connected counterparts upon available geological information the delineation of spatially organized subsurface pathways as tree like bidimensional structures is consistent with other methodologies proposed upon concepts of networked topologies e g zuecco et al 2019 which have been recently investigated relying on surface topography based methodologies e g zhang et al 2020 for shallow soils furthermore the spatial position of flow pathways within the subsurface seems to be intimately correlated with energetic features of groundwater flow e g local hydraulic gradient or discharge for phreatic aquifers zehe et al 2021 suggested that the thermodynamic based investigation of preferential pathways for flow and solute transport is critical to understanding complex heterogeneous groundwater systems moreover schiavo et al 2022 recently proposed a novel energy based methodology to delineate subsurface flow directions from a probabilistic perspective xu et al 2021 reconstructed subsurface preferential pathways through stochastic simulations of alluvial permeable facies sand ratios in a layered aquifer but this operation is limited to the context of the prior modeling of sediments transport in river deltas which is not the case of the present work one of the most important goals of stochastic modeling in groundwater applications is the quantification of the uncertainty associated with the estimation of soil properties e g bianchi janetti et al 2019 or contaminants molinari et al 2019 such as soil texture and water retention capacity abdu et al 2008 miltenberger et al 2021 suggested the role of the uncertainty related to highly permeable soil extensions although at the laboratory scale nevertheless stochastic simulations of permeable hydrofacies in highly heterogeneous aquifers performed upon the knowledge of few data such as borehole data in foothill or densely forested areas seems to be a promising way of studying subsurface connections such recently as proposed by jorreto zaguirre et al 2020 and bubnova et al 2020 however former studies do not provide a unique identification criterion of subsurface connections between water bodies and at least a preliminary analysis of subsurface discharges and the latter is limited to an automatic procedure to determine local sedimentary units from well data the knowledge of preferential pathways spatial distribution within an alluvial domain plays therefore a key role in each subsequent numerical modeling activity or analysis the determination of highly permeable flow corridors let one be able to properly understand the subsurface circulation patterns flow directions and a qualitative appraisal of locations where groundwater flow would probably convey or not this information is fundamental also when fixing numerical models boundary conditions which strongly constrain water flow main directions for example the choice of a constant or general head boundary in a certain location abruptly affects model results de filippis and giudici 2017 peeters and turnadge 2019 coelho et al 2017 pejman tahmasebi 2022 furthermore many areas under hydrogeological study are poorly monitored such as those located in arid and semi arid environments or forested and mountainous ones quay et al 2020 the need for prior information sources to choose proper conceptual models to be subsequently implemented in numerical ones seems both a relevant and a challenging issue candela et al 2014 thakur 2017 moreover many of these areas are under climate change effects radelyuk et al 2021 then improving the assessment of water resources even in a lack of data is a need of our times in addition the need for the delineation of preferential pathways within saturated soils is confirmed by the latest research via experimental techniques like infrared imaging and dye tracking at the laboratory scale chen et al 2022 these approaches are not possible at large scales of investigation e g at the municipality or regional scale and this strengthens the desirability of an approach reliable both at large scales and in absence of further models or a wide variety of data the present work aims to address these issues by proposing a novel and stochastic based methodology to identify where preferential pathways within aquifers are located and to evaluate their uncertain position and extension by only relying upon geological data a real application of the proposed methodology is offered by investigating aquifers within the province of lecco lombardy northern italy although subsurface channelization structures evidence had been already noticed for this study area neither an uncertain modeling of their spatial distribution nor at least a preliminary estimation of subsurface discharge they convey has been given moreover their drainage or recharge role in respect of surface water bodies through their permeable alluvial beds must be deepened too because of the lack of information in some areas or the intrinsic limits in classical geological models beretta et al 1984 the paper is organized in the following way sections 2 1 and 2 2 report how to prepare real available data and how to perform conditional sequential simulations respectively and how to delineate the most probable alluvial pathways from borehole data the area of interest where the latter locates is briefly introduced as well as the description of available data in section 3 1 results regarding the real case study application are reported within section 3 and subsections therein each for a different type of result a comparison of the present results with a multiple point statistics mps application i e the single normal equation simulation method snesim deutsch and journel 1997 remy and boucher 2009 is offered as a supplementary comparison methodology within the section 3 6 section 4 is dedicated to the discussion of the present approach limitations and further research opportunities and perspectives while major conclusions of the present work are summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 data preparation the current methodology relies on a dataset of n 1 n boreholes each one defined by its geographical coordinates x n x n y n each borehole information provides stratigraphic and facies description along its vertical extension see those employed in the present application within the data sources section and illustrated in fig 2 later on in section 3 the study of highly permeable pathways residing in the surficial aquifer starts from the analysis of geomaterials located between domain ground level and the bottom of the surficial aquifer surface geological facies within the surficial aquifer are divided into a certain number of classes conglomerate see later on in the manuscript the classification for the proposed application in fig 1 s righter side panel borehole facies are distinguished into most permeable called alluvial ones which may correspond to gravels and sands and non alluvial facies each borehole s prevalent geological nature is classified upon the prevalence of alluvial facies or non alluvial ones by averaging their volumetric ratios on local aquifer thickness as well as provided by borehole data then if a borehole is characterized by the prevalence of alluvial facies along its depth i e a volumetric ratio called f of alluvial facies higher than 0 50 its associated location identifies the position of a mostly alluvial surficial aquifer soil location otherwise the borehole is classified with a prevalent non alluvial facies composition i e it is characterized by a scarce volumetric ratio of permeable geomaterials 2 2 sequential simulations of large scale alluvial patterns the spatial organization of alluvial facies is modeled as a bi dimensional spatial random field and characterized in terms of a given structure of the associated variogram γ isaaks and srivastava 1989 for the present study an isotropic omnidirectional variogram model deutsch and journel 1997 remy and boucher 2009 has been employed to reproduce the spatial correlation of alluvial facies variogram parameter estimation is achieved through a maximum likelihood ml approach the present work aims to assess the probable spatial position and extension of highly permeable aquifer locations by relying on geological data only thus the uncertainty there is considered for further calculations regards aquifer local properties this consists of the depth averaged ratio of alluvial soil that can be simulated in a domain location therefore the geological uncertainty source here analyzed comes from the sequential simulation of many possible and equiprobable realizations of local alluvial soil ratios in line with this idea a monte carlo mc approach is employed to collect simulations of surficial aquifer alluvial soil spatial distribution under the geological uncertainty that a certain map location is associated with mostly alluvial soil or not alluvial pathways delineation can be achieved through a few steps a graph of the complete procedure is offered in fig 1 sequential simulations are performed starting from alluvial soil distribution i e alluvial ratio thresholds f described in section 2 1 and spatially described by variogram function γ see e g gomez hernandez et al 1999 gomez hernandez 2012 sanchez vila et al 2004 liu and pyrcz 2020 respectively illustrated in fig 1 s panels 1 and 2 such an mc approach returns r realizations of alluvial soil ratio thus embedding each domain cell i with as many simulated ratios of alluvial soil mc realizations are panel 3 fig 1 once r realizations are achieved two orders of thresholds must be employed the first threshold is imposed on alluvial soil ratios f within the unit interval local simulated ratio f x i is then classified as a prevalently alluvial or non alluvial aquifer location whether exceeding the prescribed threshold f or not this operation must be performed for each cell i for each realization r if this requirement is met then the f x i local value is rounded to 1 and the cell is classified as an alluvial soil otherwise f x i is rounded to 0 and local soil is classified as non alluvial as illustrated by fig 1 s panel 4 then the mean across alluvial non alluvial soil features i e cells embedded with 1 or 0 must be performed to achieve the probability χ x i of having an alluvial aquifer in cell i with a minimum alluvial sediments ratio f fig 1 s panel 5 the higher the probability χ x i in a cell the higher the probability of a location belonging to a highly permeable aquifer location adjacent cells sharing a minimum probability χ x i to simulate an alluvial soil ratio greater or equal to f are connected and therefore compose a preferential alluvial pathway fig 2 s panel 6 3 results 3 1 real case study area and available data the domain of interest is a 25 km 25 km area located in lombardy region northern italy see fig 2 and is mostly enclosed within the province of lecco the site is encased between rivers lambro and adda which are tributaries of the po river in this area 222 boreholes are available providing geological and stratigraphic information furthermore 8 hydrogeological sections for this area are available the study of each borehole stratigraphy lets one be able to identify which facies belong to the surficial phreatic aquifer surficial aquifer bottom depth identified as a mostly continuous poorly permeable rocky clayey horizon i e an aquitard can be identified at each borehole this enables one to identify which facies reside in the surficial rather than in deeper aquifer bodies fig 1 illustrates domain location and available data in particular borehole locations highlighted by yellow circles and provides information about the lithologic classification of borehole data belonging to the surficial aquifer in volumetric percentages as well as reported by the righter side panel in the latter a two ways lithological classification of hydrofacies i e alluvial and non alluvial ones is given the preparation of borehole data is treated in section 2 3 a piezometric map of the area dated 2013 already employed in schiavo et al 2022 currently used by local authorities is available and used for results interpretation moreover a continuous surface aquifer bottom surface has been obtained from boreholes illustrated in fig 2 for further details not included in the present study see schiavo et al 2022 all involved data are freely available and reported in data source section the analysis here proposed refers to the phreatic aquifer s saturated part relying upon borehole data and hydrogeological sections illustrated in fig 2 the former ones colored upon the prevalent facies the latter ones as black lines geological facies within the surficial aquifer are divided into 5 classes gravels sands clays compact conglomerates and fractured conglomerates illustrated in fig 2 s righter side panel then borehole facies are distinguished into most permeable called alluvial ones which correspond to gravels and sands and non alluvial facies alluvial and non alluvial facies are employed within the stochastic methodology presented in section 2 2 3 2 geological and hydrogeological framework the hydrogeology of the domain is mostly characterized by alluvial sandy soils of fluvioglacial nature consisting of a surficial alluvial aquifer while semi confined or locally confined others are delimited by mostly continuous clayey or rocky layers cavallin et al 1983 beretta et al 1984 surface water bodies are carved into quaternary fluvioglacial sedimentary extensions which mainly develop from the region of lakes in the northern part of the domain to the southern one alluvial sediments mainly retain high permeability properties as well as many paleochannels have been detected as subsurface counterparts of surface rivers or creeks such as those below river adda and molgora stream see fontana et al 2014 these paleochannels carve subsurface permeable layers whose thickness may be in the order of meters in the proximity of riparian areas fontana et al 2014 where the aquifer tends to adhere to rivers seepage face in the present study the average borehole depth is around 50 m while the domain planar extension is 25 km 25 km the present analysis refers to the phreatic aquifer s saturated part since domain extension is more than 2 orders of magnitude larger than a vertical one the latter is considered as well as a bi dimensional lattice to be discretized by regularly gridded cells of dimension l 100 m and a negligible vertical extension this approximation seems acceptable if one considers the thickness domain side ratio of 0 002 which is lower than other study cases where subsurface flow is considered mostly bidimensional see e g zuecco et al 2019 thus the domain under study counts a total of 62 500 cells the analysis starts from the knowledge of alluvial ratios located in cells hosting a borehole and embedded with a real number corresponding to the depth averaged ratio of alluvial soil 3 3 probabilistic delineation of subsurface alluvial pathways under geological uncertainty a collection of conditional realizations of alluvial soil are based on the dataset described in section 2 2 relying upon the variogram function described in section 2 3 sequential gaussian simulations i e sgsims see e g deutsch and journel 1997 gomez hernandez et al 1999 abdu et al 2008 remy and boucher 2009 have been employed as widely known and tested methodology to achieve conditional simulations of alluvial soil ratios alluvial facies spatial organization is achieved through an exponential zero nugget variogram with a range a 2 3 km where lower and upper ml confidence interval bounds are 2 0 and 2 6 km respectively some source of anisotropy in the correlated structure of subsurface pathways might be found if considering only the boreholes along rivers such as those along the adda river on the contrary the omnidirectional variogram approach has been chosen to delineate subsurface pathways not only along surface water bodies but across the whole domain fig 3 shows an example of 4 alluvial soil simulations in panels a b c and d respectively randomly chosen among r realizations each sgsim embeds every domain cell with a different alluvial soil ratio f x i within the unit interval fig 3 illustrates four random realizations of alluvial soil ratios for the domain of interest the classification of prevalent alluvial or non alluvial domain locations can be performed upon the use of thresholds based on a required ratio of alluvial soil f fig 4 illustrates the use of four different alluvial soil ratios for thresholding the mc realization depicted in fig 3 s panel a in fig 5 the mean across mc realizations in each domain cell i offers the probability χ x i of embedding a location with a minimum ratio of permeable sediments equal to f which is reported at the top of each fig 5 s panel results numerical stability not shown is assured through the numerical stability of the first statistical moments of the variable χ x i across r 2000 realizations this number of realizations is sufficient to provide the numerical stability of the local mean and variance of the variable χ x i the higher the threshold on alluvial sediments f the lower the number of cells fulfilling this condition thus the narrower the extension of most probable subsurface pathways like comparing the probabilistic assessment of pathways depicted in panel a f 0 50 and panel d f 0 95 an appraisal of the extension of these areas is given in fig 6 where four probability thresholds χ respectively 0 50 0 75 0 90 and 0 95 have been employed in combination with a single alluvial soil threshold f 0 75 delineating subsurface pathways juxtaposed to a piezometric map dated 2013 currently used by local authorities lower probability thresholds χ favor the delineation of highly continuous subsurface pathways while larger ones return highly discontinuous permeable extension prevalent alluvial pathways depicted in fig 4 s panels are mostly located in the proximity of surface river bodies where alluvial sediments are highly concentrated the orientation and direction of sediment structures are furthermore consistent with available piezometric reconstructions of the area as well as highlighted by red arrows interpreting mean subsurface flow directions moreover continuous subsurface connections can be identified between garlate lake and river adda banks and between pusiano and annone lakes and river adda see also fig 2 these findings are consistent with previous literature available about the hydrogeology of this area e g beretta et al 1984 fontana et al 2014 and introduce a novel probabilistic estimation of each subsurface pathway spatial extension 3 4 subsurface pathways and the relationship with preliminarily assessed subsurface discharge the probabilistic delineation of subsurface pathways in fig 8 offers the possibility to deepen the relationship between probability χ x i and local groundwater discharge q x i l s three subsurface sections have been chosen dashed black lines across main alluvial pathways depicted in fig 7 threshold with a sediment ratio of f 0 75 for each section s 1 s 2 and s 3 an enlargement is provided enabling one to visualize the position of each section in respect of alluvial pathways and piezometric map information on fig 7 righter side the spatial distribution of probability χ x i and surficial aquifer steady discharge q q x i are compared in panels a section s 1 b section s 2 and c section s 3 local discharge has been preliminarily calculated upon the local hydraulic gradient h i estimated from an available piezometric reconstruction the one juxtaposed to fig 8 s panels the subsurface wetted section a w i m2 and the average homogeneous saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat 1 84 10 4 m s through darcy s law q x i k sat h i a w i the use of a homogeneous k sat gives an overall appraisal of discharge spatial distribution and is consistent with other preliminary numerical results not shown the wetted section a w i is calculated as the product between cell width l introduced in section 2 2 and the difference between local water table h i m asl and local aquifer bottom elevation z i m asl while k sat has been estimated as the mean of each facies ratio conductivity upon the knowledge of volumetric facies distribution as reported in fig 2 hence k sat has been calculated through assigning reasonable average saturated conductivities to each facies ratio k1 10 5 m s k2 10 7 m s k3 10 4 m s k4 10 8 m s k5 5 10 3 m s yellow arrows indicate mean flow directions inferred from the piezometric map and are consistent with the simulated water table not shown fig 7 illustrates how spatial distributions of variables q x i and χ x i across sections follow a similar trend in all three sections enlarged the larger the probability of having an alluvial soil in a cell greater or equal to f the higher the estimated discharge both peak in the central part of hydraulic sections and are characterized by lower values in the proximity of hydraulic sections ends this is consistent with the idea of channelization in alluvial riverbeds suggesting that subsurface discharge fluxes are conveyed through main alluvial corridors moreover since a large alluvial ratio f in a cell means a large saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat those cells embedded with large discharges are more favorable to reside along the most probable permeable pathways at this point one may note that alluvial pathways have been identified upon the knowledge of geological data and not upon topographic ones which are usually employed to extract river networks for surface catchments this proof must be regarded as an overall indicator of the consistency between the spatial extension of discharge peaks and the most permeable aquifer pathways in fig 8 the alluvial pathway crossing hydraulic section s 1 black dashed line is illustrated using four thresholds f on permeable sediment ratio respectively f 0 50 panel a f 0 75 panel b f 0 90 panel c and f 0 95 panel d the collection of cells embedded in the highest values exhibits a clear channel like spatial pattern spatial distribution of probability χ x i tends to abruptly decrease by increasing the distance from cells with the highest values of χ x i as well as discharge spatial distribution offered in fig 7 s panel a as well as preliminarily discussed in fig 5 the width of pathways with sediment ratio exceeding threshold f is related to f itself the higher the ratio f the narrower the width of alluvial channels depicted in fig 8 s panels cells embedded with lower values of χ x i e g orange colored ones 0 6 χ x i 0 8 retain a spatial structure strikingly similar to that of alluvial sedimentary fans schmitt et al 2016 and consistent with geological reconstructions provided by fontana et al 2014 although these latter ones are investigated at a larger scale these channel like features emerge by an appraisal of local subsurface discharge along section s 1 the narrower the alluvial pathway composed of cells embedded with the highest values of χ x i the less uniform is local discharge across the section such as illustrated in fig 6 s panels a b c and d local subsurface discharge peaks in the central portion of the hydraulic section at the change of threshold f indicating that spatial features of cells embedded with the highest χ x i do not change local discharges simulated on the alluvial channel s righter side decrease when the sediment ratio threshold increases in addition the main directions of channel like most probable alluvial pathways are consistent for each one of fig 8 s panels with available piezometric information as well as highlighted by water table heads and yellow arrows similar results have been obtained for other relevant hydraulic sections such as those reported in fig 5 denoting a precise pattern of subsurface pathways as preferential corridors for subsurface fluxes 3 5 hydrogeologic consistency of subsurface pathways in alluvial aquifers the consistency of preferential subsurface pathways with other kinds of information can be appraised if permeable pathways spatial probability distribution χ x i is compared with hydrogeological sections as an example surface water bodies e g pusiano and garlate lakes treated in detail are acknowledged to lie over alluvial permeable beds which is confirmed by the hydrogeological setting of the area see section 2 1 and previously cited studies e g cavallin et al 1983 beretta et al 1984 fontana et al 2014 fig 9 illustrates one hydrogeological section sections a among the eight available ones which tracks are depicted in fig 1 section a already present in schiavo et al 2022 has been chosen because of its position alongside the river adda subsurface pathway section a s hydrogeological interpretation can be coupled with values of probability χ x i evaluated across the complete collection of mc based realizations of alluvial soil extracted upon four different alluvial sediment thresholds f hence one can appreciate whether the position of permeable groundwater bodies matches most of the locations with high values of probability χ f i e local maxima of the random variable χ x i for pathways thresholded by alluvial sediment ratio f along each hydrogeological section furthermore the higher the threshold imposed on sediment ratio f the less uniform the spatial distribution of variables along the section locations with the highest values over section a in fig 9 match those of phreatic wells with filters within the surficial aquifer enclosed in red dashed boxes this enables the identification of surficial aquifers circulation patterns since most alluvial phreatic aquifers highlighted by fig 9 s red dashed boxes can be appraised in correspondence to the highest probable pathway locations 3 6 comparison with a multiple points statistics approach the present work has been based on two points statistics through sgsims employment as defined within the methodology section and the use of the realizations ensemble to delineate the most probable subsurface pathways in this section a comparison with a single normal equation algorithm i e snesim see for details deutsch and journel 1997 remy and boucher 2009 is proposed this algorithm s procedure is applied to the same dataset described in section 3 1 fig 4 being alluvial non alluvial classified boreholes prevalent lithology assumed as hard data illustrated in fig 10 s panel a this way snesim simulations share the same starting point of the present methodology employing sgsims thus after step no 1 in fig 1 snesim simulations also need a soft probability distribution and a proper training image to avoid using a variogram based approach see fig 1 step 2 as further sources of information a continuous soft probability distribution is employed as the probability of identifying an alluvial location upon a minimum alluvial soil fraction of f 0 75 as well as illustrated in fig 10 panel b a zoom of this spatial distribution has been also illustrated in fig 8 panel b a proper training image is defined as the alluvial pathway carved upon a minimum alluvial fraction f 0 75 and a minimum occurrence probability of χ 0 75 which is illustrated in fig 10 panel c this image serves to train snesim s simulations to spatially predict alluvial or non alluvial features the employment of such a soft probability map and a so carved training image should return a result as similar as possible to those illustrated in figs 6 7 and 8 therefore a numerically stable ensemble of 500 snesim simulations has been achieved from aforementioned input data each simulation returns a continuous alluvial non alluvial spatial distribution whose total probabilities resemble those of alluvial and non alluvial training image locations being 0 2 and 0 8 respectively the final achievement is snesim s probability map obtained as the mean across snesim s simulations ensemble the latter is illustrated in the following fig 11 panel a while fig 5 panel b one is reported in figure s 10 panel b as a reference both these two panels have been thresholded upon a probability χ 0 75 to achieve the delineation of preferential pathways and respectively illustrated in fig 13 panels c and d snesim s simulations ensemble probability distribution of the variable χ appears to be highly constraint to borehole data location in predicting highly permeable subsurface pathways the highest values of χ therefore are located in proximity of borehole locations while other locations retain medium or low values of χ if compared with their mean across sgsims counterparts as one can appraise panels a s features of χ are much more channel like than panel b s ones the most interesting result can be noted if these probability fields are carved upon a probability threshold e g χ 0 75 this way fig 11 s panels a and b return panels c and d respectively the comparison between the latter two highlines very different spatial characterization of preferential pathways channel like features are not clearly highlighted from snesims ensemble panel d while just few locations retain alluvial like features but they are highly disconnected the two main ones are located in proximity of the lake of lecco in the northern part of the domain and in the southern domain area although these areas are embedded by the lowest elevations of the water table as one can appraise from contours in fig 11 s panels they do not be properly regarded as pathways connecting different domain areas thus the sgsim based approach seems more useful to delineate the most probable subsurface pathways throughout a whole inspection domain 4 discussion the present methodology is simple and reliable needing few geological data for the appraisal of large scale groundwater circulation pathways via understanding the probable location of preferential subsurface pathways the identification of mostly probable pathways within the subsurface may play a key role in the preliminary assessment of where the water goes and to appraise subsurface connections and disconnections this task performed upon the sole knowledge of geological data provides novel and useful insights toward a deeper comprehension of groundwater circulation systems however this methodology cannot replace a proper groundwater modeling activity but may be significantly helpful to the latter for several reasons i to have a clearer comprehension of the hydrogeological setting of an inspection domain and therefore to positively affect a conceptual modeling phase ii to enrich the available information to be employed in a numerical model thus giving the probable extension of highly permeable pathways whose cells to be embedded by high permeability values iii to return a spatial distribution of soil properties e g local depth averaged permeabilities priorly constrained to respect the hydrogeological nature of the aquifer hence complaining with borehole data and hydrogeologic sections information the present work proposes a bi dimensional approach which of course consists of a strong limitation to fully exploiting subsurface pathways the present approach offers feasible results and seems to perform better than other mps methods see section 3 6 in order to delineate subsurface connected pathways although the starting hard dataset is the same between the two methodologies the snesim approach does require i a prior knowledge of preferential alluvial pathways and ii a soft probability spatial distribution to be run which is not granted in conclusion the present approach requires fewer data and performs better in capturing preferential connected pathways than a mps one however a large scale appraisal of the latter ones may treat the problem by neglecting the vertical direction this does not mean that vertical fluxes through preferential pathways are not important but that the main information one might come up with is the planar assessment of their directions and spatial extension this point is strengthened by the fact that if on one side it is true that layer s permeability may significantly vary along the vertical direction phreatic aquifers may be preliminarily regarded as vertically homogeneous water bodies further research work should be conveyed to extend the present methodology to a 3d case the latter task seems reasonable whereas it might not significantly improve the large scale assessment of preferential pathways since surficial aquifers thickness is usually several orders of magnitude lower than aquifers extension as well as in the real case study offered in this paper another point of the discussion is the nature of subsurface water bodies those are generally considered heterogeneous volumes of different kinds of materials this work concludes with a novel way of thinking of them as counterparts of surface rivers not only from a water budget perspective but from a physical based viewpoint this conclusion is supported by the most recent research works while zehe et al 2021 underline the importance of preferential pathways both in flow and transport problems schiavo et al 2022 propose a novel methodology to treat subsurface pathways as river like elements from an energetic viewpoint in this sense the present work may be significantly helpful to underline the perspective on surface water and groundwater which seem not so dissimilar and may be regarded as two sides of the same water world thus the author proposes further attention to considering surface water and groundwater not only as two different water worlds see berkowitz and zehe 2020 but as two sides of a unique one the present work opens the way to a wide range of future research vectors the latter may consist in employing different geostatistical techniques to reproduce variogram functions such as co simulated realizations upon employing spatially continuous data or regarding conditioned stochastic fields of the variable of interest e g the effect of the mesh side dimension or the number of kriging conditioning points other opportunities may be provided through the usage of information related to other processes like surface ones provided by satellite data within water balance frameworks between surface and groundwater moreover a deeper investigation of energy related quantities and their probabilistic spatial assessment seems a promising path toward the detection of preferential pathways in complex groundwater systems 5 conclusions the proposed framework leads toward a novel way of approaching groundwater circulation in complex alluvial systems major results of the present study can be summarized as follows probable subsurface pathways throughout subsurface domains may be investigated upon a geostatistical methodology whose simulations are framed within an mc framework stochastic realizations of alluvial sediment ratios have been achieved by relying upon borehole data through proper variogram modeling moreover this kind of approach enables quantifying the probability of a subsurface connection among different aquifer locations alluvial soil realizations are thresholded on simulated sediment s ratio f to delineate locations embedded with a minimum ratio of permeable sediments preferential alluvial pathways can be delineated by using a probability threshold hence identifying the most probable pathways and their spatial features this enables to identify the extension of a preferential pathway and the probability associated with its delineation hence answering the issue of its uncertainty delineation this way a threshold χ returns the likelihood that groundwater flow follows that preferential pathway through alluvial sediments with a minimum f ratio therefore f may vary on the aquifer s hydrogeology thus one may require a high or low minimum ratio of alluvial sediments to carve a flow pathway throughout the subsurface most probable aquifer pathways locations appear as connected tongues of highly permeable sediments these are mostly located in the proximity of surface water bodies the most probable alluvial pathways retain clear channel like spatial features suggesting that the spatial organization of subsurface sediments follows oriented patterns driving conveying flow in a similar way to their surface counterparts the preliminary quantification of subsurface discharges across hydraulic sections reveals that discharge conveys in subsurface corridors peaking where more permeable sediments are more likely to be located the appraisal of preferential alluvial pathways spatial position is consistent with borehole data and information provided by available hydrogeological sections the results show that the highest probabilities of having a subsurface pathway are located where subsurface sedimentary water bodies are carved moreover preferential alluvial pathways resemble groundwater circulation patterns within the phreatic aquifer being consistent with the piezometric ones appraised for a currently used piezometric map data sources data repositories

2692,hydrological conditions in cold regions have been shown to be sensitive to climate change however a detailed understanding of how regional climate and basin landscape conditions independently influence the current hydrology and its climate sensitivity is currently lacking this study therefore compares the climate sensitivity of the hydrology of two basins with contrasted landscape and meteorological characteristics typical of eastern canada a forested boreal climate basin montmorency versus an agricultural hemiboreal climate basin acadie the physically based cold regions hydrological modelling crhm platform was used to simulate the current and future hydrological processes both basin landscape and regional climate drove differences in hydrological sensitivities to climate change projected peak swe were highly sensitive to warming particularly for milder baseline climate conditions and moderately influenced by differences in landscape conditions landscape conditions mediated a wide range of differing hydrological processes and streamflow responses to climate change the effective precipitation was more sensitive to warming in the forested basin than in the agricultural one due to reductions in forest canopy interception losses with warming under present climate precipitation and discharge were found to be more synchronized in the greater relief and slopes of the forested basin whereas under climate change they are more synchronized in the agricultural basin due to reduced infiltration and storage capacities flow through and over agricultural soils translated the increase in water availability under a warmer and wetter climate into higher peak discharges whereas the porous forest soils dampened the response of peak discharge to increased available water these findings help diagnose the mechanisms controlling hydrological response to climate change in cold regions forested and agricultural basins keywords cold regions hydrology climate sensitivity snowmelt forested basin agricultural basin hemiboreal climate boreal climate eastern canada data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land cover can have distinctive influences on snow accumulation pomeroy and gray 1995 in boreal forests up to 60 and 40 of cumulative snowfall can be intercepted and sublimated respectively hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 pomeroy et al 1998 compared to open areas snowmelt rates can be up to 70 lower in forests because of attenuated incoming shortwave radiation and reduced sensible and latent heat fluxes resulting from dampened wind speed by canopies varhola et al 2010 within forests while small clearings are sheltered by the nearby forest canopy larger clearings can lose snow accumulation via blowing snow erosion which can lead to less snow accumulation in clearings than in the adjacent coniferous forest broxton et al 2015 pomeroy et al 2012 pomeroy and gray 1995 over open and wind exposed areas blowing snow can transport and sublimate as much as 75 of the annual snowfall pomeroy and gray 1995 many cold regions have been reported to exhibit different sensitivities to temperature and precipitation change depending on their current cold season temperature regime governed by latitude and or elevation more drastic changes in snow cover were found to occur over regions with near freezing air temperatures whereas colder regions were found to be comparatively less sensitive to climate change aygün et al 2020a in northern europe for instance more pronounced declines in snow accumulation are projected in response to warming in the coastal and southern regions as they have milder temperatures compared to the interior and northern regions arheimer et al 2013 kellomäki et al 2010 räisänen and eklund 2012 stonevičius et al 2017 similarly in north america the most dramatic declines in snow accumulation are projected to occur in regions with mild cold seasons such as the coastal regions of north america brown and mote 2009 schnorbus et al 2014 have found that while snow water equivalent swe is projected to decline in the peace campbell and upper columbia river basins in british columbia canada the reductions are projected to be most drastic in the lower elevation and warmer coastal campbell watershed and less pronounced in the high elevation and colder interior upper columbia watershed köplin et al 2012 related climate change signals to physiographic properties including mean altitude slope elevation range and dominant land use in 186 basins in switzerland they showed that hydrological changes are strongly correlated to altitude which governs the mean annual temperature of a basin and the associated hydro climatological processes e g the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation and snowmelt while these studies showed that the present day climate of a region is an important indicator for explaining the responses of snow accumulation to climate change they did not resolve how the dominant land cover of a basin will modify the response of snow accumulation and runoff to climate change multiple studies have shown that forest harvesting can lead to increased peak flow as a result of higher snow accumulation due to reductions in snow interception by the canopy buttle et al 2009 moore and wondzell 2005 pomeroy et al 2012 whitaker et al 2002 other studies also reported higher peak flows when the forest cover is reduced or converted to agricultural fields or urban areas which was mostly explained by the increased surface runoff due to reduced infiltration capacities resulting from compaction of the soil brown et al 2005 chandler 2006 easton et al 2007 germer et al 2010 savary et al 2009 ziegler et al 2004 deforestation for agricultural or urban purposes has also been reported to be responsible for an increase in annual water yield brown et al 2005 dias et al 2015 savary et al 2009 which is mainly due to reduced evapotranspiration robinet et al 2018 these studies are helpful for understanding the impact of land cover changes on peak and annual flows but the question as to how each component of the basin landscape i e land cover topography and soil conditions affects its hydrological sensitivity to climate change has not been directly addressed by these studies exploring the relationships between basin characteristics and flow signatures in europe kuentz et al 2017 have reported that land cover is one of the most important determining factors on controlling flow signatures padrón et al 2017 on the other hand have shown that vegetation related factors have only a minor role on the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and evapotranspiration while climate related variables are the key controls while williams et al 2012 have found no evidence that regions with higher fractions of snowfall favor streamflow berghuijs et al 2014 later demonstrated that a higher fraction of snowfall is associated with higher mean annual streamflow for basins throughout the contiguous us sankarasubramanian et al 2001 have shown that the sensitivity of streamflow to changes in precipitation is lower in regions that have higher average annual snowpack depths compared to other regions in the us analyzing the climate sensitivities of floods across several british basins prudhomme et al 2013 did not find any clear geographical patterns on the contrary rice et al 2015 found that the geographical locations of river basins are highly influential on the variability of streamflow trends across the continental us they also showed that the topographic characteristics of basins elevation and slope are strongly related to streamflow trends within individual ecoregions on the other hand sawicz et al 2014 reported that land use provides no valuable information in describing the streamflow responses to climate change across the continental us these contrasting conclusions drawn in the literature regarding the roles of climatic factors and basin properties on streamflow highlight the need for more studies on this topic a top down approach where data from climate models drive hydrological models is often used to assess potential climate impacts on hydrology arnell and gosling 2016 minville et al 2008 sulis et al 2012 teutschbein et al 2015 however hydrological modelling studies become computationally expensive due to the increasing number of climate models and must be repeated whenever new climate projections become available kay et al 2021 some instead have thus adopted a less time consuming sensitivity based approach using existing climate change projections to calculate uniform seasonal or annual climatic changes over a region this approach allows investigating a wider spectrum of simple climate change scenarios against which updated climate projections can be compared aygün et al 2021 aygün et al 2020b lópez moreno et al 2013 prudhomme et al 2010 rasouli et al 2015 rasouli et al 2022 wetterhall et al 2011 whateley et al 2014 the main objective of this study is to find out the degree to which regional climate and landscape land cover topography and soil conditions explain the current snow accumulation and streamflow regimes and their sensitivity to climate change two basins were selected in eastern canada that represent contrasted landscape and meteorological conditions common in the region namely montmorency with a rugged forested landscape and cold humid boreal climate and acadie with a flat agricultural landscape and warmer less humid hemiboreal climate these two contrasted basins were unique in the region having both natural flow regimes and being sufficiently well instrumented to apply and validate a physically based hydrological model crhm pomeroy et al 2007 the two main questions addressed in this study are 1 what are the differences and similarities between the current and future hydrological processes in these two contrasted basins 2 what are the respective impacts of landscape and present day climate conditions on present and future snow accumulation and streamflow regimes this study is an attempt to advance efforts on understanding the relationship between current climate landscape characteristics and basin response to climate change in humid cold regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the montmorency and acadie basins are located in the st lawrence valley in eastern canada fig 1 the montmorency river basin which is the primary study area for this research is mostly dominated by forests 85 which are sub classified into mature coniferous forest 53 mixed forest 6 and regenerated forest 26 fig 1b forest clearings resulting from clear cutting and regeneration practices occupy about 8 of the basin area fig 1b intensive farming activities take place in the acadie river basin of which 77 is occupied by agricultural fields fig 1c current and future hydrology of the acadie were studied in a previous modelling study aygün et al 2020b the montmorency river basin fig 1b differs from the acadie river basin fig 1c in terms of landscape and meteorological conditions table 1 montmorency is dominated by forests on porous sandy loam over hilly uplands with varying altitudes whereas the acadie is occupied mostly by agricultural fields on compacted clay soils over flat lowlands table 1 montmorency has a boreal climate dfc peel et al 2007 which is colder and more humid than the hemiboreal climate dfb peel et al 2007 of acadie the annual air temperature is about 6 c higher in acadie than in montmorency table 1 winters are considerably colder in montmorency 12 4 c than in acadie 6 6 c in spring the air temperature is slightly below freezing point in montmorency 0 1 c while it is well above zero degree for acadie 6 3 c table 1 compared to the acadie river basin the montmorency river basin receives more precipitation and the snowfall ratio is almost twice that in acadie table 1 montmorency receives slightly more precipitation in winter than in spring whereas it is the other way around for acadie table 1 the montmorency river basin encloses two densely studied watersheds namely berev bassin bassin expérimental du ruisseau des eaux volées 20 km2 managed by laval university and lac laflamme 0 7 km2 managed by québec ministry of forests wildlife and parks mffp fig 1b while earlier studies in the lac laflamme carried out modelling of snow accumulation and melt barry et al 1990 plamondon et al 1984 prévost et al 1991 more recent studies focused on analyzing changes in soil water content

coniferous and mixed forest sites of the lac laflamme watershed fig 1b were acquired from the mffp daily river discharge measured at the forêt montmorency gauge id 051005 fig 1b were extracted from

the forêt montmorency weather station of environment and climate change canada fig 1b daily precipitation observations were disaggregated uniformly over the hours of a day the gaps in hourly and daily data about 2 of the whole period were filled with data from a mffp weather station located in the lac laflamme watershed fig 1b 1 7 km away from the forêt montmorency weather station the temperature

reliable portion of existing data 2 2 modelling approach following aygün et al 2020b the cold regions hydrological modelling crhm platform pomeroy et al 2007 was used to build a hydrological model for the montmorency river basin taking advantage of the object oriented and modular structure of crhm fang et al 2013 relevant physical process modules were selected to simulate the dominant hydrological processes in the montmorency river basin table s1 the model was discretized into 78 hydrological response units hrus that each represent one set of parameters and one control volume for mass and energy budgeting pomeroy et al 2007 zhou et al 2014 and are defined by land cover aspect slope and elevation classes see supplementary fig s1 building on earlier modelling results in acadie the model outputs from montmorency were compared with previous results from the acadie river basin aygün et al 2020b updated for this study subsurface flow and groundwater surface interactions in montmorency river basin were simulated using physically based parameters and principles on hillslopes using the hillslope module in crhm table s1 this module is a modified version of the soil moisture balance modules in crhm dornes et al 2008 fang et al 2010 comprising a near surface detention layer over two soil layers and a groundwater layer with provision for macropore flow between sub surface layers and from surface to groundwater fang et al 2013 the near surface detention layer allows the surface runoff to flow through a porous medium as a transient flow pathway which allows handling the water storage in loose organic material in the forest floor pomeroy et al 2016 horizontal and vertical flows from soil layers and groundwater layer are calculated based on darcy s law where brooks and corey s relationship brooks and corey 1964 is used to estimate the actual hydraulic conductivity in the unsaturated zone estimation of the parameters in the montmorency river basin was performed based on the well studied berev and lac laflamme watersheds section 2 1 fig 1b and also other snow dominated basins with similar landscape characteristics the soil profile parameters were estimated from previous studies performed at lac laflamme barry et al 1988 jutras 2012 ouimet and duchesne 2005 vegetation height and stalk diameter were obtained from the ecoforest mapsproduced in southern québec by themffp mature coniferous and mixed forest stands were assigned to have a stalk diameter of 60 cm and canopy height of 14 m whereas regenerated forest hrus were assigned a stalk diameter of 40 cm

subbasin of montmorency hadiwijaya et al 2020 isabelle et al 2020 parajuli et al 2020 the maximum canopy snow load capacity was set to 3 3 kg m2 and 6 3 kg m2 for regenerated forest and mature coniferous forest respectively these values are transferred from the studies performed in boreal forests of western canada hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 pomeroy et al 2012 all the hrus were routed to the

setup and results are given in aygün et al 2020b 2 3 perturbed climate the potential impacts of climate change on the hydrology of the montmorency river basin were explored via climate sensitivity analyses where the historical long term temperature and precipitation data 2005 2019 were perturbed according to the ensemble of climate projections produced by charron 2016 these projections were generated from a set of 11 downscaled global climate simulations provided by the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 charron 2016 they are produced for two greenhouse gas emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 and for two periods 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 for all the administrative regions in the province of québec charron 2016 based on these scenarios temperature warming up to 8 c 0 8 c at 1 c degree interval and an increase in total precipitation wetting up to 20 0 20 5 interval were considered in the sensitivity analyses these changes thus encompass the spread in projections for the mid and end of century under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios for the administrative region where the montmorency river basin is located fig 1 the climate sensitivity analyses carried out previously for the acadie river basin aygün et al 2020b were repeated by updating the reference climate period from 1996 2019 to 2005 2019 in order to match the reference climate period used in montmorency which had a shorter observational record therefore the results presented for the acadie river basin in this paper are modified from those presented in aygün et al 2020b the hydrological sensitivity of the montmorency river basin fig 1a was compared with that of the acadie river basin fig 1b by assessing the changes in snow and water fluxes using sensitivity response surfaces detailed comparisons were carried out for the 3 c and 6 c warming scenarios which respectively represent the mean warming projection for the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods under the high emission scenario for both basins charron 2016 these warming scenarios were modulated with a minimum 0 and maximum 20 increase in precipitation based on the range of existing scenarios in order to analyze the potential compensation effect of increasing precipitation on snow and water fluxes impacted by warming the reference run δt 0 c p 100 represents the historically averaged observed data for both basins over the 2005 2019 period 2 4 permuted baseline climate experiments in order to explore the respective roles of present day climates and basin landscape on the climate sensitivity of hydrological responses a set of climate sensitivity analyses were performed in which the historical climates of both basins were permuted historical 2005 2019 time series of air temperature and precipitation of the acadie river basin were thus used as meteorological inputs for the montmorency river basin and vice versa this resulted in climate sensitivity analyses for four distinct combinations of present day climate and landscapes acadie type landscape under its own hemiboreal climate acadie type landscape under montmorency boreal climate montmorency type landscape under its own boreal climate and montmorency type landscape under acadie hemiboreal climate the climate sensitivities of hydrological variables i e relative changes in hydrological variables in response to changes in temperature and precipitation were compared for the most likely climate change scenarios for the 2041 2070 period 3 c warming and or 20 increasing precipitation 3 results the model performance in simulating daily streamflow at the basin outlet for the 2005 2019 is slightly better in montmorency with a kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 of 0 82 and a mean bias of 0 6 fig s5a and c than in acadie with a kge of 0 69 and a mean bias of 1 8 aygün et al 2020b 3 1 simulated historical water fluxes montmorency receives 40 higher annual precipitation 1460 mm than acadie 1030 mm fig 2 a and b almost half 44 of the annual precipitation in montmorency occurs as snowfall whereas the snowfall ratio in acadie is 23 fig 2a and b in the southernly and warmer acadie evapotranspiration and streamflow are the two main outfluxes of the annual water balance each accounting for 45 of annual precipitation in montmorency mean annual streamflow 1067 mm 73 of annual precipitation is the largest outflux with only 18 of the annual precipitation being lost through evapotranspiration fig 2a and b groundwater is an important part of the hydrological system in montmorency which sources 48 513 mm of the streamflow as baseflow annual sublimation losses in montmorency 140 mm reach 22 of the annual snowfall compared with 14 29 mm in acadie in both basins snowmelt generates a substantial proportion montmorency 46 acadie 42 of the mean annual streamflow fig 2c and d the snowmelt contribution to annual streamflow is marked by the sharp increase in cumulative runoff in both basins during snowmelt periods may june in montmorency and april may in acadie the mean simulated annual peak swe in montmorency 405 mm fig 2c is about six times greater than that in acadie 65 mm fig 2d under historical climate conditions the annual peak swe in montmorency occurs on april 10 fig 2c which is more than a month later that in acadie where it presently occurs in early march fig 2d 3 2 responses of snow fluxes to warming the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation in both basins shown by percentages on panel a and b of fig 3 exhibits a decrease in response to warming under 6 c warming only 10 of the total precipitation occurs as snowfall in acadie fig 3b whilst the snowfall ratio in montmorency drops to 23 fig 3a which is equal to the snowfall ratio in acadie under reference climate conditions fig 3b the amount of snowmelt in both basins is lower under warmer temperatures due to these decreased snowfall ratios fig 3a and b intercepted snow sublimation removes a considerable amount of snow 132 mm year 21 of the annual snowfall in montmorency under reference climate conditions fig 3c this is because montmorency is dominated by coniferous trees fig 1b and table 1 that intercept a sizeable fraction of seasonal snowfall which subsequently sublimates over the long winter warming air temperatures in montmorency reduce the total sublimation from intercepted snowfall to 104 mm and 79 mm with 3 c and 6 c warming respectively fig 3c which can be explained by the reduced snowfall ratio and increased unloading and drip of intercepted snow from the forest canopy fig 3a in comparison with the canopy sublimation sublimation from the snowpack surface is very low reaching only 1 2 of the annual snowfall in montmorency under reference climate conditions fig 3c in acadie on the other hand annual sublimation is mostly composed of snowpack sublimation 20 8 mm year 9 of the annual snowfall whereas the canopy sublimation loss 4 mm year 1 7 of the annual snowfall is the smallest term of the snow mass balance under the reference climate conditions fig 3d these contrasted sublimation losses can be explained with the landscape of acadie which is dominated by well exposed open agricultural fields fig 1c and table 1 that are subjected to high winds and relatively high surface sublimation rates while only 17 of the basin is covered by forest of which 60 is deciduous therefore resulting in relatively small canopy sublimation losses at the basin scale compared to the reference climate conditions the snowpack sublimation to snowfall ratio is higher in both basins under warmer temperatures fig 3c and d which can be explained by the greater available energy for sublimation under warmer temperatures canopy sublimation ratios are also greater particularly in montmorency under warmer temperatures fig 3c these higher sublimation ratios suggest that sublimation is a more efficient snow removal process under warmer temperatures since relative humidity and wind speed remain unchanged in the climate sensitivity experiments higher sublimation to snowfall ratio implies that the saturated vapor pressure at the snow air interface increases more on average than the atmospheric vapor pressure leading to a greater water vapour deficit and hence higher sublimation fluxes while there is no blowing snow sublimation component in the forested montmorency as blowing snow transport is suppressed by the tall vegetation blowing snow sublimation reaches 2 of the annual snowfall under reference climate conditions in more open acadie fig 3d in comparison with the other sublimation components in acadie blowing snow sublimation shows the greatest sensitivity to warming declining by 74 and 90 with 3 c and 6 c warming respectively fig 3d this is due to the increasing inter crystal bond strength and cohesion of snow as it warms which raises the threshold wind speed required to initiate saltation li and pomeroy 1997 3 3 altered snow regimes in response to climate change the annual peak swe the mean annual maximum swe decreases in response to warming in both basins fig 4 a and d with more dramatical changes simulated for acadie while the peak swe declines by about 10 per c warming in montmorency fig 4a the peak swe in acadie decreases by 60 per c warming fig 4d the lower swe sensitivity in the montmorency is due to the colder temperatures in this region compared to the acadie table 1 under 3 c warming which represents the mean warming projection for the mid century for both basins the decline in peak swe in acadie 79 is twice as great as in montmorency 38 fig 4a and d under this scenario a 20 increase in precipitation would compensate 48 of the decline in peak swe in montmorency but only 13 in acadie fig 4a and d a 6 c warming which represents the mean warming for the 2071 2100 period under the high emission scenario reduces peak swe in montmorency by 70 from 405 mm to 115 mm fig 4a and d which is still greater than the peak swe in acadie under reference climate conditions 65 mm fig 2d the annual peak swe shifts towards earlier dates under almost every warming scenario in both basins with greater shifts simulated for acadie for instance peak swe advances by less than a month in montmorency under 3 c warming while the same scenario causes the peak swe in acadie to shift by almost two months fig 4b and e the peak swe timing changes the fastest within the 1 2 c warming band in both basins but with comparatively fast changes in peak swe only in acadie snowmelt rates are slower under all warming scenarios in both basins as long as there is no increase in precipitation fig 4c and f like the peak swe response surface patterns fig 4a and d snowmelt rates decline uniformly by 10 15 per c warming in montmorency whereas in acadie snowmelt rates decrease faster reaching 60 for a 1 c warming this is because warming leads to shallower snowpacks which melt out earlier in the year when the available energy is lower therefore leading to overall slower melt rates fig 4c and f also suggest a possibility for faster snowmelt rates in the future when limited warming 1 c for acadie and 2 5 c for montmorency is accompanied by increasing precipitation fig 4c and f the faster melt rates could reflect the higher incoming energy available for deeper snowpack under wetting and limited warming scenarios 3 4 comparison of peak streamflow sensitivities the annual peak discharge the mean annual peak discharge could increase by up to 25 and 40 in montmorency and acadie respectively depending on the warming and wetting scenario fig 5 a and c this zone of positive peak discharge sensitivity is delineated by the 0 contour in fig 5a and c below which the peak streamflow shows an increase in montmorency a 20 increase in precipitation could compensate peak flow declines due to warming up to 2 9 c however beyond 3 c warming impacts predominate and peak flow decreases which can be attributed to the declining peak snow accumulation fig 4a fig 5c indicates a two layer positive sensitivity zone for acadie while the increasing peak flow in the first layer warming 1 c in fig 5c is attributed to the higher snow accumulation in response to increasing precipitation and limited warming 1 c see fig 4d the second layer warming 1 c can be explained by increasing peak flows under a mixed rain and snowmelt winter regime as explained next warming causes a shift in peak streamflow timing towards earlier dates in both basins with greater shifts simulated for acadie fig 5b and d which is in line with the earlier peak swe occurrence under warming scenarios see fig 4b and e the peak streamflow in acadie shifts by 80 days earlier in response to 1 c warming fig 5d and occurs before the peak swe date under the same warming level fig 4e this finding suggests that the peak flow in acadie desynchronizes from the peak snow accumulation in response to a 1 c warming i e shifting towards a rain dominated flood regime for montmorency the timing of peak streamflow is relatively less sensitive to warming compared to the timing of peak swe particularly for a warming between 0 c and 5 c figs 5b vs 4b however beyond 6 c warming the peak streamflow timing in montmorency becomes very responsive advancing by roughly four months when warming reaches 7 c under these conditions the streamflow regime of montmorency shifts towards a mixed snowmelt rainfall regime with peak flows occurring in winter under the mid and late 21st century climate conditions where warming exceeds 3 c the acadie river mean hydrograph becomes very flashy and the seasonality of precipitation dictates the magnitude and timing of the annual peak streamflow fig 6 c in other words the flow regime of the acadie river basin transits to a rainfall dominated regime in contrast the montmorency river conserves a distinct snowmelt dominated peak streamflow under 3 c warming moreover a 20 increase in precipitation almost completely 94 counterbalances the decline in peak streamflow caused by a 3 c warming however the peak flow occurs 19 days earlier i e on april 23 rather than may 9 fig 6a this highlights the considerable uncertainty in future peak streamflow magnitude and timing and flood risks caused by the uncertainties in projected precipitation meanwhile a 6 c warming causes the flow regime of montmorency river to transit from a snowmelt to a mixed snowmelt rainfall regime fig 6a warmer temperatures cause an increase in winter flows in both basins fig 6a c which is due to the increase in available water in winter due to higher winter rainfall and more frequent mid winter snowmelt events increasing precipitation leads to even higher streamflow in winter this is also evident in the increase in flows with exceedance probabilities between 0 3 and 0 8 and 0 5 and 1 respectively for acadie and montmorency fig 6b and d in acadie winter becomes the active flood season fig 6c due to abundant rainfall which combines with winter snowmelt and restricted infiltration over frozen ground 3 5 relative influence of climate and basin landscape on the hydrological sensitivity to climate change the respective roles of the landscape features and current climates on the climate sensitivity of key hydrological variables are explored in figs 7 10 in these figures the vertical double arrows indicate the effect of regional climate while the horizontal double arrows indicate the influence of the basin landscape on the climate sensitivity of a given hydrological variable the reference historically averaged baseline values of hydrological variables under a given regional climate and landscape combination are given in parentheses in panel a of figs 7 10 3 5 1 peak swe focusing on the impact of regional climate on the current peak swe vertical arrows in fig 7 a the snowier and colder boreal climate of montmorency leads to greater peak snow accumulation compared to the hemiboreal acadie climate under both montmorency type 405 mm 67 mm and acadie type 431 mm 65 mm landscapes on the other hand the sensitivity of peak swe to warming and wetting is found to be much more pronounced when both landscapes are forced by the warmer and drier hemiboreal baseline climate than by the colder and more humid boreal climate vertical arrows in fig 7a c this highlights the strong dependence of the climate sensitivity of the peak swe to current climate conditions under hemiboreal climate conditions a small to moderate warming leads to significant declines in snow accumulation due to already milder temperatures table 1 looking at the influence of landscape on the current peak swe horizontal arrows in fig 7a the simulated peak swe in montmorency type landscape 405 mm is smaller than in acadie type landscape 431 mm when both are forced by the boreal climate this can be explained by the higher canopy sublimation losses in the forested landscape of montmorency fig 3c when forced by the warmer and rainier hemiboreal climate canopy sublimation losses in montmorency decrease but the total sublimation ratio in montmorency 36 remains greater than that in acadie 13 because the greater canopy storage in coniferous forests favour sublimation losses however the amount of snowmelt simulated in mid winter in montmorency is about 22 less than that in acadie mostly due to the reduced amount of energy available for melting in montmorency due to shading by the forest canopy this reduced snowmelt compensates the sublimation losses and as a result the peak snow accumulations are almost equal in both basins when forced by the hemiboreal climate fig 7a likewise the peak swe shows rather similar sensitivities to warming and wetting in both basins when forced by the same climate fig 7a c these results show that the climate sensitivity of the peak swe is little influenced by the landscape but is rather shaped by the current regional climate condition 3 5 2 water fluxes present day mean annual effective precipitation was calculated as the sum of snowmelt and net rainfall where net rainfall is the gross rainfall minus interception losses hence differences in baseline mean effective precipitation and their climate sensitivities reflect the varying influences of interception losses canopy sublimation and evaporation and snowpack sublimation losses present day effective precipitation values in parentheses in fig 8 a are higher under montmorency boreal baseline climate due to its higher precipitation rates and cooler and more humid climate fig 3a vs b the montmorency type landscape enhances the climate sensitivity of the effective precipitation especially under hemiboreal baseline climate forcing fig 8a c in order to quantify the influence of vegetation on effective precipitation sensitivity the montmorency basin was artificially deforested in the crhm model keeping the other basin properties including soils unchanged the results showed that sensitivity of effective precipitation in the deforested montmorency decreased to 20 21 in response to combined 3 c warming and 20 wetting which is lower than for the forested montmorency type landscape 23 27 and almost the same as for the acadie type landscape 20 21 fig 8c these findings highlight that canopy interception plays the key role in modifying the effective precipitation sensitivity to climate change snow storage on the canopy in montmorency is particularly prone to sublimation losses so that the shift from snowfall to rainfall in a warmer climate decreases the canopy losses and leads to a slight increase in mean effective precipitation fig 8a even if canopy and snowpack sublimation themselves become more efficient under a warmer climate i e sublimation ratios increase see fig 3c this suggests that sublimation from the canopy is a more efficient process to remove water from this basin than is evaporation of rainfall stored on the canopy due to the longer residence time of snow on the canopy compared to rainfall the fraction of the mean effective precipitation that infiltrates in the soils varies among the two landscapes and climates the buffering capacity is defined similarly to herron and wilson 2001 and van tiel et al 2021 as the ratio of the annual mean infiltration to the mean effective precipitation which describes the capacity of a catchment to absorb surface water fluxes and its ability to attenuate runoff and enhance baseflow this buffering capacity is lower in the acadie type landscape 0 40 0 59 than in the montmorency type landscape 0 54 0 73 when both are forced by the same climate fig 9a this suggests that the acadie type landscape is more efficient in translating available water to runoff than montmorency type landscape due to its compacted agricultural soils that have a lower infiltration and storage capacity the more porous forested soils of montmorency on the other hand favour infiltration fig 9 a b artificially deforesting montmorency has a small impact on its buffering capacity fig 9a which confirms that soils predominantly affect the buffering capacity of montmorency the buffering capacity of both basins is also higher when forced by the warmer and less snowy hemiboreal climate than by the cooler and wetter boreal climate fig 9a b which suggests that infiltration decreases overall under a snowier climate because the soil remains saturated and or frozen for a long period during spring snowmelt and restrict infiltration the buffering capacity of montmorency type landscape increases in response to warming and wetting especially under boreal climate forcing fig 9b c reflecting the larger snowfall to rainfall conversion for this climate fig 3a b and decreased influence of snowmelt on soil saturation the correlation coefficient between average monthly discharge and precipitation corr q p fig 10a provides information on the current seasonal synchronicity between discharge and precipitation for each combination of climate and landscape the basins exhibit much lower corr q p 0 07 0 14 i e a lower synchronicity between p and q when forced by the baseline boreal climate montmorency than when forced by the hemiboreal acadie climate corr q p 0 28 0 66 fig 10 a this is because the colder boreal climate has a higher snowfall fraction 44 than the hemiboreal climate 23 fig 3a and b which results in larger snow accumulation storage that delays discharge until late spring this snow damming effect is very climate sensitive in many basins around the world and its loss is an indicator of decoupling between snowpack and streamflow regimes lópez moreno et al 2020 the coupling between p and q increases under all climate change scenarios and climate landscape combinations fig 10a c with the largest increases simulated under a combined warming and wetting scenario fig 10c the boreal montmorency climate enhances the climate sensitivity of corr q p i e the relative increase in the seasonal synchronicity between precipitation and streamflow is more pronounced in this climate however although the climate sensitivity of corr q p is higher under boreal climate forcing the absolute corr q p values themselves remain expectedly higher under the rainier hemiboreal climate forcing suggesting a more synchronized q and p the montmorency type landscape favors larger present day corr q p under the same baseline climate conditions especially under the warmer and rainier acadie climate fig 10a this can be explained by two factors i the higher slopes in montmorency which favor more rapid transfers of surface runoff ii the higher infiltration and storage capacity that lead to a smoother hydrograph in montmorency compared to acadie see fig 6 the lag 1 autocorrelation of monthly streamflow is indeed correspondingly higher for the montmorency type landscape 0 21 than for the acadie type landscape 0 09 which would act to increase corr q p fig 10a to isolate the effect of slopes from soil effects crhm model parameters describing hru slopes were artificially lowered for montmorency to approximately match those in acadie this resulted in a corr q p of 0 22 when forced by the acadie climate which is lower than the original value 0 66 in fig 10a and more comparable to the acadie type landscape under acadie climate 0 28 in fig 10a the higher slopes in montmorency thus appear to explain the current day tighter coupling between q and p especially under a rainier climate under a changing climate however the montmorency type landscape leads to smaller increases in the synchronicity between p and q corr q p compared to the acadie type landscape fig 10a c this can be explained by the greater increases in the buffering capacity of the montmorency type landscape under climate change as described in the previous section fig 9c 3 5 3 peak discharge the response of peak discharge to warming and wetting is illustrated in fig 11 present day peak discharges are higher under the boreal climate 0 16 0 24 m3 s km2 than under the hemiboreal climate 0 05 0 06 m3 s km2 fig 11a as the current peak swe is greater and the buffering capacity is lower for the boreal climate figs 7a and 9a interestingly streamflow regimes show less sensitivity to warming fig 11a than do snowpack regimes fig 7a under any baseline climate and landscape conditions when the slopes are artificially lowered in montmorency type landscape to match those in acadie the present day peak discharge decreases by about 20 under both boreal climate 0 13 m3 s km2 and hemiboreal climate 0 04 m3 s km2 this means that higher slopes lead to higher peak discharges yet the acadie type landscape which has lower slopes exhibits higher present day peak discharges than the montmorency type landscape under both climates fig 11a due to its lower buffering capacity fig 9a peak q shows a stronger sensitivity to warming under the boreal climate 15 to 18 than under the hemiboreal climate conditions 8 to 9 fig 11a this is opposite to the much greater sensitivity of peak swe seen under the hemiboreal climate compared to the boreal climate in response to the same level of warming fig 7a this dichotomy occurs because when the hemiboreal climate is warmed by 3 c the peak q decouples from the snow cycle fig 5d so that the large declines in peak swe fig 7a do not translate into large changes in peak q fig 11a while warming alone leads to an overall decline in peak discharge combined warming and wetting results in higher peak discharges for all climate and landscape combinations except for the montmorency type landscape under its own climate fig 11c the hemiboreal climate shows a greater sensitivity 37 47 of peak flow to wetting than the boreal climate 18 24 fig 11b which can be explained by the greater increases in peak swe under the hemiboreal climate in response to wetting fig 7b similarly the significant declines in peak swe in response to combined warming and wetting of the hemiboreal baseline climate fig 7c are not reflected by decreasing peak flows which rather rise by 20 24 fig 11c this is due to increased precipitation in the form of rainfall leading to increased annual peak runoff net rainfall snowmelt infiltration supplementary fig s6f in contrast when forced with the boreal baseline climate the peak q remains synchronized with the peak snowmelt timing under 3 c warming fig 5b and the peak q of both basins responds more strongly to changes in peak swe even though the declines in peak swe are smaller fig 7a in other words under a combined wetting and warming scenario peak discharge responds more strongly to changes in precipitation rainfall in the hemiboreal baseline climate while peak discharge is comparatively more sensitive to warming in the boreal baseline climate due to snowpack depletion effects fig 11c reveals that basin landscape can lead to asymmetric changes in peak q in response to climate change despite an increase in available mean effective precipitation in response to combined warming and wetting in montmorency under its own boreal climate fig 8c the mean runoff declines supplementary fig s6c which in turn leads to a 1 decline in peak q fig 11c the same degree of warming and wetting also leads to a similar decrease in peak q by 0 5 in the artificially deforested montmorency these findings reveal that the soil characteristics play the major role in governing the response of peak flow to climate change and that the forested porous soils buffer the increased mean water fluxes and lead to decreased mean runoff supplementary fig s6c and peak q fig 11c this effect is well illustrated in fig 9 which shows that the buffering capacity of the montmorency type landscape increases under a warming wetting scenario especially for the boreal baseline climate fig 9b c contrary to the montmorency type landscape under boreal climate the acadie type landscape under boreal climate shows an increase in peak q in response to warming and wetting fig 11c this suggests that the increase in mean effective precipitation simulated for acadie under the boreal baseline climate fig 8c translates into an increase in mean runoff fig s6c and as a result peak q increases fig 11c hence our results suggest that the reduced infiltration and storage capacity of the agricultural soils are less apt to buffer the increased runoff and lead to increased peak flow 4 discussion 4 1 simulated water balance in montmorency our model simulations demonstrate that 28 of the total precipitation left as evapotranspiration and sublimation in montmorency river basin for the 2005 2019 period which broadly agrees with observations reported for the berev subbasin of montmorency 34 isabelle et al 2020 30 schilling et al 2021 simulated sublimation itself only accounted for about 10 of the annual precipitation in the basin which is within the range 5 13 reported by parajuli et al 2020 for the berev subbasin of montmorency over the 2005 2019 period snowmelt contributed 46 of the simulated annual streamflow in the montmorency river basin which is in line with the contribution 45 47 reported by isabelle et al 2020 for the berev subbasin of montmorency over the 2016 2018 period the simulated soil moisture also exhibited a good match with the observations figs s3 and s4 suggesting that the model represents fairly well infiltration and thus the recharge process our results highlight that there is a significant contribution from groundwater flow to streamflow as baseflow in montmorency groundwater flow provided 48 of the annual streamflow for the 14 years of simulation period in montmorency this is of a similar magnitude with the 50 groundwater contribution to streamflow calculated from on site tracer experiments in the berev subbasin of montmorency for the 2017 2018 period schilling et al 2021 despite the relatively simple treatment of groundwater flow in chrm these results suggest an adequate representation of groundwater contribution to streamflow 4 2 landscape and climate influence on present day hydrological processes when both basins are forced by the snowier boreal climate less snow accumulates in the montmorency type landscape fig 7a due to higher canopy sublimation losses fig 3c which is consistent with previous studies that reported less snow accumulation in a forested basin than in an agricultural basin in russia gelfan et al 2004 and less snow accumulation in forested sites compared with nearby open environments in cold regions of europe koivusalo and kokkonen 2002 and north america jost et al 2007 varhola et al 2010 on the other hand when forced by the hemiboreal climate reduced mid winter snowmelt was simulated in the forested basin due to shading which compensated the canopy interception losses such that both basins exhibited similar maximum snow accumulations fig 7a this is in agreement with varhola et al 2010 and veatch et al 2009 who have shown that reduced mid winter and spring ablation rates in forests can offset the lesser accumulation resulting in snowpacks being thicker in forests than in open areas gelfan et al 2004 veatch et al 2009 although higher than in acadie fig 3d the ratio of canopy interception sublimation to snowfall 21 in montmorency fig 3c is lower than the 25 45 values reported from colder and drier boreal forest environments essery et al 2003 such as the southern boreal forest in saskatchewan pomeroy and gray 1995 pomeroy et al 1998 this is because montmorency river basin has a humid climate dfc peel et al 2007 which limits the sublimation essery and pomeroy 2001 however it is important to note that although the canopy sublimation ratio is lower for montmorency than for the drier climate of saskatchewan the absolute amount is greater which is explained by the higher amount of snowfall fig 3a and hence longer duration for which intercepted snow is exposed to the atmosphere in montmorency on the other hand the simulated canopy sublimation to snowfall ratio in montmorency fig 3c is higher than the 10 canopy sublimation loss estimated for the umpqua national forest in oregon us storck et al 2002 where the climate is warmer and more humid which results in more rapid unloading and in limited sublimation essery et al 2003 the canopy sublimation losses in montmorency decrease by about 7 per c fig 3c which is similar to that recently reported for a southern boreal forest of western canada 6 per c he et al 2021 decreasing canopy sublimation losses in response to warming was also found to explain the increase in effective precipitation in the forested landscape fig 8 when forced by common climate conditions the annual peak discharge was found to be higher in the acadie type landscape fig 11a which shows that the lower buffering capacity i e reduced infiltration and storage capacity fig 9a of agricultural soils favor runoff despite the lower slopes compared to the more rugged montmorency type landscape 4 3 landscape and climate influence on hydrological sensitivity to climate change slower snowmelt rates were simulated in both basins in response to warming fig 4c and f which is consistent with findings in some other snowmelt dominated regions located in europe lópez moreno et al 2013 and north america musselman et al 2017 rasouli et al 2014 rasouli et al 2019b trujillo and molotch 2014 where snowmelt occurs before the summer solstice essery et al 2020 in contrast faster snowmelt rates could occur in the future when limited warming 1 c for acadie and 2 5 c for montmorency is accompanied by increasing precipitation fig 4c f which is similar to the increased snowmelt rates in response to warming reported for relatively deeper swe regions 150 mm across the northern hemisphere wu et al 2018 and increased rates in the northern boreal forest of the northwest territories canada where snowfall increases along with rising temperature krogh and pomeroy 2019 these results suggest that changes in snowmelt rate are influenced not only by warming but also by increasing precipitation and future snowmelt rate can be either lower or higher depending on the regional climate and snow regimes and whether the snowmelt period is shifted by changing climate into a lower or higher insolation season similar to the findings from the inter comparison study of carey et al 2010 in northern basins the boreal climate with higher precipitation as snow exhibited a lower correlation between precipitation and discharge than the hemiboreal climate fig 9 the declining snow accumulation in response to warming therefore leads to more synchronized precipitation and discharge regarding the impact of basin landscape the increase in correlation between p and q in response to climate change is greater in the acadie type landscape which presents more compacted soils with smaller storage capacity smaller buffering capacity fig 9a highlighting the influence of soil characteristics on the climate sensitivity of precipitation discharge synchronicity streamflow regimes showed less sensitivity to warming fig 11a compared to the changes in peak snowpack accumulation fig 7a under all baseline climate and landscape combinations this finding is in agreement with the conclusion from a recent worldwide comparison of high mountain snowpack and streamflow sensitivities to climate warming lópez moreno et al 2020 notwithstanding the colder boreal climate was found to enhance the sensitivity of peak q to warming due to the persisting dominant influence of the snow cycle on streamflow but to reduce the sensitivity to wetting compared to the hemiboreal climate fig 11 in other words a higher snowfall fraction in a basin fig 3a buffers against extreme streamflow response to increasing precipitation which is consistent with the conclusions of previous studies conducted in north america by sankarasubramanian et al 2001 dethier et al 2020 and more recently by robles et al 2021 in both montmorency and acadie the streamflow regimes were projected to shift towards a more rainfall dominated regime under warmer temperatures with faster transition projected for acadie fig 5e peak discharge in basins with a mild hemiboreal winter climate could increase in response to a combination of 3 c warming and 20 increasing precipitation due the substantial conversion of snowfall to rainfall combined with enhanced winter snowmelt which together lead to higher surface runoff extremes in winter fig 11c the acadie type landscape with its reduced buffering capacity fig 9c is more sensitive to this scenario than the montmorency type landscape whose increased buffering capacity fig 9c attenuates extreme rainfall snowmelt events this finding is in agreement with a recent study over selected north american mountain basins where higher storage and infiltration capacity due to forestation resulted in decreased high flows in a warmer and wetter future rasouli et al 2019a conversely under a colder boreal climate and for the same climate change scenario 3 c warming and 20 increasing precipitation the streamflow remains largely synchronized with the snowpack regime the bulk of snowmelt continues to occur in the spring with more limited conversion of snowfall to rainfall which attenuates extreme runoff events however basins respond differently to the increased water inputs in the more impervious acadie type landscape the amount of runoff but not its intensity increases and leads to higher peak discharge in the spring while the porous soils of montmorency type landscape largely buffer the increased flux resulting in decreased runoff amount and lower peak discharge fig 11c 4 4 limitations and prospects this study aimed to assess how present day climate and landscape conditions modulate the hydrological sensitivity while the potential impacts of climate change on vegetation such as the reduction in stomatal conductance le et al 2011 decline in canopy lai caused by warming boulanger et al 2017 and the forest disturbance due to fire or insects seidl et al 2017 were not considered this imposes a limitation on the computed hydrological sensitivities since including future vegetation changes is likely to modulate the hydrological responses to climate change in snowmelt dominated basins rasouli et al 2019a and elsewhere gerten et al 2004 however including feedbacks from changing vegetation due to climate change would complicate isolating the effect of current vegetation on the hydrological sensitivity to climate change this study thus demonstrates how current landscape conditions affect the hydrological sensitivity but future changes in vegetation and or land use could invariably contribute to changes in water fluxes within the catchments and should be considered for more accurate climate change impact assessments it is also worth noting that many of the subjective choices made when choosing parameterizations and assigning parameters in physically based hydrological models can have a significant impact on the magnitude of the output uncertainty the separation of precipitation into rainfall or snowfall is one of the most sensitive parameterizations when simulating cold regions hydrological processes harder and pomeroy 2013 underestimation overestimation of rainfall can advect less more energy to snowpack decrease increase snowpack liquid content lead to earlier later warming and ripening and in turn impact the magnitude and timing of snowmelt streamflow peak flow pomeroy et al 2016 in this study the total precipitation was partitioned between liquid and solid precipitation using a psychometric energy balance method proposed by harder and pomeroy 2013 rainfall fraction was calculated as a function of the temperature of falling precipitation estimated using the air temperature and relative humidity future studies could use in situ records of precipitation phase made in the berev watershed pierre et al 2019 to calibrate air temperature precipitation phase relationships to reduce errors in phase partitioning while most of the model parameters were prescribed based on observations and previous studies within the basins some parameters such as maximum canopy snow load capacity and maximum active layer thickness of snow were borrowed from basins with similar landscape conditions which introduce uncertainties in the hydrological models future studies are required to perform detailed parameter sensitivity analyses to fully quantify the uncertainty in hydrological simulations 5 conclusion a physically based hydrological model was set up using the cold regions hydrological modelling crhm platform driven with current climate data and perturbed by projected annually uniform changes in temperature and precipitation to analyze the influences of these changes on the hydrological regime of two archetypical climates and landscapes of the st lawrence river in eastern canada namely a rugged and forested basin with boreal climate montmorency north shore and a relatively level agricultural basin with hemiboreal climate acadie south shore on a regional perspective the main finding is that although these basins are not very far from each other 400 km their distinct present day meteorological conditions lead to different hydrological sensitivities to the same climate perturbation the faster and more dramatic hydrological changes were simulated for acadie in response to warming due to its milder present day climate table 1 by the mid century the snow accumulation in acadie is projected to almost completely by 80 vanish while the peak snow accumulation in montmorency declines by less than 50 by the end of the century acadie is projected to be completely dominated by rainfall runoff mechanisms whereas the snowmelt continues to play a dominant role on the peak runoff in montmorency these results have important implications for regional water management adaptation strategies in addition to the regional findings this study more broadly illustrates the contrasted hydrological behaviours that can arise under present and future climates in cold forested and agricultural landscapes of the globe competing mechanisms were found between the current climate conditions and the landscape characteristics which dictate the amounts of snow accumulations this interplay between regional climate and the landscape features greatly impacts the climate sensitivity of the basins i e how snow accumulation snowmelt runoff and streamflow responded to a common climate change signal the major findings are as follows i a forested landscape can present a lower or equal amount of snow accumulation compared to an agricultural environment depending on the regional climate that governs the compensation effect between canopy sublimation losses on the one hand and reduced snowmelt due to forest shading on the other hand ii the response of peak swe to climate change depends only on regional climate and is not impacted by basin landscape iii sublimation rate declines in a warmer climate due to faster decreasing snow availability iv basin topography and soil characteristics influence in different ways the synchronization between precipitation and discharge steeper basin slopes favor a tighter coupling between precipitation and discharge whereas the more porous soils with higher infiltration capacity dampen the sensitivity of this coupling to climate v a more impervious agricultural landscape tends to translate the climate variability to higher peak flows whereas a forested landscape can absorb the same degree of variability and even lead to reduced flows afforestation therefore can be an important way of mitigating the future climate change induced hydrological extremes particularly in colder cold regions vi the attenuation of extreme flows by forested landscapes in response to climate change is climate dependent it is more efficient in present day colder temperature regime than in milder cold regions where greater conversions from snowfall to rainfall in response to warming can overwhelm the buffering capacity of even

2692,hydrological conditions in cold regions have been shown to be sensitive to climate change however a detailed understanding of how regional climate and basin landscape conditions independently influence the current hydrology and its climate sensitivity is currently lacking this study therefore compares the climate sensitivity of the hydrology of two basins with contrasted landscape and meteorological characteristics typical of eastern canada a forested boreal climate basin montmorency versus an agricultural hemiboreal climate basin acadie the physically based cold regions hydrological modelling crhm platform was used to simulate the current and future hydrological processes both basin landscape and regional climate drove differences in hydrological sensitivities to climate change projected peak swe were highly sensitive to warming particularly for milder baseline climate conditions and moderately influenced by differences in landscape conditions landscape conditions mediated a wide range of differing hydrological processes and streamflow responses to climate change the effective precipitation was more sensitive to warming in the forested basin than in the agricultural one due to reductions in forest canopy interception losses with warming under present climate precipitation and discharge were found to be more synchronized in the greater relief and slopes of the forested basin whereas under climate change they are more synchronized in the agricultural basin due to reduced infiltration and storage capacities flow through and over agricultural soils translated the increase in water availability under a warmer and wetter climate into higher peak discharges whereas the porous forest soils dampened the response of peak discharge to increased available water these findings help diagnose the mechanisms controlling hydrological response to climate change in cold regions forested and agricultural basins keywords cold regions hydrology climate sensitivity snowmelt forested basin agricultural basin hemiboreal climate boreal climate eastern canada data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land cover can have distinctive influences on snow accumulation pomeroy and gray 1995 in boreal forests up to 60 and 40 of cumulative snowfall can be intercepted and sublimated respectively hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 pomeroy et al 1998 compared to open areas snowmelt rates can be up to 70 lower in forests because of attenuated incoming shortwave radiation and reduced sensible and latent heat fluxes resulting from dampened wind speed by canopies varhola et al 2010 within forests while small clearings are sheltered by the nearby forest canopy larger clearings can lose snow accumulation via blowing snow erosion which can lead to less snow accumulation in clearings than in the adjacent coniferous forest broxton et al 2015 pomeroy et al 2012 pomeroy and gray 1995 over open and wind exposed areas blowing snow can transport and sublimate as much as 75 of the annual snowfall pomeroy and gray 1995 many cold regions have been reported to exhibit different sensitivities to temperature and precipitation change depending on their current cold season temperature regime governed by latitude and or elevation more drastic changes in snow cover were found to occur over regions with near freezing air temperatures whereas colder regions were found to be comparatively less sensitive to climate change aygün et al 2020a in northern europe for instance more pronounced declines in snow accumulation are projected in response to warming in the coastal and southern regions as they have milder temperatures compared to the interior and northern regions arheimer et al 2013 kellomäki et al 2010 räisänen and eklund 2012 stonevičius et al 2017 similarly in north america the most dramatic declines in snow accumulation are projected to occur in regions with mild cold seasons such as the coastal regions of north america brown and mote 2009 schnorbus et al 2014 have found that while snow water equivalent swe is projected to decline in the peace campbell and upper columbia river basins in british columbia canada the reductions are projected to be most drastic in the lower elevation and warmer coastal campbell watershed and less pronounced in the high elevation and colder interior upper columbia watershed köplin et al 2012 related climate change signals to physiographic properties including mean altitude slope elevation range and dominant land use in 186 basins in switzerland they showed that hydrological changes are strongly correlated to altitude which governs the mean annual temperature of a basin and the associated hydro climatological processes e g the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation and snowmelt while these studies showed that the present day climate of a region is an important indicator for explaining the responses of snow accumulation to climate change they did not resolve how the dominant land cover of a basin will modify the response of snow accumulation and runoff to climate change multiple studies have shown that forest harvesting can lead to increased peak flow as a result of higher snow accumulation due to reductions in snow interception by the canopy buttle et al 2009 moore and wondzell 2005 pomeroy et al 2012 whitaker et al 2002 other studies also reported higher peak flows when the forest cover is reduced or converted to agricultural fields or urban areas which was mostly explained by the increased surface runoff due to reduced infiltration capacities resulting from compaction of the soil brown et al 2005 chandler 2006 easton et al 2007 germer et al 2010 savary et al 2009 ziegler et al 2004 deforestation for agricultural or urban purposes has also been reported to be responsible for an increase in annual water yield brown et al 2005 dias et al 2015 savary et al 2009 which is mainly due to reduced evapotranspiration robinet et al 2018 these studies are helpful for understanding the impact of land cover changes on peak and annual flows but the question as to how each component of the basin landscape i e land cover topography and soil conditions affects its hydrological sensitivity to climate change has not been directly addressed by these studies exploring the relationships between basin characteristics and flow signatures in europe kuentz et al 2017 have reported that land cover is one of the most important determining factors on controlling flow signatures padrón et al 2017 on the other hand have shown that vegetation related factors have only a minor role on the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and evapotranspiration while climate related variables are the key controls while williams et al 2012 have found no evidence that regions with higher fractions of snowfall favor streamflow berghuijs et al 2014 later demonstrated that a higher fraction of snowfall is associated with higher mean annual streamflow for basins throughout the contiguous us sankarasubramanian et al 2001 have shown that the sensitivity of streamflow to changes in precipitation is lower in regions that have higher average annual snowpack depths compared to other regions in the us analyzing the climate sensitivities of floods across several british basins prudhomme et al 2013 did not find any clear geographical patterns on the contrary rice et al 2015 found that the geographical locations of river basins are highly influential on the variability of streamflow trends across the continental us they also showed that the topographic characteristics of basins elevation and slope are strongly related to streamflow trends within individual ecoregions on the other hand sawicz et al 2014 reported that land use provides no valuable information in describing the streamflow responses to climate change across the continental us these contrasting conclusions drawn in the literature regarding the roles of climatic factors and basin properties on streamflow highlight the need for more studies on this topic a top down approach where data from climate models drive hydrological models is often used to assess potential climate impacts on hydrology arnell and gosling 2016 minville et al 2008 sulis et al 2012 teutschbein et al 2015 however hydrological modelling studies become computationally expensive due to the increasing number of climate models and must be repeated whenever new climate projections become available kay et al 2021 some instead have thus adopted a less time consuming sensitivity based approach using existing climate change projections to calculate uniform seasonal or annual climatic changes over a region this approach allows investigating a wider spectrum of simple climate change scenarios against which updated climate projections can be compared aygün et al 2021 aygün et al 2020b lópez moreno et al 2013 prudhomme et al 2010 rasouli et al 2015 rasouli et al 2022 wetterhall et al 2011 whateley et al 2014 the main objective of this study is to find out the degree to which regional climate and landscape land cover topography and soil conditions explain the current snow accumulation and streamflow regimes and their sensitivity to climate change two basins were selected in eastern canada that represent contrasted landscape and meteorological conditions common in the region namely montmorency with a rugged forested landscape and cold humid boreal climate and acadie with a flat agricultural landscape and warmer less humid hemiboreal climate these two contrasted basins were unique in the region having both natural flow regimes and being sufficiently well instrumented to apply and validate a physically based hydrological model crhm pomeroy et al 2007 the two main questions addressed in this study are 1 what are the differences and similarities between the current and future hydrological processes in these two contrasted basins 2 what are the respective impacts of landscape and present day climate conditions on present and future snow accumulation and streamflow regimes this study is an attempt to advance efforts on understanding the relationship between current climate landscape characteristics and basin response to climate change in humid cold regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the montmorency and acadie basins are located in the st lawrence valley in eastern canada fig 1 the montmorency river basin which is the primary study area for this research is mostly dominated by forests 85 which are sub classified into mature coniferous forest 53 mixed forest 6 and regenerated forest 26 fig 1b forest clearings resulting from clear cutting and regeneration practices occupy about 8 of the basin area fig 1b intensive farming activities take place in the acadie river basin of which 77 is occupied by agricultural fields fig 1c current and future hydrology of the acadie were studied in a previous modelling study aygün et al 2020b the montmorency river basin fig 1b differs from the acadie river basin fig 1c in terms of landscape and meteorological conditions table 1 montmorency is dominated by forests on porous sandy loam over hilly uplands with varying altitudes whereas the acadie is occupied mostly by agricultural fields on compacted clay soils over flat lowlands table 1 montmorency has a boreal climate dfc peel et al 2007 which is colder and more humid than the hemiboreal climate dfb peel et al 2007 of acadie the annual air temperature is about 6 c higher in acadie than in montmorency table 1 winters are considerably colder in montmorency 12 4 c than in acadie 6 6 c in spring the air temperature is slightly below freezing point in montmorency 0 1 c while it is well above zero degree for acadie 6 3 c table 1 compared to the acadie river basin the montmorency river basin receives more precipitation and the snowfall ratio is almost twice that in acadie table 1 montmorency receives slightly more precipitation in winter than in spring whereas it is the other way around for acadie table 1 the montmorency river basin encloses two densely studied watersheds namely berev bassin bassin expérimental du ruisseau des eaux volées 20 km2 managed by laval university and lac laflamme 0 7 km2 managed by québec ministry of forests wildlife and parks mffp fig 1b while earlier studies in the lac laflamme carried out modelling of snow accumulation and melt barry et al 1990 plamondon et al 1984 prévost et al 1991 more recent studies focused on analyzing changes in soil water content and temperature d orangeville et al 2016 houle et al 2012 and also nutrient cycling houle et al 2016 in the berev earlier studies explored the impacts of forest harvesting on hydrological behaviour guillemette et al 2005 lavigne 2007 tremblay et al 2008 and water quality tremblay et al 2009 while more recent studies performed plot scale studies to examine catch efficiency of snowfall gauges pierre et al 2019 energy and water budget isabelle et al 2020 evapotranspiration hadiwijaya et al 2020 and groundwater flow schilling et al 2021 measurements of snow depth and density at snow stations i and j within the berev watershed fig 1b have been collected by the québec ministry of environment and fight against climate change melcc and researchers from laval university for the 2005 2019 period station i and station j are located within regenerated forests with south facing and north facing slopes respectively continuous measurements since 1996 of soil temperature and moisture at the coniferous and mixed forest sites of the lac laflamme watershed fig 1b were acquired from the mffp daily river discharge measured at the forêt montmorency gauge id 051005 fig 1b were extracted from the database of québec center of water expertise for the 2005 2019 period hourly temperature wind speed relative humidity and daily precipitation data have been acquired for the 2005 2019 period from the forêt montmorency weather station of environment and climate change canada fig 1b daily precipitation observations were disaggregated uniformly over the hours of a day the gaps in hourly and daily data about 2 of the whole period were filled with data from a mffp weather station located in the lac laflamme watershed fig 1b 1 7 km away from the forêt montmorency weather station the temperature was spatially distributed over the basin based on an environmental lapse rate of 5 c 1000 m bergeron 2016 daily snowfall records were corrected for wind under catch using the algorithm developed for the alter shielded geonor gauge smith 2007 the incoming shortwave radiation has been estimated using the method presented by annandale et al 2002 within the crhm platform and validated against the reliable portion of existing data 2 2 modelling approach following aygün et al 2020b the cold regions hydrological modelling crhm platform pomeroy et al 2007 was used to build a hydrological model for the montmorency river basin taking advantage of the object oriented and modular structure of crhm fang et al 2013 relevant physical process modules were selected to simulate the dominant hydrological processes in the montmorency river basin table s1 the model was discretized into 78 hydrological response units hrus that each represent one set of parameters and one control volume for mass and energy budgeting pomeroy et al 2007 zhou et al 2014 and are defined by land cover aspect slope and elevation classes see supplementary fig s1 building on earlier modelling results in acadie the model outputs from montmorency were compared with previous results from the acadie river basin aygün et al 2020b updated for this study subsurface flow and groundwater surface interactions in montmorency river basin were simulated using physically based parameters and principles on hillslopes using the hillslope module in crhm table s1 this module is a modified version of the soil moisture balance modules in crhm dornes et al 2008 fang et al 2010 comprising a near surface detention layer over two soil layers and a groundwater layer with provision for macropore flow between sub surface layers and from surface to groundwater fang et al 2013 the near surface detention layer allows the surface runoff to flow through a porous medium as a transient flow pathway which allows handling the water storage in loose organic material in the forest floor pomeroy et al 2016 horizontal and vertical flows from soil layers and groundwater layer are calculated based on darcy s law where brooks and corey s relationship brooks and corey 1964 is used to estimate the actual hydraulic conductivity in the unsaturated zone estimation of the parameters in the montmorency river basin was performed based on the well studied berev and lac laflamme watersheds section 2 1 fig 1b and also other snow dominated basins with similar landscape characteristics the soil profile parameters were estimated from previous studies performed at lac laflamme barry et al 1988 jutras 2012 ouimet and duchesne 2005 vegetation height and stalk diameter were obtained from the ecoforest mapsproduced in southern québec by themffp mature coniferous and mixed forest stands were assigned to have a stalk diameter of 60 cm and canopy height of 14 m whereas regenerated forest hrus were assigned a stalk diameter of 40 cm and a canopy height of 6 m the leaf area index lai was set to be 2 9 m2 m2 and 3 4 m2 m2 for regenerated and mature balsam fir forests respectively as reported by previous studies for the berev subbasin of montmorency hadiwijaya et al 2020 isabelle et al 2020 parajuli et al 2020 the maximum canopy snow load capacity was set to 3 3 kg m2 and 6 3 kg m2 for regenerated forest and mature coniferous forest respectively these values are transferred from the studies performed in boreal forests of western canada hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 pomeroy et al 2012 all the hrus were routed to the streamflow network where routing lengths were calculated as median distances from each hru to the closest tributary the model was run at an hourly time step evaluation of the crhm model performance for swe soil moisture and river discharge in montmorency river basin is provided in the supplementary material figs s2 5 hourly simulations for acadie are available for 1996 2019 and detailed model setup and results are given in aygün et al 2020b 2 3 perturbed climate the potential impacts of climate change on the hydrology of the montmorency river basin were explored via climate sensitivity analyses where the historical long term temperature and precipitation data 2005 2019 were perturbed according to the ensemble of climate projections produced by charron 2016 these projections were generated from a set of 11 downscaled global climate simulations provided by the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 charron 2016 they are produced for two greenhouse gas emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 and for two periods 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 for all the administrative regions in the province of québec charron 2016 based on these scenarios temperature warming up to 8 c 0 8 c at 1 c degree interval and an increase in total precipitation wetting up to 20 0 20 5 interval were considered in the sensitivity analyses these changes thus encompass the spread in projections for the mid and end of century under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios for the administrative region where the montmorency river basin is located fig 1 the climate sensitivity analyses carried out previously for the acadie river basin aygün et al 2020b were repeated by updating the reference climate period from 1996 2019 to 2005 2019 in order to match the reference climate period used in montmorency which had a shorter observational record therefore the results presented for the acadie river basin in this paper are modified from those presented in aygün et al 2020b the hydrological sensitivity of the montmorency river basin fig 1a was compared with that of the acadie river basin fig 1b by assessing the changes in snow and water fluxes using sensitivity response surfaces detailed comparisons were carried out for the 3 c and 6 c warming scenarios which respectively represent the mean warming projection for the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods under the high emission scenario for both basins charron 2016 these warming scenarios were modulated with a minimum 0 and maximum 20 increase in precipitation based on the range of existing scenarios in order to analyze the potential compensation effect of increasing precipitation on snow and water fluxes impacted by warming the reference run δt 0 c p 100 represents the historically averaged observed data for both basins over the 2005 2019 period 2 4 permuted baseline climate experiments in order to explore the respective roles of present day climates and basin landscape on the climate sensitivity of hydrological responses a set of climate sensitivity analyses were performed in which the historical climates of both basins were permuted historical 2005 2019 time series of air temperature and precipitation of the acadie river basin were thus used as meteorological inputs for the montmorency river basin and vice versa this resulted in climate sensitivity analyses for four distinct combinations of present day climate and landscapes acadie type landscape under its own hemiboreal climate acadie type landscape under montmorency boreal climate montmorency type landscape under its own boreal climate and montmorency type landscape under acadie hemiboreal climate the climate sensitivities of hydrological variables i e relative changes in hydrological variables in response to changes in temperature and precipitation were compared for the most likely climate change scenarios for the 2041 2070 period 3 c warming and or 20 increasing precipitation 3 results the model performance in simulating daily streamflow at the basin outlet for the 2005 2019 is slightly better in montmorency with a kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 of 0 82 and a mean bias of 0 6 fig s5a and c than in acadie with a kge of 0 69 and a mean bias of 1 8 aygün et al 2020b 3 1 simulated historical water fluxes montmorency receives 40 higher annual precipitation 1460 mm than acadie 1030 mm fig 2 a and b almost half 44 of the annual precipitation in montmorency occurs as snowfall whereas the snowfall ratio in acadie is 23 fig 2a and b in the southernly and warmer acadie evapotranspiration and streamflow are the two main outfluxes of the annual water balance each accounting for 45 of annual precipitation in montmorency mean annual streamflow 1067 mm 73 of annual precipitation is the largest outflux with only 18 of the annual precipitation being lost through evapotranspiration fig 2a and b groundwater is an important part of the hydrological system in montmorency which sources 48 513 mm of the streamflow as baseflow annual sublimation losses in montmorency 140 mm reach 22 of the annual snowfall compared with 14 29 mm in acadie in both basins snowmelt generates a substantial proportion montmorency 46 acadie 42 of the mean annual streamflow fig 2c and d the snowmelt contribution to annual streamflow is marked by the sharp increase in cumulative runoff in both basins during snowmelt periods may june in montmorency and april may in acadie the mean simulated annual peak swe in montmorency 405 mm fig 2c is about six times greater than that in acadie 65 mm fig 2d under historical climate conditions the annual peak swe in montmorency occurs on april 10 fig 2c which is more than a month later that in acadie where it presently occurs in early march fig 2d 3 2 responses of snow fluxes to warming the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation in both basins shown by percentages on panel a and b of fig 3 exhibits a decrease in response to warming under 6 c warming only 10 of the total precipitation occurs as snowfall in acadie fig 3b whilst the snowfall ratio in montmorency drops to 23 fig 3a which is equal to the snowfall ratio in acadie under reference climate conditions fig 3b the amount of snowmelt in both basins is lower under warmer temperatures due to these decreased snowfall ratios fig 3a and b intercepted snow sublimation removes a considerable amount of snow 132 mm year 21 of the annual snowfall in montmorency under reference climate conditions fig 3c this is because montmorency is dominated by coniferous trees fig 1b and table 1 that intercept a sizeable fraction of seasonal snowfall which subsequently sublimates over the long winter warming air temperatures in montmorency reduce the total sublimation from intercepted snowfall to 104 mm and 79 mm with 3 c and 6 c warming respectively fig 3c which can be explained by the reduced snowfall ratio and increased unloading and drip of intercepted snow from the forest canopy fig 3a in comparison with the canopy sublimation sublimation from the snowpack surface is very low reaching only 1 2 of the annual snowfall in montmorency under reference climate conditions fig 3c in acadie on the other hand annual sublimation is mostly composed of snowpack sublimation 20 8 mm year 9 of the annual snowfall whereas the canopy sublimation loss 4 mm year 1 7 of the annual snowfall is the smallest term of the snow mass balance under the reference climate conditions fig 3d these contrasted sublimation losses can be explained with the landscape of acadie which is dominated by well exposed open agricultural fields fig 1c and table 1 that are subjected to high winds and relatively high surface sublimation rates while only 17 of the basin is covered by forest of which 60 is deciduous therefore resulting in relatively small canopy sublimation losses at the basin scale compared to the reference climate conditions the snowpack sublimation to snowfall ratio is higher in both basins under warmer temperatures fig 3c and d which can be explained by the greater available energy for sublimation under warmer temperatures canopy sublimation ratios are also greater particularly in montmorency under warmer temperatures fig 3c these higher sublimation ratios suggest that sublimation is a more efficient snow removal process under warmer temperatures since relative humidity and wind speed remain unchanged in the climate sensitivity experiments higher sublimation to snowfall ratio implies that the saturated vapor pressure at the snow air interface increases more on average than the atmospheric vapor pressure leading to a greater water vapour deficit and hence higher sublimation fluxes while there is no blowing snow sublimation component in the forested montmorency as blowing snow transport is suppressed by the tall vegetation blowing snow sublimation reaches 2 of the annual snowfall under reference climate conditions in more open acadie fig 3d in comparison with the other sublimation components in acadie blowing snow sublimation shows the greatest sensitivity to warming declining by 74 and 90 with 3 c and 6 c warming respectively fig 3d this is due to the increasing inter crystal bond strength and cohesion of snow as it warms which raises the threshold wind speed required to initiate saltation li and pomeroy 1997 3 3 altered snow regimes in response to climate change the annual peak swe the mean annual maximum swe decreases in response to warming in both basins fig 4 a and d with more dramatical changes simulated for acadie while the peak swe declines by about 10 per c warming in montmorency fig 4a the peak swe in acadie decreases by 60 per c warming fig 4d the lower swe sensitivity in the montmorency is due to the colder temperatures in this region compared to the acadie table 1 under 3 c warming which represents the mean warming projection for the mid century for both basins the decline in peak swe in acadie 79 is twice as great as in montmorency 38 fig 4a and d under this scenario a 20 increase in precipitation would compensate 48 of the decline in peak swe in montmorency but only 13 in acadie fig 4a and d a 6 c warming which represents the mean warming for the 2071 2100 period under the high emission scenario reduces peak swe in montmorency by 70 from 405 mm to 115 mm fig 4a and d which is still greater than the peak swe in acadie under reference climate conditions 65 mm fig 2d the annual peak swe shifts towards earlier dates under almost every warming scenario in both basins with greater shifts simulated for acadie for instance peak swe advances by less than a month in montmorency under 3 c warming while the same scenario causes the peak swe in acadie to shift by almost two months fig 4b and e the peak swe timing changes the fastest within the 1 2 c warming band in both basins but with comparatively fast changes in peak swe only in acadie snowmelt rates are slower under all warming scenarios in both basins as long as there is no increase in precipitation fig 4c and f like the peak swe response surface patterns fig 4a and d snowmelt rates decline uniformly by 10 15 per c warming in montmorency whereas in acadie snowmelt rates decrease faster reaching 60 for a 1 c warming this is because warming leads to shallower snowpacks which melt out earlier in the year when the available energy is lower therefore leading to overall slower melt rates fig 4c and f also suggest a possibility for faster snowmelt rates in the future when limited warming 1 c for acadie and 2 5 c for montmorency is accompanied by increasing precipitation fig 4c and f the faster melt rates could reflect the higher incoming energy available for deeper snowpack under wetting and limited warming scenarios 3 4 comparison of peak streamflow sensitivities the annual peak discharge the mean annual peak discharge could increase by up to 25 and 40 in montmorency and acadie respectively depending on the warming and wetting scenario fig 5 a and c this zone of positive peak discharge sensitivity is delineated by the 0 contour in fig 5a and c below which the peak streamflow shows an increase in montmorency a 20 increase in precipitation could compensate peak flow declines due to warming up to 2 9 c however beyond 3 c warming impacts predominate and peak flow decreases which can be attributed to the declining peak snow accumulation fig 4a fig 5c indicates a two layer positive sensitivity zone for acadie while the increasing peak flow in the first layer warming 1 c in fig 5c is attributed to the higher snow accumulation in response to increasing precipitation and limited warming 1 c see fig 4d the second layer warming 1 c can be explained by increasing peak flows under a mixed rain and snowmelt winter regime as explained next warming causes a shift in peak streamflow timing towards earlier dates in both basins with greater shifts simulated for acadie fig 5b and d which is in line with the earlier peak swe occurrence under warming scenarios see fig 4b and e the peak streamflow in acadie shifts by 80 days earlier in response to 1 c warming fig 5d and occurs before the peak swe date under the same warming level fig 4e this finding suggests that the peak flow in acadie desynchronizes from the peak snow accumulation in response to a 1 c warming i e shifting towards a rain dominated flood regime for montmorency the timing of peak streamflow is relatively less sensitive to warming compared to the timing of peak swe particularly for a warming between 0 c and 5 c figs 5b vs 4b however beyond 6 c warming the peak streamflow timing in montmorency becomes very responsive advancing by roughly four months when warming reaches 7 c under these conditions the streamflow regime of montmorency shifts towards a mixed snowmelt rainfall regime with peak flows occurring in winter under the mid and late 21st century climate conditions where warming exceeds 3 c the acadie river mean hydrograph becomes very flashy and the seasonality of precipitation dictates the magnitude and timing of the annual peak streamflow fig 6 c in other words the flow regime of the acadie river basin transits to a rainfall dominated regime in contrast the montmorency river conserves a distinct snowmelt dominated peak streamflow under 3 c warming moreover a 20 increase in precipitation almost completely 94 counterbalances the decline in peak streamflow caused by a 3 c warming however the peak flow occurs 19 days earlier i e on april 23 rather than may 9 fig 6a this highlights the considerable uncertainty in future peak streamflow magnitude and timing and flood risks caused by the uncertainties in projected precipitation meanwhile a 6 c warming causes the flow regime of montmorency river to transit from a snowmelt to a mixed snowmelt rainfall regime fig 6a warmer temperatures cause an increase in winter flows in both basins fig 6a c which is due to the increase in available water in winter due to higher winter rainfall and more frequent mid winter snowmelt events increasing precipitation leads to even higher streamflow in winter this is also evident in the increase in flows with exceedance probabilities between 0 3 and 0 8 and 0 5 and 1 respectively for acadie and montmorency fig 6b and d in acadie winter becomes the active flood season fig 6c due to abundant rainfall which combines with winter snowmelt and restricted infiltration over frozen ground 3 5 relative influence of climate and basin landscape on the hydrological sensitivity to climate change the respective roles of the landscape features and current climates on the climate sensitivity of key hydrological variables are explored in figs 7 10 in these figures the vertical double arrows indicate the effect of regional climate while the horizontal double arrows indicate the influence of the basin landscape on the climate sensitivity of a given hydrological variable the reference historically averaged baseline values of hydrological variables under a given regional climate and landscape combination are given in parentheses in panel a of figs 7 10 3 5 1 peak swe focusing on the impact of regional climate on the current peak swe vertical arrows in fig 7 a the snowier and colder boreal climate of montmorency leads to greater peak snow accumulation compared to the hemiboreal acadie climate under both montmorency type 405 mm 67 mm and acadie type 431 mm 65 mm landscapes on the other hand the sensitivity of peak swe to warming and wetting is found to be much more pronounced when both landscapes are forced by the warmer and drier hemiboreal baseline climate than by the colder and more humid boreal climate vertical arrows in fig 7a c this highlights the strong dependence of the climate sensitivity of the peak swe to current climate conditions under hemiboreal climate conditions a small to moderate warming leads to significant declines in snow accumulation due to already milder temperatures table 1 looking at the influence of landscape on the current peak swe horizontal arrows in fig 7a the simulated peak swe in montmorency type landscape 405 mm is smaller than in acadie type landscape 431 mm when both are forced by the boreal climate this can be explained by the higher canopy sublimation losses in the forested landscape of montmorency fig 3c when forced by the warmer and rainier hemiboreal climate canopy sublimation losses in montmorency decrease but the total sublimation ratio in montmorency 36 remains greater than that in acadie 13 because the greater canopy storage in coniferous forests favour sublimation losses however the amount of snowmelt simulated in mid winter in montmorency is about 22 less than that in acadie mostly due to the reduced amount of energy available for melting in montmorency due to shading by the forest canopy this reduced snowmelt compensates the sublimation losses and as a result the peak snow accumulations are almost equal in both basins when forced by the hemiboreal climate fig 7a likewise the peak swe shows rather similar sensitivities to warming and wetting in both basins when forced by the same climate fig 7a c these results show that the climate sensitivity of the peak swe is little influenced by the landscape but is rather shaped by the current regional climate condition 3 5 2 water fluxes present day mean annual effective precipitation was calculated as the sum of snowmelt and net rainfall where net rainfall is the gross rainfall minus interception losses hence differences in baseline mean effective precipitation and their climate sensitivities reflect the varying influences of interception losses canopy sublimation and evaporation and snowpack sublimation losses present day effective precipitation values in parentheses in fig 8 a are higher under montmorency boreal baseline climate due to its higher precipitation rates and cooler and more humid climate fig 3a vs b the montmorency type landscape enhances the climate sensitivity of the effective precipitation especially under hemiboreal baseline climate forcing fig 8a c in order to quantify the influence of vegetation on effective precipitation sensitivity the montmorency basin was artificially deforested in the crhm model keeping the other basin properties including soils unchanged the results showed that sensitivity of effective precipitation in the deforested montmorency decreased to 20 21 in response to combined 3 c warming and 20 wetting which is lower than for the forested montmorency type landscape 23 27 and almost the same as for the acadie type landscape 20 21 fig 8c these findings highlight that canopy interception plays the key role in modifying the effective precipitation sensitivity to climate change snow storage on the canopy in montmorency is particularly prone to sublimation losses so that the shift from snowfall to rainfall in a warmer climate decreases the canopy losses and leads to a slight increase in mean effective precipitation fig 8a even if canopy and snowpack sublimation themselves become more efficient under a warmer climate i e sublimation ratios increase see fig 3c this suggests that sublimation from the canopy is a more efficient process to remove water from this basin than is evaporation of rainfall stored on the canopy due to the longer residence time of snow on the canopy compared to rainfall the fraction of the mean effective precipitation that infiltrates in the soils varies among the two landscapes and climates the buffering capacity is defined similarly to herron and wilson 2001 and van tiel et al 2021 as the ratio of the annual mean infiltration to the mean effective precipitation which describes the capacity of a catchment to absorb surface water fluxes and its ability to attenuate runoff and enhance baseflow this buffering capacity is lower in the acadie type landscape 0 40 0 59 than in the montmorency type landscape 0 54 0 73 when both are forced by the same climate fig 9a this suggests that the acadie type landscape is more efficient in translating available water to runoff than montmorency type landscape due to its compacted agricultural soils that have a lower infiltration and storage capacity the more porous forested soils of montmorency on the other hand favour infiltration fig 9 a b artificially deforesting montmorency has a small impact on its buffering capacity fig 9a which confirms that soils predominantly affect the buffering capacity of montmorency the buffering capacity of both basins is also higher when forced by the warmer and less snowy hemiboreal climate than by the cooler and wetter boreal climate fig 9a b which suggests that infiltration decreases overall under a snowier climate because the soil remains saturated and or frozen for a long period during spring snowmelt and restrict infiltration the buffering capacity of montmorency type landscape increases in response to warming and wetting especially under boreal climate forcing fig 9b c reflecting the larger snowfall to rainfall conversion for this climate fig 3a b and decreased influence of snowmelt on soil saturation the correlation coefficient between average monthly discharge and precipitation corr q p fig 10a provides information on the current seasonal synchronicity between discharge and precipitation for each combination of climate and landscape the basins exhibit much lower corr q p 0 07 0 14 i e a lower synchronicity between p and q when forced by the baseline boreal climate montmorency than when forced by the hemiboreal acadie climate corr q p 0 28 0 66 fig 10 a this is because the colder boreal climate has a higher snowfall fraction 44 than the hemiboreal climate 23 fig 3a and b which results in larger snow accumulation storage that delays discharge until late spring this snow damming effect is very climate sensitive in many basins around the world and its loss is an indicator of decoupling between snowpack and streamflow regimes lópez moreno et al 2020 the coupling between p and q increases under all climate change scenarios and climate landscape combinations fig 10a c with the largest increases simulated under a combined warming and wetting scenario fig 10c the boreal montmorency climate enhances the climate sensitivity of corr q p i e the relative increase in the seasonal synchronicity between precipitation and streamflow is more pronounced in this climate however although the climate sensitivity of corr q p is higher under boreal climate forcing the absolute corr q p values themselves remain expectedly higher under the rainier hemiboreal climate forcing suggesting a more synchronized q and p the montmorency type landscape favors larger present day corr q p under the same baseline climate conditions especially under the warmer and rainier acadie climate fig 10a this can be explained by two factors i the higher slopes in montmorency which favor more rapid transfers of surface runoff ii the higher infiltration and storage capacity that lead to a smoother hydrograph in montmorency compared to acadie see fig 6 the lag 1 autocorrelation of monthly streamflow is indeed correspondingly higher for the montmorency type landscape 0 21 than for the acadie type landscape 0 09 which would act to increase corr q p fig 10a to isolate the effect of slopes from soil effects crhm model parameters describing hru slopes were artificially lowered for montmorency to approximately match those in acadie this resulted in a corr q p of 0 22 when forced by the acadie climate which is lower than the original value 0 66 in fig 10a and more comparable to the acadie type landscape under acadie climate 0 28 in fig 10a the higher slopes in montmorency thus appear to explain the current day tighter coupling between q and p especially under a rainier climate under a changing climate however the montmorency type landscape leads to smaller increases in the synchronicity between p and q corr q p compared to the acadie type landscape fig 10a c this can be explained by the greater increases in the buffering capacity of the montmorency type landscape under climate change as described in the previous section fig 9c 3 5 3 peak discharge the response of peak discharge to warming and wetting is illustrated in fig 11 present day peak discharges are higher under the boreal climate 0 16 0 24 m3 s km2 than under the hemiboreal climate 0 05 0 06 m3 s km2 fig 11a as the current peak swe is greater and the buffering capacity is lower for the boreal climate figs 7a and 9a interestingly streamflow regimes show less sensitivity to warming fig 11a than do snowpack regimes fig 7a under any baseline climate and landscape conditions when the slopes are artificially lowered in montmorency type landscape to match those in acadie the present day peak discharge decreases by about 20 under both boreal climate 0 13 m3 s km2 and hemiboreal climate 0 04 m3 s km2 this means that higher slopes lead to higher peak discharges yet the acadie type landscape which has lower slopes exhibits higher present day peak discharges than the montmorency type landscape under both climates fig 11a due to its lower buffering capacity fig 9a peak q shows a stronger sensitivity to warming under the boreal climate 15 to 18 than under the hemiboreal climate conditions 8 to 9 fig 11a this is opposite to the much greater sensitivity of peak swe seen under the hemiboreal climate compared to the boreal climate in response to the same level of warming fig 7a this dichotomy occurs because when the hemiboreal climate is warmed by 3 c the peak q decouples from the snow cycle fig 5d so that the large declines in peak swe fig 7a do not translate into large changes in peak q fig 11a while warming alone leads to an overall decline in peak discharge combined warming and wetting results in higher peak discharges for all climate and landscape combinations except for the montmorency type landscape under its own climate fig 11c the hemiboreal climate shows a greater sensitivity 37 47 of peak flow to wetting than the boreal climate 18 24 fig 11b which can be explained by the greater increases in peak swe under the hemiboreal climate in response to wetting fig 7b similarly the significant declines in peak swe in response to combined warming and wetting of the hemiboreal baseline climate fig 7c are not reflected by decreasing peak flows which rather rise by 20 24 fig 11c this is due to increased precipitation in the form of rainfall leading to increased annual peak runoff net rainfall snowmelt infiltration supplementary fig s6f in contrast when forced with the boreal baseline climate the peak q remains synchronized with the peak snowmelt timing under 3 c warming fig 5b and the peak q of both basins responds more strongly to changes in peak swe even though the declines in peak swe are smaller fig 7a in other words under a combined wetting and warming scenario peak discharge responds more strongly to changes in precipitation rainfall in the hemiboreal baseline climate while peak discharge is comparatively more sensitive to warming in the boreal baseline climate due to snowpack depletion effects fig 11c reveals that basin landscape can lead to asymmetric changes in peak q in response to climate change despite an increase in available mean effective precipitation in response to combined warming and wetting in montmorency under its own boreal climate fig 8c the mean runoff declines supplementary fig s6c which in turn leads to a 1 decline in peak q fig 11c the same degree of warming and wetting also leads to a similar decrease in peak q by 0 5 in the artificially deforested montmorency these findings reveal that the soil characteristics play the major role in governing the response of peak flow to climate change and that the forested porous soils buffer the increased mean water fluxes and lead to decreased mean runoff supplementary fig s6c and peak q fig 11c this effect is well illustrated in fig 9 which shows that the buffering capacity of the montmorency type landscape increases under a warming wetting scenario especially for the boreal baseline climate fig 9b c contrary to the montmorency type landscape under boreal climate the acadie type landscape under boreal climate shows an increase in peak q in response to warming and wetting fig 11c this suggests that the increase in mean effective precipitation simulated for acadie under the boreal baseline climate fig 8c translates into an increase in mean runoff fig s6c and as a result peak q increases fig 11c hence our results suggest that the reduced infiltration and storage capacity of the agricultural soils are less apt to buffer the increased runoff and lead to increased peak flow 4 discussion 4 1 simulated water balance in montmorency our model simulations demonstrate that 28 of the total precipitation left as evapotranspiration and sublimation in montmorency river basin for the 2005 2019 period which broadly agrees with observations reported for the berev subbasin of montmorency 34 isabelle et al 2020 30 schilling et al 2021 simulated sublimation itself only accounted for about 10 of the annual precipitation in the basin which is within the range 5 13 reported by parajuli et al 2020 for the berev subbasin of montmorency over the 2005 2019 period snowmelt contributed 46 of the simulated annual streamflow in the montmorency river basin which is in line with the contribution 45 47 reported by isabelle et al 2020 for the berev subbasin of montmorency over the 2016 2018 period the simulated soil moisture also exhibited a good match with the observations figs s3 and s4 suggesting that the model represents fairly well infiltration and thus the recharge process our results highlight that there is a significant contribution from groundwater flow to streamflow as baseflow in montmorency groundwater flow provided 48 of the annual streamflow for the 14 years of simulation period in montmorency this is of a similar magnitude with the 50 groundwater contribution to streamflow calculated from on site tracer experiments in the berev subbasin of montmorency for the 2017 2018 period schilling et al 2021 despite the relatively simple treatment of groundwater flow in chrm these results suggest an adequate representation of groundwater contribution to streamflow 4 2 landscape and climate influence on present day hydrological processes when both basins are forced by the snowier boreal climate less snow accumulates in the montmorency type landscape fig 7a due to higher canopy sublimation losses fig 3c which is consistent with previous studies that reported less snow accumulation in a forested basin than in an agricultural basin in russia gelfan et al 2004 and less snow accumulation in forested sites compared with nearby open environments in cold regions of europe koivusalo and kokkonen 2002 and north america jost et al 2007 varhola et al 2010 on the other hand when forced by the hemiboreal climate reduced mid winter snowmelt was simulated in the forested basin due to shading which compensated the canopy interception losses such that both basins exhibited similar maximum snow accumulations fig 7a this is in agreement with varhola et al 2010 and veatch et al 2009 who have shown that reduced mid winter and spring ablation rates in forests can offset the lesser accumulation resulting in snowpacks being thicker in forests than in open areas gelfan et al 2004 veatch et al 2009 although higher than in acadie fig 3d the ratio of canopy interception sublimation to snowfall 21 in montmorency fig 3c is lower than the 25 45 values reported from colder and drier boreal forest environments essery et al 2003 such as the southern boreal forest in saskatchewan pomeroy and gray 1995 pomeroy et al 1998 this is because montmorency river basin has a humid climate dfc peel et al 2007 which limits the sublimation essery and pomeroy 2001 however it is important to note that although the canopy sublimation ratio is lower for montmorency than for the drier climate of saskatchewan the absolute amount is greater which is explained by the higher amount of snowfall fig 3a and hence longer duration for which intercepted snow is exposed to the atmosphere in montmorency on the other hand the simulated canopy sublimation to snowfall ratio in montmorency fig 3c is higher than the 10 canopy sublimation loss estimated for the umpqua national forest in oregon us storck et al 2002 where the climate is warmer and more humid which results in more rapid unloading and in limited sublimation essery et al 2003 the canopy sublimation losses in montmorency decrease by about 7 per c fig 3c which is similar to that recently reported for a southern boreal forest of western canada 6 per c he et al 2021 decreasing canopy sublimation losses in response to warming was also found to explain the increase in effective precipitation in the forested landscape fig 8 when forced by common climate conditions the annual peak discharge was found to be higher in the acadie type landscape fig 11a which shows that the lower buffering capacity i e reduced infiltration and storage capacity fig 9a of agricultural soils favor runoff despite the lower slopes compared to the more rugged montmorency type landscape 4 3 landscape and climate influence on hydrological sensitivity to climate change slower snowmelt rates were simulated in both basins in response to warming fig 4c and f which is consistent with findings in some other snowmelt dominated regions located in europe lópez moreno et al 2013 and north america musselman et al 2017 rasouli et al 2014 rasouli et al 2019b trujillo and molotch 2014 where snowmelt occurs before the summer solstice essery et al 2020 in contrast faster snowmelt rates could occur in the future when limited warming 1 c for acadie and 2 5 c for montmorency is accompanied by increasing precipitation fig 4c f which is similar to the increased snowmelt rates in response to warming reported for relatively deeper swe regions 150 mm across the northern hemisphere wu et al 2018 and increased rates in the northern boreal forest of the northwest territories canada where snowfall increases along with rising temperature krogh and pomeroy 2019 these results suggest that changes in snowmelt rate are influenced not only by warming but also by increasing precipitation and future snowmelt rate can be either lower or higher depending on the regional climate and snow regimes and whether the snowmelt period is shifted by changing climate into a lower or higher insolation season similar to the findings from the inter comparison study of carey et al 2010 in northern basins the boreal climate with higher precipitation as snow exhibited a lower correlation between precipitation and discharge than the hemiboreal climate fig 9 the declining snow accumulation in response to warming therefore leads to more synchronized precipitation and discharge regarding the impact of basin landscape the increase in correlation between p and q in response to climate change is greater in the acadie type landscape which presents more compacted soils with smaller storage capacity smaller buffering capacity fig 9a highlighting the influence of soil characteristics on the climate sensitivity of precipitation discharge synchronicity streamflow regimes showed less sensitivity to warming fig 11a compared to the changes in peak snowpack accumulation fig 7a under all baseline climate and landscape combinations this finding is in agreement with the conclusion from a recent worldwide comparison of high mountain snowpack and streamflow sensitivities to climate warming lópez moreno et al 2020 notwithstanding the colder boreal climate was found to enhance the sensitivity of peak q to warming due to the persisting dominant influence of the snow cycle on streamflow but to reduce the sensitivity to wetting compared to the hemiboreal climate fig 11 in other words a higher snowfall fraction in a basin fig 3a buffers against extreme streamflow response to increasing precipitation which is consistent with the conclusions of previous studies conducted in north america by sankarasubramanian et al 2001 dethier et al 2020 and more recently by robles et al 2021 in both montmorency and acadie the streamflow regimes were projected to shift towards a more rainfall dominated regime under warmer temperatures with faster transition projected for acadie fig 5e peak discharge in basins with a mild hemiboreal winter climate could increase in response to a combination of 3 c warming and 20 increasing precipitation due the substantial conversion of snowfall to rainfall combined with enhanced winter snowmelt which together lead to higher surface runoff extremes in winter fig 11c the acadie type landscape with its reduced buffering capacity fig 9c is more sensitive to this scenario than the montmorency type landscape whose increased buffering capacity fig 9c attenuates extreme rainfall snowmelt events this finding is in agreement with a recent study over selected north american mountain basins where higher storage and infiltration capacity due to forestation resulted in decreased high flows in a warmer and wetter future rasouli et al 2019a conversely under a colder boreal climate and for the same climate change scenario 3 c warming and 20 increasing precipitation the streamflow remains largely synchronized with the snowpack regime the bulk of snowmelt continues to occur in the spring with more limited conversion of snowfall to rainfall which attenuates extreme runoff events however basins respond differently to the increased water inputs in the more impervious acadie type landscape the amount of runoff but not its intensity increases and leads to higher peak discharge in the spring while the porous soils of montmorency type landscape largely buffer the increased flux resulting in decreased runoff amount and lower peak discharge fig 11c 4 4 limitations and prospects this study aimed to assess how present day climate and landscape conditions modulate the hydrological sensitivity while the potential impacts of climate change on vegetation such as the reduction in stomatal conductance le et al 2011 decline in canopy lai caused by warming boulanger et al 2017 and the forest disturbance due to fire or insects seidl et al 2017 were not considered this imposes a limitation on the computed hydrological sensitivities since including future vegetation changes is likely to modulate the hydrological responses to climate change in snowmelt dominated basins rasouli et al 2019a and elsewhere gerten et al 2004 however including feedbacks from changing vegetation due to climate change would complicate isolating the effect of current vegetation on the hydrological sensitivity to climate change this study thus demonstrates how current landscape conditions affect the hydrological sensitivity but future changes in vegetation and or land use could invariably contribute to changes in water fluxes within the catchments and should be considered for more accurate climate change impact assessments it is also worth noting that many of the subjective choices made when choosing parameterizations and assigning parameters in physically based hydrological models can have a significant impact on the magnitude of the output uncertainty the separation of precipitation into rainfall or snowfall is one of the most sensitive parameterizations when simulating cold regions hydrological processes harder and pomeroy 2013 underestimation overestimation of rainfall can advect less more energy to snowpack decrease increase snowpack liquid content lead to earlier later warming and ripening and in turn impact the magnitude and timing of snowmelt streamflow peak flow pomeroy et al 2016 in this study the total precipitation was partitioned between liquid and solid precipitation using a psychometric energy balance method proposed by harder and pomeroy 2013 rainfall fraction was calculated as a function of the temperature of falling precipitation estimated using the air temperature and relative humidity future studies could use in situ records of precipitation phase made in the berev watershed pierre et al 2019 to calibrate air temperature precipitation phase relationships to reduce errors in phase partitioning while most of the model parameters were prescribed based on observations and previous studies within the basins some parameters such as maximum canopy snow load capacity and maximum active layer thickness of snow were borrowed from basins with similar landscape conditions which introduce uncertainties in the hydrological models future studies are required to perform detailed parameter sensitivity analyses to fully quantify the uncertainty in hydrological simulations 5 conclusion a physically based hydrological model was set up using the cold regions hydrological modelling crhm platform driven with current climate data and perturbed by projected annually uniform changes in temperature and precipitation to analyze the influences of these changes on the hydrological regime of two archetypical climates and landscapes of the st lawrence river in eastern canada namely a rugged and forested basin with boreal climate montmorency north shore and a relatively level agricultural basin with hemiboreal climate acadie south shore on a regional perspective the main finding is that although these basins are not very far from each other 400 km their distinct present day meteorological conditions lead to different hydrological sensitivities to the same climate perturbation the faster and more dramatic hydrological changes were simulated for acadie in response to warming due to its milder present day climate table 1 by the mid century the snow accumulation in acadie is projected to almost completely by 80 vanish while the peak snow accumulation in montmorency declines by less than 50 by the end of the century acadie is projected to be completely dominated by rainfall runoff mechanisms whereas the snowmelt continues to play a dominant role on the peak runoff in montmorency these results have important implications for regional water management adaptation strategies in addition to the regional findings this study more broadly illustrates the contrasted hydrological behaviours that can arise under present and future climates in cold forested and agricultural landscapes of the globe competing mechanisms were found between the current climate conditions and the landscape characteristics which dictate the amounts of snow accumulations this interplay between regional climate and the landscape features greatly impacts the climate sensitivity of the basins i e how snow accumulation snowmelt runoff and streamflow responded to a common climate change signal the major findings are as follows i a forested landscape can present a lower or equal amount of snow accumulation compared to an agricultural environment depending on the regional climate that governs the compensation effect between canopy sublimation losses on the one hand and reduced snowmelt due to forest shading on the other hand ii the response of peak swe to climate change depends only on regional climate and is not impacted by basin landscape iii sublimation rate declines in a warmer climate due to faster decreasing snow availability iv basin topography and soil characteristics influence in different ways the synchronization between precipitation and discharge steeper basin slopes favor a tighter coupling between precipitation and discharge whereas the more porous soils with higher infiltration capacity dampen the sensitivity of this coupling to climate v a more impervious agricultural landscape tends to translate the climate variability to higher peak flows whereas a forested landscape can absorb the same degree of variability and even lead to reduced flows afforestation therefore can be an important way of mitigating the future climate change induced hydrological extremes particularly in colder cold regions vi the attenuation of extreme flows by forested landscapes in response to climate change is climate dependent it is more efficient in present day colder temperature regime than in milder cold regions where greater conversions from snowfall to rainfall in response to warming can overwhelm the buffering capacity of even

2693,revegetation of degraded ecosystems provides opportunities for improving ecosystem production mitigating climate change and improving carbon sequestration revegetation tends to reduce streamflow q caused by enhanced evapotranspiration et or increase the water yield w due to increasing soil water infiltration with the steady state assumption while under multiple steady states its effects on the hydrological state remain controversial here the assumptions that et is calculated from water balance etwb and using evaporation theory etc are independent assessment of the hydrological states can be provided following this assumption in a water limited region such as the loess plateau china the results showed that i revegetation dramatically improved the leaf area index lai over the loess plateau and abrupt lai changes were detected in 2002 ii enhanced et etwb and etc with revegetation was observed and the elevated fraction of precipitation p partitioned into etwb led to decreases in w p etc and iii as inferred by our assumption most catchments tended to be wetter 11 among 17 catchments which indicates that soil water storage sws also increased combined with increased et and decreased q our results provide new insight into revegetation playing a new role in partitioning p into et q and sws higher ratios of p tend to be intercepted in sws to maintain higher et and even induce a reduction in q in most regions of the loess plateau china keywords loess plateau revegetation evaporation theory water balance soil water storage data availability data will be made available

energy flow and affect human well being and natural ecosystem balance anderegg william et al 2020 gan et al 2021 sheil 2018 zhang et al 2015 on one hand near land surface characteristics such as land surface albedo soil infiltration capacity near surface temperature and wind speed will be altered with vegetation changes and thus influence water energy exchanges between land atmosphere duveiller et al 2018 loranty et al 2014 meng et al 2018 peng et al 2014 ren et al 2016 on the other hand as a vital carbon pool vegetation greening may increase carbon uptake and thus slow the climate warming trend gu et al 2019b wang et al 2021 for a long time large scale vegetation restoration triggered an increase in water consumption a decrease in streamflow q and drought which simultaneously greatly contributed to regulating regional microclimates and mitigating climate change anderegg william et al 2020 lu et al 2020 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2015 however some studies have demonstrated that vegetation greening significantly enhances soil infiltration capacity and thus improves water yield w and soil water storage sws gao et al 2017 li et al 2018 ren et al 2016 other research suggested an opposing viewpoint in which vegetation restoration and precipitation p interception enhanced and thus improved evaporation and transpiration therefore w and sws decreased feng et al 2016 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 theoretically from these studies it was predicted that large scale revegetation induced asymmetric hydrological effects which seems difficult to reach an agreement atmospheric soil vegetation interactions reach equilibrium by a process of natural evolution eagleson 2005 which means vegetation closely interacts with the hydrologic cycle zhang et al 2018 the changes in hydrological state control the vegetation state zhang et al 2018 and vice versa davis et al 2019 lemordant et al 2018 however it is difficult to elucidate the hydrological state changes with changes in vegetation due to their complex interactions liu et al 2016 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 to assess the hydrological state the water balance has been widely applied to quantify water fluxes and sws considering the difficulty of measuring evapotranspiration et sws and groundwater it is conventionally and fundamentally assumed that the catchment state remains steady which means there are no changes in sws or groundwater on an multiyear scale kampf et al 2020 shao et al 2021 for example shao et al 2021 used a water balance model to quantify loess plateau long term change in sws after revegetation and suggested that the sws of 16 catchments increased moreover the budyko framework has been widely used to calculate et and q under steady state conditions gan et al 2021 zhang et al 2001 recently the budyko framework incorporated into physical and ecohydrological parameters also attempts to explain the effects of vegetation and groundwater on water balance chen et al 2020 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2016 incorporated a dynamic ecohydrological model into the budyko choudhury porporato model to illuminate the hydrological effects of vegetation characteristics over the yellow river basin in the context of climate change catchment ecosystems might alter the state to adapt to anthropic activity cresto aleina et al 2013 or natural disturbance peterson tim et al 2021 which increases the complex interactions between vegetation climate change and hydrological state though developing evaporation theory including the penman monteith leuning model leuning et al 2008 and generalized complementary approach brutsaert 2015 et has been calculated more acceptably and validated with eddy covariance observations gan et al 2018 hu et al 2013 accuracy in et estimation considering vegetation dynamics martens et al 2017 provides an opportunity to explain water fluxes and changes in sws while sws in catchment remains uncertain due to climate change e g drought peterson tim et al 2021 and catchment characteristics e g large scale revegetation zhang et al 2022 elucidating water fluxes and sws with changes in catchment characteristics should be an interesting scientific question which will also produce some implications for water resource management to help address climate change to solve this problem a new method was proposed for estimating differences in soil water storage change in catchment scale combined with a water balance model and evaporation model specifically the objectives of the present study are i to provide a new method for estimating the differences in soil water storage change to represent catchment hydrological state alterations ii to assess the changes in vegetation coverage resulting from large scale revegetation using leaf area index lai and iii to evaluate the differences in soil water storage change under a critical assumption that the independence of et results from the water balance method etwb and evaporation theory etc the present study was conducted on the loess plateau china where the grain for green project gfgp has been conducted and has led to dramatic changes in vegetation cover and water balance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the loess plateau which mainly covers arid and semi arid regions with an area of 640 000 km2 fig 1 is a typical vegetation restoration area p is the main water supply for vegetation ranging from 200 mm yr 1 to 800 mm yr 1 hence the vegetation types from northwest to southeast include grassland deserts desert grasslands grasslands forest grasslands and forests and the demands on groundwater are relatively minor feng et al 2016 xie et al 2015 the water table of the loess plateau is approximately 50 m to 200 m which rarely impacts the water cycle jiang et al 2012 the gfgp was implemented to control soil and water erosion recover the ecological environment and improve human life quality since 1999 which has been invested us 8 7 billion and converted 16 000 km2 cropland into planted vegetation feng et al 2016 while the vegetation fraction has increased significantly a host of ecohydrological issues have drawn extensive attention including decreased q zhang et al 2018 severe depletion of soil moisture deng et al 2016 more severe drought zhao et al 2019 and stunted or small old trees mcvicar et al 2007 we selected 17 catchments associated with the gfgp to explore

technology infrastructure of china https www geodata cn 2 3 assessment of revegetation processes we used the mann kendall method to detect abrupt changes in lai to assess revegetation processes wei et al 2022 according to the timing of abrupt changes revegetation processes can be divided into two periods pre revegetation state a and revegetation state b additionally linear regression was used to analyse the trend of lai furthermore we used the two sample t test to examine the significance of mean differences in variable between two periods including lai p q and et 2 4 alteration of water balance in different vegetation states to examine how revegetation alters water balance we compared the long term partitioning of p between q and etwb for each period more specifically under the water balance framework using the long term mean annual p of each period a b as a baseline the long term average annual q and etwb were divided by the baseline to represent the fraction of p partitioned into q and etwb 2 5 the impact of revegetation on hydrological state to elucidate the impact of revegetation on hydrological state two assumptions were made i the water balance is in equilibrium which means the effects of human activities were omitted e g irrigation division and ii the effects of groundwater on vegetation and water balance can also be omitted following this two hydrological data series were used to assess the impact of revegetation on the hydrological state in different vegetation states i water balance method 1 p i q i et wb i i a b 2 δ p q p b q b p a q a δ et wb ii et assessed from evaporation theory 3 δ et c et c b et c a where p i and q i are the long term average precipitation and streamflow for the i th period mm respectively et wb i et c i are the actual evapotranspiration calculated by water balance and evaporation theory for the i th period mm under the water balance framework while the catchment maintains an equilibrium state change in sws equal to zero results in the different in soil water storage change between period a and b δs being equal to zero hence the equilibrium state is broken or altered while δs is unequal to zero i e the hydrological state is altered as δetwb and δetc are independent and δetwb can be presented as changes in et and sws the alteration of hydrological state can be deduced from the relations δetwb and δetc while the hydrological state remains consistent there is no difference in sws δetc δetwb and δs 0 i e the line of no change is shown in fig 2 in turn while the state is altered it might tend to be wetter or drier if it tends to be wetter changes in sws is higher than former δetc δetwb and δs 0 i e the red region if it tends to be drier changes in sws is lower than former δetc δetwb and δs 0 i e the grey region 3 results 3 1 assessment of revegetation processes fig 3 demonstrates the temporal changes in lai over the loess plateau from 1982 to 2015 according to the mk test lai consistently continued to increase fig 3a it displayed an insignificant increase during 1982 1998 while there was significant growth after 1999 a mutation point occurred in approximately 2002 and the research period was divided into two periods 1982 2002 the pre revegetation state and 2003 2015 the revegetation state the lai trends for the two periods both presented significant upwards trends fig 3b furthermore the growth ratio and value of the latter period were greater than those of the former over the 1982 2015 period the spatial pattern of lai trend over the loess plateau was mixed fig 4 a there was a markedly increasing trend of 91 73 on the loess plateau among them 74 32 of the area showed a significant trend while 17 41 showed an insignificant trend there was a decreasing trend of 8 27 in this region among them 1 81 of the area showed a significant trend while 6 46 showed an insignificant trend compared with lai trend during the pre revegetation state the revegetation state accelerated lai changes we observed an increase from 0 0048 m2 m 2 yr 1 to 0 0070 m2 m 2 yr 1 in lai growth ratio between 1982 and 2002 and 2003 2015 fig 4b c while the percentage of grid cells showing an increasing lai decreased from 83 40 to 76 78 the upwards trend during 2003 2015 was greater than that during 1982 2002 areas with identical upwards to upwards and downwards to downwards and opposing upwards to downwards and downwards to upwards trends contributed 66 90 and 33 10 respectively fig 4d the opposing trend was primarily distributed across the northwestern and southeastern parts of the loess plateau furthermore the area where maintained an upwards trend was the main part accounting for 63 54 and was distributed in the regions with the gfgp these results implied that human activity was the main factor regarding revegetation the long term mean lai of 17 selected catchments was diverse ranging from 0 18 to 1 24 which basically represents different vegetation cover situations fig 5 a compared with 1982 2002 the lai increased significantly over 17 catchments ranging from 0 06 to 0 27 m2 m 2 0 14 m2 m 2 on average fig 5b these results demonstrated that these selected catchments were representative for exploring the impact of revegetation on the hydrological state 3 2 alteration of water balance in different vegetation states to evaluate the impact of revegetation on the water balance in different vegetation states we first compared the alteration of each hydrological feature the increase in p was insignificant except for sjw and hdc ranging from 31 27 mm to 76 35 mm 50 36 mm on average significant changes in q were found in eight catchments bjc zjs zt sm gjb zc ggy and ya and decreased q was observed except for rc and wz ranging from 33 12 mm to 11 83 mm 8 84 mm on average and markedly enhanced etwb was observed in six catchments sm gjb sjw ljp hdc and zc ranging from 34 16 mm to 88 38 mm 59 19 mm on average fig 6 a c our study shows that large scale revegetation altered the long term partitioning of p fig 6d the mean fraction of p partitioned into q decreased from 8 91 to 6 18 while the fraction of p partitioned into etwb increased from 91 09 to 93 82 generally the fraction of q and etwb tended to decrease and increase while some catchments did not follow this pattern for the fraction of q rc and wz tended to increase from 7 06 to 8 42 and from 6 65 to 7 16 respectively for the fraction of etwb rc and wz tended to decrease from 92 94 to 91 58 and from 93 35 to 92 84 respectively 3 3 the impact of revegetation on hydrological state large scale revegetation had varying effects on hydrological state all catchments except for 6 catchments bjc wz sm gjb sjw and ya tended to be drier and 11 catchments tended to be wetter fig 7 a furthermore based on the arid index ai calculated by p divided by pet we classified 17 catchments into two categories semi arid catchments semi humid and humid catchments table s1 among the 6 semi humid and humid catchments ljc zjs zt rc wlk and wz 5 catchments tended to be wetter while among the semi arid catchments sws changes based on the assumption were more complicated there was only a slight majority of catchments with wetter trends 6 among 11 compared with the amounts of catchments with drier trends 5 among 11 additionally there was a strong and significant correlation between lai and etc and a weak and insignificant correlation between lai and p as well as q table s2 moreover compared with the semi humid and humid catchments there were globally greater correlations between lai and etc among the semi arid catchments and fig 5b also shows that the magnitudes of lai variation were greater these results might explain that the magnitude of etc variation among the semi arid catchments was greater than that among the semi humid and humid catchments fig 6c and more water consumption resulted in a greater tendency to be drier catchments while the sws change based on gldas in each catchment was different based on the sws for example only 8 catchments showed the same tendency compared with our assumption it was held that in general the semi humid and humid conditions tended to be wetter and the semi arid conditions were more complicated fig 7b furthermore changes in water yield δw calculated by δp minus δetc decreased globally while the magnitude 3 18 mm on average was lower than q especially for the semi humid and humid conditions fig 7c which implied that sws increased globally 4 discussion 4 1 assessment of revegetation processes the gfgp activities have dramatically altered the vegetation cover fig 3 fig 4 which was also validated by other researchers piao et al 2015 wang et al 2018 as reported by piao et al 2015 vegetation cover increased from 8 19 to 15 82 over the loess plateau during 2000 2016 with gfgp implementation in these regions influenced by the anthropic ecological protection and restoration by the central government of china vegetation has been restored in most regions of the loess plateau yan et al 2018 zhou and zhou 2021 for example ding et al 2021 surveyed the land use changes from 2000 to 2015 over the loess plateau and showed that 334 km2 of desert 1 495 km2 of cropland and 1 610 km2 of grassland were transformed into forest notably increasing lai might be caused by co2 fertilization climate change and nitrogen deposition piao et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 for example rising atmospheric co2 concentrations will promote photosynthesis as a fundamental substrate and will enhance water use efficiency by closing leaf stomata to mitigate water pressure for vegetation growth and elevate vegetation greenness especially over semi arid regions keenan et al 2013 farquhar and sharkey 1982 for the loess plateau compared with co2 concentration and other factors liu et al 2020 suggested that gfgp induced vegetation greening contributed more than 20 which is consistent with our results vegetation restoration is also influenced by environmental slope aspect and terrain and climatic factors p and air temperature mcvicar et al 2007 mcvicar et al 2010 wang et al 2018 xie et al 2015 as shown in fig 6a p showed an increasing trend in all studied catchments and higher p might result in rising lai over semiarid regions he 2014 na et al 2021 wu et al 2020 moreover zhang et al 2021 illustrated that the contribution of vegetation greening to the increasing p was approximately 40 over the loess plateau the potential reason for this is that vegetation survival and development are critically controlled by soil moisture and p is the major natural supply of soil moisture and impacts the water use strategy of vegetation especially on the loess plateau which mainly covers semi arid and arid regions he et al 2007 zhang et al 2021 it should be noted that due to the complex from climate vegetation and soil rising lai could increase precipitation canopy interception and lower surface albedo so that intensify et and the enhanced et would promote evaporation cycling and water exchange between land and atmosphere and then increase atmospheric water vapour content to accelerate downwind p peng et al 2014 piao et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 nevertheless we found that with a markedly enhanced lai an insignificant increase in p and a weak correlation between p and lai existed at the multiyear scale and there was a varying correlation across regions table s2 which was likely because of the existence of a threshold between vegetation growth and p wu et al 2020 considering this complicated relationship further work is required to explore the interactions and mechanisms between p and vegetation 4 2 alteration of hydrological states in different vegetation states the gfgp has significantly changed the streamflow sediment characteristics over the loess plateau from severe soil and water erosion due to strong p splashing to a lower streamflow coefficient and sediment yield zheng et al 2020 demonstrated that after the gfgp reductions in the annual maximum daily q depth and sediment yield were observed at 66 and 77 hydrological stations over the loess plateau respectively unexpectedly most catchments tended to be wetter 11 among 17 catchments with elevated et and decreased q fig 7a the revegetation activities have dramatically altered the partitioning of p i p interception increased with increasing in lai which will led to the increase in evaporation wang and wang 2018 ii transpiration increased with increasing in revegetation wei et al 2017 mechanism i combined with ii increased the et iii increasing in vegetation rooting depth and litter resulted in increasing in infiltration which also reduced surface flow and thus the soil erosion during rainfall and increased the soil water and depth soil flow gu et al 2019a han et al 2021 the reduced q with increased sws indicated that an increase in sws maybe not increase the groundwater and then recharge to q which resulted in increased q but used to maintained the et during p interval in most of catchments in the loess plateau china the low water table over the loess plateau may be the potential reason jiang et al 2012 noted that as pointed by wei et al 2017 exponential increase in the fraction of transpiration with increasingly lai which indicated that a relative weakening of soil evaporation it might result that the demanding of soil moisture for soil evaporation reduced and thus sws increased at the same time an increase in the amount and partitioning of q was found in rc and wz mainly related to the increased q and different and nonlinear p q relationship it highlights the varying pattern of q response to vegetation change which is largely related to multiple factors including climate condition difference scale effect vegetation characteristic topology geology and landscape pattern so do p q relationship farmer et al 2003 guo et al 2017 karlsen et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 bart and hope 2010 williams and albertson 2005 our results show that hydrological effect of vegetation change can varying from region for example 6 catchments tended to be drier fig 7a and decreased fraction of et shown in 2 catchments fig 6d as pointed by feng et al 2016 revegetation in china s loess plateau is approaching sustainable water resources limits continuing revegetation may cause severe soil moisture depletion deng et al 2016 increase in water demand zhang et al 2015 and water resource threaten therefore under specific vegetation coverage over the loess plateau there are threshold of water resource for providing natural and anthropic demanding like prominent ecological water demand above also indicated that there are threshold of vegetation coverage zhang et al 2018 measured the climate defined equilibrium vegetation coverage 0 43 on average based on meteorological hydrological and vegetation data and demonstrated that excessive revegetation is major driver of soil drying unmatched vegetation fraction may cause the high demand of water resource and thus stunted or small old trees over the loess plateau mcvicar et al 2007 a slowdown of vegetation greening pan et al 2018 and even mortality van mantgem et al 2009 it implied that vegetation should match local specific hydrometeorological conditions above implied that there are equilibrium relationship between water resource supply and vegetation water use demand as eagleson 2005 claimed that after long term evolution vegetation would maintain equilibrium with local hydrometeorological conditions there is a bidirectional and dynamic equilibrium both the significant change in vegetation characteristics and hydrometeorological conditions would affect the equilibrium zhang et al 2018 markedly alteration in hydrometeorological condition for future climate has tremendous effects on local vegetation characteristics and water availability and lowers equilibrium vegetation coverage zhang et al 2018 it implied that for excessive revegetation region vegetation coverage reduction only by logging may far from reach equilibrium moreover local vegetation species have reached the equilibrium eagleson 2005 under the context of climate change however further work is required to explore whether the equilibrium succession occur and the succession provide an opportunity for other vegetation species above equilibrium relationship provide a new insight for guiding anthropic activity e g large scale revegetation water transfer elucidating complicated interaction between vegetation and water 5 uncertainty and limitations the present study is based on satellite derived and field observed datasets but did not verify the satellite observed datasets using field observed data due to numerous studies using those datasets the fitting is acceptable feng et al 2016 shao et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 therefore this process was omitted while it might be a potential uncertainty it is noteworthy that only we can judge the state change using our assumption while we cannot estimate the original and current states and that based on long term data driven methods short term prediction is insufficient 6 conclusions vegetation change drives hydrosphere change and profoundly effects natural ecosystem balance and human well being the gfgp has been implemented over the loess plateau since 1999 large scale and high intensity revegetation triggered a host of complex ecohydrology issue which have drawn extensive attention particularly about catchment scale sws to systematically explore the impact of large scale revegetation on sws we proposed a new method based on a fundamental assumption that the independence of etwb and etc the gfgp markedly promoted lai and gfgp induced vegetation greening triggered an increase in p and et and a reduction in q as well as improved the fraction of p partitioned into et due to the imbalance relationship between recharged p and reduced q most catchments tend to be wetter especially in the semi humid and humid catchment furthermore for semi arid catchment further revegetation might cause a decrease in sws additionally varying impacts of revegetation on sws indicated that there is an equilibrium relationship between vegetation and sws in the context of increased p and et most catchments tend to be wetter highlight that revegetation triggers more portion of p into sws to maintain higher et which highlight the important role of revegetation in partitioning water resources large scale revegetation would significantly regulate water cycle and the amount and partitioning of water resource and fundamentally influence sws for the future revegetation it should be fully considered that the equilibrium relationship between climate vegetation hydrology for

2693,revegetation of degraded ecosystems provides opportunities for improving ecosystem production mitigating climate change and improving carbon sequestration revegetation tends to reduce streamflow q caused by enhanced evapotranspiration et or increase the water yield w due to increasing soil water infiltration with the steady state assumption while under multiple steady states its effects on the hydrological state remain controversial here the assumptions that et is calculated from water balance etwb and using evaporation theory etc are independent assessment of the hydrological states can be provided following this assumption in a water limited region such as the loess plateau china the results showed that i revegetation dramatically improved the leaf area index lai over the loess plateau and abrupt lai changes were detected in 2002 ii enhanced et etwb and etc with revegetation was observed and the elevated fraction of precipitation p partitioned into etwb led to decreases in w p etc and iii as inferred by our assumption most catchments tended to be wetter 11 among 17 catchments which indicates that soil water storage sws also increased combined with increased et and decreased q our results provide new insight into revegetation playing a new role in partitioning p into et q and sws higher ratios of p tend to be intercepted in sws to maintain higher et and even induce a reduction in q in most regions of the loess plateau china keywords loess plateau revegetation evaporation theory water balance soil water storage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an effective measure to mitigate human induced global climate change vegetation changes can intensify and accelerate the global water cycle drive material cycling and energy flow and affect human well being and natural ecosystem balance anderegg william et al 2020 gan et al 2021 sheil 2018 zhang et al 2015 on one hand near land surface characteristics such as land surface albedo soil infiltration capacity near surface temperature and wind speed will be altered with vegetation changes and thus influence water energy exchanges between land atmosphere duveiller et al 2018 loranty et al 2014 meng et al 2018 peng et al 2014 ren et al 2016 on the other hand as a vital carbon pool vegetation greening may increase carbon uptake and thus slow the climate warming trend gu et al 2019b wang et al 2021 for a long time large scale vegetation restoration triggered an increase in water consumption a decrease in streamflow q and drought which simultaneously greatly contributed to regulating regional microclimates and mitigating climate change anderegg william et al 2020 lu et al 2020 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2015 however some studies have demonstrated that vegetation greening significantly enhances soil infiltration capacity and thus improves water yield w and soil water storage sws gao et al 2017 li et al 2018 ren et al 2016 other research suggested an opposing viewpoint in which vegetation restoration and precipitation p interception enhanced and thus improved evaporation and transpiration therefore w and sws decreased feng et al 2016 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 theoretically from these studies it was predicted that large scale revegetation induced asymmetric hydrological effects which seems difficult to reach an agreement atmospheric soil vegetation interactions reach equilibrium by a process of natural evolution eagleson 2005 which means vegetation closely interacts with the hydrologic cycle zhang et al 2018 the changes in hydrological state control the vegetation state zhang et al 2018 and vice versa davis et al 2019 lemordant et al 2018 however it is difficult to elucidate the hydrological state changes with changes in vegetation due to their complex interactions liu et al 2016 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 to assess the hydrological state the water balance has been widely applied to quantify water fluxes and sws considering the difficulty of measuring evapotranspiration et sws and groundwater it is conventionally and fundamentally assumed that the catchment state remains steady which means there are no changes in sws or groundwater on an multiyear scale kampf et al 2020 shao et al 2021 for example shao et al 2021 used a water balance model to quantify loess plateau long term change in sws after revegetation and suggested that the sws of 16 catchments increased moreover the budyko framework has been widely used to calculate et and q under steady state conditions gan et al 2021 zhang et al 2001 recently the budyko framework incorporated into physical and ecohydrological parameters also attempts to explain the effects of vegetation and groundwater on water balance chen et al 2020 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2016 incorporated a dynamic ecohydrological model into the budyko choudhury porporato model to illuminate the hydrological effects of vegetation characteristics over the yellow river basin in the context of climate change catchment ecosystems might alter the state to adapt to anthropic activity cresto aleina et al 2013 or natural disturbance peterson tim et al 2021 which increases the complex interactions between vegetation climate change and hydrological state though developing evaporation theory including the penman monteith leuning model leuning et al 2008 and generalized complementary approach brutsaert 2015 et has been calculated more acceptably and validated with eddy covariance observations gan et al 2018 hu et al 2013 accuracy in et estimation considering vegetation dynamics martens et al 2017 provides an opportunity to explain water fluxes and changes in sws while sws in catchment remains uncertain due to climate change e g drought peterson tim et al 2021 and catchment characteristics e g large scale revegetation zhang et al 2022 elucidating water fluxes and sws with changes in catchment characteristics should be an interesting scientific question which will also produce some implications for water resource management to help address climate change to solve this problem a new method was proposed for estimating differences in soil water storage change in catchment scale combined with a water balance model and evaporation model specifically the objectives of the present study are i to provide a new method for estimating the differences in soil water storage change to represent catchment hydrological state alterations ii to assess the changes in vegetation coverage resulting from large scale revegetation using leaf area index lai and iii to evaluate the differences in soil water storage change under a critical assumption that the independence of et results from the water balance method etwb and evaporation theory etc the present study was conducted on the loess plateau china where the grain for green project gfgp has been conducted and has led to dramatic changes in vegetation cover and water balance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the loess plateau which mainly covers arid and semi arid regions with an area of 640 000 km2 fig 1 is a typical vegetation restoration area p is the main water supply for vegetation ranging from 200 mm yr 1 to 800 mm yr 1 hence the vegetation types from northwest to southeast include grassland deserts desert grasslands grasslands forest grasslands and forests and the demands on groundwater are relatively minor feng et al 2016 xie et al 2015 the water table of the loess plateau is approximately 50 m to 200 m which rarely impacts the water cycle jiang et al 2012 the gfgp was implemented to control soil and water erosion recover the ecological environment and improve human life quality since 1999 which has been invested us 8 7 billion and converted 16 000 km2 cropland into planted vegetation feng et al 2016 while the vegetation fraction has increased significantly a host of ecohydrological issues have drawn extensive attention including decreased q zhang et al 2018 severe depletion of soil moisture deng et al 2016 more severe drought zhao et al 2019 and stunted or small old trees mcvicar et al 2007 we selected 17 catchments associated with the gfgp to explore the impact of revegetation on hydrological state and the area ranged from 916 48092 km2 table 1 2 2 data and processing the monthly p from 1982 to 2015 was provided by the china meteorological forcing

technology infrastructure of china https www geodata cn 2 3 assessment of revegetation processes we used the mann kendall method to detect abrupt changes in lai to assess revegetation processes wei et al 2022 according to the timing of abrupt changes revegetation processes can be divided into two periods pre revegetation state a and revegetation state b additionally linear regression was used to analyse the trend of lai furthermore we used the two sample t test to examine the significance of mean differences in variable between two periods including lai p q and et 2 4 alteration of water balance in different vegetation states to examine how revegetation alters water balance we compared the long term partitioning of p between q and etwb for each period more specifically under the water balance framework using the long term mean annual p of each period a b as a baseline the long term average annual q and etwb were divided by the baseline to represent the fraction of p partitioned into q and etwb 2 5 the impact of revegetation on hydrological state to elucidate the impact of revegetation on hydrological state two assumptions were made i the water balance is in equilibrium which means the effects of human activities were omitted e g irrigation division and ii the effects of groundwater on vegetation and water balance can also be omitted following this two hydrological data series were used to assess the impact of revegetation on the hydrological state in different vegetation states i water balance method 1 p i q i et wb i i a b 2 δ p q p b q b p a q a δ et wb ii et assessed from evaporation theory 3 δ et c et c b et c a where p i and q i are the long term average precipitation and streamflow for the i th period mm respectively et wb i et c i are the actual evapotranspiration calculated by water balance and evaporation theory for the i th period mm under the water balance framework while the catchment maintains an equilibrium state change in sws equal to zero results in the different in soil water storage change between period a and b δs being equal to zero hence the equilibrium state is broken or altered while δs is unequal to zero i e the hydrological state is altered as δetwb and δetc are independent and δetwb can be presented as changes in et and sws the alteration of hydrological state can be deduced from the relations δetwb and δetc while the hydrological state remains consistent there is no difference in sws δetc δetwb and δs 0 i e the line of no change is shown in fig 2 in turn while the state is altered it might tend to be wetter or drier if it tends to be wetter changes in sws is higher than former δetc δetwb and δs 0 i e the red region if it tends to be drier changes in sws is lower than former δetc δetwb and δs 0 i e the grey region 3 results 3 1 assessment of revegetation processes fig 3 demonstrates the temporal changes in lai over the loess plateau from 1982 to 2015 according to the mk test lai consistently continued to increase fig 3a it displayed an insignificant increase during 1982 1998 while there was significant growth after 1999 a mutation point occurred in approximately 2002 and the research period was divided into two periods 1982 2002 the pre revegetation state and 2003 2015 the revegetation state the lai trends for the two periods both presented significant upwards trends fig 3b furthermore the growth ratio and value of the latter period were greater than those of the former over the 1982 2015 period the spatial pattern of lai trend over the loess plateau was mixed fig 4 a there was a markedly increasing trend of 91 73 on the loess plateau among them 74 32 of the area showed a significant trend while 17 41 showed an insignificant trend there was a decreasing trend of 8 27 in this region among them 1 81 of the area showed a significant trend while 6 46 showed an insignificant trend compared with lai trend during the pre revegetation state the revegetation state accelerated lai changes we observed an increase from 0 0048 m2 m 2 yr 1 to 0 0070 m2 m 2 yr 1 in lai growth ratio between 1982 and 2002 and 2003 2015 fig 4b c while the percentage of grid cells showing an increasing lai decreased from 83 40 to 76 78 the upwards trend during 2003 2015 was greater than that during 1982 2002 areas with identical upwards to upwards and downwards to downwards and opposing upwards to downwards and downwards to upwards trends contributed 66 90 and 33 10 respectively fig 4d the opposing trend was primarily distributed across the northwestern and southeastern parts of the loess plateau furthermore the area where maintained an upwards trend was the main part accounting for 63 54 and was distributed in the regions with the gfgp these results implied that human activity was the main factor regarding revegetation the long term mean lai of 17 selected catchments was diverse ranging from 0 18 to 1 24 which basically represents different vegetation cover situations fig 5 a compared with 1982 2002 the lai increased significantly over 17 catchments ranging from 0 06 to 0 27 m2 m 2 0 14 m2 m 2 on average fig 5b these results demonstrated that these selected catchments were representative for exploring the impact of revegetation on the hydrological state 3 2 alteration of water balance in different vegetation states to evaluate the impact of revegetation on the water balance in different vegetation states we first compared the alteration of each hydrological feature the increase in p was insignificant except for sjw and hdc ranging from 31 27 mm to 76 35 mm 50 36 mm on average significant changes in q were found in eight catchments bjc zjs zt sm gjb zc ggy and ya and decreased q was observed except for rc and wz ranging from 33 12 mm to 11 83 mm 8 84 mm on average and markedly enhanced etwb was observed in six catchments sm gjb sjw ljp hdc and zc ranging from 34 16 mm to 88 38 mm 59 19 mm on average fig 6 a c our study shows that large scale revegetation altered the long term partitioning of p fig 6d the mean fraction of p partitioned into q decreased from 8 91 to 6 18 while the fraction of p partitioned into etwb increased from 91 09 to 93 82 generally the fraction of q and etwb tended to decrease and increase while some catchments did not follow this pattern for the fraction of q rc and wz tended to increase from 7 06 to 8 42 and from 6 65 to 7 16 respectively for the fraction of etwb rc and wz tended to decrease from 92 94 to 91 58 and from 93 35 to 92 84 respectively 3 3 the impact of revegetation on hydrological state large scale revegetation had varying effects on hydrological state all catchments except for 6 catchments bjc wz sm gjb sjw and ya tended to be drier and 11 catchments tended to be wetter fig 7 a furthermore based on the arid index ai calculated by p divided by pet we classified 17 catchments into two categories semi arid catchments semi humid and humid catchments table s1 among the 6 semi humid and humid catchments ljc zjs zt rc wlk and wz 5 catchments tended to be wetter while among the semi arid catchments sws changes based on the assumption were more complicated there was only a slight majority of catchments with wetter trends 6 among 11 compared with the amounts of catchments with drier trends 5 among 11 additionally there was a strong and significant correlation between lai and etc and a weak and insignificant correlation between lai and p as well as q table s2 moreover compared with the semi humid and humid catchments there were globally greater correlations between lai and etc among the semi arid catchments and fig 5b also shows that the magnitudes of lai variation were greater these results might explain that the magnitude of etc variation among the semi arid catchments was greater than that among the semi humid and humid catchments fig 6c and more water consumption resulted in a greater tendency to be drier catchments while the sws change based on gldas in each catchment was different based on the sws for example only 8 catchments showed the same tendency compared with our assumption it was held that in general the semi humid and humid conditions tended to be wetter and the semi arid conditions were more complicated fig 7b furthermore changes in water yield δw calculated by δp minus δetc decreased globally while the magnitude 3 18 mm on average was lower than q especially for the semi humid and humid conditions fig 7c which implied that sws increased globally 4 discussion 4 1 assessment of revegetation processes the gfgp activities have dramatically altered the vegetation cover fig 3 fig 4 which was also validated by other researchers piao et al 2015 wang et al 2018 as reported by piao et al 2015 vegetation cover increased from 8 19 to 15 82 over the loess plateau during 2000 2016 with gfgp implementation in these regions influenced by the anthropic ecological protection and restoration by the central government of china vegetation has been restored in most regions of the loess plateau yan et al 2018 zhou and zhou 2021 for example ding et al 2021 surveyed the land use changes from 2000 to 2015 over the loess plateau and showed that 334 km2 of desert 1 495 km2 of cropland and 1 610 km2 of grassland were transformed into forest notably increasing lai might be caused by co2 fertilization climate change and nitrogen deposition piao et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 for example rising atmospheric co2 concentrations will promote photosynthesis as a fundamental substrate and will enhance water use efficiency by closing leaf stomata to mitigate water pressure for vegetation growth and elevate vegetation greenness especially over semi arid regions keenan et al 2013 farquhar and sharkey 1982 for the loess plateau compared with co2 concentration and other factors liu et al 2020 suggested that gfgp induced vegetation greening contributed more than 20 which is consistent with our results vegetation restoration is also influenced by environmental slope aspect and terrain and climatic factors p and air temperature mcvicar et al 2007 mcvicar et al 2010 wang et al 2018 xie et al 2015 as shown in fig 6a p showed an increasing trend in all studied catchments and higher p might result in rising lai over semiarid regions he 2014 na et al 2021 wu et al 2020 moreover zhang et al 2021 illustrated that the contribution of vegetation greening to the increasing p was approximately 40 over the loess plateau the potential reason for this is that vegetation survival and development are critically controlled by soil moisture and p is the major natural supply of soil moisture and impacts the water use strategy of vegetation especially on the loess plateau which mainly covers semi arid and arid regions he et al 2007 zhang et al 2021 it should be noted that due to the complex from climate vegetation and soil rising lai could increase precipitation canopy interception and lower surface albedo so that intensify et and the enhanced et would promote evaporation cycling and water exchange between land and atmosphere and then increase atmospheric water vapour content to accelerate downwind p peng et al 2014 piao et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 nevertheless we found that with a markedly enhanced lai an insignificant increase in p and a weak correlation between p and lai existed at the multiyear scale and there was a varying correlation across regions table s2 which was likely because of the existence of a threshold between vegetation growth and p wu et al 2020 considering this complicated relationship further work is required to explore the interactions and mechanisms between p and vegetation 4 2 alteration of hydrological states in different vegetation states the gfgp has significantly changed the streamflow sediment characteristics over the loess plateau from severe soil and water erosion due to strong p splashing to a lower streamflow coefficient and sediment yield zheng et al 2020 demonstrated that after the gfgp reductions in the annual maximum daily q depth and sediment yield were observed at 66 and 77 hydrological stations over the loess plateau respectively unexpectedly most catchments tended to be wetter 11 among 17 catchments with elevated et and decreased q fig 7a the revegetation activities have dramatically altered the partitioning of p i p interception increased with increasing in lai which will led to the increase in evaporation wang and wang 2018 ii transpiration increased with increasing in revegetation wei et al 2017 mechanism i combined with ii increased the et iii increasing in vegetation rooting depth and litter resulted in increasing in infiltration which also reduced surface flow and thus the soil erosion during rainfall and increased the soil water and depth soil flow gu et al 2019a han et al 2021 the reduced q with increased sws indicated that an increase in sws maybe not increase the groundwater and then recharge to q which resulted in increased q but used to maintained the et during p interval in most of catchments in the loess plateau china the low water table over the loess plateau may be the potential reason jiang et al 2012 noted that as pointed by wei et al 2017 exponential increase in the fraction of transpiration with increasingly lai which indicated that a relative weakening of soil evaporation it might result that the demanding of soil moisture for soil evaporation reduced and thus sws increased at the same time an increase in the amount and partitioning of q was found in rc and wz mainly related to the increased q and different and nonlinear p q relationship it highlights the varying pattern of q response to vegetation change which is largely related to multiple factors including climate condition difference scale effect vegetation characteristic topology geology and landscape pattern so do p q relationship farmer et al 2003 guo et al 2017 karlsen et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 bart and hope 2010 williams and albertson 2005 our results show that hydrological effect of vegetation change can varying from region for example 6 catchments tended to be drier fig 7a and decreased fraction of et shown in 2 catchments fig 6d as pointed by feng et al 2016 revegetation in china s loess plateau is approaching sustainable water resources limits continuing revegetation may cause severe soil moisture depletion deng et al 2016 increase in water demand zhang et al 2015 and water resource threaten therefore under specific vegetation coverage over the loess plateau there are threshold of water resource for providing natural and anthropic demanding like prominent ecological water demand above also indicated that there are threshold of vegetation coverage zhang et al 2018 measured the climate defined equilibrium vegetation coverage 0 43 on average based on meteorological hydrological and vegetation data and demonstrated that excessive revegetation is major driver of soil drying unmatched vegetation fraction may cause the high demand of water resource and thus stunted or small old trees over the loess plateau mcvicar et al 2007 a slowdown of vegetation greening pan et al 2018 and even mortality van mantgem et al 2009 it implied that vegetation should match local specific hydrometeorological conditions above implied that there are equilibrium relationship between water resource supply and vegetation water use demand as eagleson 2005 claimed that after long term evolution vegetation would maintain equilibrium with local hydrometeorological conditions there is a bidirectional and dynamic equilibrium both the significant change in vegetation characteristics and hydrometeorological conditions would affect the equilibrium zhang et al 2018 markedly alteration in hydrometeorological condition for future climate has tremendous effects on local vegetation characteristics and water availability and lowers equilibrium vegetation coverage zhang et al 2018 it implied that for excessive revegetation region vegetation coverage reduction only by logging may far from reach equilibrium moreover local vegetation species have reached the equilibrium eagleson 2005 under the context of climate change however further work is required to explore whether the equilibrium succession occur and the succession provide an opportunity for other vegetation species above equilibrium relationship provide a new insight for guiding anthropic activity e g large scale revegetation water transfer elucidating complicated interaction between vegetation and water 5 uncertainty and limitations the present study is based on satellite derived and field observed datasets but did not verify the satellite observed datasets using field observed data due to numerous studies using those datasets the fitting is acceptable feng et al 2016 shao et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 therefore this process was omitted while it might be a potential uncertainty it is noteworthy that only we can judge the state change using our assumption while we cannot estimate the original and current states and that based on long term data driven methods short term prediction is insufficient 6 conclusions vegetation change drives hydrosphere change and profoundly effects natural ecosystem balance and human well being the gfgp has been implemented over the loess plateau since 1999 large scale and high intensity revegetation triggered a host of complex ecohydrology issue which have drawn extensive attention particularly about catchment scale sws to systematically explore the impact of large scale revegetation on sws we proposed a new method based on a fundamental assumption that the independence of etwb and etc the gfgp markedly promoted lai and gfgp induced vegetation greening triggered an increase in p and et and a reduction in q as well as improved the fraction of p partitioned into et due to the imbalance relationship between recharged p and reduced q most catchments tend to be wetter especially in the semi humid and humid catchment furthermore for semi arid catchment further revegetation might cause a decrease in sws additionally varying impacts of revegetation on sws indicated that there is an equilibrium relationship between vegetation and sws in the context of increased p and et most catchments tend to be wetter highlight that revegetation triggers more portion of p into sws to maintain higher et which highlight the important role of revegetation in partitioning water resources large scale revegetation would significantly regulate water cycle and the amount and partitioning of water resource and fundamentally influence sws for the future revegetation it should be fully considered that the equilibrium relationship between climate vegetation hydrology for

2694,groundwater salinization is considered to be one of the most severe and complex phenomena affecting coastal regions worldwide occurring when high concentrations of water soluble salts are present in groundwater systems geostatistics is a branch of statistics used to analyze and predict the spatio temporal variability of such complex phenomena in particular numerous geostatistical approaches and technologies are currently used to identify and map salinity affected regions investigate how salinity indicators influence groundwater mechanisms and eventually design optimal groundwater management policies this article reviews recent key applications of geostatistical methods to address challenges relevant to groundwater salinization the basic principles of geostatistics are briefly described and numerous studies are discussed that employ geostatistical and multivariate tools for identifying the origin of salinity sources clarifying the relationship among salinity indicators and groundwater processes and propagating the uncertainty of the inputs to the outputs of either physically based or surrogate models of relevant geological systems finally several recommendations and future directions are identified with regards to the most popular methods and with regards to key geostatistical methods whose application in this thematic area is still very limited keywords

freshwater or are vitally needed to supplement surface water sources as a result there is a need to secure the availability and quality of groundwater reserves in these areas in particular the mediterranean and middle east mme regions are among the world s most vulnerable territories to water scarcity and quality degradation due to rapid changes imposed by non climatic and climatic drivers salinization in particular limits or threatens the availability of groundwater resources in the most populated and productive coastal areas of the mme mastrocicco and colombani 2021 as a phenomenon aquifer salinization is a complex and dynamic process often related to multiple causes such as lack of internal drainage seawater intrusion bear et al 1999 werner et al 2013 natural occurrence in closed surface water basins hardie and eugster 1970 eugster and hardie 1978 high water levels that cause increased evaporation via capillary rise barrett lennard 2003 chaudhuri and ale 2014 soil salinization associated with water irrigation hanson et al 1999 hillel 2000 and geogenic factors e g evaporite dissolution etc due to the complexity of spatial and temporal salinization patterns large and high dimensional datasets are required to fully characterize the salinity status of subsurface systems consequently a reliable assessment of salinity risks depends heavily on the ability of statistical tools to accurately capture the spatial variability and the interrelation among salinity indicators such as chloride electric conductivity and sodium content estimations of these indicators at unsampled locations are obtained from observed data at sample locations through interpolation methods geostatistics is a branch of spatial statistics that describes the spatial pattern and provides estimates of the attribute values at unsampled locations it provides a comprehensive framework for combining different types of datasets to build local models of spatial uncertainty numerous studies exist that report the application of different geostatistical techniques to groundwater pollution problems kriging is a popular method that has been successfully used for mapping the spatio temporal patterns of groundwater salinity parameters adhikary et al 2010 yimit et al 2011 deepika et al 2020 multivariate extensions of kriging can also be used to perform spatial interpolation of multiple attributes by incorporating information of one or more secondary variables for reducing the prediction error variance of the primary variable ahmadi and sedghamiz 2006 dokou et al 2015 it has been shown that the inclusion of additional information can improve the estimation accuracy if the primary variable is cross correlated with the secondary attributes issaks and srivastava 1989 a key limitation of kriging methods is that they often provide smooth interpolated attribute maps particularly in the presence of sparse data which might not fully capture the variability of the attribute of interest a remedy is to conduct geostatistical simulation to generate multiple realizations of the attribute of interest reproducing short scale attribute variability these alternative realizations of the spatial distribution of attribute values are typically used to propagate parameter uncertainty in physically based models lee et al 2007 blouin et al 2012 a large number of model runs that depends on the complexity of the physical model itself are often required to achieve sufficient accuracy in the distribution of model outputs leading to computationally expensive monte carlo uncertainty assessments furthermore these computations involve the solution of different physically based models that aim to a identify various sources and processes of salinization b capture the dynamics and characterize the state of groundwater systems and c assess future risks in terms of future climate and socio economic changes dunlop et al 2019 filippis et al 2016 mastrocicco et al 2019 these models require the determination of various parameters such as specific yield storage hydraulic conductivity sink and source terms along with boundary and initial conditions one way to mitigate the computational burden is to replace complex physical models with simpler models that mimic the behaviour of the former machine learning tools particularly gaussian process regression gpr have been successfully used to facilitate uncertainty analysis in groundwater salinization problems razavi et al 2012 lal and datta 2018 the purpose of the current study is to provide an overview of recent 2005 studies that employ geostatistical techniques in groundwater salinization problems particularly the current overview focuses on studies that use geostatistics a along with multivariate techniques to identify and analyze the dominant mechanisms influencing groundwater salinity and estimate the spatial variability of major salinity indicators b for integrating salinity attributes towards the objective of spatial interpolation c for quantifying spatial uncertainty by generating multiple realizations of salinization related parameters and d for constructing surrogate models that emulate physically based models in order to reduce model complexity and computational burden fig 1 shows a graphical overview of this review study in terms of the major thematic areas of geostatistics which involve the analysis and modeling of spatial association the integration of data of different sources and resolutions towards the objective of spatial interpolation and the assessment of uncertainty in spatial prediction and its propagation to outputs results of spatial operations or of models with spatially distributed inputs and or parameters kyriakidis 2017 note that these studies are further classified based on the dimensionality of the sample dataset relevant publications were selected through search engines and online databases using keywords associated with the thematic areas fig 2 provides a classification of these keywords in terms of their occurrences in the context of groundwater salinization bibliographical data e g authors publication year title etc is used to cluster the selected keywords the size of each bubble denotes the total number of occurrences whereas the thickness of a line connecting a pair of keywords denotes the number of common occurrences for example it is observed that several transient groundwater flow models tgf such as modflow sutra feflow seawat are used in conjuction with different monte carlo simulation methods such as sequential indicator simulation sis sequential gaussian simulation sgs markov chain monte carlo mcmc transition probabilities tp and latin hypercube sampling lhs to conduct uncertainty analysis the findings of fig 2 are used in section 4 to identify the most widely used methods and propose future directions based on the results of this review several advanced geostatistical techniques that have not been favoured yet by practitioners for these problems have been identified which could potentially lead to improved estimations in addition key challenges and future directions are addressed 2 general principles of geostatistics as shown in fig 1 geostatistics can be classified into three thematic areas kyriakidis 2017 a analysis and modelling of spatial association b spatial interpolation of attribute parameter data with or without the incorporation of data on relevant auxiliary or predictor attributes and c quantification of the uncertainty in the spatial distribution of estimated attribute values spatial uncertainty and its impact on model predictions uncertainty propagation 2 1 spatial association spatial association refers to the similarity or dissimilarity between values of attributes parameters measured at different spatial locations within the framework of geostatistics attribute spatial variability can be quantified through the sample or empirical semivariogram in the case of two variables this quantity can be extended to the bivariate case termed sample cross variogram issaks and srivastava 1989 jointly permissible models of spatial association are needed in the case of two or more variables such as the intrinsic co regionalization model and the linear model of co regionalization chilès and delfiner 2012 in the case of categorical data indicator variograms have been used for quantifying the spatial association of each category chilès and delfiner 2012 semivariograms are often computed from a limited sample data set and represent averages of pairwise attribute dis similarity values at discrete distance classes in order to obtain a continuous spatial description of this quantity as a function of distance suitable semivariogram model expressions are considered that are required to provide non negative variance of estimators fig 1 thus called positive definite functions expressions that satisfy this requirement and are widely used in applications relevant to groundwater salinization are the exponential gaussian and spherical functions such models reach a plateau sill i e they correspond to random functions fields with a finite variance other variogram models without a sill such as the linear and power law models are also widely used in hydrology and correspond to intrinsic random functions fields chilès and delfiner 2012 variogram models play an essential role in modelling the spatial continuity of attribute values chilès and delfiner 2012 goovaerts 1997 and comprise key elements of geostatistical spatial interpolation methods used to construct maps of the spatial distribution of hydrogeological or other parameters such as hydraulic conductivity electric conductivity total dissolved solids nitrates etc 2 2 spatial interpolation up to date several spatial interpolation methods have been developed issaks and srivastava 1989 which can be classified into two main categories deterministic and stochastic deterministic methods are used for predicting a unique attribute value at each location where a sample is not available examples are nearest neighbor interpolation bilinear interpolation triangulated irregular network interpolation inverse distance weighted idw interpolation and spline interpolation regarding stochastic interpolation techniques special attention is given to the kriging method fig 1 which qualifies as the best linear unbiased predictor blup kriging also known as gaussian process regression in machine learning cui et al 2021 provides an optimal prediction of an attribute at a target location by minimizing the prediction error variance assuming that a variogram or covariogram model is available different variants of kriging have been developed depending on the assumptions adopted regarding the expected attribute value average at different locations the simplest variant named simple kriging occurs when the expected attribute value is assumed to be known everywhere however this assumption limits the applicability of this kriging variant due to the difficulty of acquiring this information ordinary kriging ok within local neighborhoods centered at prediction locations is the most popular kriging method used in groundwater salinization problems arslan 2012 karami et al 2018 hu et al 2005 and assumes a constant but unknown expected attribute value within each search neighborhood different from one neighborhood to another universal kriging uk assumes a linear functional link between the attribute s expected value and the spatial coordinates or polynomials thereof within the search neighborhood similar to trend surface analysis the theory of intrinsic random functions of order k irf k generalizes uk to random functions with stationary increments spatial differences of order k capitalizing on the notion of generalized covariances of that order more details can be found in several works chilès and delfiner 2012 matheron 1970 matheron 1971 kitanidis 1997 in the case where the local attribute of interest is connected to other relevant or auxiliary attributes through a linear regression model the corresponding kriging variant is termed kriging with external drift ked goovaerts 1997 deutsch and journel 1992 wackernagel 2003 rivest et al 2008 the kriging normal equations provide a general framework to incorporate into spatial prediction data that are linearly linked to the attribute of interest such as data defined as arithmetic averages of point attribute values over a block or as differences of attribute values at nearby locations defined via for example the laplacian operator a classical gradient based linear link between attributes in hydrogeology is the poisson type partial differential equation linking transmissivity to piezometric head see dong dong 1989 in the local regression approach for spatial interpolation furnished by ked the data of the auxiliary variables should be collocated with those of the attribute of interest at the sample locations for estimating the parameters of the regression model and at the prediction locations for predicting the corresponding target values however such an isotopic or equally sampled design is often not realized in practice in this case data on multiple attributes can alternatively be integrated into spatial interpolation via co kriging triki et al 2013 ashrafzadeh et al 2016 in this case spatial interpolation is typically performed via co kriging and its variants and calls for the availability of a jointly permissible model for all auto and cross variograms defined between variables depending on the characteristics of the sample data additional kriging variants can be considered for example factorial kriging fk is used when the measurement errors of the sample data need to be considered in the presence of non gaussian datasets several extensions of kriging can be used such as lognormal kriging indicator kriging ik disjunctive kriging kuisi et al 2009 yazdanpanah 2016 tabandeh et al 2021 and copula based kriging agarwal et al 2021 li et al 2021 classical kriging under a multivariate gaussian assumption for the attribute random field furnishes the conditional mean expectation and variance of the unknown attribute value at a prediction location given conditional upon the nearby sample data these two parameters define a local at a prediction location gaussian conditional distribution indicator kriging furnishes an approximation of that local conditional distribution by estimating its k local quantiles using binary 0 1 indicators constructed from the sample data that is data values are transformed to k indicators of non exceedance of k attribute threshold values corresponding for example to k deciles of the sample data distribution disjunctive kriging furnishes a more consistent estimator of the conditional expectation and variance hence of the local conditional distribution as it amounts to co kriging of multiple indicators capitalizing on the notion of orthogonal polynomials for modelling the bivariate two point distribution of attribute pairs for different lag distances disjunctive kriging expresses the local conditional expectation as a function of coefficients of those orthogonal polynomials after gaussian anamorphosis transformation to a standard gaussian distribution once the local conditional distribution is approximated via disjunctive kriging the probability of exceeding or not a particular attribute threshold can be readily computed for more details on indicator kriging disjunctive kriging including their advantages and disadvantages see matheron matheron 1976 chilès and delfiner 2012 yates et al 1986 kriging based geostatistical simulations rely on variograms thus are not able to reproduce complex patterns clearly considering only two points is not sufficient for reproducing complex and heterogeneous models collecting information from multiple sources leads to large datasets which are not usually available in the earth science problems as they come with sparse and incomplete data such data instead can be browsed in the form a conceptual image called training image hence the fundamental novelty of the multiple point statistics mps framework is to encapsulate in a training image the interpretative knowledge on the spatial structure of the modeled phenomenon mariethoz and caers 2014 which can be difficult as natural images are typically not sufficiently repetitive or stationary copulas based geostatistical interpolations bárdossy and li 2008 are based on similar concepts with isofactorial models of bivariate distributions popularized within the geostatistical literature matheron 1984 and can be also used to model bivariate or multivariate distributions without imposing a multivariate gaussian assumption particularly copulas are standardized multivariate distributions with uniform marginals which can be used to describe the dependence structure of multivariate distributions separately from their univariate marginals hence bivariate empirical copulas can be used as an alternative to variograms and covariance functions for the characterization of spatial variability 2 3 uncertainty propagation knowledge of a series of local uncertainty models specified for example by the local kriging derived mean and variance are not always sufficient information for uncertainty propagation purposes particularly in the case of non gaussian distribution and or non linear models the appropriate solution for these cases is to use geostatistical monte carlo simulation goovaerts 1997 a statistical technique that aims at mimicking the process of sampling an actual phenomenon uncertainty propagation in this context is performed by first producing multiple realizations of the spatial distribution of the attribute under study via geostatistical simulation and subsequently evaluating a physical model using as alternative inputs parameters those realizations to produce multiple realizations model predictions fig 1 an illustrative example is the generation of alternative models of the three dimensional spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity used as input data to groundwater flow equations these alternative realizations and the flow equations are combined within a monte carlo framework to evaluate the uncertainty in the spatial distribution of hydraulic head in practice many monte carlo simulations are required to provide accurate predictive distributions making this method computationally expensive as mentioned in the introductory section a common approach is to construct simplified approximations of the complex modelling expressions known as surrogate models used instead within the mc framework in addition to achieving computational efficiency surrogate models are known for improving the numerical stability of the algorithms facilitating uncertainty analysis doherty and christensen 2011 3 applications of geostatistics in groundwater salinization an overview of studies that employ geostatistical techniques to groundwater salinization problems is hereafter presented from which gaps and future directions are identified and discussed in section 4 relevant review papers in the field of groundwater modeling quality assessment and monitoring already exist in the literature for example to achieve improved predictions regarding subsurface processes linde et al linde et al 2015 performed an overview of different geostatistical approaches combined to provide prior geological knowledge the authors emphasized the significance of reducing the dimensionality of the data allowing a better representation of geological heterogeneities and improved predictions of the aquifer states also priyanka and kumar priyanka and kumar 2017 provided a general perspective of how geostatistical models are used to model seawater intrusion swi processes the primary limitations and novelties of existing methodologies were discussed along with the need for further understanding of the complex structure of coastal aquifers geostatistical tools emerge as effective approaches for generating alternative realistic 2d or 3d numerical representations realizations of the spatial distribution of key hydrogeological and or hydrogeochemical parameters for simulating flow and transport processes in various case studies for example carrera et al carrera et al 2009 reviewed how geostatistical techniques are applied to assess salinization occurring due to seawater intrusion in particular the authors discussed computational and conceptual traits when used to model seawater intrusion concluding that there is plenty of room for improvement in terms of computational performance for example through the use of code parallelization to solve inverse problems and use of state variables from previous calibration iterations as initial guesses for non linear direct problems mastrocicco and colombani mastrocicco and colombani 2021 conducted an extensive overview of groundwater salinisation s major processes focusing on the mediterranean region the authors discussed various state of the art techniques including geostatistics used to address salinization problems and suggested that combining these approaches can potentially lead to optimal management strategies a key parameter but not the only in designing management strategies is how well the geological model is reflected in the uncertainty of the predictions a popular way to generate an ensemble of realizations for the aquifer states that reflect the geological pattern is by performing monte carlo simulations within the context of geostatistical simulations however this approach is computationally inefficient since it requires the iterative evaluation of forward model computations for a large number of realizations of the geological parameter e g hydraulic conductivity different approaches have been proposed to reduce such a computational cost for example through the selection of a subset of representative realizations from a large ensemble scheidt and caers 2008 ginsbourger et al 2013 building geological model at a lower resolution than the scale of the dataset upscaling li et al 2012 myrseth et al 2013 and by constructing simplified approximations of the complex models to decrease the number of unknowns that must be computed he et al 2013 pau et al 2013 known as surrogate models a recent survey by roy and datta roy and datta 2018 has summarized a wide range of surrogate models developed to approximate physical models and reduce computational complexity these models are used to quantify the spatial uncertainty of the predictions contributing to the revision of seawater intrusion management strategies gómez hernandez et al gómez hernández et al 2021 collected a number of studies that emphasize the significance of modelling uncertainty in groundwater processes using stochastic techniques these studies emphasized the importance of using computationally efficient methods in complex groundwater systems such as the edward aquifer white et al 2020 and the savanah river carle and fogg 2020 no review manuscript has been published specifically on the application of geostatistical techniques in groundwater salinization these techniques along with dimensionality reduction techniques are employed to a identify the origins and sources of groundwater salinization b relate geochemical parameters with contamination and or enrichment processes i e seawater intrusion water rock interactions and eventually construct maps to identify regions of high salinization risk c evaluate spatial uncertainty by generating multiple earth models and d assess the ability of geostatistical methods to replace physically based models in terms of estimation accuracy and computational demand for completeness this review study includes representative studies that consider closely related techniques to geostatistical methods even if the term geostatistics might not be explicitly used in the original paper 3 1 multivariate statistical techniques there are a plethora of studies that employ multivariate techniques alone to groundwater salinization problems here a small subset of these applications is considered since this is not the focus of this review article for example kumar et al kumar et al 2006 kumar et al 2009 conducted cluster and factor analyses to assess the interaction between surface water and an alluvial aquifer in delhi india application of hierarchical cluster analysis revealed the strong influence of regions of contaminated surface waters to specific groups of sampling locations then factor analysis was used to identify the most important quality parameters associated with hydro geochemical mechanisms reducing the number of parameters similar to kumar et al acikel and ekmekci acikel and ekmekci 2018 combined factor and cluster analysis to conduct a groundwater quality assessment of a karstified aquifer located in the south western part of turkey their results revealed the complexity that drives the recharge and salinization processes in the study area el yaouti et al yaouti et al 2009 combined cluster and principal component analyses to characterize the spatial variability of salinity and major contaminated regions within the bou areg unconfined aquifer their results indicated the presence of salinization due to seawater intrusion in different zones of the aquifer which is exhibiting an increasing trend in terms of depth and distance from the coastline papatheodorou et al papatheodorou et al 2007 considered various multivariate tools to assess the spatio temporal evolution of the malia coastal aquifer located on the island of crete in greece they applied factor and discriminant analyses to three separate sets of samples collected during different sampling periods their results suggested the presence of two dominant hydrochemical processes namely seawater intrusion and nitrate pollution whereas trend surface analysis showed the strong influence of flow movement on the spatial distribution of nitrate zaidi et al zaidi et al 2015 considered principal component analysis to clarify the impact of anthropogenic and natural activities on the evolution of a multi layer groundwater system located in a region dominated by agricultural activities in saudi arabia high concentrations of total dissolved solids tds and salinity were associated with rock water interactions and evaporation whereas high values of phosphorus and nitrate were attributed to anthropogenic factors particularly the usage of inorganic fertilizers in agricultural activities the significant role of both anthropogenic and natural activities on groundwater quality has also been pointed out by raju et al raju et al 2015 the authors used factor analysis to analyze a large number of parameters in central nepal mallick et al mallick et al 2018 combined principal component analysis with correlation analysis and descriptive statistics to evaluate the quality of a groundwater system located in the aseer region saudi arabia pca identified the major mechanisms that control groundwater chemistry whereas phreeqc software was combined with inverse geochemical modeling for estimating aqueous mineral phases and saturation index the results suggested the adaptation of existing water policies due to high concentrations of salinity and alkalinity indicators in the area telahigue et al telahigue et al 2018 used multivariate techniques to evaluate the spatial extent of aquifer salinization in a coastal area located in jerba island in tunisia as before pca was adapted to identify the major components that explain the variability of the groundwater system their analyses identified high salinity risks along the coastal zone whereas high levels of mineralization were found in several parts of the study area that were attributed to the combined action of seawater intrusion and water rock interaction overall factor analysis fa and principal component analysis pca are found to be the most commonly used multivariate techniques fig 2 3 2 spatial interpolation and kriging hu et al hu et al 2005 used ordinary kriging ok to estimate and map the spatial distribution of electric conductivity groundwater head and nitrate concentrations in the north china plain these maps revealed the existence of particular regions vulnerable to salinization indicator kriging was used to evaluate the health risks associated with νο3 by providing the likelihood that nitrate concentrations exceed specific threshold values nas nas 2009 conducted a groundwater quality assessment in konya turkey whereby ok was used to estimate the spatial variability of major salinity indicators and nitrate concentrations adhikary et al adhikary et al 2011 applied kriging methods to investigate whether the groundwater quality at the najafgarh block delhi is suitable for drinking and or irrigation purposes ok was used to produce spatial distributions of different geochemical parameters arslan arslan 2012 analyzed the spatial and seasonal variability of groundwater salinity at bafra plain through the use of ok in addition indicator kriging ik was applied to construct probability maps of electrical conductivity to evaluate the salinity risks makkawi makkawi 2014 combined ok and ik to construct three dimensional salinity maps to identify risk regions in a brackish saline aquifer these maps showed increasing tds concentrations with depth and towards the northern part of the study area the authors also argued that their approach could be used for choosing suitable pumping wells in terms of groundwater quality bradai et al bradaï et al 2016 investigated the performance of ok and ik methods on estimating the spatial distribution of salinity in terms of variance and area size ik achieved a better agreement with field measurements than ok whereas the former method provided a more detailed description of the regions of high ec concentrations also the authors recommended the use of ik for determining zones that are suitable for irrigation purposes seyedmohammadi et al seyedmohammadi et al 2016 compared various deterministic interpolation methods idw global polynomial interpolation local polynomial interpolation radial basis functions to choose the most suitable for estimating the spatial variation of ec in paddy fields ok was the optimal choice for groundwater management showing increased salinity and salt ions concentrations in the study area a similar conclusion has been reached by karami et al karami et al 2018 who reported the superior performance of ok concerning traditional deterministic methods for mapping purposes kurunc et al kurunc et al 2016 considered the spatio temporal evolution of groundwater quality parameters in the antalya basin located in the south part of anatolia turkey they observed water quality degradation due to anthropogenic and natural processes resulting in increased salinity and nitrate concentrations their results showed high levels of salinity and nitrate pollution in the study area mainly attributed to anthropogenic and natural activities ranjbar and ehteshami ranjbar and ehteshami 2019 used the three dimensional density dependent numerical model seawat to simulate the transport groundwater salinity via total dissolved solids tds of a coastal aquifer located in the talar region different popular variogram models particularly spherical gaussian and exponential were considered whereas a stochastic optimization algorithm called genetic algorithm was used to provide optimal values for the variogram parameters namely sill range and nugget the resulting variogram model was used to compile maps of the salinity indicator through ok it was found that a combination of the exponential and gaussian models achieved the best agreement with the field measurements kriging variants have also been used for the optimal design of monitoring networks in groundwater systems dhar and datta dhar and datta 2009 addressed the difficulty of optimization algorithms to provide globally optimal solutions based on the notion that linear formulations such as kriging schemes can overcome this issue as a result they proposed a monitoring network that combined a decision model with ordinary kriging as a spatial interpolation scheme the performance of the aforementioned approach was found to be satisfactory being able to find an optimal set of monitoring locations for estimating the spatio temporal distribution of pollutants several reports exist that incorporate kriging variants to design monitoring networks kavusi et al 2020 chao et al 2011 yeh et al 2006 that are used for groundwater quality assessment as expected ordinary kriging has appeared more than any other kriging variant during this review followed by the indicator kriging fig 2 3 3 combination of multivariate techniques and geostatistics a significant number of recent studies have focused on coupling multivariate techniques with geostatistics to improve groundwater resource exploitation strategy sánchez martos et al 2001 babiker et al 2006 mcleod et al 2017 güler et al 2012 particularly popular multivariate methods such as principal component analysis and factor analysis are used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets thus facilitating the identification of patterns among the variables the results from these analyses typically pertain to sparse measurement locations and are then used by geostatistics to compile spatial maps of factor components and risks originated from anthropogenic and geogenic activities shyu et al shyu et al 2011 combined ordinary kriging with factor analysis to identify the principal factors influencing groundwater quality and map their spatial pattern shannon s entropy was used to estimate the uncertainty of the quality factors that emerged from the collection of samples in taiwan over a two year span the authors suggested that the results could facilitate subsequent research on environmental remediation pollution prevention and investigating natural variations and implementing water management projects agoubi et al agoubi et al 2012 conducted a multi disciplinary study to model salinity transport in a coastal aquifer located in the southeast part of tunisia hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify sample locations with similar hydrochemical characteristics related to major mineralization processes kriging techniques were used to construct salinity maps that indicated seawater intrusion to the coastal zone of the aquifer masoud masoud 2014 used a partitioning clustering method called k means to classify sampling wells fa was adapted to identify the principal factors that drive the geochemical processes whereas ok was used to compile groundwater quality maps similar to the conclusions of shyu et al the authors suggested that the integration of multivariate and geostatistical tools can help design improved management strategies a similar approach to the classification of the sample wells and the characterization of groundwater processes has been proposed by venkatramanan et al venkatramanan et al 2016 the authors successfully combined factor analysis cluster analysis and ok to evaluate the groundwater quality for an aquifer in miryang city south korea kim et al kim et al 2012 conducted a multi disciplinary analysis to assess groundwater pollution levels and origins at a coastal region in south korea hierarchical clustering was applied to classify monitoring wells in three groups each relating to a pollution process factor analysis identified the sources of pollution which were associated with three major factor components discriminant analysis was used to identify the origin of contaminants as a result the major geochemical parameters were associated with the principal factors maps of significant contaminants and factors were constructed through the use of ok showing similar distributions abu alnaeem et al abu alnaeem et al 2018 conducted a similar study to delineate pollution zones and identify controlling factors of seawater intrusion of the gaza coastal aquifer located in palestine as in other studies the authors highlighted the effectiveness of combining multivariate and geostatistical tools for designing groundwater management policies in another study elumalai et al elumalai et al 2017 used ok and idw interpolation methods to construct pollution maps of a groundwater system located in richards bay south africa ok achieved a better agreement with the field measurements than idw accurately identifying the three pollution zones factor analysis and principal component analysis were combined to determine the significant factors the overall results revealed the presence of poor groundwater quality in the study area and recommended the implementation of remediation measures additional studies that involved the combination of factor and principal component analyses to identify significant factors can be found in the literature for example the analysis of belkhiri and narany belkhiri and narany 2015 revealed the dominant role of anthropogenic activities and water rock interactions on groundwater quality maps for major geochemical parameters were constructed using ok which helped connect the high concentrations of parameters with the anthropogenic contamination at specific zones of the study area egbi et al egbi et al 2018 applied the same techniques to conduct a holistic assessment of groundwater quality of a shallow aquifer located in the lower volta river basin in ghana their results identified salinity as one of the major hydrochemical processes that affect the conditions of the groundwater system in narany et al narany et al 2013 the significance of choosing an optimal combination of monitoring wells was discussed for assessing the geochemical conditions of a groundwater system in the amol babol plain iran to achieve that purpose ik was employed for constructing probability maps of exceeding nitrate thresholds based on nitrate concentration data these maps suggested zones that are vulnerable to nitrate pollution additional risk maps were obtained using the us epa drastic method integrated with the probability maps to identify optimal sampling locations belkhiri et al belkhiri et al 2020 integrated different statistical tools to map the spatial extent of a groundwater quality index gwqi which reflects the impact of several geochemical variables on groundwater quality the results suggested a strong connection between gwqi and major salinity indicators chosen as auxiliary variables in co kriging cross validation revealed the superiority of co kriging over ok when ec was chosen as the covariate triki et al triki et al 2013 combined multivariate statistics with co kriging to estimate salinity risk in a coastal aquifer located in sfax tunisia pca has been adopted in order to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset three principal components were selected to associate the quality parameters with seawater intrusion water rock interaction and n o 3 an r mode hierarchical cluster algorithm was then used to classify the sampling wells into distinct groups revealing a strong correlation among major parameters similar to pca co kriging was then considered in order to incorporate information regarding the interaction between the geochemical parameters cross validation revealed the superior performance of co kriging compared to ok for estimating the spatial pattern of groundwater contaminants whereas the authors emphasized the effectiveness of using the proposed approach to revise existing groundwater management policies the superiority of ordinary co kriging over ordinary kriging has been also reported by ashrafzadeh et al ashrafzadeh et al 2016 who considered the spatio temporal variability of electric conductivity and sums of major cations and anions in guilan province iran over a five year span maps of interpolated values for these parameters allowed the division of the study area into zones based on the salinity levels in addition probability maps of exceeding specific salinity thresholds were constructed using indicator kriging allowing the identification of regions within the study area of high salinization risk based on their results the authors suggested that the resulting maps can guide farmers for better water management 3 4 modeling spatial uncertainty although kriging and related methods quantify local per interpolation location uncertainty regarding the corresponding interpolated attribute parameter values too often practitioners end up using only these interpolated values for subsequent analyses maps of interpolated parameter values are typically too smooth and do not reflect short scale attribute variability as discussed in the introductory session geostatistical simulation can be used to quantify and propagate uncertainty regarding the entire spatial distribution of an attribute this is done by simulating a set ensemble of attribute realizations each realistically reflecting the spatial variability and patterns of model parameters these realizations are conditioned to state observations caers 2011 kyriakidis 2017 subsequently these realizations are further elaborated to model uncertainty in associated model predictions this subsection discusses several publications that evaluate the uncertainty in groundwater model predictions through geostatistical simulation or ensemble based methods optimization based methods such as ensemble kalman filter enkf are also considered to evaluate uncertainty in a computationally efficient way along with studies involving the replacement of complex physical models with machine learning techniques closely related to geostatistics such as gaussian process regression gpr 3 4 1 simulations in an attempt to revisit the groundwater model in amchitka island alaska usa hassan et al hassan et al 2009 performed markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulations to condition samples of model parameters generated from prior distributions in contrast to conventional mc approaches they constructed relations between model and likelihood parameters to reduce the computational time conditioning on three datasets including chemistry data hydraulic head data and newly collected magnetotelluric mt data significantly reduces the uncertainty of model inputs resulting in a much narrower range of model outputs compared to the unconditioned simulations in a recent study kreyns et al kreyns et al 2020 investigated the influence of geological heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of salinity in volcanic aquifers multiple realizations of the hydraulic conductivity field were constructed through a monte carlo based technique called sequential indicator simulation sis which were used as input to the seawat numerical model for simulating the spatio temporal distribution of the groundwater flow and salt their results revealed the significant impact of aquifer heterogeneity on the evolution of salinity and submarine groundwater discharge gómez hernandez et al gómez hernández et al 2021 used sis to construct realizations of three dimensional geological model of a highly heterogeneous aquifer located in the south western part of spain the heterogeneity of geological classes was characterized through indicator variograms whereas sis was used for quantifying the spatial uncertainty of the geological features the resulting realizations were then imported in modflow to evaluate the evolution of the piezometric levels compared to homogeneous models the predictions of the proposed approach exhibited major discrepancies at specific regions highlighting the significant influence of the geological model on the spatial variability of the piezometric levels furthermore the authors emphasized the positive impact that an improved geological model can have on improving management policies in terms of marine water intrusion and groundwater exploitation in an attempt to model uncertainty regarding aquifer geology jorreto zaguirre et al jorreto zaguirre et al 2020 modelled the uncertainty of the geology of a coastal aquifer by proposing an extension of the sequential indicator simulation that was done by including uncertainty information about hydrofacies proportions leading to improved uncertainty quantification of the porous media the simulations revealed the strong connection between the variogram model and the connectivity of the hydrofacies which determines the spatial extent of the seawater penetration the authors suggested that this approach can set up optimal flow simulation models in terms of groundwater management in order to evaluate groundwater quality in the birjand plain iran aryafar et al aryafar et al 2020 used geostatistical methods to estimate the spatial distribution of thirteen geochemical parameters variogram models were constructed and validated based on jack knife and cross validation techniques ok was used for estimating the spatial distribution of these variables sequential gaussian simulation sgs was also considered to mitigate the smoothing effects produced by the kriging method achieving a better agreement with the actual dataset the authors suggested that the resulting maps can be used for designing optimal sampling strategies jalali et al jalali et al 2019 combined geostatistical and multivariate methods to characterize the groundwater state in saveh aquifer turkey principal component analysis and factor analysis were used to relate major quality parameters with groundwater processes sgs was used to construct simulated parameter realizations to avoid the smoothing issues of ok leading to the identification of highly contaminated regions and the classification of the aquifer in three risk groups i e low moderate and high through the use of the fractal theory a similar study was conducted by karami et al karami et al 2020 highlighting the advantages of using geostatistical simulations instead of kriging to design optimal strategies for sustainable groundwater management in their study they investigated groundwater quality conditions in tehran karaj plain aquifer iran their results exhibited the ability of sgs to accurately delineate pollution zones thus allowing decision makers to focus on limited areas for further sampling and analysis another way that geostatistical methods can be used for estimating the spatial extent of salinity has been discussed by hermans et al hermans et al 2012 more specific the authors employed electrical resistivity to delineate tds for the purpose of monitoring seawater intrusion they proposed the inclusion of a covariance matrix based on variograms of electric conductivity to solve the electric resistivity tomography ert inverse problem in particular borehole measurements were used to construct a vertical variogram of the electrical conductivity the variogram was used to construct a covariance matrix for regularizing the inversion model kriging and sgs were also employed as model comparison references the generated saltwater plume model compared well with field data leading to a reduction of the spatial uncertainty of the saltwater plume according to three dimensional tds profiles 3 4 2 computationally efficient methods 3 4 2 1 latin hypercube as a sampling strategy monte carlo implementations are computationally expensive due to the large number of simulations required for conducting the uncertainty propagation at an acceptable level of accuracy one way to reduce the computational complexity is by reducing the number of simulations through sampling strategies without deteriorating the accuracy of the predictions rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2014 an example of these strategies is latin hypercube sampling lhs a stratified monte carlo method that generates realizations of random attributes that cover the range of given probability distributions hardyanto and merkel 2007 liodakis et al 2015 liodakis et al 2017 latin hypercube simulation does not require any gaussian assumption it simply generates simulations within quantile demarkated intervals of a given distribution no matter its functional form parametric or non parametric dong and nakayama 2017 only few publications related to groundwater salinization have been found that use lhs to generate samples of model inputs such as pumping rates kopsiaftis et al kopsiaftis et al 2019 hydraulic conductivity and recharge rates karamouz et al karamouz et al 2020 compared to standard monte carlo simulations it was found that lhs can significantly improve sampling efficiently several variants of this sampling algorithm have been proposed meant to improve space filling optimize projective properties minimize least square error and maximize entropy and reduce spurious correlations shields and zhang 2016 to the best of the authors knowledge none of these strategies has been used in groundwater salinization applications within the time frame 2005 2021 of this review 3 4 2 2 ensemble kalman filtering the process of model calibration involves the use of all observations simultaneously whereas sequential approaches repeatedly recalibrate the model using a subset of the data in a given step for transient parameters such as groundwater recharge sequential methods are the methods of choice a particularly popular sequential method in groundwater modeling is ensemble kalman filter enkf chen and zhang 2006 erdal and cirpka 2017 it is essentially a monte carlo approach using an ensemble of model realizations to evaluate necessary statistics unlike kalman filter enkf is suitable for handling nonlinearities and large dimensions and is easy to implement it has the particular advantage that it can be used in conjunction with any model relating model inputs to observations without the necessity to compute the jacobian of that relationship a limitation of this approach is the assumption that all probability distributions involved are gaussian data assimilation methods such as the ensemble kalman filter provide an alternative way for generating conditional realizations of aquifer parameters in a computationally efficient manner an illustrative example is reported by franssen and kinzelbach franssen and kinzelbach 2009 who applied enkf to a synthetic case study even though their predictions were similar to those obtained by modelling techniques like the sequential self calibration method gómez hernández et al 1997 they reduced the computational time by almost two orders of magnitude this efficiency is partly attributed to the explicit computation of the covariance matrix from the model outputs for each realization and the incorporation of observations without storing model outputs from previous time steps this method has gained attention by the hydrogeological community for conditioning hydrogeological parameters to concentration schöniger et al 2012 crestani et al 2013 and groundwater head chen and zhang 2006 zhou et al 2011 until now only a few studies involved real world field experiments whereas the majority of these studies involved synthetic test cases crestani et al 2013 zovi et al 2017 the work conducted by bouzaglou et al bouzaglou et al 2018 was the only one that applied this method to address salinity issues in groundwater systems particularly due to seawater intrusion they integrated enkf with a three dimensional groundwater model called sutra for simulating the salinity evolution in a real experiment electrical resistivity tomography data electrical resistances are assimilated to update soil parameters and salt concentration the results suggested that enkf is a promising data assimilation tool for reducing the uncertainty on model inputs outputs for various groundwater related problems including salinization 3 4 2 3 gaussian process regression gpr as a surrogate model as mentioned in section 2 3 surrogate models can facilitate uncertainty analysis by reducing the number of unknowns and improving numerical robustness it is a common approach to use gpr based surrogate models in engineering optimization applications these models involve empirical approximations of complex model outputs calibrated on a set of inputs and outputs of the complex model a major advantage of this category of models compared to deterministic ones is that it predicts a distribution described by mean and standard deviation rather than just a point estimate the standard deviation of a distribution is referred in literature as epistemic uncertainty i e how certain the model is with respect to its prediction another source of uncertainty can be observed with regard to the lack of complete control over all influential parameters these deviations occurring during repeated process iterations under the same conditions are referred to as aleatoric uncertainty as expected a major limitation of this method is the requirement of the probability distributions to satisfy a gaussian assumption few studies have been identified that applied these models in problems relevant to groundwater salinity werner et al 2013 asher et al 2015 according to rajabi and ketabchi rajabi and ketabchi 2017 gpr based surrogate models are suitable for evaluating in a computationally efficient manner the epistemic and aleatory uncertainty that is present in swi models the proposed emulator was chosen instead of the sutra transport model within a simulation optimization scheme to assess the swi extent of a coastal aquifer in the persian gulf the results demonstrated the ability of this meta model to provide reliable predictions while achieving a significant reduction in computational time kopsiaftis et al kopsiaftis et al 2019 compared the performance of gpr based meta models with three commonly used regression models specifically support vector machine and regression trees to predict the spatial extent of seawater intrusion the proposed model was trained based on a large number of variable density computations whereas lhs was adopted to generate representative pumping rates the hyperparameters of all surrogate models were optimized through a bayesian procedure although gpr needs more computational time than the other models the results showed that it achieved the highest performance according to different quantitative indicators roy and datta roy and datta 2018 aimed at designing optimized policies to prevent saltwater intrusion by investigating the influence of climatic conditions at sea three surrogate models specifically gpr adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and multivariate adaptive regression spline mars were trained based on numerical computations of a density dependent transport model the performance of these models was evaluated at a multi layer coastal aquifer all models managed to capture the trends of the salinization processes whereas anfis based emulator provided the most accurate predictions along with the highest computational efficiency accordingly the best meta model replaced the transport model within the simulation optimization based s o swi management framework showing promising results a similar study has been reported by the same authors roy and datta 2018 who compared the performance of rt ma and gpr based surrogate models in predicting model parameters gpr achieved the highest scores and it was then integrated within an optimization algorithm in terms of swi management the results supported the argument that gpr is suitable for replacing complex physical models within an optimization framework 4 conclusions and further directions from this review article it can be inferred that several geostatistical methods have not yet been considered to address groundwater salinization problems for example very few applications of co kriging exist despite its advantages compared to other kriging variants it worth mentioning that few publications have considered jointly simulating the spatial distribution of multiple attributes parameters by transforming them to log ratios and then to principal components thus avoiding co simulation based on co kriging for which inference of a jointly permissible set of auto and cross variogram models can be challenging madani and carranza 2020 sharifi et al 2019 no recent studies were identified that employ principal component simulation to groundwater salinization problems fuzzy kriging is another method that has not been favoured yet by practitioners this method can handle the epistemic uncertainty of contaminants that is present due to imprecise or and incomplete sample data fuzzy kriging has been used for the construction of optimized groundwater quality monitoring networks dhar and patil 2011 an alternative interpolation method has been developed by bardossy bárdossy 2006 bárdossy and li 2008 who borrowed the idea of copulas to characterize spatial dependence in groundwater quality parameters instead of covariance functions and variograms as expected it has been shown that non gaussian copulas can provide more accurate predictions than traditional kriging methods for several groundwater quality parameters whereas no comparison between copulas and non linear geostatistics such as disjunctive kriging was reported it worth mentioning that no recent articles were found that employ disjunctive kriging to groundwater salinization problems revealing a gap that can be potentially addressed in future studies regarding geostatistical simulations transition probability geostatistics is reported as an efficient method for constructing conditional realizations of the geological patterns that has not yet been applied to address groundwater salinization problems he et al 2014 dell arciprete et al 2011 sivakumar et al 2005 for example lee et al lee et al 2007 reported that indicator simulation based on tp could better capture the lateral connectivity of channel facies than sgs which led to improved predictions of groundwater head responses during pumping optimized extensions of lhs have been shown to generate representative realizations of model parameters with high sampling efficiency allowing the reduction of the computational time of monte carlo simulations these lhs variants have not yet received significant attention in real world gw applications multi dimensional scaling mds is another powerful tool for visualizing the uncertainty of very high dimensional spatial models realizations by computing an appropriate distance between pairs of attribute realizations within an ensemble of such realizations which are then projected into a lower dimensional space mds has not been applied yet in groundwater salinization problems to the best of the authors knowledge based on the above literature review the following conclusions recommendations can be identified in terms of most used methods future directions and main challenges remaining to be addressed according to fig 2 ordinary kriging under a gaussian assumption is by far the most widely used interpolation method for the spatial interpolation of salinity parameters whereas pca and ca multivariate techniques are extensively used to identify potential groundwater salinity sources sis is favoured by practitioners followed by sgs for capturing short scale attribute variability leading to more realistic spatial distribution mapping than kriging whereas ensemble kalman filter enkf is found to be the most popular data assimilation method in terms of future directions further integration of data and models is needed for improving the accuracy of the estimations whereas more realistic spatial prediction methods such as simulation are recommended to avoid smoothing effects of interpolation kriging and for performing uncertainty propagation efficient sampling strategies such as optimized extensions of lhs are expected further to reduce the computational cost generating a large number of stochastic simulations which are then processed by groundwater models for uncertainty analysis propagation purposes further improvements in computational complexity and stability can be achieved using machine learning methods such as gpr based surrogate models generative adversarial network gan is an example of a deep machine learning algorithm that is recently used for modelling reservoir facies dupont et al 2018 laloy et al 2018 this algorithm is widely used for generating images of systems that exhibit similarities to facies models comparisons with conventional geostatistical methods zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2021 show the superior performance of gans in terms of learning and mapping the complex geological structures gans fall under the realm of multiple point geostatistics mariethoz and caers 2014 tahmasebi 2018 which is an active area of research based on the above reducing computational cost is expected to remain a significant challenge for scientists to consider particularly when physically based models are involved along with the integration of machine learning approaches beyond a black box treatment for these challenges to be successfully addressed a close and continuous collaboration between hydrogeologists geochemists geo statisticians computer and data scientists and policy decision makers is required concluding this review demonstrates the direct relevance of geostatistics to groundwater salinization problems both in terms of analysis mapping of geochemical and other relevant variables and in terms of simulation of hydraulic conductivity and other input parameters to physically based models of groundwater quality assessment based on the review studies some recommendations can be made on the future role of geostatistics in this area firstly further application of geostatistics is envisioned towards the characterization and managements of aquifers facing salinization problems due to the stochastic nature of these groundwater systems due to the complexity of the subsurface systems and the high dimensionality of the associated datasets innovative integration of geostatistics and machine learning methods is expected to provide improved understanding and modeling of groundwater salinization processes lastly the application of modern geostatistical simulation algorithms accounting for diverse information sources might improve mapping the spatial and or spatiotemporal distribution of

2694,groundwater salinization is considered to be one of the most severe and complex phenomena affecting coastal regions worldwide occurring when high concentrations of water soluble salts are present in groundwater systems geostatistics is a branch of statistics used to analyze and predict the spatio temporal variability of such complex phenomena in particular numerous geostatistical approaches and technologies are currently used to identify and map salinity affected regions investigate how salinity indicators influence groundwater mechanisms and eventually design optimal groundwater management policies this article reviews recent key applications of geostatistical methods to address challenges relevant to groundwater salinization the basic principles of geostatistics are briefly described and numerous studies are discussed that employ geostatistical and multivariate tools for identifying the origin of salinity sources clarifying the relationship among salinity indicators and groundwater processes and propagating the uncertainty of the inputs to the outputs of either physically based or surrogate models of relevant geological systems finally several recommendations and future directions are identified with regards to the most popular methods and with regards to key geostatistical methods whose application in this thematic area is still very limited keywords

freshwater or are vitally needed to supplement surface water sources as a result there is a need to secure the availability and quality of groundwater reserves in these areas in particular the mediterranean and middle east mme regions are among the world s most vulnerable territories to water scarcity and quality degradation due to rapid changes imposed by non climatic and climatic drivers salinization in particular limits or threatens the availability of groundwater resources in the most populated and productive coastal areas of the mme mastrocicco and colombani 2021 as a phenomenon aquifer salinization is a complex and dynamic process often related to multiple causes such as lack of internal drainage seawater intrusion bear et al 1999 werner et al 2013 natural occurrence in closed surface water basins hardie and eugster 1970 eugster and hardie 1978 high water levels that cause increased evaporation via capillary rise barrett lennard 2003 chaudhuri and ale 2014 soil salinization associated with water irrigation hanson et al 1999 hillel 2000 and geogenic factors e g evaporite dissolution etc due to the complexity of spatial and temporal salinization patterns large and high dimensional datasets are required to fully characterize the salinity status of subsurface systems consequently a reliable assessment of salinity risks depends heavily on the ability of statistical tools to accurately capture the spatial variability and the interrelation among salinity indicators such as chloride electric conductivity and sodium content estimations of these indicators at unsampled locations are obtained from observed data at sample locations through interpolation methods geostatistics is a branch of spatial statistics that describes the spatial pattern and provides estimates of the attribute values at unsampled locations it provides a comprehensive framework for combining different types of datasets to build local models of spatial uncertainty numerous studies exist that report the application of different geostatistical techniques to groundwater pollution problems kriging is a popular method that has been successfully used for mapping the spatio temporal patterns of groundwater salinity parameters adhikary et al 2010 yimit et al 2011 deepika et al 2020 multivariate extensions of kriging can also be used to perform spatial interpolation of multiple attributes by incorporating information of one or more secondary variables for reducing the prediction error variance of the primary variable ahmadi and sedghamiz 2006 dokou et al 2015 it has been shown that the inclusion of additional information can improve the estimation accuracy if the primary variable is cross correlated with the secondary attributes issaks and srivastava 1989 a key limitation of kriging methods is that they often provide smooth interpolated attribute maps particularly in the presence of sparse data which might not fully capture the variability of the attribute of interest a remedy is to conduct geostatistical simulation to generate multiple realizations of the attribute of interest reproducing short scale attribute variability these alternative realizations of the spatial distribution of attribute values are typically used to propagate parameter uncertainty in physically based models lee et al 2007 blouin et al 2012 a large number of model runs that depends on the complexity of the physical model itself are often required to achieve sufficient accuracy in the distribution of model outputs leading to computationally expensive monte carlo uncertainty assessments furthermore these computations involve the solution of different physically based models that aim to a identify various sources and processes of salinization b capture the dynamics and characterize the state of groundwater systems and c assess future risks in terms of future climate and socio economic changes dunlop et al 2019 filippis et al 2016 mastrocicco et al 2019 these models require the determination of various parameters such as specific yield storage hydraulic conductivity sink and source terms along with boundary and initial conditions one way to mitigate the computational burden is to replace complex physical models with simpler models that mimic the behaviour of the former machine learning tools particularly gaussian process regression gpr have been successfully used to facilitate uncertainty analysis in groundwater salinization problems razavi et al 2012 lal and datta 2018 the purpose of the current study is to provide an overview of recent 2005 studies that employ geostatistical techniques in groundwater salinization problems particularly the current overview focuses on studies that use geostatistics a along with multivariate techniques to identify and analyze the dominant mechanisms influencing groundwater salinity and estimate the spatial variability of major salinity indicators b for integrating salinity attributes towards the objective of spatial interpolation c for quantifying spatial uncertainty by generating multiple realizations of salinization related parameters and d for constructing surrogate models that emulate physically based models in order to reduce model complexity and computational burden fig 1 shows a graphical overview of this review study in terms of the major thematic areas of geostatistics which involve the analysis and modeling of spatial association the integration of data of different sources and resolutions towards the objective of spatial interpolation and the assessment of uncertainty in spatial prediction and its propagation to outputs results of spatial operations or of models with spatially distributed inputs and or parameters kyriakidis 2017 note that these studies are further classified based on the dimensionality of the sample dataset relevant publications were selected through search engines and online databases using keywords associated with the thematic areas fig 2 provides a classification of these keywords in terms of their occurrences in the context of groundwater salinization bibliographical data e g authors publication year title etc is used to cluster the selected keywords the size of each bubble denotes the total number of occurrences whereas the thickness of a line connecting a pair of keywords denotes the number of common occurrences for example it is observed that several transient groundwater flow models tgf such as modflow sutra feflow seawat are used in conjuction with different monte carlo simulation methods such as sequential indicator simulation sis sequential gaussian simulation sgs markov chain monte carlo mcmc transition probabilities tp and latin hypercube sampling lhs to conduct uncertainty analysis the findings of fig 2 are used in section 4 to identify the most widely used methods and propose future directions based on the results of this review several advanced geostatistical techniques that have not been favoured yet by practitioners for these problems have been identified which could potentially lead to improved estimations in addition key challenges and future directions are addressed 2 general principles of geostatistics as shown in fig 1 geostatistics can be classified into three thematic areas kyriakidis 2017 a analysis and modelling of spatial association b spatial interpolation of attribute parameter data with or without the incorporation of data on relevant auxiliary or predictor attributes and c quantification of the uncertainty in the spatial distribution of estimated attribute values spatial uncertainty and its impact on model predictions uncertainty propagation 2 1 spatial association spatial association refers to the similarity or dissimilarity between values of attributes parameters measured at different spatial locations within the framework of geostatistics attribute spatial variability can be quantified through the sample or empirical semivariogram in the case of two variables this quantity can be extended to the bivariate case termed sample cross variogram issaks and srivastava 1989 jointly permissible models of spatial association are needed in the case of two or more variables such as the intrinsic co regionalization model and the linear model of co regionalization chilès and delfiner 2012 in the case of categorical data indicator variograms have been used for quantifying the spatial association of each category chilès and delfiner 2012 semivariograms are often computed from a limited sample data set and represent averages of pairwise attribute dis similarity values at discrete distance classes in order to obtain a continuous spatial description of this quantity as a function of distance suitable semivariogram model expressions are considered that are required to provide non negative variance of estimators fig 1 thus called positive definite functions expressions that satisfy this requirement and are widely used in applications relevant to groundwater salinization are the exponential gaussian and spherical functions such models reach a plateau sill i e they correspond to random functions fields with a finite variance other variogram models without a sill such as the linear and power law models are also widely used in hydrology and correspond to intrinsic random functions fields chilès and delfiner 2012 variogram models play an essential role in modelling the spatial continuity of attribute values chilès and delfiner 2012 goovaerts 1997 and comprise key elements of geostatistical spatial interpolation methods used to construct maps of the spatial distribution of hydrogeological or other parameters such as hydraulic conductivity electric conductivity total dissolved solids nitrates etc 2 2 spatial interpolation up to date several spatial interpolation methods have been developed issaks and srivastava 1989 which can be classified into two main categories deterministic and stochastic deterministic methods are used for predicting a unique attribute value at each location where a sample is not available examples are nearest neighbor interpolation bilinear interpolation triangulated irregular network interpolation inverse distance weighted idw interpolation and spline interpolation regarding stochastic interpolation techniques special attention is given to the kriging method fig 1 which qualifies as the best linear unbiased predictor blup kriging also known as gaussian process regression in machine learning cui et al 2021 provides an optimal prediction of an attribute at a target location by minimizing the prediction error variance assuming that a variogram or covariogram model is available different variants of kriging have been developed depending on the assumptions adopted regarding the expected attribute value average at different locations the simplest variant named simple kriging occurs when the expected attribute value is assumed to be known everywhere however this assumption limits the applicability of this kriging variant due to the difficulty of acquiring this information ordinary kriging ok within local neighborhoods centered at prediction locations is the most popular kriging method used in groundwater salinization problems arslan 2012 karami et al 2018 hu et al 2005 and assumes a constant but unknown expected attribute value within each search neighborhood different from one neighborhood to another universal kriging uk assumes a linear functional link between the attribute s expected value and the spatial coordinates or polynomials thereof within the search neighborhood similar to trend surface analysis the theory of intrinsic random functions of order k irf k generalizes uk to random functions with stationary increments spatial differences of order k capitalizing on the notion of generalized covariances of that order more details can be found in several works chilès and delfiner 2012 matheron 1970 matheron 1971 kitanidis 1997 in the case where the local attribute of interest is connected to other relevant or auxiliary attributes through a linear regression model the corresponding kriging variant is termed kriging with external drift ked goovaerts 1997 deutsch and journel 1992 wackernagel 2003 rivest et al 2008 the kriging normal equations provide a general framework to incorporate into spatial prediction data that are linearly linked to the attribute of interest such as data defined as arithmetic averages of point attribute values over a block or as differences of attribute values at nearby locations defined via for example the laplacian operator a classical gradient based linear link between attributes in hydrogeology is the poisson type partial differential equation linking transmissivity to piezometric head see dong dong 1989 in the local regression approach for spatial interpolation furnished by ked the data of the auxiliary variables should be collocated with those of the attribute of interest at the sample locations for estimating the parameters of the regression model and at the prediction locations for predicting the corresponding target values however such an isotopic or equally sampled design is often not realized in practice in this case data on multiple attributes can alternatively be integrated into spatial interpolation via co kriging triki et al 2013 ashrafzadeh et al 2016 in this case spatial interpolation is typically performed via co kriging and its variants and calls for the availability of a jointly permissible model for all auto and cross variograms defined between variables depending on the characteristics of the sample data additional kriging variants can be considered for example factorial kriging fk is used when the measurement errors of the sample data need to be considered in the presence of non gaussian datasets several extensions of kriging can be used such as lognormal kriging indicator kriging ik disjunctive kriging kuisi et al 2009 yazdanpanah 2016 tabandeh et al 2021 and copula based kriging agarwal et al 2021 li et al 2021 classical kriging under a multivariate gaussian assumption for the attribute random field furnishes the conditional mean expectation and variance of the unknown attribute value at a prediction location given conditional upon the nearby sample data these two parameters define a local at a prediction location gaussian conditional distribution indicator kriging furnishes an approximation of that local conditional distribution by estimating its k local quantiles using binary 0 1 indicators constructed from the sample data that is data values are transformed to k indicators of non exceedance of k attribute threshold values corresponding for example to k deciles of the sample data distribution disjunctive kriging furnishes a more consistent estimator of the conditional expectation and variance hence of the local conditional distribution as it amounts to co kriging of multiple indicators capitalizing on the notion of orthogonal polynomials for modelling the bivariate two point distribution of attribute pairs for different lag distances disjunctive kriging expresses the local conditional expectation as a function of coefficients of those orthogonal polynomials after gaussian anamorphosis transformation to a standard gaussian distribution once the local conditional distribution is approximated via disjunctive kriging the probability of exceeding or not a particular attribute threshold can be readily computed for more details on indicator kriging disjunctive kriging including their advantages and disadvantages see matheron matheron 1976 chilès and delfiner 2012 yates et al 1986 kriging based geostatistical simulations rely on variograms thus are not able to reproduce complex patterns clearly considering only two points is not sufficient for reproducing complex and heterogeneous models collecting information from multiple sources leads to large datasets which are not usually available in the earth science problems as they come with sparse and incomplete data such data instead can be browsed in the form a conceptual image called training image hence the fundamental novelty of the multiple point statistics mps framework is to encapsulate in a training image the interpretative knowledge on the spatial structure of the modeled phenomenon mariethoz and caers 2014 which can be difficult as natural images are typically not sufficiently repetitive or stationary copulas based geostatistical interpolations bárdossy and li 2008 are based on similar concepts with isofactorial models of bivariate distributions popularized within the geostatistical literature matheron 1984 and can be also used to model bivariate or multivariate distributions without imposing a multivariate gaussian assumption particularly copulas are standardized multivariate distributions with uniform marginals which can be used to describe the dependence structure of multivariate distributions separately from their univariate marginals hence bivariate empirical copulas can be used as an alternative to variograms and covariance functions for the characterization of spatial variability 2 3 uncertainty propagation knowledge of a series of local uncertainty models specified for example by the local kriging derived mean and variance are not always sufficient information for uncertainty propagation purposes particularly in the case of non gaussian distribution and or non linear models the appropriate solution for these cases is to use geostatistical monte carlo simulation goovaerts 1997 a statistical technique that aims at mimicking the process of sampling an actual phenomenon uncertainty propagation in this context is performed by first producing multiple realizations of the spatial distribution of the attribute under study via geostatistical simulation and subsequently evaluating a physical model using as alternative inputs parameters those realizations to produce multiple realizations model predictions fig 1 an illustrative example is the generation of alternative models of the three dimensional spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity used as input data to groundwater flow equations these alternative realizations and the flow equations are combined within a monte carlo framework to evaluate the uncertainty in the spatial distribution of hydraulic head in practice many monte carlo simulations are required to provide accurate predictive distributions making this method computationally expensive as mentioned in the introductory section a common approach is to construct simplified approximations of the complex modelling expressions known as surrogate models used instead within the mc framework in addition to achieving computational efficiency surrogate models are known for improving the numerical stability of the algorithms facilitating uncertainty analysis doherty and christensen 2011 3 applications of geostatistics in groundwater salinization an overview of studies that employ geostatistical techniques to groundwater salinization problems is hereafter presented from which gaps and future directions are identified and discussed in section 4 relevant review papers in the field of groundwater modeling quality assessment and monitoring already exist in the literature for example to achieve improved predictions regarding subsurface processes linde et al linde et al 2015 performed an overview of different geostatistical approaches combined to provide prior geological knowledge the authors emphasized the significance of reducing the dimensionality of the data allowing a better representation of geological heterogeneities and improved predictions of the aquifer states also priyanka and kumar priyanka and kumar 2017 provided a general perspective of how geostatistical models are used to model seawater intrusion swi processes the primary limitations and novelties of existing methodologies were discussed along with the need for further understanding of the complex structure of coastal aquifers geostatistical tools emerge as effective approaches for generating alternative realistic 2d or 3d numerical representations realizations of the spatial distribution of key hydrogeological and or hydrogeochemical parameters for simulating flow and transport processes in various case studies for example carrera et al carrera et al 2009 reviewed how geostatistical techniques are applied to assess salinization occurring due to seawater intrusion in particular the authors discussed computational and conceptual traits when used to model seawater intrusion concluding that there is plenty of room for improvement in terms of computational performance for example through the use of code parallelization to solve inverse problems and use of state variables from previous calibration iterations as initial guesses for non linear direct problems mastrocicco and colombani mastrocicco and colombani 2021 conducted an extensive overview of groundwater salinisation s major processes focusing on the mediterranean region the authors discussed various state of the art techniques including geostatistics used to address salinization problems and suggested that combining these approaches can potentially lead to optimal management strategies a key parameter but not the only in designing management strategies is how well the geological model is reflected in the uncertainty of the predictions a popular way to generate an ensemble of realizations for the aquifer states that reflect the geological pattern is by performing monte carlo simulations within the context of geostatistical simulations however this approach is computationally inefficient since it requires the iterative evaluation of forward model computations for a large number of realizations of the geological parameter e g hydraulic conductivity different approaches have been proposed to reduce such a computational cost for example through the selection of a subset of representative realizations from a large ensemble scheidt and caers 2008 ginsbourger et al 2013 building geological model at a lower resolution than the scale of the dataset upscaling li et al 2012 myrseth et al 2013 and by constructing simplified approximations of the complex models to decrease the number of unknowns that must be computed he et al 2013 pau et al 2013 known as surrogate models a recent survey by roy and datta roy and datta 2018 has summarized a wide range of surrogate models developed to approximate physical models and reduce computational complexity these models are used to quantify the spatial uncertainty of the predictions contributing to the revision of seawater intrusion management strategies gómez hernandez et al gómez hernández et al 2021 collected a number of studies that emphasize the significance of modelling uncertainty in groundwater processes using stochastic techniques these studies emphasized the importance of using computationally efficient methods in complex groundwater systems such as the edward aquifer white et al 2020 and the savanah river carle and fogg 2020 no review manuscript has been published specifically on the application of geostatistical techniques in groundwater salinization these techniques along with dimensionality reduction techniques are employed to a identify the origins and sources of groundwater salinization b relate geochemical parameters with contamination and or enrichment processes i e seawater intrusion water rock interactions and eventually construct maps to identify regions of high salinization risk c evaluate spatial uncertainty by generating multiple earth models and d assess the ability of geostatistical methods to replace physically based models in terms of estimation accuracy and computational demand for completeness this review study includes representative studies that consider closely related techniques to geostatistical methods even if the term geostatistics might not be explicitly used in the original paper 3 1 multivariate statistical techniques there are a plethora of studies that employ multivariate techniques alone to groundwater salinization problems here a small subset of these applications is considered since this is not the focus of this review article for example kumar et al kumar et al 2006 kumar et al 2009 conducted cluster and factor analyses to assess the interaction between surface water and an alluvial aquifer in delhi india application of hierarchical cluster analysis revealed the strong influence of regions of contaminated surface waters to specific groups of sampling locations then factor analysis was used to identify the most important quality parameters associated with hydro geochemical mechanisms reducing the number of parameters similar to kumar et al acikel and ekmekci acikel and ekmekci 2018 combined factor and cluster analysis to conduct a groundwater quality assessment of a karstified aquifer located in the south western part of turkey their results revealed the complexity that drives the recharge and salinization processes in the study area el yaouti et al yaouti et al 2009 combined cluster and principal component analyses to characterize the spatial variability of salinity and major contaminated regions within the bou areg unconfined aquifer their results indicated the presence of salinization due to seawater intrusion in different zones of the aquifer which is exhibiting an increasing trend in terms of depth and distance from the coastline papatheodorou et al papatheodorou et al 2007 considered various multivariate tools to assess the spatio temporal evolution of the malia coastal aquifer located on the island of crete in greece they applied factor and discriminant analyses to three separate sets of samples collected during different sampling periods their results suggested the presence of two dominant hydrochemical processes namely seawater intrusion and nitrate pollution whereas trend surface analysis showed the strong influence of flow movement on the spatial distribution of nitrate zaidi et al zaidi et al 2015 considered principal component analysis to clarify the impact of anthropogenic and natural activities on the evolution of a multi layer groundwater system located in a region dominated by agricultural activities in saudi arabia high concentrations of total dissolved solids tds and salinity were associated with rock water interactions and evaporation whereas high values of phosphorus and nitrate were attributed to anthropogenic factors particularly the usage of inorganic fertilizers in agricultural activities the significant role of both anthropogenic and natural activities on groundwater quality has also been pointed out by raju et al raju et al 2015 the authors used factor analysis to analyze a large number of parameters in central nepal mallick et al mallick et al 2018 combined principal component analysis with correlation analysis and descriptive statistics to evaluate the quality of a groundwater system located in the aseer region saudi arabia pca identified the major mechanisms that control groundwater chemistry whereas phreeqc software was combined with inverse geochemical modeling for estimating aqueous mineral phases and saturation index the results suggested the adaptation of existing water policies due to high concentrations of salinity and alkalinity indicators in the area telahigue et al telahigue et al 2018 used multivariate techniques to evaluate the spatial extent of aquifer salinization in a coastal area located in jerba island in tunisia as before pca was adapted to identify the major components that explain the variability of the groundwater system their analyses identified high salinity risks along the coastal zone whereas high levels of mineralization were found in several parts of the study area that were attributed to the combined action of seawater intrusion and water rock interaction overall factor analysis fa and principal component analysis pca are found to be the most commonly used multivariate techniques fig 2 3 2 spatial interpolation and kriging hu et al hu et al 2005 used ordinary kriging ok to estimate and map the spatial distribution of electric conductivity groundwater head and nitrate concentrations in the north china plain these maps revealed the existence of particular regions vulnerable to salinization indicator kriging was used to evaluate the health risks associated with νο3 by providing the likelihood that nitrate concentrations exceed specific threshold values nas nas 2009 conducted a groundwater quality assessment in konya turkey whereby ok was used to estimate the spatial variability of major salinity indicators and nitrate concentrations adhikary et al adhikary et al 2011 applied kriging methods to investigate whether the groundwater quality at the najafgarh block delhi is suitable for drinking and or irrigation purposes ok was used to produce spatial distributions of different geochemical parameters arslan arslan 2012 analyzed the spatial and seasonal variability of groundwater salinity at bafra plain through the use of ok in addition indicator kriging ik was applied to construct probability maps of electrical conductivity to evaluate the salinity risks makkawi makkawi 2014 combined ok and ik to construct three dimensional salinity maps to identify risk regions in a brackish saline aquifer these maps showed increasing tds concentrations with depth and towards the northern part of the study area the authors also argued that their approach could be used for choosing suitable pumping wells in terms of groundwater quality bradai et al bradaï et al 2016 investigated the performance of ok and ik methods on estimating the spatial distribution of salinity in terms of variance and area size ik achieved a better agreement with field measurements than ok whereas the former method provided a more detailed description of the regions of high ec concentrations also the authors recommended the use of ik for determining zones that are suitable for irrigation purposes seyedmohammadi et al seyedmohammadi et al 2016 compared various deterministic interpolation methods idw global polynomial interpolation local polynomial interpolation radial basis functions to choose the most suitable for estimating the spatial variation of ec in paddy fields ok was the optimal choice for groundwater management showing increased salinity and salt ions concentrations in the study area a similar conclusion has been reached by karami et al karami et al 2018 who reported the superior performance of ok concerning traditional deterministic methods for mapping purposes kurunc et al kurunc et al 2016 considered the spatio temporal evolution of groundwater quality parameters in the antalya basin located in the south part of anatolia turkey they observed water quality degradation due to anthropogenic and natural processes resulting in increased salinity and nitrate concentrations their results showed high levels of salinity and nitrate pollution in the study area mainly attributed to anthropogenic and natural activities ranjbar and ehteshami ranjbar and ehteshami 2019 used the three dimensional density dependent numerical model seawat to simulate the transport groundwater salinity via total dissolved solids tds of a coastal aquifer located in the talar region different popular variogram models particularly spherical gaussian and exponential were considered whereas a stochastic optimization algorithm called genetic algorithm was used to provide optimal values for the variogram parameters namely sill range and nugget the resulting variogram model was used to compile maps of the salinity indicator through ok it was found that a combination of the exponential and gaussian models achieved the best agreement with the field measurements kriging variants have also been used for the optimal design of monitoring networks in groundwater systems dhar and datta dhar and datta 2009 addressed the difficulty of optimization algorithms to provide globally optimal solutions based on the notion that linear formulations such as kriging schemes can overcome this issue as a result they proposed a monitoring network that combined a decision model with ordinary kriging as a spatial interpolation scheme the performance of the aforementioned approach was found to be satisfactory being able to find an optimal set of monitoring locations for estimating the spatio temporal distribution of pollutants several reports exist that incorporate kriging variants to design monitoring networks kavusi et al 2020 chao et al 2011 yeh et al 2006 that are used for groundwater quality assessment as expected ordinary kriging has appeared more than any other kriging variant during this review followed by the indicator kriging fig 2 3 3 combination of multivariate techniques and geostatistics a significant number of recent studies have focused on coupling multivariate techniques with geostatistics to improve groundwater resource exploitation strategy sánchez martos et al 2001 babiker et al 2006 mcleod et al 2017 güler et al 2012 particularly popular multivariate methods such as principal component analysis and factor analysis are used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets thus facilitating the identification of patterns among the variables the results from these analyses typically pertain to sparse measurement locations and are then used by geostatistics to compile spatial maps of factor components and risks originated from anthropogenic and geogenic activities shyu et al shyu et al 2011 combined ordinary kriging with factor analysis to identify the principal factors influencing groundwater quality and map their spatial pattern shannon s entropy was used to estimate the uncertainty of the quality factors that emerged from the collection of samples in taiwan over a two year span the authors suggested that the results could facilitate subsequent research on environmental remediation pollution prevention and investigating natural variations and implementing water management projects agoubi et al agoubi et al 2012 conducted a multi disciplinary study to model salinity transport in a coastal aquifer located in the southeast part of tunisia hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify sample locations with similar hydrochemical characteristics related to major mineralization processes kriging techniques were used to construct salinity maps that indicated seawater intrusion to the coastal zone of the aquifer masoud masoud 2014 used a partitioning clustering method called k means to classify sampling wells fa was adapted to identify the principal factors that drive the geochemical processes whereas ok was used to compile groundwater quality maps similar to the conclusions of shyu et al the authors suggested that the integration of multivariate and geostatistical tools can help design improved management strategies a similar approach to the classification of the sample wells and the characterization of groundwater processes has been proposed by venkatramanan et al venkatramanan et al 2016 the authors successfully combined factor analysis cluster analysis and ok to evaluate the groundwater quality for an aquifer in miryang city south korea kim et al kim et al 2012 conducted a multi disciplinary analysis to assess groundwater pollution levels and origins at a coastal region in south korea hierarchical clustering was applied to classify monitoring wells in three groups each relating to a pollution process factor analysis identified the sources of pollution which were associated with three major factor components discriminant analysis was used to identify the origin of contaminants as a result the major geochemical parameters were associated with the principal factors maps of significant contaminants and factors were constructed through the use of ok showing similar distributions abu alnaeem et al abu alnaeem et al 2018 conducted a similar study to delineate pollution zones and identify controlling factors of seawater intrusion of the gaza coastal aquifer located in palestine as in other studies the authors highlighted the effectiveness of combining multivariate and geostatistical tools for designing groundwater management policies in another study elumalai et al elumalai et al 2017 used ok and idw interpolation methods to construct pollution maps of a groundwater system located in richards bay south africa ok achieved a better agreement with the field measurements than idw accurately identifying the three pollution zones factor analysis and principal component analysis were combined to determine the significant factors the overall results revealed the presence of poor groundwater quality in the study area and recommended the implementation of remediation measures additional studies that involved the combination of factor and principal component analyses to identify significant factors can be found in the literature for example the analysis of belkhiri and narany belkhiri and narany 2015 revealed the dominant role of anthropogenic activities and water rock interactions on groundwater quality maps for major geochemical parameters were constructed using ok which helped connect the high concentrations of parameters with the anthropogenic contamination at specific zones of the study area egbi et al egbi et al 2018 applied the same techniques to conduct a holistic assessment of groundwater quality of a shallow aquifer located in the lower volta river basin in ghana their results identified salinity as one of the major hydrochemical processes that affect the conditions of the groundwater system in narany et al narany et al 2013 the significance of choosing an optimal combination of monitoring wells was discussed for assessing the geochemical conditions of a groundwater system in the amol babol plain iran to achieve that purpose ik was employed for constructing probability maps of exceeding nitrate thresholds based on nitrate concentration data these maps suggested zones that are vulnerable to nitrate pollution additional risk maps were obtained using the us epa drastic method integrated with the probability maps to identify optimal sampling locations belkhiri et al belkhiri et al 2020 integrated different statistical tools to map the spatial extent of a groundwater quality index gwqi which reflects the impact of several geochemical variables on groundwater quality the results suggested a strong connection between gwqi and major salinity indicators chosen as auxiliary variables in co kriging cross validation revealed the superiority of co kriging over ok when ec was chosen as the covariate triki et al triki et al 2013 combined multivariate statistics with co kriging to estimate salinity risk in a coastal aquifer located in sfax tunisia pca has been adopted in order to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset three principal components were selected to associate the quality parameters with seawater intrusion water rock interaction and n o 3 an r mode hierarchical cluster algorithm was then used to classify the sampling wells into distinct groups revealing a strong correlation among major parameters similar to pca co kriging was then considered in order to incorporate information regarding the interaction between the geochemical parameters cross validation revealed the superior performance of co kriging compared to ok for estimating the spatial pattern of groundwater contaminants whereas the authors emphasized the effectiveness of using the proposed approach to revise existing groundwater management policies the superiority of ordinary co kriging over ordinary kriging has been also reported by ashrafzadeh et al ashrafzadeh et al 2016 who considered the spatio temporal variability of electric conductivity and sums of major cations and anions in guilan province iran over a five year span maps of interpolated values for these parameters allowed the division of the study area into zones based on the salinity levels in addition probability maps of exceeding specific salinity thresholds were constructed using indicator kriging allowing the identification of regions within the study area of high salinization risk based on their results the authors suggested that the resulting maps can guide farmers for better water management 3 4 modeling spatial uncertainty although kriging and related methods quantify local per interpolation location uncertainty regarding the corresponding interpolated attribute parameter values too often practitioners end up using only these interpolated values for subsequent analyses maps of interpolated parameter values are typically too smooth and do not reflect short scale attribute variability as discussed in the introductory session geostatistical simulation can be used to quantify and propagate uncertainty regarding the entire spatial distribution of an attribute this is done by simulating a set ensemble of attribute realizations each realistically reflecting the spatial variability and patterns of model parameters these realizations are conditioned to state observations caers 2011 kyriakidis 2017 subsequently these realizations are further elaborated to model uncertainty in associated model predictions this subsection discusses several publications that evaluate the uncertainty in groundwater model predictions through geostatistical simulation or ensemble based methods optimization based methods such as ensemble kalman filter enkf are also considered to evaluate uncertainty in a computationally efficient way along with studies involving the replacement of complex physical models with machine learning techniques closely related to geostatistics such as gaussian process regression gpr 3 4 1 simulations in an attempt to revisit the groundwater model in amchitka island alaska usa hassan et al hassan et al 2009 performed markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulations to condition samples of model parameters generated from prior distributions in contrast to conventional mc approaches they constructed relations between model and likelihood parameters to reduce the computational time conditioning on three datasets including chemistry data hydraulic head data and newly collected magnetotelluric mt data significantly reduces the uncertainty of model inputs resulting in a much narrower range of model outputs compared to the unconditioned simulations in a recent study kreyns et al kreyns et al 2020 investigated the influence of geological heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of salinity in volcanic aquifers multiple realizations of the hydraulic conductivity field were constructed through a monte carlo based technique called sequential indicator simulation sis which were used as input to the seawat numerical model for simulating the spatio temporal distribution of the groundwater flow and salt their results revealed the significant impact of aquifer heterogeneity on the evolution of salinity and submarine groundwater discharge gómez hernandez et al gómez hernández et al 2021 used sis to construct realizations of three dimensional geological model of a highly heterogeneous aquifer located in the south western part of spain the heterogeneity of geological classes was characterized through indicator variograms whereas sis was used for quantifying the spatial uncertainty of the geological features the resulting realizations were then imported in modflow to evaluate the evolution of the piezometric levels compared to homogeneous models the predictions of the proposed approach exhibited major discrepancies at specific regions highlighting the significant influence of the geological model on the spatial variability of the piezometric levels furthermore the authors emphasized the positive impact that an improved geological model can have on improving management policies in terms of marine water intrusion and groundwater exploitation in an attempt to model uncertainty regarding aquifer geology jorreto zaguirre et al jorreto zaguirre et al 2020 modelled the uncertainty of the geology of a coastal aquifer by proposing an extension of the sequential indicator simulation that was done by including uncertainty information about hydrofacies proportions leading to improved uncertainty quantification of the porous media the simulations revealed the strong connection between the variogram model and the connectivity of the hydrofacies which determines the spatial extent of the seawater penetration the authors suggested that this approach can set up optimal flow simulation models in terms of groundwater management in order to evaluate groundwater quality in the birjand plain iran aryafar et al aryafar et al 2020 used geostatistical methods to estimate the spatial distribution of thirteen geochemical parameters variogram models were constructed and validated based on jack knife and cross validation techniques ok was used for estimating the spatial distribution of these variables sequential gaussian simulation sgs was also considered to mitigate the smoothing effects produced by the kriging method achieving a better agreement with the actual dataset the authors suggested that the resulting maps can be used for designing optimal sampling strategies jalali et al jalali et al 2019 combined geostatistical and multivariate methods to characterize the groundwater state in saveh aquifer turkey principal component analysis and factor analysis were used to relate major quality parameters with groundwater processes sgs was used to construct simulated parameter realizations to avoid the smoothing issues of ok leading to the identification of highly contaminated regions and the classification of the aquifer in three risk groups i e low moderate and high through the use of the fractal theory a similar study was conducted by karami et al karami et al 2020 highlighting the advantages of using geostatistical simulations instead of kriging to design optimal strategies for sustainable groundwater management in their study they investigated groundwater quality conditions in tehran karaj plain aquifer iran their results exhibited the ability of sgs to accurately delineate pollution zones thus allowing decision makers to focus on limited areas for further sampling and analysis another way that geostatistical methods can be used for estimating the spatial extent of salinity has been discussed by hermans et al hermans et al 2012 more specific the authors employed electrical resistivity to delineate tds for the purpose of monitoring seawater intrusion they proposed the inclusion of a covariance matrix based on variograms of electric conductivity to solve the electric resistivity tomography ert inverse problem in particular borehole measurements were used to construct a vertical variogram of the electrical conductivity the variogram was used to construct a covariance matrix for regularizing the inversion model kriging and sgs were also employed as model comparison references the generated saltwater plume model compared well with field data leading to a reduction of the spatial uncertainty of the saltwater plume according to three dimensional tds profiles 3 4 2 computationally efficient methods 3 4 2 1 latin hypercube as a sampling strategy monte carlo implementations are computationally expensive due to the large number of simulations required for conducting the uncertainty propagation at an acceptable level of accuracy one way to reduce the computational complexity is by reducing the number of simulations through sampling strategies without deteriorating the accuracy of the predictions rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2014 an example of these strategies is latin hypercube sampling lhs a stratified monte carlo method that generates realizations of random attributes that cover the range of given probability distributions hardyanto and merkel 2007 liodakis et al 2015 liodakis et al 2017 latin hypercube simulation does not require any gaussian assumption it simply generates simulations within quantile demarkated intervals of a given distribution no matter its functional form parametric or non parametric dong and nakayama 2017 only few publications related to groundwater salinization have been found that use lhs to generate samples of model inputs such as pumping rates kopsiaftis et al kopsiaftis et al 2019 hydraulic conductivity and recharge rates karamouz et al karamouz et al 2020 compared to standard monte carlo simulations it was found that lhs can significantly improve sampling efficiently several variants of this sampling algorithm have been proposed meant to improve space filling optimize projective properties minimize least square error and maximize entropy and reduce spurious correlations shields and zhang 2016 to the best of the authors knowledge none of these strategies has been used in groundwater salinization applications within the time frame 2005 2021 of this review 3 4 2 2 ensemble kalman filtering the process of model calibration involves the use of all observations simultaneously whereas sequential approaches repeatedly recalibrate the model using a subset of the data in a given step for transient parameters such as groundwater recharge sequential methods are the methods of choice a particularly popular sequential method in groundwater modeling is ensemble kalman filter enkf chen and zhang 2006 erdal and cirpka 2017 it is essentially a monte carlo approach using an ensemble of model realizations to evaluate necessary statistics unlike kalman filter enkf is suitable for handling nonlinearities and large dimensions and is easy to implement it has the particular advantage that it can be used in conjunction with any model relating model inputs to observations without the necessity to compute the jacobian of that relationship a limitation of this approach is the assumption that all probability distributions involved are gaussian data assimilation methods such as the ensemble kalman filter provide an alternative way for generating conditional realizations of aquifer parameters in a computationally efficient manner an illustrative example is reported by franssen and kinzelbach franssen and kinzelbach 2009 who applied enkf to a synthetic case study even though their predictions were similar to those obtained by modelling techniques like the sequential self calibration method gómez hernández et al 1997 they reduced the computational time by almost two orders of magnitude this efficiency is partly attributed to the explicit computation of the covariance matrix from the model outputs for each realization and the incorporation of observations without storing model outputs from previous time steps this method has gained attention by the hydrogeological community for conditioning hydrogeological parameters to concentration schöniger et al 2012 crestani et al 2013 and groundwater head chen and zhang 2006 zhou et al 2011 until now only a few studies involved real world field experiments whereas the majority of these studies involved synthetic test cases crestani et al 2013 zovi et al 2017 the work conducted by bouzaglou et al bouzaglou et al 2018 was the only one that applied this method to address salinity issues in groundwater systems particularly due to seawater intrusion they integrated enkf with a three dimensional groundwater model called sutra for simulating the salinity evolution in a real experiment electrical resistivity tomography data electrical resistances are assimilated to update soil parameters and salt concentration the results suggested that enkf is a promising data assimilation tool for reducing the uncertainty on model inputs outputs for various groundwater related problems including salinization 3 4 2 3 gaussian process regression gpr as a surrogate model as mentioned in section 2 3 surrogate models can facilitate uncertainty analysis by reducing the number of unknowns and improving numerical robustness it is a common approach to use gpr based surrogate models in engineering optimization applications these models involve empirical approximations of complex model outputs calibrated on a set of inputs and outputs of the complex model a major advantage of this category of models compared to deterministic ones is that it predicts a distribution described by mean and standard deviation rather than just a point estimate the standard deviation of a distribution is referred in literature as epistemic uncertainty i e how certain the model is with respect to its prediction another source of uncertainty can be observed with regard to the lack of complete control over all influential parameters these deviations occurring during repeated process iterations under the same conditions are referred to as aleatoric uncertainty as expected a major limitation of this method is the requirement of the probability distributions to satisfy a gaussian assumption few studies have been identified that applied these models in problems relevant to groundwater salinity werner et al 2013 asher et al 2015 according to rajabi and ketabchi rajabi and ketabchi 2017 gpr based surrogate models are suitable for evaluating in a computationally efficient manner the epistemic and aleatory uncertainty that is present in swi models the proposed emulator was chosen instead of the sutra transport model within a simulation optimization scheme to assess the swi extent of a coastal aquifer in the persian gulf the results demonstrated the ability of this meta model to provide reliable predictions while achieving a significant reduction in computational time kopsiaftis et al kopsiaftis et al 2019 compared the performance of gpr based meta models with three commonly used regression models specifically support vector machine and regression trees to predict the spatial extent of seawater intrusion the proposed model was trained based on a large number of variable density computations whereas lhs was adopted to generate representative pumping rates the hyperparameters of all surrogate models were optimized through a bayesian procedure although gpr needs more computational time than the other models the results showed that it achieved the highest performance according to different quantitative indicators roy and datta roy and datta 2018 aimed at designing optimized policies to prevent saltwater intrusion by investigating the influence of climatic conditions at sea three surrogate models specifically gpr adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and multivariate adaptive regression spline mars were trained based on numerical computations of a density dependent transport model the performance of these models was evaluated at a multi layer coastal aquifer all models managed to capture the trends of the salinization processes whereas anfis based emulator provided the most accurate predictions along with the highest computational efficiency accordingly the best meta model replaced the transport model within the simulation optimization based s o swi management framework showing promising results a similar study has been reported by the same authors roy and datta 2018 who compared the performance of rt ma and gpr based surrogate models in predicting model parameters gpr achieved the highest scores and it was then integrated within an optimization algorithm in terms of swi management the results supported the argument that gpr is suitable for replacing complex physical models within an optimization framework 4 conclusions and further directions from this review article it can be inferred that several geostatistical methods have not yet been considered to address groundwater salinization problems for example very few applications of co kriging exist despite its advantages compared to other kriging variants it worth mentioning that few publications have considered jointly simulating the spatial distribution of multiple attributes parameters by transforming them to log ratios and then to principal components thus avoiding co simulation based on co kriging for which inference of a jointly permissible set of auto and cross variogram models can be challenging madani and carranza 2020 sharifi et al 2019 no recent studies were identified that employ principal component simulation to groundwater salinization problems fuzzy kriging is another method that has not been favoured yet by practitioners this method can handle the epistemic uncertainty of contaminants that is present due to imprecise or and incomplete sample data fuzzy kriging has been used for the construction of optimized groundwater quality monitoring networks dhar and patil 2011 an alternative interpolation method has been developed by bardossy bárdossy 2006 bárdossy and li 2008 who borrowed the idea of copulas to characterize spatial dependence in groundwater quality parameters instead of covariance functions and variograms as expected it has been shown that non gaussian copulas can provide more accurate predictions than traditional kriging methods for several groundwater quality parameters whereas no comparison between copulas and non linear geostatistics such as disjunctive kriging was reported it worth mentioning that no recent articles were found that employ disjunctive kriging to groundwater salinization problems revealing a gap that can be potentially addressed in future studies regarding geostatistical simulations transition probability geostatistics is reported as an efficient method for constructing conditional realizations of the geological patterns that has not yet been applied to address groundwater salinization problems he et al 2014 dell arciprete et al 2011 sivakumar et al 2005 for example lee et al lee et al 2007 reported that indicator simulation based on tp could better capture the lateral connectivity of channel facies than sgs which led to improved predictions of groundwater head responses during pumping optimized extensions of lhs have been shown to generate representative realizations of model parameters with high sampling efficiency allowing the reduction of the computational time of monte carlo simulations these lhs variants have not yet received significant attention in real world gw applications multi dimensional scaling mds is another powerful tool for visualizing the uncertainty of very high dimensional spatial models realizations by computing an appropriate distance between pairs of attribute realizations within an ensemble of such realizations which are then projected into a lower dimensional space mds has not been applied yet in groundwater salinization problems to the best of the authors knowledge based on the above literature review the following conclusions recommendations can be identified in terms of most used methods future directions and main challenges remaining to be addressed according to fig 2 ordinary kriging under a gaussian assumption is by far the most widely used interpolation method for the spatial interpolation of salinity parameters whereas pca and ca multivariate techniques are extensively used to identify potential groundwater salinity sources sis is favoured by practitioners followed by sgs for capturing short scale attribute variability leading to more realistic spatial distribution mapping than kriging whereas ensemble kalman filter enkf is found to be the most popular data assimilation method in terms of future directions further integration of data and models is needed for improving the accuracy of the estimations whereas more realistic spatial prediction methods such as simulation are recommended to avoid smoothing effects of interpolation kriging and for performing uncertainty propagation efficient sampling strategies such as optimized extensions of lhs are expected further to reduce the computational cost generating a large number of stochastic simulations which are then processed by groundwater models for uncertainty analysis propagation purposes further improvements in computational complexity and stability can be achieved using machine learning methods such as gpr based surrogate models generative adversarial network gan is an example of a deep machine learning algorithm that is recently used for modelling reservoir facies dupont et al 2018 laloy et al 2018 this algorithm is widely used for generating images of systems that exhibit similarities to facies models comparisons with conventional geostatistical methods zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2021 show the superior performance of gans in terms of learning and mapping the complex geological structures gans fall under the realm of multiple point geostatistics mariethoz and caers 2014 tahmasebi 2018 which is an active area of research based on the above reducing computational cost is expected to remain a significant challenge for scientists to consider particularly when physically based models are involved along with the integration of machine learning approaches beyond a black box treatment for these challenges to be successfully addressed a close and continuous collaboration between hydrogeologists geochemists geo statisticians computer and data scientists and policy decision makers is required concluding this review demonstrates the direct relevance of geostatistics to groundwater salinization problems both in terms of analysis mapping of geochemical and other relevant variables and in terms of simulation of hydraulic conductivity and other input parameters to physically based models of groundwater quality assessment based on the review studies some recommendations can be made on the future role of geostatistics in this area firstly further application of geostatistics is envisioned towards the characterization and managements of aquifers facing salinization problems due to the stochastic nature of these groundwater systems due to the complexity of the subsurface systems and the high dimensionality of the associated datasets innovative integration of geostatistics and machine learning methods is expected to provide improved understanding and modeling of groundwater salinization processes lastly the application of modern geostatistical simulation algorithms accounting for diverse information sources might improve mapping the spatial and or spatiotemporal distribution of
