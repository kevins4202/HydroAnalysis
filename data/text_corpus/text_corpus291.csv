1455,the vulnerability of semi arid basin aquifers to long term salinization due to the dissolution of groundwater chemical constituents is a major global problem despite this resilient techniques of tracing the sources of groundwater salinization in semi arid basin aquifers are still evolving due to the aquifer complexities this study proves the effectiveness of the use of different ionic ratios multivariate statistical and geochemical modeling approaches to understand groundwater evolution and trace salinization in the semi arid pru basin of ghana the basin is homogeneously composed of argillaceous sediments of the oti pendjari group of the voltaian supergroup a total of 81 samples from hand dug wells and boreholes within the pru formation of the oti pendjari group in the basin were collected for this study quantitative analysis of the data shows that the abundance of major ions follows the order na ca2 mg2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 the groundwater evolved from na hco3 na hco3 cl na ca hco3 to na mg hco3 water types in a decreasing order of abundance calculated meteoric genesis index r2 indicates the dominance of deep meteoric water percolation effects on groundwater chemistry groundwater chemistry is principally controlled by water rock interaction ion exchange reactions weathering carbonate and silicate salinization and anthropogenic activities different ionic ratio plots and spatial distribution maps reveal the prevalence of salinization in the aquifer system especially around the southwestern part of the basin revelle index assessment of the groundwater salinization level indicates that about 19 8 of the groundwater samples with ri values 0 5 is influenced by salinization the groundwater salinization results from saline water intrusion from adjacent aquifers mixing effects ion exchange reactions water rock interaction and anthropogenic activities the geochemical modeling involving thermodynamic calculation of mineral saturation indices in phreeqc indicates that groundwater is largely saturated with respect to majority of the carbonate and silicate mineral phases keywords groundwater chemistry groundwater salinization ionic ratio plots multivariate statistical analyses geochemical modeling semi arid pru basin 1 introduction the demand for groundwater for various purposes starting from the home to the industry keeps increasing owing to the increasing global population the hike in global population has also led to urbanization industrialization increasing commercial agricultural activities and demand for food which make it important to continuously assess the chemical quality of groundwater sunkari et al 2020 although the demand for quality groundwater to support the ever growing global population is on the rise the aforementioned activities which are equally necessary for a sustainable growing population have adverse effects on the quality of groundwater available for domestic agricultural and industrial usage yidana et al 2018 sunkari et al 2019 2020 the safe usage of groundwater for agricultural domestic and industrial purposes depends on the chemistry of the groundwater rufino et al 2019 it is widely known that the chemistry of groundwater is controlled by several geogenic factors including precipitation composition weathering geology and mineralogy of aquifers and geochemical processes occurring in aquifers belkhiri et al 2012 sunkari et al 2018 kaur et al 2019 karunanidhi et al 2020 interaction among all these factors results in various hydrochemical facies or water types these hydrochemical facies are mostly determined from major ion studies and their spatial variability usually gives vital information on aquifer characteristics belkhiri et al 2012 busico et al 2018 among the geogenic factors that control groundwater chemistry weathering of the rocks through which groundwater is transmitted and ion exchange reactions play a critical role the weathering rate of rocks and ion exchange reactions are controlled by groundwater residence time ph and temperature yidana et al 2012 a classic example is the dissolution rate of crystalline rocks and the silicate minerals they contain which involves a very slow process that is enhanced by low ph and high temperatures chegbeleh et al 2020 moreover anthropogenic activities such as mining agriculture unplanned developments and other human activities have been documented as sources of groundwater pollution e g lermi and ertan 2019 sunkari et al 2019 zango et al 2019 abanyie et al 2020 gibrilla et al 2020 through these activities heavy metals and pesticides have the proclivity of seeping into aquifers and thus influencing the chemistry of groundwater ultimately leading to groundwater pollution for instance sunkari and abu 2019 studied the sources of groundwater fluoride in the bongo district of the upper east region of ghana using hydrochemical and multivariate statistical approaches they suggested that in addition to the geogenic origin of the groundwater fluoride anthropogenic sources such as the use of phosphate fertilizers also contributed greatly to the fluoride loading in the groundwater anthropogenic pollution of groundwater mostly occurs in shallow unconfined aquifers than deep confined aquifers this is because the shallow unconfined aquifers typically occur a few meters beneath the subsurface and are therefore liable to pollution by surficial contaminant sources therefore areas that have unprotected recharge zones and unregulated surface activities are likely to be hit hard by groundwater pollution one of the major global threats to groundwater quality in coastal and basinal areas is salinization groundwater salinization comes from different sources including seawater intrusion pratheepa et al 2015 najib et al 2017 egbi et al 2019 ion exchange reactions pratheepa et al 2015 dissolution of secondary minerals ammar et al 2020 saline water flow from adjacent aquifers egbi et al 2019 return flow from irrigation water kass et al 2005 evapotranspiration cartwright and morgenstern 2012 anthropogenic input karunanidhi et al 2020 climate change and land use borrok and engle 2014 or commonly a combination of most of these sources keesari and dauji 2020 groundwater salinization is harmful to cropping soils as it causes accumulation of higher amounts of salt that affects salt intolerable crops this calls for the need to characterize and identify groundwater salinization processes in coastal and basinal areas for sustainable management of groundwater resources as a strategic way of protecting groundwater resources geoscientists now focus more on understanding the geochemical evolution of groundwater using multivariate statistical techniques such as factor analysis and principal component analysis belkhiri et al 2010 2012 yidana et al 2012 2018 loh et al 2019 sunkari and abu 2019 sunkari et al 2019 2020 zango et al 2019 Ã§iner et al 2020 these approaches are able to analyze all the parameters thus the cations and anions in a sample suite by reducing and classifying the data they are able to extract vital information from hydrochemical datasets even in complex hydrogeological systems also spatial distribution maps of hydrochemical parameters have been effectively used in delineating areas under threat of pollution e g gnanachandrasamy et al 2015 zango et al 2019 sunkari et al 2020 furthermore the development of geochemical modeling in geoscience has led to the use of major ions to deduce the physico chemical processes controlling groundwater chemistry belkhiri et al 2010 salifu et al 2012 zango et al 2019 karunanidhi et al 2020 lyons et al 2020 the most common geochemical modelling approach used in hydrogeochemical studies is thermodynamic calculation of the saturation indices of mineral phases in phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 it uses geochemical parameters and computes the saturation indices of minerals that are capable of pervading a solution therefore a combination of all these approaches will help in understanding the geochemical evolution of groundwater and sources of pollution in the study area the semi arid pru basin covers most areas in the bono east region of ghana where farming and fishing are the dominant occupation the region is widely known to be the food basket of the nation and this has resulted in the migration of farmers from the northern and the two upper regions of ghana as the food basket of ghana commercial farming in this region involves the use of weedicides herbicides fertilizers and other farming inputs within the semi arid pru basin this part of ghana is characterized by a very thick regolith profile due to the prevailing climatic conditions in the area which tends to support deeper chemical weathering the predominance of agricultural activities in and around the semi arid pru basin coupled with its thick regolith profile has the tendency of influencing the groundwater chemistry via infiltration from agricultural lands as well as disposables from the growing agrochemical shops and factories within the catchment of the basin not precluding geogenic source effect eventually the quality of the water would be affected which can greatly impact the health and livelihood of the rural dwellers moreover all the rivers in the semi arid pru basin form part of the volta river drainage system serving as tributaries to the volta lake in the wake of these potential threats to the groundwater quality in the area there is little data available on the current nature of groundwater chemistry in the area and hence the quality to allow for monitoring and designing of proper management practices within the catchment of the semi arid pru basin is not well documented in the literature the mechanisms responsible for groundwater chemistry in the semi arid pru basin are still not properly understood therefore the primary objectives of this study are to assess the geochemical composition of groundwater and to determine geogenic and anthropogenic controls of groundwater chemistry in the semi arid pru basin using ionic ratio plots multivariate statistical and geochemical modeling approaches the research will contribute to the understanding of the vulnerability of basinal aquifers to long term salinization in a broad context through the dissolution of groundwater chemical constituents the use of different ionic ratio plots and geochemical modeling to depict groundwater salinization is still not common in the scientific front most studies employ single ionic plots such as na cl versus ionic concentration of cl to show groundwater salinization but such plots in which both axes have a common variable cl can reveal trends that may be totally unrelated to hydrogeochemical processes and thus may be induced resulting in common variable effect on correlation or spurious correlation keesari and dauji 2020 as a result it is better to always use different ionic ratio plots involving na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and b alongside mineral saturation indices to verify groundwater salinization as done in this study in all this study is the first to document evidence of groundwater salinization in the semi arid pru basin the results of this study will guide policy makers and stake holders in designing effective ways of protecting groundwater resources in the area the recommendations made can be extrapolated to similar areas in the world 2 study area 2 1 location climate and drainage features the semi arid pru basin covers the area between longitudes 00 45 to 01 15 w and latitudes 07 45 to 08 15 n fig 1a it lies in the central part of the bono east region of ghana with a small area between prang and abease as part of the northern region of ghana the area lies in the southern part of the so called middle belt of ghana and is located along the main route between ejura and salaga the area is situated in the central domain of ghana and is partially bounded by the volta lake in the east it is characterized by periods of wetness and dryness march july is the major rainy season with june as the wettest month whereas november february is the major dry season august is the shortest or minor dry season time and september october is the shortest rainy season mean rainfall is about 1150 1250 mm lowest about 330 mm and highest about 1500 mm the highest temperatures mean shade maximum approximately 30 c occur just before the rainy season and the lowest mean shade minimum about 24 c occur during the peak wet months junner and hirdes 1946 almost all the rivers in the area form part of the volta river drainage system the most important is the pru river of which the majority of the rivers are its tributaries the pru river flows from the southwest to the northeast where it enters the volta lake 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the semi arid pru basin forms part of the neoproterozoic to paleozoic flat lying sedimentary succession of ghana known as the voltaian supergroup the voltaian supergroup is composed of three main groups from top to bottom as tamale obosum group oti pendjari group and kwahu bombouaka group abu et al 2019 the semi arid pru basin is entirely overlain by the oti pendjari group fig 1a with outcrops mainly in the eastern and northern fringes the pru formation within this group consists mainly of reddish brown interbedded mudstone and sandstone affaton 2008 the basal part of the unit is more sandstone rich becoming richer in mudstone higher up to the north and east of prang carney et al 2008 ferricrete covers most of the area and is absent only along the main rivers small scarps are sometimes formed at where the rivers cut through the ferricrete the ferricrete occurs below a variable thickness of soil overlying the bedrock the ferricrete is up to 1 5 m thick locally thicker it usually contains angular fragments of the underlying mudstone and sandstone these fragments lack any indication of transportation and are from local geological formations in situ ferricretization of the underlying sediments is evident no deep weathering of bedrock below the ferricrete can be observed numerous wells usually about 0 5 m in diameter have been dug through the ferricrete and the underlying mudstone and hollowed out to depths of 3 4 m to store rainwater the semi arid pru basin forms a significant portion of the voltaian hydrogeological province in ghana which is coterminous with the volta lake fig 1b it is characterized by altering argillaceous and arenaceous rocks and the wide spread presence of ferricretes griffis et al 2002 which significantly affect the depth of weathering and restrict recharge therefore aquifers are shallow and fractured with deep weathering being restricted by the ferricrete the lithology and jointing of the bedrock below the ferricrete is expected to affect permeability in general the aquifer is semi confined by the ferricrete and the water level follows the topography borehole depths range between 45 and 75 m and aquifers are generally encountered between the depth range of 20 and 30 m the success rate of drilling boreholes in the pru formation is about 50 and it is among the lowest in the country primary porosities are very low owing to the impervious nature of the rocks but are enhanced by fracturing and weathering therefore the hydrogeological parameters are primarily based on secondary structures in the form of joints developed after the primary porosities had been destroyed in the wake of rock compaction and slight metamorphism this has resulted in a wide range of hydrogeological properties the hydrogeological properties of the study area are not favourable for large scale groundwater development since yields are generally less than 3 5 m3 h dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 however yields as high as 15 m3 h are occasionally encountered the depth of the weathered zone provides potential for increased groundwater storage however the low permeability limits abstraction the depths of aquifers are normally between 20 and 60 m with alluvial deposits defining most of the main river channels sikah et al 2016 they are generally fine grain deposits mainly silty and clayey hence they form poor aquifers groundwater quality issues related to elevated nitrates exist in some communities owing to localized pollution from agricultural activities around open shallow wells 3 methodology 3 1 data collection and analysis a total of 81 samples were collected from 70 hand dug wells and 11 boreholes using 300 ml plastic bottles the samples from the hand dug wells were collected using a klyen downhole stainless steel borehole sampler whereas the samples from the boreholes were collected by direct pumping from the installed pumps of the boreholes at each of the sampling points the 300 ml plastic bottles were rinsed with the water to be collected to reduce or completely eliminate any contaminations that might be introduced and then filled to the brim geo satellite positioning of all the 81 sampling points were determined with a gps device the collected samples were immediately stored in ice chests containing ice cubes to prevent reactions within the water the samples were then taken to the ghana atomic energy commission in accra for geochemical analysis physico chemical parameters such as ph temperature total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were measured directly in the field from the hand dug wells and boreholes using wtw profiline 3320 universal multi parameter portable meter major ions such as potassium k and sodium na were analyzed using flame photometer magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 concentrations were determined using the aa240fs fast sequential atomic absorption spectrometer ics 90 ion chromatograph dionex ics 90 was used in determining carbonate co3 2 bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl fluoride f nitrate no3 and sulfate so4 2 concentrations boron b concentrations were analyzed using fluorescence analyzer the detection limits for all the ions were k 0 1 mg l na 0 01 mg l mg2 0 05 mg l ca2 0 05 mg l co3 2 0 03 mg l hco3 0 03 mg l cl 0 2 mg l f 0 02 mg l no3 0 05 mg l so4 2 0 1 mg l and b 0 005 mg l in order to maintain the accuracy and a degree of confidence in the integrity of the data all the sampling bottles and glassware were soaked in a 5 nitric acid for overnight and rinsed with deionized water before use instruments used were calibrated with standard chemical solutions prepared from commercially available chemicals and validated with standard reference materials srm and certified reference materials crm the srm were analyzed repeatedly at predetermined intervals to confirm that the method remained in a state of statistical control duplicate samples were also measured and compared and their results were found reproducible within 5 error limit again accuracy of the laboratory analysis was checked by calculating the cation anion balance errors and only those results with errors 5 were relied on for subsequent interpretation 3 2 multivariate statistical techniques r mode factor analysis fa and principal component analysis pca were the main statistical techniques employed in this study these techniques are used to reduce the complexity of large scale datasets and show the relationship between data components sunkari et al 2020 by using these techniques factors with eigenvalues 1 were considered as a possible variance in the study the algorithm employed for extraction of the factors was the pca whilst varimax rotation was the rotation criterion the multivariate statistical analyses were done using spss statistics version 25 however ionic ratios bivariate plots were plotted for pairs of related chemical species using aquachem version 4 0 the ratios between major ions were employed to determine the variable dependency and the relationships between a variable pair in the water 3 3 hydrochemical graphing and geochemical modeling in this study aquachem version 4 0 was used in producing piper and gibbs plots to identify the hydrochemical facies and the mechanisms controlling the groundwater chemistry spatial distribution maps of the hydrochemical parameters were produced by means of surfer version 11 using kriging interpolation kriging was the preferred interpolation technique because it addresses surface estimation problems by using semi variograms sunkari and abu 2019 phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 was employed in performing thermodynamic calculation of the saturation indices si of the various mineral phases residing in the groundwater using eq 1 1 si log iap k sp where iap stands for the ion activity of the solution and ksp is the solubility constant at a particular temperature in the current study carbonate and silicate minerals were the most important during the thermodynamic calculation of the saturation indices since the aquifer materials in the study area are dominated by carbonate rocks and silicate minerals si less than zero is an indication that the groundwater is under saturated with respect to the particular mineral and such value is a reflection of the nature of the groundwater in an environment of formation which contains less amount of the mineral in solution it also points to shorter residence times of the groundwater ako et al 2012 si value greater than zero suggests that the groundwater is supersaturated with respect to the given mineral in solution and the water is unable to further dissolve the mineral 3 4 groundwater salinization revelle index was used in assessing the level of groundwater salinization in the study area the revelle index was computed from the equation below 2 revelle index ri cl hco 3 co 3 2 the concentrations of the ions used in the above equation are expressed in meq l according to karunanidhi et al 2020 groundwater with ri values 0 5 is said to be influenced by salinization after identifying the level of groundwater salinization using the ri approach ionic ratio plots were produced to identify the sources of the salinization 4 results 4 1 geochemical characterization the physico chemical parameters of the samples were evaluated with reference to guidelines for drinking water provided by the world health organization world health organization w h o 2017 they are presented in table 1 and summarized in table 2 the ph levels of majority of the samples are within the who acceptable limits 6 5 8 5 and closely vary between 7 77 and 8 63 with an average value of 8 29 however 8 samples 2 boreholes and 6 hand dug wells have higher ph values when compared to the acceptable limits the high ph values in these boreholes and hand dug wells is attributed to the dominance of limestone in the communities where they are located fig 1a this is because limestone contains carbonate bicarbonate and hydroxide compounds that are capable of dissolving and mixing with the water raising the ph level of the water the samples have widely varied electrical conductivity ec values in the range of 306 7914 Î¼s cm with an average value of 797 Î¼s cm which suggests noncompliance with the world health organization w h o 2017 guideline value of 2500 Î¼s cm the measured isolated cases of very high ec values of 7914 Î¼s cm and 2604 Î¼s cm in hand dug well samples pj009 adeemra community and pj020 burkina bumbo community respectively table 1 are due to longer residence time of the groundwater in the aquifer works conducted in some parts of the volta basin of ghana which serves as the main reservoir for the semi arid pru basin reported very high ec values in groundwater for instance egbi et al 2019 and tay 2012 reported 141 19 370 Î¼s cm and 147 23 200 Î¼s cm at the lower and middle parts of the volta basin respectively though these areas are not specifically in the current study area the high ec values indicate that some form of mixing of freshwater and saline water may have occurred as suggested by egbi et al 2019 total dissolved solids tds concentrations vary between 275 and 7123 mg l with an average value of 717 mg l exceeding the world health organization w h o 2017 guideline value of 500 mg l the tds values in the study area can be compared with those 70 9680 mg l mean of 1237 mg l reported from the lower volta river basin egbi et al 2019 and those 62 11 900 mg l reported from the middle volta river basin tay 2012 more so the geology of the middle volta river basin in the study of tay 2012 overlaps with the geology of the semi arid pru basin as they are both dominated by rocks belonging to the oti pendjari group in this regard the high tds values imply high amount of charged species and longer water rock interaction within the aquifer system sunkari et al 2019 the abundance of feldspars and quartzitic sandstones in the oti pendjari group in the study area fig 1a may also account for the high tds values moreover anthropogenic activities largely as run offs and infiltration from farm lands in the semi arid pru basin cannot be precluded from influencing the tds concentrations in the groundwater as there is a very strong positive correlation r 0 99 between tds and chloride cl table 3 among the major ions only sodium na concentrations exceeded the maximum permissible limit 200 mg l of the who the na concentrations varied from 25 2 to 2115 mg l with an average value of 226 mg l a total of 26 samples 4 boreholes and 22 hand dug wells representing about 32 1 of the total samples have na concentrations exceeding the guideline value the high na concentrations are likely due to ion exchange reactions in the aquifer yidana et al 2018 there is a very strong to moderate correlation between na and ca2 r 0 89 na and cl r 0 97 ca2 and cl r 0 94 k and cl r 0 54 and na and k r 0 52 table 3 all these open a window of interpretation for a common geochemical source of the ions likely salinization via ion exchange reactions gopinath et al 2014 the concentrations of k ca2 and mg2 in the studied samples fall within the guideline values except one sample pj009 adeemra community which has ca2 concentration of 505 mg l exceeding the maximum permissible value of 200 mg l table 1 cl has the highest concentration among the anions ranging from 1 36 to 4671 mg l and an average concentration of 240 mg l a total of 11 hand dug wells have very high cl concentrations when compared with the who 2017 maximum permissible limit of 250 mg l ion exchange reactions in the aquifer system may be responsible for the high cl concentrations consistent with the high tds and ec values bicarbonate hco3 is the most dominant anion with concentrations in the range of 121 641 mg l and an average value of 430 mg l the hco3 concentrations may be controlled by reaction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and soil that produces carbonic acid in the soil loh et al 2019 which chemically disintegrates feldspars in the sandstones of the oti pendjari group during infiltration the fluoride f concentrations are in the range of 0 23 and 3 40 mg l with an average of 0 70 mg l hand dug wells in parambo no 1 burkina bumbo and wurukasa communities have slightly elevated f concentrations of 2 70 mg l 2 23 mg l and 3 40 mg l respectively the high f in these areas is due to ion exchange reactions in the aquifer considering the major ion abundance table 1 nitrate no3 concentrations are generally within the who guideline value of 50 mg l for all the samples except one sample from a hand dug well in yeji township which has concentration up to 70 6 mg l the high no3 concentration in this hand dug well is due to anthropogenic activities like agrochemical applications on farms around the yeji township boron b concentrations varied from 0 05 to 3 37 mg l with an average concentration of 0 50 mg l this implies that groundwater in the semi arid pru basin exceeds the maximum permissible limit 0 5 mg l of b in drinking water provided by the world health organization w h o 2017 twenty two samples comprising of 4 boreholes and 18 hand dug wells have high b concentrations when compared with the threshold value of 0 5 mg l the b enrichment may be due to the dominance of ion exchange reactions in the aquifer the remaining anions such as co3 2 and so4 2 are within the permissible limits the orders of concentration of the major cations and anions are na ca2 mg2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 respectively fig 2 4 2 hydrochemical facies identifying the hydrochemical facies in an aquifer can help reveal mechanisms of both occurrence and salinization and possibly unravel the paleoenvironmental history of the groundwater system piper 1953 diagram indicates that the groundwater types in the semi arid pru basin spread within na hco3 na hco3 cl na ca hco3 and na mg hco3 types in a decreasing order of abundance fig 3 the na hco3 type reflects input from ion exchange reactions in the aquifer song et al 2007 and chemical weathering of silicate minerals the na hco3 cl groundwater type is dominant in areas towards the volta lake which are under threat of anthropogenic activities such as farming involving the use of agrochemicals the na ca hco3 and na mg hco3 water types indicate aquifer recharge water gopinath et al 2014 since groundwater from recharge areas experiences lower rates of water sediment interaction stuyfzand 1999 this accounted for the paucity of the na ca hco3 and na mg hco3 water types as compared to the other water types which are mainly related to discharge areas matthes 1982 characterized the hydrochemical facies of groundwater using indices rather than the usual piper ternary diagram he proposed the base exchange index r1 using na cl and so4 2 parameters eq 3 with their concentrations in meq l and the meteoric genesis index r2 using k na cl and so4 2 parameters eq 4 with concentrations in meq l with r1 1 the water facies is said to be that of na so4 2 whiles r1 1 implies that the water is of na hco3 type also r2 1 means that there was a deeper percolation of meteoric water and hence longer residence time and r2 1 indicates that meteoric water percolation was up to shallow levels matthes 1982 3 base exchange index r1 na cl so 4 2 4 meteoric genesis index r2 k na cl so 4 2 the calculated r1 indices for the studied samples show that 8 samples representing approximately 10 of the collected samples fall in the na so4 2 type field and the remaining 73 samples representing approximately 90 of the collected samples are na hco3 water types fig 4a by the indices calculated table 4 the water facies in the area show a dominant na hco3 water type and minor amount of na so4 2 water type fig 4a the r2 calculations on the other hand show that majority of the samples have r2 values 1 implying that they had longer residence time via deeper percolation fig 4b the higher percentage of the samples with r2 1 accounts for the high tds na cl and hco3 concentrations observed in the samples since there will be enough time for ion exchange reactions in the aquifer for the ion enrichment 4 3 spatial distribution of hydrochemical parameters spatial distribution maps of the various hydrochemical parameters are presented in fig 5 from the maps it is observed that higher ph values are found in samples collected from the northwestern and central parts of the study area fig 5a the high tds and na concentrations given in table 1 are mainly around the southwestern fringe of the study area in peprabon community and its surroundings fig 5b and c the k distribution map also shows high values in the northern and southern parts of the semi arid pru basin fig 5d high ca2 content is only observed in the southwestern peripheral fig 5e just like the tds and na concentrations the mg2 distribution map indicates that high concentrations are only restricted to the northwestern domain of the semi arid pru basin fig 5f which is dominated by limestones and dolomites of the oti pendjari group of the voltaian supergroup the cl distribution map shows high cl content mainly in the southwestern part of the semi arid pru basin consistent with the high tds content observed in the same area fig 5g this may suggest that there is interplay of processes like salinization and anthropogenic activities in the southwestern part of the basin the northwestern part of the basin also shows high so4 2 content fig 5h and could be interpreted as a result of weathering of gypsum from the carbonate lithologies of the oti pendjari group among all the hydrochemical parameters only hco3 shows high content in almost all the parts of the semi arid pru basin fig 5i this might be as result of the homogeneous dominance of carbonate rocks in the basin the no3 distribution map reveals that high no3 in the semi arid pru basin is only common in the northeastern part of the basin towards yeji community where farming activities are dominant fig 5j nevertheless slightly high no3 content is observed in the southwestern part especially towards peprabon community fig 5j f concentrations appear to be high in the northwestern and eastern fringes of the study area particularly in parambo no 1 burkina bumbo and wurukasa fig 5k this suggests that the inhabitants in these communities are prone to the threat of dental fluorosis should they keep drinking water from those hand dug wells the high b content of groundwater in the semi arid pru basin is mainly in the northern eastern southern and northwestern parts fig 5l 4 4 multivariate statistics and geochemical modeling the r mode fa resulted in four factors with eigenvalues 1 table 4 these factors explained 76 0 of the total variance of all the hydrochemical parameters analyzed in this study factor 1 which explains about 37 6 of the total variance table 4 is contributed by ec tds na k ca2 mg2 and cl fig 6 factor 2 explains 15 5 of the sample variance table 4 and loads positively on ph hco3 and co3 fig 6 factor 3 accounts for 14 6 of the variance table 5 and mainly associated with so4 2 f and b fig 6 factor 4 explains about 8 32 of the total variance of the dataset table 4 and is strongly associated with temperature and no3 fig 6 statistical summary of the calculated saturation indices si of the identified mineral phases in the groundwater are presented in table 5 all the studied samples are saturated with respect to calcite 0 08 1 36 average of 0 90 and dolomite 0 07 2 97 average of 1 79 the samples are under saturated with respect to gypsum 5 79 to 1 71 and anhydrite 6 03 to 1 92 table 5 some of the studied samples also appear to be saturated with respect to aragonite 0 06 to 1 22 average of 0 76 and talc 4 54 5 54 average of 1 99 table 5 however all the samples are under saturated with respect to halite 9 01 to 3 75 and fluorite 2 68 to 0 27 table 5 the calculated si values of minerals by phreeqc also show that some samples are saturated with respect to silicate minerals such as albite 5 60 0 27 average of 2 73 chalcedony 1 24 0 28 average of 0 47 and quartz 0 82 0 75 average of 0 04 table 5 5 discussion 5 1 processes controlling groundwater chemistry 5 1 1 ion exchange reactions schoeller 1965 used chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and cai 2 to indicate forward ion exchange and reverse ion exchange reactions and these indices have been extensively used in evaluating how ion exchange governs the occurrence of groundwater ako et al 2012 emenike et al 2020 positive cai 1 eq 5 and cai 2 eq 6 is indicative of reverse ion exchange reaction where na and k replace ca2 and mg2 ions whereas it becomes forward ion exchange reaction when cai 1 and cai 2 values are negative with ca2 and mg2 replacing na and k in the process the 81 groundwater samples of the semi arid pru basin show that about 68 of the samples are with negative cai 1 and cai 2 values indicating a dominant forward ion exchange reaction with ca2 and mg2 replacing na and k in the process due to the presence of dolomitic rocks in the area this process is further observed in fig 7a which involves cai 1 values indicating both forward and reverse ion exchange processes with dominant forward ion exchange however reverse ion exchange reaction is observed as the dominant process in the cai 2 diagram fig 7b it can thus be concluded that on a basin scale both forward and reverse ion exchange reactions control groundwater chemistry in the semi arid pru basin this is supported by the average cai 1 and cai 2 values table 4 5 cai 1 cl na k cl 6 cai 2 cl na k so 4 2 hco 3 co 3 2 no 3 moreover a plot of ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 reveals the dominance of ion exchange reactions mainly forward ion exchange in the aquifer since most of the samples shift to the right due to an excess of hco3 so4 2 fig 8a if reverse ion exchange was the dominant process the samples would have shifted to the left due to an excess of ca2 mg2 over hco3 so4 2 mclean and jankowski 2000 via the reaction below eq 7 nevertheless three hand dug well samples plot in the reverse ion exchange field fig 7a 7 2na ca mg clay na clay ca 2 mg 2 fig 8b confirms that reverse ion exchange is also a common process in the aquifer system of the semi arid pru basin this plot involves mg2 versus ca2 mg2 where all the samples shift to the left except two that shifted to the right indicating that reverse ion exchange predominates the system than forward ion exchange further confirmation of this is observed in the plot of ca2 versus ca2 so4 2 where all the samples plot in the reverse ion exchange field save for two samples that plot in the forward ion exchange field fig 8c but the plot of na versus cl equilibrates the two processes in the aquifer system fig 8d implying that both forward ion exchange and reverse ion exchange reactions are the dominant processes influencing groundwater chemistry in the semi arid pru basin 5 1 2 water rock interaction the samples in this study were plotted on the gibbs 1970 diagrams to identify the principal geochemical controls of the groundwater chemistry on the cationic diagram which involves tds versus na na ca majority of the samples plot in the rock weathering dominance field whereas a few samples plot in the evaporation crystallization dominance field fig 9a this suggests that chemical weathering of rocks and dissolution of minerals as well as evaporation are the principal controls of the groundwater chemistry similar trend is observed in the anionic diagram fig 9b that involves tds versus cl cl hco3 nevertheless the increase in tds against na na ca and cl cl hco3 in both diagrams implies that other processes such as ion exchange reactions are also controls of the groundwater chemistry li et al 2016 aside using the traditional bivariate plot of gibbs to infer the relation between the host rock and the groundwater a number of ratios have been used to elucidate the effect of water rock interaction as a mineralization process of groundwater cl Ê anions na cl na na ca2 and mg2 ca2 mg2 have been used to deduce the effect of silicate weathering naseem et al 2010 kumar et al 2018 the 1 value of cl Ê anions is indicative of silicate mineral weathering kumar et al 2018 in the basin table 6 this is supported by the 1 values of na na ca2 and mg2 ca2 mg2 table 6 in addition moghaddam and fijani 2008 indicated that the mg2 ca2 mg2 also differentiates between the contribution of the different rock types in area hence the average value of mg2 ca2 mg2 table 6 is 1 supporting the input of ferromagnesian minerals from the adjacent mafic rocks of the paleoproterozoic birimian supergroup in the area the effect of silicate mineral weathering and for that matter water rock interaction is again emphasized by the high average na cl value 1 in the area table 6 the positive correlation between ca2 and na and k table 3 suggests that cation exchange reaction within crystalline aquifers is a dominant process where water rocks reaction played a significant role in the chemistry of the groundwater within the semi arid pru basin the semi arid pru basin which is largely within the oti pendjari group of the voltaian supergroup fig 1b overlies feldspathic and quartzitic sandstones which also unconformably overly the basement birimian rocks these feldspathic sandstones as well as the birimian rocks contain silicate minerals as their constituent minerals and thus one cannot preclude possible water rock interaction as a contributory factor to groundwater chemistry in the area this proposition is supported by the high ec level which indicates high water residence time in the aquifer that possibly allowed enough time for the rock minerals to react with the groundwater the fact that silicate weathering plays a critical role in the groundwater chemistry is supported by the bivariate plot involving ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 fig 8a in this plot samples below the 1 1 equiline are attributed to silicate weathering whilst those above the 1 1 equiline might have resulted from carbonate mineral weathering of calcite gypsum or dolomite chegbeleh et al 2020 such process involves reaction of atmospheric carbonic acid with the water to dissolve the carbonate minerals which preferentially releases ca2 and mg2 in the water this chemical process is further highlighted in fig 8b for the weathering of dolomite and fig 8c for the weathering of gypsum the samples that plot near or along the 1 2 line may be as a result of dolomite and gypsum weathering on the plot of na versus cl fig 8d three processes can be observed the first two are reverse and forward ion exchange reactions for the samples with higher na as explained earlier whereas the third is saline water intrusion for the samples with higher cl majority of the samples plot close to the 2 1 line which may indicate the effect of halite dissolution on groundwater chemistry however halite is less common in the study area and thus anthropogenic activities might be enriching cl in the groundwater using the na normalized ca versus hco3 plot fig 8e of gaillardet et al 1999 all the samples range from being influenced by silicate weathering evaporate dissolution and carbonate dissolution in a decreasing order of magnitude also on a na normalized ca versus mg plot fig 8f it is observed that although majority of the mg content of the groundwater may have been derived from carbonate dolomite dissolution a significant fraction may have come from silicate and evaporate dissolution 5 1 3 salinization the computed revelle index ri values ranged from 0 01 to 66 2 table 1 the ri assessment of the level of groundwater salinization in the semi arid pru basin indicates that about 19 8 of the groundwater samples with ri values 0 5 is influenced by salinization therefore in order to identify the potential sources of groundwater salinization in the semi arid pru basin ionic plots were produced ions such as na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and b have proven to be conservative tracers of groundwater salinization in any hydrogeological system gopinath et al 2014 the effect of saline water intrusion and anthropogenic activities on groundwater chemistry is demonstrated in fig 10a on this plot the samples showing na cl ratios 0 86 suggest that the groundwater is intruded by saline water whereas the samples with na cl ratios 1 are likely to have been contaminated by anthropogenic sources naily 2018 sunkari et al 2019 about 12 4 of the groundwater resources mainly hand dug wells in the semi arid pru basin are affected by saline water intrusion when compared with saline water from the volta river egbi et al 2019 which serves as the major reservoir for the semi arid pru basin implying that saline water from adjacent aquifers may be contributing to groundwater salinization moreover majority of the samples 87 7 plot in the zone of anthropogenic pollution fig 10a implying that the groundwater salinization is largely influenced by anthropogenic sources like run offs and infiltration from irrigable farm lands comparable to the study of karunanidhi et al 2020 from the spatial maps the high cl and tds contents are restricted to the southwestern part of the basin fig 5b and g where there is no paucity of anthropogenic activities most of the rivers making up the volta river drainage system are found in the southwestern part of the basin and the rural dwellers depend on them for irrigation farming as well as small scale fishing it is possible that leaching from the chemicals the farmers use in these activities may be the culprit for the groundwater salinization in the southwestern part of the basin abdalla 2016 proposed the use of ca hco3 so4 versus na cl diagram to demarcate water that is influenced by saline water and base ion exchange as drivers of groundwater salinization therefore on the ca hco3 so4 versus na cl diagram 10 samples representing 12 4 of the studied samples plot in the cl excess zone which is the region of higher salinity 70 samples representing 86 4 of the total samples plot in the base ion exchange zone whereas only 1 sample representing 1 23 of the total samples plot in the ca excess zone fig 10b certainly this trend suggests that in addition to anthropogenic activities as discussed earlier ion exchange reactions and saline water intrusion from adjacent aquifers are the principal controls of groundwater salinization in the semi arid pru basin furthermore the major ion and chloride relationships still throw more light on the sources of groundwater salinization the ca2 versus cl plot fig 10c indicates that 69 of the samples with higher ca2 ratios were influenced by mixing of fresh groundwater with saline water gopinath et al 2014 the mg2 versus cl plot fig 10d delineates samples influenced by both saline water intrusion those below the conservative mixing and weathering of calcium magnesium minerals in the oti pendjari group those above the conservative mixing line gopinath et al 2018 the relationship between k and cl fig 10e reveals that samples with high cl ratios might be influenced by ion exchange processes gopinath et al 2018 however the low k concentration in groundwater may be related with the proclivity of k to be adsorbed by clay minerals to form secondary minerals and agricultural activities in the basin gopinath et al 2018 the b versus cl ratios slightly increased and shifted towards the excess cl field due to possible mixing with saline water from adjacent aquifers fig 10f the so4 2 versus cl ratio plot fig 10g indicates that depletion in so4 2 is primarily as a result of saline water intrusion gopinath et al 2014 the so4 2 depletion could also be due to gypsum precipitation in the saline water during the initial stages of intrusion majority of the samples show higher values of the so4 2 cl and b concentration fig 10h pointing to evaporate dissolution within the aquifer trabelsi et al 2007 the relationship between tds and cl fig 10i indicates an exceptional linear mixing trend with a very strong correlation coefficient r 0 99 this suggests that the enrichment of cl in groundwater may be due to saline water mixing processes and the samples with higher tds might be an indication of water rock interaction and anthropogenic input ebrahimi et al 2016 in all it can be inferred from the ionic ratio plots that the source of groundwater salinization in the semi arid pru basin is an interplay of factors comprising saline water intrusion mixing effects ion exchange reactions water rock interaction and anthropogenic activities similar processes are ascribed as the source of groundwater salinization in basins and coastal aquifers with similar climatic conditions in ghana kortatsi 2007 egbi et al 2019 iran ebrahimi et al 2016 and india pratheepa et al 2015 karunanidhi et al 2020 5 1 4 anthropogenic activities the nitrate levels as well as tds concentration levels are indication of anthropogenic activities in a given area sunkari et al 2019 the nitrate contribution to the chemical content in the groundwater only affects a sample collected from the yeji township 2 where the concentration 70 6 mg l exceeds the maximum permissible value of 50 mg l by the who table 1 however when all the no3 concentrations are compared with the guideline value 10 mg l of the bureau of indian standards bureau of indian standards bis 2012 the no3 concentrations of hand dug wells from nyomoase 33 7 mg l adeemra 43 8 mg l kumfia 1 33 1 yeji catholic hospital 1 33 8 mg l yeji catholic hospital 2 33 2 mg l and yeji township 1 32 6 mg l appear to exceed the threshold therefore approximately 9 of the groundwater resources in the semi arid pru basin are contaminated with nitrates the affected communities are mostly around the eastern and southwestern parts of the semi arid pru basin where anthropogenic activities such as farming are common the source of nitrate in groundwater has been traced to the application of nitrate fertilizers berhe et al 2017 gibrilla et al 2020 the reasonable positive correlation of no3 with the other ions table 3 supports anthropogenic pollution through the continuous application of nitrate fertilizers in farms within the basin the tds values are generally higher than the 500 mg l acceptable level and anthropogenic activities have proven to be the main source of tds in groundwater berhe et al 2017 lermi and ertan 2019 on bivariate plots of selected major ions versus tds it is observed that about 50 of the groundwater samples are contaminated with respect to higher tds values with increasing ion concentration fig 11a d the increasing trends of na mg2 cl and no3 with increasing tds support anthropogenic contribution from agricultural activities untreated sewage effluents and household waste leachates fig 11a d 5 2 constraints from multivariate statistical and geochemical modeling approaches in general it is difficult to understand geochemical processes due to their complex nature applying multivariate statistical techniques to hydrochemical data can show their interrelationships and thus help decipher their sources yidana et al 2012 in this regard the results of the r mode fa give a hint to the sources of the ions in groundwater the concentrations of ec tds na k ca2 mg2 and cl in saline water exceed that of continental freshwater trabelsi et al 2007 therefore the association of these parameters with factor 1 fig 6 could be linked to saline water intrusion into the aquifer from adjacent aquifers which is one of the primary factors controlling the chemistry of groundwater also factor 1 can be associated with water rock interaction which dissolved most of the rock constituents and then released these ions into groundwater yidana et al 2012 hco3 and co3 2 in factor 2 fig 6 are derived from the dissolution of co2 in the water and gives a hint on the source of recharge in the basin trabelsi et al 2007 the inclusion of ph in factor 2 fig 6 highlights the significant role it plays in geochemistry of carbonates and clays in the semi arid pru basin it is therefore associated with carbonate and clay mineral dissolution in the aquifer strong positive loading of so4 2 f and b in factor 3 fig 6 is as a result of ion exchange reactions in the aquifer however contribution from anthropogenic activities like application of agrochemicals such as sulphate fertilizers especially in the southwestern part of the study area may have resulted in this factor loading therefore this factor staggers the boundary between geogenic and anthropogenic sources of the ions moreover temperature and no3 associated with factor 4 fig 6 may be confirming the contribution from anthropogenic sources since the surface of the aquifer is used for agricultural activities the no3 may be derived from surface runoff of nitrate fertilizers the saturation of groundwater with respect to calcite and dolomite confirms the dissolution of these minerals from the kodjari formation of the oti pendjari group as explained in the earlier section on a bivariate plot of si dolomite versus si calcite fig 12a all the studied samples plot in the field of saturation with respect to both minerals therefore the high concentration of ca2 mg2 and hco3 may be as a result of calcite and dolomite dissolution since carbonate weathering is dominant in the study area the under saturation of the samples with respect to gypsum fig 12b and anhydrite suggests that the less concentration of so4 2 in the groundwater is due to less dissolution of gypsum the saturation of some of the samples with respect to calcite and aragonite fig 12c indicates possible dissolution of these minerals in groundwater on fig 12d about 85 of the samples plot in the talc saturation zone talc occurs as a hydrated magnesium silicate that may be formed from reaction of dolomite and silica or metamorphism of magnesium bearing minerals in the presence of water and carbon dioxide singh et al 2015 this is consistent with the prevalence of dolomites in the oti pendjari group consequently saturation of groundwater with respect to talc implies that either processes may be responsible on the bivariate plot of si halite versus cl fig 12e all the samples plot in the halite under saturation zone implying that halite dissolution can be precluded from influencing the groundwater chemistry however the high cl concentration of groundwater can be explained by saline water intrusion and other processes like ion exchange reactions and anthropogenic activities fluorite also shows under saturation in the groundwater fig 12f but the strong positive correlation of fluorite and f may suggest that the f enrichment in groundwater of some of the communities reflects the role of ca2 through ion exchange reaction zango et al 2019 saturation of some samples with respect to the silicate mineral phases such as albite chalcedony and quartz table 5 explains the role of silicate weathering in groundwater chemistry 6 conclusions aquifers in semi arid environments are known to have several hydrogeological complexities and environmental problems one of them is groundwater salinization and an increase in the concentrations of ions that are detrimental to human health also the use of different ionic ratio plots multivariate statistical and geochemical modeling techniques to depict groundwater salinization is still not common in the scientific front therefore this study contributes to the understanding of the vulnerability of semi arid basin aquifers to long term salinization in a broad context through the dissolution of groundwater chemical constituents in this regard the study has made available new data from the semi arid pru basin in ghana regarding the geochemical evolution of groundwater from 81 hand dug wells and boreholes within the siliciclastic pru formation of the oti pendjari group in the basin it is the first to document evidence of groundwater salinization in the semi arid pru basin using an integrated approach involving different ionic ratio plots multivariate statistical analyses and geochemical modeling the findings of the study revealed that the abundance of major ions follows the order na ca2 mg2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 groundwater in the semi arid pru basin evolved from a less saline na hco3 na ca hco3 and na mg hco3 water type to a more saline na hco3 cl water type the main controls of groundwater chemistry are water rock interaction ion exchange reactions silicate and carbonate weathering salinization and anthropogenic activities like application of agrochemicals to farms and shallow meteoric water infiltration from agricultural lands the ionic ratio plots involving na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and b and multivariate statistical analyses indicate that groundwater salinization is as a result of geogenic processes and anthropogenic activities revelle index indicated that the groundwater salinization affected about 19 8 of the studied samples the southwestern part of the basin is the most affected mineral saturation indices calculated using phreeqc demonstrate that groundwater is generally saturated with respect to carbonate minerals calcite aragonite talc and silicate minerals albite chalcedony quartz but under saturated with respect to anhydrite fluorite gypsum and halite it is recommended that to mitigate the threat of groundwater salinization the basin water level should be kept high artificial subsurface barriers should be developed rainwater harvesting technology should be used artificial recharge structures should be adopted and aquifer improvement plans should be implemented future researches in the area should focus on using isotopes to completely

1455,the vulnerability of semi arid basin aquifers to long term salinization due to the dissolution of groundwater chemical constituents is a major global problem despite this resilient techniques of tracing the sources of groundwater salinization in semi arid basin aquifers are still evolving due to the aquifer complexities this study proves the effectiveness of the use of different ionic ratios multivariate statistical and geochemical modeling approaches to understand groundwater evolution and trace salinization in the semi arid pru basin of ghana the basin is homogeneously composed of argillaceous sediments of the oti pendjari group of the voltaian supergroup a total of 81 samples from hand dug wells and boreholes within the pru formation of the oti pendjari group in the basin were collected for this study quantitative analysis of the data shows that the abundance of major ions follows the order na ca2 mg2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 the groundwater evolved from na hco3 na hco3 cl na ca hco3 to na mg hco3 water types in a decreasing order of abundance calculated meteoric genesis index r2 indicates the dominance of deep meteoric water percolation effects on groundwater chemistry groundwater chemistry is principally controlled by water rock interaction ion exchange reactions weathering carbonate and silicate salinization and anthropogenic activities different ionic ratio plots and spatial distribution maps reveal the prevalence of salinization in the aquifer system especially around the southwestern part of the basin revelle index assessment of the groundwater salinization level indicates that about 19 8 of the groundwater samples with ri values 0 5 is influenced by salinization the groundwater salinization results from saline water intrusion from adjacent aquifers mixing effects ion exchange reactions water rock interaction and anthropogenic activities the geochemical modeling involving thermodynamic calculation of mineral saturation indices in phreeqc indicates that groundwater is largely saturated with respect to majority of the carbonate and silicate mineral phases keywords groundwater chemistry groundwater salinization ionic ratio plots multivariate statistical analyses geochemical modeling semi arid pru basin 1 introduction the demand for groundwater for various purposes starting from the home to the industry keeps increasing owing to the increasing global population the hike in global population has also led to urbanization industrialization increasing commercial agricultural activities and demand for food which make it important to continuously assess the chemical quality of groundwater sunkari et al 2020 although the demand for quality groundwater to support the ever growing global population is on the rise the aforementioned activities which are equally necessary for a sustainable growing population have adverse effects on the quality of groundwater available for domestic agricultural and industrial usage yidana et al 2018 sunkari et al 2019 2020 the safe usage of groundwater for agricultural domestic and industrial purposes depends on the chemistry of the groundwater rufino et al 2019 it is widely known that the chemistry of groundwater is controlled by several geogenic factors including precipitation composition weathering geology and mineralogy of aquifers and geochemical processes occurring in aquifers belkhiri et al 2012 sunkari et al 2018 kaur et al 2019 karunanidhi et al 2020 interaction among all these factors results in various hydrochemical facies or water types these hydrochemical facies are mostly determined from major ion studies and their spatial variability usually gives vital information on aquifer characteristics belkhiri et al 2012 busico et al 2018 among the geogenic factors that control groundwater chemistry weathering of the rocks through which groundwater is transmitted and ion exchange reactions play a critical role the weathering rate of rocks and ion exchange reactions are controlled by groundwater residence time ph and temperature yidana et al 2012 a classic example is the dissolution rate of crystalline rocks and the silicate minerals they contain which involves a very slow process that is enhanced by low ph and high temperatures chegbeleh et al 2020 moreover anthropogenic activities such as mining agriculture unplanned developments and other human activities have been documented as sources of groundwater pollution e g lermi and ertan 2019 sunkari et al 2019 zango et al 2019 abanyie et al 2020 gibrilla et al 2020 through these activities heavy metals and pesticides have the proclivity of seeping into aquifers and thus influencing the chemistry of groundwater ultimately leading to groundwater pollution for instance sunkari and abu 2019 studied the sources of groundwater fluoride in the bongo district of the upper east region of ghana using hydrochemical and multivariate statistical approaches they suggested that in addition to the geogenic origin of the groundwater fluoride anthropogenic sources such as the use of phosphate fertilizers also contributed greatly to the fluoride loading in the groundwater anthropogenic pollution of groundwater mostly occurs in shallow unconfined aquifers than deep confined aquifers this is because the shallow unconfined aquifers typically occur a few meters beneath the subsurface and are therefore liable to pollution by surficial contaminant sources therefore areas that have unprotected recharge zones and unregulated surface activities are likely to be hit hard by groundwater pollution one of the major global threats to groundwater quality in coastal and basinal areas is salinization groundwater salinization comes from different sources including seawater intrusion pratheepa et al 2015 najib et al 2017 egbi et al 2019 ion exchange reactions pratheepa et al 2015 dissolution of secondary minerals ammar et al 2020 saline water flow from adjacent aquifers egbi et al 2019 return flow from irrigation water kass et al 2005 evapotranspiration cartwright and morgenstern 2012 anthropogenic input karunanidhi et al 2020 climate change and land use borrok and engle 2014 or commonly a combination of most of these sources keesari and dauji 2020 groundwater salinization is harmful to cropping soils as it causes accumulation of higher amounts of salt that affects salt intolerable crops this calls for the need to characterize and identify groundwater salinization processes in coastal and basinal areas for sustainable management of groundwater resources as a strategic way of protecting groundwater resources geoscientists now focus more on understanding the geochemical evolution of groundwater using multivariate statistical techniques such as factor analysis and principal component analysis belkhiri et al 2010 2012 yidana et al 2012 2018 loh et al 2019 sunkari and abu 2019 sunkari et al 2019 2020 zango et al 2019 Ã§iner et al 2020 these approaches are able to analyze all the parameters thus the cations and anions in a sample suite by reducing and classifying the data they are able to extract vital information from hydrochemical datasets even in complex hydrogeological systems also spatial distribution maps of hydrochemical parameters have been effectively used in delineating areas under threat of pollution e g gnanachandrasamy et al 2015 zango et al 2019 sunkari et al 2020 furthermore the development of geochemical modeling in geoscience has led to the use of major ions to deduce the physico chemical processes controlling groundwater chemistry belkhiri et al 2010 salifu et al 2012 zango et al 2019 karunanidhi et al 2020 lyons et al 2020 the most common geochemical modelling approach used in hydrogeochemical studies is thermodynamic calculation of the saturation indices of mineral phases in phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 it uses geochemical parameters and computes the saturation indices of minerals that are capable of pervading a solution therefore a combination of all these approaches will help in understanding the geochemical evolution of groundwater and sources of pollution in the study area the semi arid pru basin covers most areas in the bono east region of ghana where farming and fishing are the dominant occupation the region is widely known to be the food basket of the nation and this has resulted in the migration of farmers from the northern and the two upper regions of ghana as the food basket of ghana commercial farming in this region involves the use of weedicides herbicides fertilizers and other farming inputs within the semi arid pru basin this part of ghana is characterized by a very thick regolith profile due to the prevailing climatic conditions in the area which tends to support deeper chemical weathering the predominance of agricultural activities in and around the semi arid pru basin coupled with its thick regolith profile has the tendency of influencing the groundwater chemistry via infiltration from agricultural lands as well as disposables from the growing agrochemical shops and factories within the catchment of the basin not precluding geogenic source effect eventually the quality of the water would be affected which can greatly impact the health and livelihood of the rural dwellers moreover all the rivers in the semi arid pru basin form part of the volta river drainage system serving as tributaries to the volta lake in the wake of these potential threats to the groundwater quality in the area there is little data available on the current nature of groundwater chemistry in the area and hence the quality to allow for monitoring and designing of proper management practices within the catchment of the semi arid pru basin is not well documented in the literature the mechanisms responsible for groundwater chemistry in the semi arid pru basin are still not properly understood therefore the primary objectives of this study are to assess the geochemical composition of groundwater and to determine geogenic and anthropogenic controls of groundwater chemistry in the semi arid pru basin using ionic ratio plots multivariate statistical and geochemical modeling approaches the research will contribute to the understanding of the vulnerability of basinal aquifers to long term salinization in a broad context through the dissolution of groundwater chemical constituents the use of different ionic ratio plots and geochemical modeling to depict groundwater salinization is still not common in the scientific front most studies employ single ionic plots such as na cl versus ionic concentration of cl to show groundwater salinization but such plots in which both axes have a common variable cl can reveal trends that may be totally unrelated to hydrogeochemical processes and thus may be induced resulting in common variable effect on correlation or spurious correlation keesari and dauji 2020 as a result it is better to always use different ionic ratio plots involving na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and b alongside mineral saturation indices to verify groundwater salinization as done in this study in all this study is the first to document evidence of groundwater salinization in the semi arid pru basin the results of this study will guide policy makers and stake holders in designing effective ways of protecting groundwater resources in the area the recommendations made can be extrapolated to similar areas in the world 2 study area 2 1 location climate and drainage features the semi arid pru basin covers the area between longitudes 00 45 to 01 15 w and latitudes 07 45 to 08 15 n fig 1a it lies in the central part of the bono east region of ghana with a small area between prang and abease as part of the northern region of ghana the area lies in the southern part of the so called middle belt of ghana and is located along the main route between ejura and salaga the area is situated in the central domain of ghana and is partially bounded by the volta lake in the east it is characterized by periods of wetness and dryness march july is the major rainy season with june as the wettest month whereas november february is the major dry season august is the shortest or minor dry season time and september october is the shortest rainy season mean rainfall is about 1150 1250 mm lowest about 330 mm and highest about 1500 mm the highest temperatures mean shade maximum approximately 30 c occur just before the rainy season and the lowest mean shade minimum about 24 c occur during the peak wet months junner and hirdes 1946 almost all the rivers in the area form part of the volta river drainage system the most important is the pru river of which the majority of the rivers are its tributaries the pru river flows from the southwest to the northeast where it enters the volta lake 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the semi arid pru basin forms part of the neoproterozoic to paleozoic flat lying sedimentary succession of ghana known as the voltaian supergroup the voltaian supergroup is composed of three main groups from top to bottom as tamale obosum group oti pendjari group and kwahu bombouaka group abu et al 2019 the semi arid pru basin is entirely overlain by the oti pendjari group fig 1a with outcrops mainly in the eastern and northern fringes the pru formation within this group consists mainly of reddish brown interbedded mudstone and sandstone affaton 2008 the basal part of the unit is more sandstone rich becoming richer in mudstone higher up to the north and east of prang carney et al 2008 ferricrete covers most of the area and is absent only along the main rivers small scarps are sometimes formed at where the rivers cut through the ferricrete the ferricrete occurs below a variable thickness of soil overlying the bedrock the ferricrete is up to 1 5 m thick locally thicker it usually contains angular fragments of the underlying mudstone and sandstone these fragments lack any indication of transportation and are from local geological formations in situ ferricretization of the underlying sediments is evident no deep weathering of bedrock below the ferricrete can be observed numerous wells usually about 0 5 m in diameter have been dug through the ferricrete and the underlying mudstone and hollowed out to depths of 3 4 m to store rainwater the semi arid pru basin forms a significant portion of the voltaian hydrogeological province in ghana which is coterminous with the volta lake fig 1b it is characterized by altering argillaceous and arenaceous rocks and the wide spread presence of ferricretes griffis et al 2002 which significantly affect the depth of weathering and restrict recharge therefore aquifers are shallow and fractured with deep weathering being restricted by the ferricrete the lithology and jointing of the bedrock below the ferricrete is expected to affect permeability in general the aquifer is semi confined by the ferricrete and the water level follows the topography borehole depths range between 45 and 75 m and aquifers are generally encountered between the depth range of 20 and 30 m the success rate of drilling boreholes in the pru formation is about 50 and it is among the lowest in the country primary porosities are very low owing to the impervious nature of the rocks but are enhanced by fracturing and weathering therefore the hydrogeological parameters are primarily based on secondary structures in the form of joints developed after the primary porosities had been destroyed in the wake of rock compaction and slight metamorphism this has resulted in a wide range of hydrogeological properties the hydrogeological properties of the study area are not favourable for large scale groundwater development since yields are generally less than 3 5 m3 h dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 however yields as high as 15 m3 h are occasionally encountered the depth of the weathered zone provides potential for increased groundwater storage however the low permeability limits abstraction the depths of aquifers are normally between 20 and 60 m with alluvial deposits defining most of the main river channels sikah et al 2016 they are generally fine grain deposits mainly silty and clayey hence they form poor aquifers groundwater quality issues related to elevated nitrates exist in some communities owing to localized pollution from agricultural activities around open shallow wells 3 methodology 3 1 data collection and analysis a total of 81 samples were collected from 70 hand dug wells and 11 boreholes using 300 ml plastic bottles the samples from the hand dug wells were collected using a klyen downhole stainless steel borehole sampler whereas the samples from the boreholes were collected by direct pumping from the installed pumps of the boreholes at each of the sampling points the 300 ml plastic bottles were rinsed with the water to be collected to reduce or completely eliminate any contaminations that might be introduced and then filled to the brim geo satellite positioning of all the 81 sampling points were determined with a gps device the collected samples were immediately stored in ice chests containing ice cubes to prevent reactions within the water the samples were then taken to the ghana atomic energy commission in accra for geochemical analysis physico chemical parameters such as ph temperature total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were measured directly in the field from the hand dug wells and boreholes using wtw profiline 3320 universal multi parameter portable meter major ions such as potassium k and sodium na were analyzed using flame photometer magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 concentrations were determined using the aa240fs fast sequential atomic absorption spectrometer ics 90 ion chromatograph dionex ics 90 was used in determining carbonate co3 2 bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl fluoride f nitrate no3 and sulfate so4 2 concentrations boron b concentrations were analyzed using fluorescence analyzer the detection limits for all the ions were k 0 1 mg l na 0 01 mg l mg2 0 05 mg l ca2 0 05 mg l co3 2 0 03 mg l hco3 0 03 mg l cl 0 2 mg l f 0 02 mg l no3 0 05 mg l so4 2 0 1 mg l and b 0 005 mg l in order to maintain the accuracy and a degree of confidence in the integrity of the data all the sampling bottles and glassware were soaked in a 5 nitric acid for overnight and rinsed with deionized water before use instruments used were calibrated with standard chemical solutions prepared from commercially available chemicals and validated with standard reference materials srm and certified reference materials crm the srm were analyzed repeatedly at predetermined intervals to confirm that the method remained in a state of statistical control duplicate samples were also measured and compared and their results were found reproducible within 5 error limit again accuracy of the laboratory analysis was checked by calculating the cation anion balance errors and only those results with errors 5 were relied on for subsequent interpretation 3 2 multivariate statistical techniques r mode factor analysis fa and principal component analysis pca were the main statistical techniques employed in this study these techniques are used to reduce the complexity of large scale datasets and show the relationship between data components sunkari et al 2020 by using these techniques factors with eigenvalues 1 were considered as a possible variance in the study the algorithm employed for extraction of the factors was the pca whilst varimax rotation was the rotation criterion the multivariate statistical analyses were done using spss statistics version 25 however ionic ratios bivariate plots were plotted for pairs of related chemical species using aquachem version 4 0 the ratios between major ions were employed to determine the variable dependency and the relationships between a variable pair in the water 3 3 hydrochemical graphing and geochemical modeling in this study aquachem version 4 0 was used in producing piper and gibbs plots to identify the hydrochemical facies and the mechanisms controlling the groundwater chemistry spatial distribution maps of the hydrochemical parameters were produced by means of surfer version 11 using kriging interpolation kriging was the preferred interpolation technique because it addresses surface estimation problems by using semi variograms sunkari and abu 2019 phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 was employed in performing thermodynamic calculation of the saturation indices si of the various mineral phases residing in the groundwater using eq 1 1 si log iap k sp where iap stands for the ion activity of the solution and ksp is the solubility constant at a particular temperature in the current study carbonate and silicate minerals were the most important during the thermodynamic calculation of the saturation indices since the aquifer materials in the study area are dominated by carbonate rocks and silicate minerals si less than zero is an indication that the groundwater is under saturated with respect to the particular mineral and such value is a reflection of the nature of the groundwater in an environment of formation which contains less amount of the mineral in solution it also points to shorter residence times of the groundwater ako et al 2012 si value greater than zero suggests that the groundwater is supersaturated with respect to the given mineral in solution and the water is unable to further dissolve the mineral 3 4 groundwater salinization revelle index was used in assessing the level of groundwater salinization in the study area the revelle index was computed from the equation below 2 revelle index ri cl hco 3 co 3 2 the concentrations of the ions used in the above equation are expressed in meq l according to karunanidhi et al 2020 groundwater with ri values 0 5 is said to be influenced by salinization after identifying the level of groundwater salinization using the ri approach ionic ratio plots were produced to identify the sources of the salinization 4 results 4 1 geochemical characterization the physico chemical parameters of the samples were evaluated with reference to guidelines for drinking water provided by the world health organization world health organization w h o 2017 they are presented in table 1 and summarized in table 2 the ph levels of majority of the samples are within the who acceptable limits 6 5 8 5 and closely vary between 7 77 and 8 63 with an average value of 8 29 however 8 samples 2 boreholes and 6 hand dug wells have higher ph values when compared to the acceptable limits the high ph values in these boreholes and hand dug wells is attributed to the dominance of limestone in the communities where they are located fig 1a this is because limestone contains carbonate bicarbonate and hydroxide compounds that are capable of dissolving and mixing with the water raising the ph level of the water the samples have widely varied electrical conductivity ec values in the range of 306 7914 Î¼s cm with an average value of 797 Î¼s cm which suggests noncompliance with the world health organization w h o 2017 guideline value of 2500 Î¼s cm the measured isolated cases of very high ec values of 7914 Î¼s cm and 2604 Î¼s cm in hand dug well samples pj009 adeemra community and pj020 burkina bumbo community respectively table 1 are due to longer residence time of the groundwater in the aquifer works conducted in some parts of the volta basin of ghana which serves as the main reservoir for the semi arid pru basin reported very high ec values in groundwater for instance egbi et al 2019 and tay 2012 reported 141 19 370 Î¼s cm and 147 23 200 Î¼s cm at the lower and middle parts of the volta basin respectively though these areas are not specifically in the current study area the high ec values indicate that some form of mixing of freshwater and saline water may have occurred as suggested by egbi et al 2019 total dissolved solids tds concentrations vary between 275 and 7123 mg l with an average value of 717 mg l exceeding the world health organization w h o 2017 guideline value of 500 mg l the tds values in the study area can be compared with those 70 9680 mg l mean of 1237 mg l reported from the lower volta river basin egbi et al 2019 and those 62 11 900 mg l reported from the middle volta river basin tay 2012 more so the geology of the middle volta river basin in the study of tay 2012 overlaps with the geology of the semi arid pru basin as they are both dominated by rocks belonging to the oti pendjari group in this regard the high tds values imply high amount of charged species and longer water rock interaction within the aquifer system sunkari et al 2019 the abundance of feldspars and quartzitic sandstones in the oti pendjari group in the study area fig 1a may also account for the high tds values moreover anthropogenic activities largely as run offs and infiltration from farm lands in the semi arid pru basin cannot be precluded from influencing the tds concentrations in the groundwater as there is a very strong positive correlation r 0 99 between tds and chloride cl table 3 among the major ions only sodium na concentrations exceeded the maximum permissible limit 200 mg l of the who the na concentrations varied from 25 2 to 2115 mg l with an average value of 226 mg l a total of 26 samples 4 boreholes and 22 hand dug wells representing about 32 1 of the total samples have na concentrations exceeding the guideline value the high na concentrations are likely due to ion exchange reactions in the aquifer yidana et al 2018 there is a very strong to moderate correlation between na and ca2 r 0 89 na and cl r 0 97 ca2 and cl r 0 94 k and cl r 0 54 and na and k r 0 52 table 3 all these open a window of interpretation for a common geochemical source of the ions likely salinization via ion exchange reactions gopinath et al 2014 the concentrations of k ca2 and mg2 in the studied samples fall within the guideline values except one sample pj009 adeemra community which has ca2 concentration of 505 mg l exceeding the maximum permissible value of 200 mg l table 1 cl has the highest concentration among the anions ranging from 1 36 to 4671 mg l and an average concentration of 240 mg l a total of 11 hand dug wells have very high cl concentrations when compared with the who 2017 maximum permissible limit of 250 mg l ion exchange reactions in the aquifer system may be responsible for the high cl concentrations consistent with the high tds and ec values bicarbonate hco3 is the most dominant anion with concentrations in the range of 121 641 mg l and an average value of 430 mg l the hco3 concentrations may be controlled by reaction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and soil that produces carbonic acid in the soil loh et al 2019 which chemically disintegrates feldspars in the sandstones of the oti pendjari group during infiltration the fluoride f concentrations are in the range of 0 23 and 3 40 mg l with an average of 0 70 mg l hand dug wells in parambo no 1 burkina bumbo and wurukasa communities have slightly elevated f concentrations of 2 70 mg l 2 23 mg l and 3 40 mg l respectively the high f in these areas is due to ion exchange reactions in the aquifer considering the major ion abundance table 1 nitrate no3 concentrations are generally within the who guideline value of 50 mg l for all the samples except one sample from a hand dug well in yeji township which has concentration up to 70 6 mg l the high no3 concentration in this hand dug well is due to anthropogenic activities like agrochemical applications on farms around the yeji township boron b concentrations varied from 0 05 to 3 37 mg l with an average concentration of 0 50 mg l this implies that groundwater in the semi arid pru basin exceeds the maximum permissible limit 0 5 mg l of b in drinking water provided by the world health organization w h o 2017 twenty two samples comprising of 4 boreholes and 18 hand dug wells have high b concentrations when compared with the threshold value of 0 5 mg l the b enrichment may be due to the dominance of ion exchange reactions in the aquifer the remaining anions such as co3 2 and so4 2 are within the permissible limits the orders of concentration of the major cations and anions are na ca2 mg2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 respectively fig 2 4 2 hydrochemical facies identifying the hydrochemical facies in an aquifer can help reveal mechanisms of both occurrence and salinization and possibly unravel the paleoenvironmental history of the groundwater system piper 1953 diagram indicates that the groundwater types in the semi arid pru basin spread within na hco3 na hco3 cl na ca hco3 and na mg hco3 types in a decreasing order of abundance fig 3 the na hco3 type reflects input from ion exchange reactions in the aquifer song et al 2007 and chemical weathering of silicate minerals the na hco3 cl groundwater type is dominant in areas towards the volta lake which are under threat of anthropogenic activities such as farming involving the use of agrochemicals the na ca hco3 and na mg hco3 water types indicate aquifer recharge water gopinath et al 2014 since groundwater from recharge areas experiences lower rates of water sediment interaction stuyfzand 1999 this accounted for the paucity of the na ca hco3 and na mg hco3 water types as compared to the other water types which are mainly related to discharge areas matthes 1982 characterized the hydrochemical facies of groundwater using indices rather than the usual piper ternary diagram he proposed the base exchange index r1 using na cl and so4 2 parameters eq 3 with their concentrations in meq l and the meteoric genesis index r2 using k na cl and so4 2 parameters eq 4 with concentrations in meq l with r1 1 the water facies is said to be that of na so4 2 whiles r1 1 implies that the water is of na hco3 type also r2 1 means that there was a deeper percolation of meteoric water and hence longer residence time and r2 1 indicates that meteoric water percolation was up to shallow levels matthes 1982 3 base exchange index r1 na cl so 4 2 4 meteoric genesis index r2 k na cl so 4 2 the calculated r1 indices for the studied samples show that 8 samples representing approximately 10 of the collected samples fall in the na so4 2 type field and the remaining 73 samples representing approximately 90 of the collected samples are na hco3 water types fig 4a by the indices calculated table 4 the water facies in the area show a dominant na hco3 water type and minor amount of na so4 2 water type fig 4a the r2 calculations on the other hand show that majority of the samples have r2 values 1 implying that they had longer residence time via deeper percolation fig 4b the higher percentage of the samples with r2 1 accounts for the high tds na cl and hco3 concentrations observed in the samples since there will be enough time for ion exchange reactions in the aquifer for the ion enrichment 4 3 spatial distribution of hydrochemical parameters spatial distribution maps of the various hydrochemical parameters are presented in fig 5 from the maps it is observed that higher ph values are found in samples collected from the northwestern and central parts of the study area fig 5a the high tds and na concentrations given in table 1 are mainly around the southwestern fringe of the study area in peprabon community and its surroundings fig 5b and c the k distribution map also shows high values in the northern and southern parts of the semi arid pru basin fig 5d high ca2 content is only observed in the southwestern peripheral fig 5e just like the tds and na concentrations the mg2 distribution map indicates that high concentrations are only restricted to the northwestern domain of the semi arid pru basin fig 5f which is dominated by limestones and dolomites of the oti pendjari group of the voltaian supergroup the cl distribution map shows high cl content mainly in the southwestern part of the semi arid pru basin consistent with the high tds content observed in the same area fig 5g this may suggest that there is interplay of processes like salinization and anthropogenic activities in the southwestern part of the basin the northwestern part of the basin also shows high so4 2 content fig 5h and could be interpreted as a result of weathering of gypsum from the carbonate lithologies of the oti pendjari group among all the hydrochemical parameters only hco3 shows high content in almost all the parts of the semi arid pru basin fig 5i this might be as result of the homogeneous dominance of carbonate rocks in the basin the no3 distribution map reveals that high no3 in the semi arid pru basin is only common in the northeastern part of the basin towards yeji community where farming activities are dominant fig 5j nevertheless slightly high no3 content is observed in the southwestern part especially towards peprabon community fig 5j f concentrations appear to be high in the northwestern and eastern fringes of the study area particularly in parambo no 1 burkina bumbo and wurukasa fig 5k this suggests that the inhabitants in these communities are prone to the threat of dental fluorosis should they keep drinking water from those hand dug wells the high b content of groundwater in the semi arid pru basin is mainly in the northern eastern southern and northwestern parts fig 5l 4 4 multivariate statistics and geochemical modeling the r mode fa resulted in four factors with eigenvalues 1 table 4 these factors explained 76 0 of the total variance of all the hydrochemical parameters analyzed in this study factor 1 which explains about 37 6 of the total variance table 4 is contributed by ec tds na k ca2 mg2 and cl fig 6 factor 2 explains 15 5 of the sample variance table 4 and loads positively on ph hco3 and co3 fig 6 factor 3 accounts for 14 6 of the variance table 5 and mainly associated with so4 2 f and b fig 6 factor 4 explains about 8 32 of the total variance of the dataset table 4 and is strongly associated with temperature and no3 fig 6 statistical summary of the calculated saturation indices si of the identified mineral phases in the groundwater are presented in table 5 all the studied samples are saturated with respect to calcite 0 08 1 36 average of 0 90 and dolomite 0 07 2 97 average of 1 79 the samples are under saturated with respect to gypsum 5 79 to 1 71 and anhydrite 6 03 to 1 92 table 5 some of the studied samples also appear to be saturated with respect to aragonite 0 06 to 1 22 average of 0 76 and talc 4 54 5 54 average of 1 99 table 5 however all the samples are under saturated with respect to halite 9 01 to 3 75 and fluorite 2 68 to 0 27 table 5 the calculated si values of minerals by phreeqc also show that some samples are saturated with respect to silicate minerals such as albite 5 60 0 27 average of 2 73 chalcedony 1 24 0 28 average of 0 47 and quartz 0 82 0 75 average of 0 04 table 5 5 discussion 5 1 processes controlling groundwater chemistry 5 1 1 ion exchange reactions schoeller 1965 used chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and cai 2 to indicate forward ion exchange and reverse ion exchange reactions and these indices have been extensively used in evaluating how ion exchange governs the occurrence of groundwater ako et al 2012 emenike et al 2020 positive cai 1 eq 5 and cai 2 eq 6 is indicative of reverse ion exchange reaction where na and k replace ca2 and mg2 ions whereas it becomes forward ion exchange reaction when cai 1 and cai 2 values are negative with ca2 and mg2 replacing na and k in the process the 81 groundwater samples of the semi arid pru basin show that about 68 of the samples are with negative cai 1 and cai 2 values indicating a dominant forward ion exchange reaction with ca2 and mg2 replacing na and k in the process due to the presence of dolomitic rocks in the area this process is further observed in fig 7a which involves cai 1 values indicating both forward and reverse ion exchange processes with dominant forward ion exchange however reverse ion exchange reaction is observed as the dominant process in the cai 2 diagram fig 7b it can thus be concluded that on a basin scale both forward and reverse ion exchange reactions control groundwater chemistry in the semi arid pru basin this is supported by the average cai 1 and cai 2 values table 4 5 cai 1 cl na k cl 6 cai 2 cl na k so 4 2 hco 3 co 3 2 no 3 moreover a plot of ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 reveals the dominance of ion exchange reactions mainly forward ion exchange in the aquifer since most of the samples shift to the right due to an excess of hco3 so4 2 fig 8a if reverse ion exchange was the dominant process the samples would have shifted to the left due to an excess of ca2 mg2 over hco3 so4 2 mclean and jankowski 2000 via the reaction below eq 7 nevertheless three hand dug well samples plot in the reverse ion exchange field fig 7a 7 2na ca mg clay na clay ca 2 mg 2 fig 8b confirms that reverse ion exchange is also a common process in the aquifer system of the semi arid pru basin this plot involves mg2 versus ca2 mg2 where all the samples shift to the left except two that shifted to the right indicating that reverse ion exchange predominates the system than forward ion exchange further confirmation of this is observed in the plot of ca2 versus ca2 so4 2 where all the samples plot in the reverse ion exchange field save for two samples that plot in the forward ion exchange field fig 8c but the plot of na versus cl equilibrates the two processes in the aquifer system fig 8d implying that both forward ion exchange and reverse ion exchange reactions are the dominant processes influencing groundwater chemistry in the semi arid pru basin 5 1 2 water rock interaction the samples in this study were plotted on the gibbs 1970 diagrams to identify the principal geochemical controls of the groundwater chemistry on the cationic diagram which involves tds versus na na ca majority of the samples plot in the rock weathering dominance field whereas a few samples plot in the evaporation crystallization dominance field fig 9a this suggests that chemical weathering of rocks and dissolution of minerals as well as evaporation are the principal controls of the groundwater chemistry similar trend is observed in the anionic diagram fig 9b that involves tds versus cl cl hco3 nevertheless the increase in tds against na na ca and cl cl hco3 in both diagrams implies that other processes such as ion exchange reactions are also controls of the groundwater chemistry li et al 2016 aside using the traditional bivariate plot of gibbs to infer the relation between the host rock and the groundwater a number of ratios have been used to elucidate the effect of water rock interaction as a mineralization process of groundwater cl Ê anions na cl na na ca2 and mg2 ca2 mg2 have been used to deduce the effect of silicate weathering naseem et al 2010 kumar et al 2018 the 1 value of cl Ê anions is indicative of silicate mineral weathering kumar et al 2018 in the basin table 6 this is supported by the 1 values of na na ca2 and mg2 ca2 mg2 table 6 in addition moghaddam and fijani 2008 indicated that the mg2 ca2 mg2 also differentiates between the contribution of the different rock types in area hence the average value of mg2 ca2 mg2 table 6 is 1 supporting the input of ferromagnesian minerals from the adjacent mafic rocks of the paleoproterozoic birimian supergroup in the area the effect of silicate mineral weathering and for that matter water rock interaction is again emphasized by the high average na cl value 1 in the area table 6 the positive correlation between ca2 and na and k table 3 suggests that cation exchange reaction within crystalline aquifers is a dominant process where water rocks reaction played a significant role in the chemistry of the groundwater within the semi arid pru basin the semi arid pru basin which is largely within the oti pendjari group of the voltaian supergroup fig 1b overlies feldspathic and quartzitic sandstones which also unconformably overly the basement birimian rocks these feldspathic sandstones as well as the birimian rocks contain silicate minerals as their constituent minerals and thus one cannot preclude possible water rock interaction as a contributory factor to groundwater chemistry in the area this proposition is supported by the high ec level which indicates high water residence time in the aquifer that possibly allowed enough time for the rock minerals to react with the groundwater the fact that silicate weathering plays a critical role in the groundwater chemistry is supported by the bivariate plot involving ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 fig 8a in this plot samples below the 1 1 equiline are attributed to silicate weathering whilst those above the 1 1 equiline might have resulted from carbonate mineral weathering of calcite gypsum or dolomite chegbeleh et al 2020 such process involves reaction of atmospheric carbonic acid with the water to dissolve the carbonate minerals which preferentially releases ca2 and mg2 in the water this chemical process is further highlighted in fig 8b for the weathering of dolomite and fig 8c for the weathering of gypsum the samples that plot near or along the 1 2 line may be as a result of dolomite and gypsum weathering on the plot of na versus cl fig 8d three processes can be observed the first two are reverse and forward ion exchange reactions for the samples with higher na as explained earlier whereas the third is saline water intrusion for the samples with higher cl majority of the samples plot close to the 2 1 line which may indicate the effect of halite dissolution on groundwater chemistry however halite is less common in the study area and thus anthropogenic activities might be enriching cl in the groundwater using the na normalized ca versus hco3 plot fig 8e of gaillardet et al 1999 all the samples range from being influenced by silicate weathering evaporate dissolution and carbonate dissolution in a decreasing order of magnitude also on a na normalized ca versus mg plot fig 8f it is observed that although majority of the mg content of the groundwater may have been derived from carbonate dolomite dissolution a significant fraction may have come from silicate and evaporate dissolution 5 1 3 salinization the computed revelle index ri values ranged from 0 01 to 66 2 table 1 the ri assessment of the level of groundwater salinization in the semi arid pru basin indicates that about 19 8 of the groundwater samples with ri values 0 5 is influenced by salinization therefore in order to identify the potential sources of groundwater salinization in the semi arid pru basin ionic plots were produced ions such as na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and b have proven to be conservative tracers of groundwater salinization in any hydrogeological system gopinath et al 2014 the effect of saline water intrusion and anthropogenic activities on groundwater chemistry is demonstrated in fig 10a on this plot the samples showing na cl ratios 0 86 suggest that the groundwater is intruded by saline water whereas the samples with na cl ratios 1 are likely to have been contaminated by anthropogenic sources naily 2018 sunkari et al 2019 about 12 4 of the groundwater resources mainly hand dug wells in the semi arid pru basin are affected by saline water intrusion when compared with saline water from the volta river egbi et al 2019 which serves as the major reservoir for the semi arid pru basin implying that saline water from adjacent aquifers may be contributing to groundwater salinization moreover majority of the samples 87 7 plot in the zone of anthropogenic pollution fig 10a implying that the groundwater salinization is largely influenced by anthropogenic sources like run offs and infiltration from irrigable farm lands comparable to the study of karunanidhi et al 2020 from the spatial maps the high cl and tds contents are restricted to the southwestern part of the basin fig 5b and g where there is no paucity of anthropogenic activities most of the rivers making up the volta river drainage system are found in the southwestern part of the basin and the rural dwellers depend on them for irrigation farming as well as small scale fishing it is possible that leaching from the chemicals the farmers use in these activities may be the culprit for the groundwater salinization in the southwestern part of the basin abdalla 2016 proposed the use of ca hco3 so4 versus na cl diagram to demarcate water that is influenced by saline water and base ion exchange as drivers of groundwater salinization therefore on the ca hco3 so4 versus na cl diagram 10 samples representing 12 4 of the studied samples plot in the cl excess zone which is the region of higher salinity 70 samples representing 86 4 of the total samples plot in the base ion exchange zone whereas only 1 sample representing 1 23 of the total samples plot in the ca excess zone fig 10b certainly this trend suggests that in addition to anthropogenic activities as discussed earlier ion exchange reactions and saline water intrusion from adjacent aquifers are the principal controls of groundwater salinization in the semi arid pru basin furthermore the major ion and chloride relationships still throw more light on the sources of groundwater salinization the ca2 versus cl plot fig 10c indicates that 69 of the samples with higher ca2 ratios were influenced by mixing of fresh groundwater with saline water gopinath et al 2014 the mg2 versus cl plot fig 10d delineates samples influenced by both saline water intrusion those below the conservative mixing and weathering of calcium magnesium minerals in the oti pendjari group those above the conservative mixing line gopinath et al 2018 the relationship between k and cl fig 10e reveals that samples with high cl ratios might be influenced by ion exchange processes gopinath et al 2018 however the low k concentration in groundwater may be related with the proclivity of k to be adsorbed by clay minerals to form secondary minerals and agricultural activities in the basin gopinath et al 2018 the b versus cl ratios slightly increased and shifted towards the excess cl field due to possible mixing with saline water from adjacent aquifers fig 10f the so4 2 versus cl ratio plot fig 10g indicates that depletion in so4 2 is primarily as a result of saline water intrusion gopinath et al 2014 the so4 2 depletion could also be due to gypsum precipitation in the saline water during the initial stages of intrusion majority of the samples show higher values of the so4 2 cl and b concentration fig 10h pointing to evaporate dissolution within the aquifer trabelsi et al 2007 the relationship between tds and cl fig 10i indicates an exceptional linear mixing trend with a very strong correlation coefficient r 0 99 this suggests that the enrichment of cl in groundwater may be due to saline water mixing processes and the samples with higher tds might be an indication of water rock interaction and anthropogenic input ebrahimi et al 2016 in all it can be inferred from the ionic ratio plots that the source of groundwater salinization in the semi arid pru basin is an interplay of factors comprising saline water intrusion mixing effects ion exchange reactions water rock interaction and anthropogenic activities similar processes are ascribed as the source of groundwater salinization in basins and coastal aquifers with similar climatic conditions in ghana kortatsi 2007 egbi et al 2019 iran ebrahimi et al 2016 and india pratheepa et al 2015 karunanidhi et al 2020 5 1 4 anthropogenic activities the nitrate levels as well as tds concentration levels are indication of anthropogenic activities in a given area sunkari et al 2019 the nitrate contribution to the chemical content in the groundwater only affects a sample collected from the yeji township 2 where the concentration 70 6 mg l exceeds the maximum permissible value of 50 mg l by the who table 1 however when all the no3 concentrations are compared with the guideline value 10 mg l of the bureau of indian standards bureau of indian standards bis 2012 the no3 concentrations of hand dug wells from nyomoase 33 7 mg l adeemra 43 8 mg l kumfia 1 33 1 yeji catholic hospital 1 33 8 mg l yeji catholic hospital 2 33 2 mg l and yeji township 1 32 6 mg l appear to exceed the threshold therefore approximately 9 of the groundwater resources in the semi arid pru basin are contaminated with nitrates the affected communities are mostly around the eastern and southwestern parts of the semi arid pru basin where anthropogenic activities such as farming are common the source of nitrate in groundwater has been traced to the application of nitrate fertilizers berhe et al 2017 gibrilla et al 2020 the reasonable positive correlation of no3 with the other ions table 3 supports anthropogenic pollution through the continuous application of nitrate fertilizers in farms within the basin the tds values are generally higher than the 500 mg l acceptable level and anthropogenic activities have proven to be the main source of tds in groundwater berhe et al 2017 lermi and ertan 2019 on bivariate plots of selected major ions versus tds it is observed that about 50 of the groundwater samples are contaminated with respect to higher tds values with increasing ion concentration fig 11a d the increasing trends of na mg2 cl and no3 with increasing tds support anthropogenic contribution from agricultural activities untreated sewage effluents and household waste leachates fig 11a d 5 2 constraints from multivariate statistical and geochemical modeling approaches in general it is difficult to understand geochemical processes due to their complex nature applying multivariate statistical techniques to hydrochemical data can show their interrelationships and thus help decipher their sources yidana et al 2012 in this regard the results of the r mode fa give a hint to the sources of the ions in groundwater the concentrations of ec tds na k ca2 mg2 and cl in saline water exceed that of continental freshwater trabelsi et al 2007 therefore the association of these parameters with factor 1 fig 6 could be linked to saline water intrusion into the aquifer from adjacent aquifers which is one of the primary factors controlling the chemistry of groundwater also factor 1 can be associated with water rock interaction which dissolved most of the rock constituents and then released these ions into groundwater yidana et al 2012 hco3 and co3 2 in factor 2 fig 6 are derived from the dissolution of co2 in the water and gives a hint on the source of recharge in the basin trabelsi et al 2007 the inclusion of ph in factor 2 fig 6 highlights the significant role it plays in geochemistry of carbonates and clays in the semi arid pru basin it is therefore associated with carbonate and clay mineral dissolution in the aquifer strong positive loading of so4 2 f and b in factor 3 fig 6 is as a result of ion exchange reactions in the aquifer however contribution from anthropogenic activities like application of agrochemicals such as sulphate fertilizers especially in the southwestern part of the study area may have resulted in this factor loading therefore this factor staggers the boundary between geogenic and anthropogenic sources of the ions moreover temperature and no3 associated with factor 4 fig 6 may be confirming the contribution from anthropogenic sources since the surface of the aquifer is used for agricultural activities the no3 may be derived from surface runoff of nitrate fertilizers the saturation of groundwater with respect to calcite and dolomite confirms the dissolution of these minerals from the kodjari formation of the oti pendjari group as explained in the earlier section on a bivariate plot of si dolomite versus si calcite fig 12a all the studied samples plot in the field of saturation with respect to both minerals therefore the high concentration of ca2 mg2 and hco3 may be as a result of calcite and dolomite dissolution since carbonate weathering is dominant in the study area the under saturation of the samples with respect to gypsum fig 12b and anhydrite suggests that the less concentration of so4 2 in the groundwater is due to less dissolution of gypsum the saturation of some of the samples with respect to calcite and aragonite fig 12c indicates possible dissolution of these minerals in groundwater on fig 12d about 85 of the samples plot in the talc saturation zone talc occurs as a hydrated magnesium silicate that may be formed from reaction of dolomite and silica or metamorphism of magnesium bearing minerals in the presence of water and carbon dioxide singh et al 2015 this is consistent with the prevalence of dolomites in the oti pendjari group consequently saturation of groundwater with respect to talc implies that either processes may be responsible on the bivariate plot of si halite versus cl fig 12e all the samples plot in the halite under saturation zone implying that halite dissolution can be precluded from influencing the groundwater chemistry however the high cl concentration of groundwater can be explained by saline water intrusion and other processes like ion exchange reactions and anthropogenic activities fluorite also shows under saturation in the groundwater fig 12f but the strong positive correlation of fluorite and f may suggest that the f enrichment in groundwater of some of the communities reflects the role of ca2 through ion exchange reaction zango et al 2019 saturation of some samples with respect to the silicate mineral phases such as albite chalcedony and quartz table 5 explains the role of silicate weathering in groundwater chemistry 6 conclusions aquifers in semi arid environments are known to have several hydrogeological complexities and environmental problems one of them is groundwater salinization and an increase in the concentrations of ions that are detrimental to human health also the use of different ionic ratio plots multivariate statistical and geochemical modeling techniques to depict groundwater salinization is still not common in the scientific front therefore this study contributes to the understanding of the vulnerability of semi arid basin aquifers to long term salinization in a broad context through the dissolution of groundwater chemical constituents in this regard the study has made available new data from the semi arid pru basin in ghana regarding the geochemical evolution of groundwater from 81 hand dug wells and boreholes within the siliciclastic pru formation of the oti pendjari group in the basin it is the first to document evidence of groundwater salinization in the semi arid pru basin using an integrated approach involving different ionic ratio plots multivariate statistical analyses and geochemical modeling the findings of the study revealed that the abundance of major ions follows the order na ca2 mg2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 groundwater in the semi arid pru basin evolved from a less saline na hco3 na ca hco3 and na mg hco3 water type to a more saline na hco3 cl water type the main controls of groundwater chemistry are water rock interaction ion exchange reactions silicate and carbonate weathering salinization and anthropogenic activities like application of agrochemicals to farms and shallow meteoric water infiltration from agricultural lands the ionic ratio plots involving na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and b and multivariate statistical analyses indicate that groundwater salinization is as a result of geogenic processes and anthropogenic activities revelle index indicated that the groundwater salinization affected about 19 8 of the studied samples the southwestern part of the basin is the most affected mineral saturation indices calculated using phreeqc demonstrate that groundwater is generally saturated with respect to carbonate minerals calcite aragonite talc and silicate minerals albite chalcedony quartz but under saturated with respect to anhydrite fluorite gypsum and halite it is recommended that to mitigate the threat of groundwater salinization the basin water level should be kept high artificial subsurface barriers should be developed rainwater harvesting technology should be used artificial recharge structures should be adopted and aquifer improvement plans should be implemented future researches in the area should focus on using isotopes to completely understand the source of groundwater salinization declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

1456,high performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultra violet diode array detection hplc uv dad was used to study the degradation reactions of ultraviolet uv filter hexyl 2 4 diethylamino 2 hydroxybenzoyl benzoate dhhb degradation by products were detected and identified by means of liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and mass spectrometry lc dad ms environmentally relevant characteristics such as water ph chlorine levels water temperature and dissolved organic matter dom concentration were modulated and studied in order to determine their influence on the degradation reactions results show that dhhb degrades quite rapidly in typical drinking water disinfection conditions displaying a kinetic rate constant of k obs 0 0060 0 0002 s 1 and a half life period of merely t 1 2 116 4 s as far as the non volatile disinfection by products dbps are concerned only the mono and dichlorinated forms of dhhb were detected in the degradation reactions regarding influential variables on dhhb degradation the presence or absence of dom in solution did not alter the trends that were found degradation of dhhb is more significant at lower ph values and higher levels of active chlorine in solution chlorinated dbps have also been found to predominate under higher ph values and lower levels of chlorine whereas they were found to be unstable and further degradable quite likely into smaller and more volatile compounds when in lower ph and higher chlorine concentrations as for the photo degradation studies dhhb was found to be extremely photo stable with only about 15 degradation rate detected during artificial irradiation periods of 6 h keywords uv filters dhhb uvinul a plus disinfection by products 1 introduction protection from ultraviolet uv radiation is the paramount function of uv filters uva or uvb absorbent compounds that constitute the backbone of sunscreen products and other cosmetics chisvert and salvador 2018 shaath 2010 there is currently a vast number of compounds regulated and applied by pharmaceutical companies worldwide in addition to this protective character these compounds are known to incorporate into the superficial water bodies where they display significant persistence as well as potentially concerning eco toxicological profiles chisvert and salvador 2018 shaath 2010 giokas et al 2007 dÃ­az cruz and barcelÃ³ 2009 despite their potential environmental concerns insight into the fate and behaviour of these compounds is shallow and somewhat ambiguous given the reduced number of studied focused on the topic giokas et al 2007 dÃ­az cruz et al 2008 la farrÃ© et al 2008 furthermore besides being persistent and accumulative in the aquatic environment these compounds are also reported to degrade and lead to the formation of degradation by products with toxicological profiles potentially more troublesome that those of the parental compounds dÃ­az cruz and barcelÃ³ 2009 dÃ­az cruz et al 2008 la farrÃ© et al 2008 santos et al 2012 therefore it is important to study the reactivity of as many uv filters as possible in order to understand their environmental impact and how to properly mitigate or eliminate it unfortunately of all the dozens of existing filters there are only a few studies conducted on this topic covering merely a handful of compounds 2 ethylhexyl 4 dimethylamino benzoate

disinfection by products will be identified with proper molecular structure elucidation with the help of liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and mass spectrometry lc dad ms the uv absorption ability of the compound will be assessed after exposed to artificial solar radiation by means of a uv vis spectrophotometer finally with the help of an experimental design formulation the

standard ich guidelines international conference on harmonization of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use ich 1994 1996 namely based on accuracy precision repeatability linearity and detection limit calibration was carried out by analysing 9 standard solutions between the range 0 02500 mg l 6 290 10 8 mol l and 25 00 mg l 6 300 10 5 mol l three trials were prepared and done for each solution calibration curves were all perfectly linear throughout the calibration range and correlation coefficients r2 were all determined to be higher than 0 998 leading to a detection limit of 1 36 Î¼g l 2 3 disinfection induced degradation 2 3 1 reaction kinetics experiments were conducted at neutral ph room temperature in the dark and under constant stirring first a stock solution of dhhb was prepared by dissolving 25 mg of standard compound in 100 00 ml of absolute ethanol final concentration 250 00 mg l or 6 289 10 4 mol l all experiments were prepared by using this stock solution as the source of dhhb the experimental reactors were 250 ml ordinary borosilicate glass vessels containing 1 000 mg l 2 516 10 6 mol l of dhhb and 5 002 mg l 6 716 10 5 mol l of naocl in 100 ml of deionized water this way active chlorine level variation would be considered theoretically negligible along with time an initial aliquot of the solution containing solely dhhb was always analysed by direct injection in the hplc uv dad system providing a record of the initial chromatographic conditions active chlorine naocl was included in the mixture the ph ph 6 4 0 5 and water temperature t 20 7 0 1 c were recorded and monitored and the reaction timer initiated one aliquot of 1000 Î¼l was taken from the reaction mixture at every 20 s of reaction during a 4 min total reaction time frame residual active chlorine in solution was quenched with the addition of 10 Î¼l of a standard 65 g l ascorbic acid aa and the samples were immediately stored at 4 c until the moment of analysis by direct injection in the hplc uv dad system 2 3 2 identification of non volatile dbps for the determination of non volatile dbps the experimental conditions were as described in section 2 3 1 however the reaction was allowed to progress for 10 min and then entirely pre concentrated by spe using 6 ml 500 mg hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb cartridges from waters corporation milford ma the spe cartridges were always previously conditioned with 3 ml of methanol followed by 3 ml of deionized water pre concentration was achieved with the help of a peristaltic pump minipuls 2 from gilson inc middleton wi usa extraction of the compounds adsorbed in the cartridge was carried out with 3 ml of dichloromethane the organic solvent was then evaporated with a careful stream of nitrogen gas the final residue was diluted in 500 Î¼l of methanol and then analysed immediately by direct injection in the lc dad ms system 2 3 3 influence of external variables this part of the work was ensured by using an experimental design formulation approach and the subsequent statistical analysis anova of the results and its response surface calculations the process was enabled by the unscrambler v9 2 camo process as oslo norway software program the purpose of this section of the work was to investigate the significance that common external variables such as the ph water temperature active chlorine and dissolved organic matter dom levels have on the fate and behaviour of dhhb in aqueous solution with this goal in mind two box behnken designs were created one without dom in solution model a and another with dom in solution model b the details of the designs are presented in fig 2 additional information on the experimental conditions is presented in the supplementary material the experimental variables and corresponding general conditions were defined based on knowledge gathered from previous studies dÃ­az cruz et al 2008 sakkas et al 2003 negreira et al 2008 nakajima et al 2009 santos et al 2013 2 4 photo degradation studies the photo degradation experiments were carried out by artificial solar irradiation with the help of a total spectrum solar radiation simulator newport oriel 96 000 with a 150 w ozone free xenon lamp with air mass filters 1 5 global 81 094 and a liquid light guide whose tip was positioned about 1 cm above the surface of the reaction mixtures as in sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 reactions were performed in ordinary borosilicate glass beakers containing 100 ml of deionized water spiked with dhhb to generate a concentration of 1 000 mg l 2 516 10 6 mol l in parallel with the irradiated solutions another equivalent solution was always kept in the dark and ambient temperature also analysed at each step as a control irradiation experiments lasted for a total time frame of six hours with an aliquot of each solution irradiated and control being removed at each hour and analysed first in the uv vis spectrophotometer and then by direct injection in the hplc uv dad system 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection induced degradation 3 1 1 reaction kinetics typical oxidation reactions between organic or inorganic compounds and active chlorine in aqueous solution normally follow a total second order kinetic degradation profile first order for both the compound and chlorine as the literature presents deborde and von gunten 2008 as far as the reaction between dhhb and the total amount of active chlorine in solution naocl t hocl clo and considering the global second order kinetic profile dhhb aq naocl aq products aq which implies the following kinetic law v Î´ dhhb Î´t k app dhhb naocl t dhhb represents the concentration of the filter naocl t is the total concentration of the ph dependent active chlorine species in solution hypochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite anion clo and k app is the apparent global second order rate constant finally under pseudo first order conditions the aforementioned kinetic law can be simplified Î´ dhhb Î´t k obs dhhb the rate constant of which k obs represents the observed pseudo first order rate constant of the reaction k obs k app naocl t as far as the results are concerned fig 3 displays the exponential plot of dhhb levels as a function of reaction time and according to those results dhhb dhhb 0 1 068645e 0 005956t by linear regression it was possible to determine the observed pseudo first order rate constant k obs 0 0060 0 0002 s 1 and the half life period of the compound t 1 2 116 38 3 71 s the data confirms that dhhb is highly reactive in a context of exposure to active chlorine reaching half of its initial concentration slightly under two minutes and achieving a total of about 74 degradation rate at the end of the four minutes of reaction time the only existing study focused on dhhb was published in 2013 grboviÄ et al 2013 and it dealt solely with the mass spectrometry ms determination of by products without approaching the degradation reaction itself subsequently this work intended to fill that gap and investigate the experimental scenario by determining the compound s degradation profile when in contact with active chlorine as well as confirming the non volatile dbps originated in the process it is also important to underline once again that the purpose of the disinfection induced degradation study was to reflect and present an experimental scenario as close as possible to the one usually found in municipal waters namely in what regards the active chlorine concentrations in aqueous solution deborde and von gunten 2008 centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2020 zwiener et al 2007 since there are no other studies dealing with dhhb specifically its degradation reactions profile and kinetic features in exposure to active chlorine an analogue comparison might be more appropriate other works have presented similar studies albeit with different compounds such are the cases of emc and bdm studied by this same research group santos et al 2013 bp4 studied by negreira and collaborators negreira et al 2012 and bp3 and bp8 approached by duirk and colleagues duirk et al 2013 according to negreira negreira et al 2012 bp4 half life periods t 1 2 varied between 3 41 ph 6 3 and 0 45 ph 8 1 minutes in ultrapure water and between 5 25 ph 6 3 and 0 98 ph 8 1 minutes in ordinary municipal water this shows us that reactivity of bp4 seems to increase with the increase of ph which indicates higher reactivity of the filter with hypochlorite anion clo that predominates at alkaline conditions deborde and von gunten 2008 however in the context of municipal water disinfection such context is irrelevant since drinking water disinfection occurs at slightly acidic conditions due to the significantly more efficient role of hypochlorous acid hclo as a disinfecting agent and which predominates at acidic to neutral ph deborde and von gunten 2008 still at slightly acidic or neutral ph bp4 displays lower reactivity than dhhb whilst still being quite reactive itself as for duirk s results duirk et al 2013 the observed first order rate constants k obs obtained were all below one tenth of the value determined in this study for dhhb at ph 6 7 and around the same levels of active chlorine in solution which also indicates much lower reactivity than dhhb under drinking water disinfecting conditions as for the results obtained by this research group for emc and bdm the former presented a half life period of 73 min whilst the latter had a half life period of 119 min under similar experimental conditions both these compounds have proven to be much more stable towards disinfection induced degradation 3 1 2 identification of non volatile dbps the lc dad ms chromatogram displaying the determined mono and dichlorinated dbps of dhhb along with the parental compound and their respective ms spectra is provided in fig 4 additional information namely the proposed mechanisms and molecular structures of the identified dbps as well as all the mass spectra and fragmentations carried out for each compound are included in the supplementary material figs s1 s4 and s5 s11 respectively retention times and most prominent or abundant fragments are included in table 2 through the analysis of the data from table 2 it was possible to clearly identify two dbps of dhhb the mono and dichlorinated forms of the compound the peak at 9 17 min was already known to belong to the parental compound dhhb and the lc dad ms analysis confirmed it the ms analysis of the peak yielded the molecular ion 398 m z which is in accordance with the molecular mass of the filter see table s3 in the supplementary material fragmentation of this peak gave origin to the molecular ions 149 233 and 296 as the most abundant fragments the two remaining peaks were assumed to be potential dbps of dhhb since in parallel to their significance and intensity in the chromatogram their area always varied as a function of variable dhhb or naocl concentrations in solution throughout the studies the peak at retention time 4 92 min exhibited a molecular ion of 466 consistent with the molecular mass of the dichlorinated form of dhhb the fragmentation of this peak led to the molecular ions 149 233 and 364 as the most predominant as far as the peak at retention time 13 37 min it displayed the molecular ion 432 consistent with the molecular mass of the mono chlorinated form of dhhb its fragmentation yielded the ions 330 302 and 348 fig 5 presents the uv absorption spectra of dhhb and both the identified dbps for comparison regarding the dichlorinated dbp as fig 5 shows its uv absorption spectrum is considerably different from the remaining two compounds which were able to retain a somewhat similar uv absorption profile since its absorption band shifts towards 260 nm and with an absorption capacity below 40 of that originally displayed by dhhb grboviÄ reported two apparently different monochlorinated species of dhhb which were not found in this study in any of the experimental scenarios applied the author also did not report the uv absorption spectra of the dichlorinated dbp so we cannot comment of possible differences or similarities according to the literature deborde and von gunten 2008 active chlorine will most likely attack aromatic rings by electrophilic substitution on the benzenic ring particularly in ortho or para positions to important functional groups such the hydroxyl and the tertiary amine groups present in one of dhhb s rings such functional groups are known as ortho and para directors or activators subsequently given the strong ortho and para activating role of the oh and nr2 groups the chlorination reaction of dhhb will most likely result in the successive electrophilic substitution of chlorine into sites 1 ortho position and 2 para position marked in red on fig 6 considering the literature deborde and von gunten 2008 most noteworthy in this case the fact that the electrophilic substitution of chlorine into the ortho position towards the hydroxyl group displays a rate constant 4 times higher than the one reported for the substitution in para position it is safe to assume that the only monochlorinated dbp determined in this work peak at 13 37 min in fig 4 will most likely be the ortho monochlorinated dhhb presented in fig 6 the dichlorinated form of dhhb peak at 4 92 min in fig 4 and structure presented in fig 6 would have been originated from the successive substitution of chlorine into the para position of the already ortho monochlorinated dhhb 3 1 3 influence of external variables detailed information about the analysis of variance anova made on the experimental results is presented in the supplementary material see tables s3 s6 two non design variables were measured or studied the chlorination and effective degradation percentages in order to ascertain the correct effect of the design variables the designs for the chlorination and effective degradation percentages from model a and b are all statistically valid and significant as the analysis presented in section 2 of the supplementary material clearly indicates and details data indicates that it is mostly the ph that influences chlorination and effective degradation in model a with chlorine concentration right below it as for the water temperature it has proven to be not very significant in both chlorination and effective degradation of dhhb figs s12 s15 of the supplementary material show the response surfaces obtained for chlorination and effective degradation respectively by combining the two most significant variables ph and naocl concentration the analysis of fig s12 shows that the highest concentration of non volatile chlorinated by products was found at higher levels of ph and lower levels of active chlorine in solution whilst the lowest amount of those compounds was found at the highest concentration of chlorine and lowest ph values as far as the loss in dhhb concentration see fig s13 the trend is exactly the opposite that is degradation of the compound is achieved at higher levels of chlorine and at lower ph levels nakajima nakajima et al 2009 also reported that the degradation rates of the uv filter 2 ethylhexyl 4 methoxycinnamate emc increased with the decrease in ph our research group also obtained and reported similar findings for emc and yet another uv filter 4 tert butyl 4 methoxydibenzoylmethane bdm santos et al 2013 according to the ph dependence of the hypochlorous acid hypochlorite anion hocl clo equilibrium pka 7 54 at 25 c deborde and von gunten 2008 the hypochlorite anion clearly predominates at higher levels of ph namely at ph 7 5 whereas hypochlorous acid which predominates between 4 ph 7 5 esteves da silva et al 1996 deborde and von gunten 2008 is usually defined as the most efficient chlorine disinfecting agent deborde and von gunten 2008 the results of this study seem to point to a significant and sequential degradation of the non volatile chlorinated by products into smaller and more volatile molecules undetected in the lc dad ms analysis this may explain why the highest concentration of non volatile dbps is found at higher ph and lower concentrations of active chlorine at higher ph values hypochlorite anion which is considered a low efficiency disinfecting agent clearly predominates and together with lower levels of active chlorine in solution seems to lead to a decrease in the degradation rate of the non volatile dbps additionally detection of higher levels of chlorinated dbps at higher ph values also points to reactions of the ionized form of dhhb with hypochlorite anion suggesting that the ionized form of the parental compound may in fact predominate in solution the effective degradation of dhhb that is the detected or accounted total loss of dhhb concentration presented in fig s13 points to those same conclusions degradation of dhhb is indeed found to be much more significant at higher levels of active chlorine in solution and lower ph values conditions where the more efficient hypochlorous acid predominates the bottom line is chlorination of organic compounds is precisely what leads to their degradation so following the variation in concentration of dbps and the establishment of fig s12 for analysis was relevant to identify what seems to be the cause of the instability of these non volatile by products and the inherent increase in their degradation rates at higher levels of active chlorine and higher ph values in model b another design variable dom was included in order to ascertain the effect of ordinary dissolved organic matter commonly found in natural and artificial water environments as was the case with model a data shows that ph is the most influential variable in the chlorination and effective degradation of dhhb in model b dom is known to actively compete with any synthetic organic compounds in solution for the available free active chlorine subsequently it was expected that the chlorination rate and the effective loss in parental compound would decrease with the increase of dom levels in solution however results didn t show a compelling mitigation of degradation rates quite possibly due to the highly reactive nature of dhhb towards free available chlorine figs s14 s15 in the supplementary material display the response surfaces for the chlorination and effective degradation of dhhb respectively by combining the ph and naocl concentration analysis of figs s14 s15 show the same trend as in model a that is degradation of dhhb is more significant at higher levels of chlorine in solution and lower levels of ph 3 2 photo degradation studies as mentioned in section 1 merely one study sakkas et al 2003 focused simultaneously on the disinfection induced and photo induced degradation of uv filters in light of that fact it was the goal of the present work to address those two degradation contexts additionally it is also worth to mention that photo induced degradation of certain uv filters has been the specific focus of several studies rodil et al 2009 maier et al 2001 huong et al 2007 huong et al 2008 the uv filter dhhb also known commercially by the trivial name uvinul a plus is officially described as being outstandingly photostable basf personal care and nutrition gmbh 40789 monheim germany 2018 the purpose of this section of the work was to test that designation and ascertain the stability of the compound when exposed to artificial solar radiation and potentially determine some photo degradation by products if detected results of the present work have shown that dhhb concentration degraded less than 15 from the initial levels after 6 h of exposure to artificial solar radiation no kinetic degradation rate and half life period were determined consequentially since the compound did not degrade significantly or consistently the compound levels reached a sort of concentration plateau in the last 2 h of irradiation which may be a testament to its photo stability attributes considering these findings the degradation rate detected should be considered fairly negligible in the scope of the overall photo stability of the compound at every step of the study an analysis by hplc uv dad was always carried out in order to detect possible by products no peaks besides the one from the filter were ever detected by liquid chromatography hplc uv dad and lc dad ms therefore it must be concluded that this very small amount of degradation rate detected throughout the experiments is not significant enough to yield any measurable amounts of possible by products these results are for instance identical to those found by rodil rodil et al 2009 for filters such as 4 methylbenzylidene camphor mbc benzophenone 3 bp3 or octocrylene oc which were also studied in similar parameters and displayed considerable photo stability throughout the experiments parallel to the chromatographic analysis a spectroscopic study was also carried out in order to measure the potential alterations in the uv absorption capacity of dhhb fig 7 presents the comparison between the uv absorption spectra of dhhb before and after artificial irradiation results indicate that there is a very slight decrease in the absorption capacity of the irradiated solution more thoroughly though using maier s concept of spectral photo inactivation maier et al 2001 it is possible to conclude that the absorption capacity decay was merely 14 98 these results demonstrate that dhhb does display remarkable photo stable characteristics when exposed towards artificial solar radiation despite the fact that the dhhb aqueous solutions were able to remain photo stable throughout artificial irradiation there was one photo exposure effect often observed in photo degradation studies huong et al 2007 huong et al 2008 a main absorption wavelength shift of 15 98 nm in this case from the conventional 361 99 nm prior to irradiation towards 377 97 nm after the process in the global scope of the uv absorption features of dhhb the wavelength shift and absorption capacity decrease might be considered minor and therefore negligible regarding the uv protective character of the filter 4 conclusions dhhb proved to be extremely reactive towards active chlorine and in drinking water disinfection conditions the half life period of the compound was quite low namely 116 3 s and the observed first order rate constant was determined to be 0 0060 0 0002 s 1 the degradation reaction yielded mono cl dhhb and dichlorinated cl2 dhhb non volatile dbps of the parental structure successfully determined by ms analysis as far as external factors on degradation ph and free chlorine levels proved to be the most influential variables either in the presence or absence of dom in solution degradation rates of dhhb were found at higher levels of active chlorine in solution and slightly more acidic ph additionally it was found that the non volatile chlorinated by products seemed to prevail in the opposite conditions which points to their instability and subsequent degradation at higher concentrations of chlorine and lower ph regarding artificial photo stability dhhb proved to be extremely stable to degradation as it is actually commercially described and promoted degradation rates observed were considered to be negligible around 15 in 6 h of exposure to artificial solar radiation and no by products were ever detected in the reaction chromatograms

1456,high performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultra violet diode array detection hplc uv dad was used to study the degradation reactions of ultraviolet uv filter hexyl 2 4 diethylamino 2 hydroxybenzoyl benzoate dhhb degradation by products were detected and identified by means of liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and mass spectrometry lc dad ms environmentally relevant characteristics such as water ph chlorine levels water temperature and dissolved organic matter dom concentration were modulated and studied in order to determine their influence on the degradation reactions results show that dhhb degrades quite rapidly in typical drinking water disinfection conditions displaying a kinetic rate constant of k obs 0 0060 0 0002 s 1 and a half life period of merely t 1 2 116 4 s as far as the non volatile disinfection by products dbps are concerned only the mono and dichlorinated forms of dhhb were detected in the degradation reactions regarding influential variables on dhhb degradation the presence or absence of dom in solution did not alter the trends that were found degradation of dhhb is more significant at lower ph values and higher levels of active chlorine in solution chlorinated dbps have also been found to predominate under higher ph values and lower levels of chlorine whereas they were found to be unstable and further degradable quite likely into smaller and more volatile compounds when in lower ph and higher chlorine concentrations as for the photo degradation studies dhhb was found to be extremely photo stable with only about 15 degradation rate detected during artificial irradiation periods of 6 h keywords uv filters dhhb uvinul a plus disinfection by products 1 introduction protection from ultraviolet uv radiation is the paramount function of uv filters uva or uvb absorbent compounds that constitute the backbone of sunscreen products and other cosmetics chisvert and salvador 2018 shaath 2010 there is currently a vast number of compounds regulated and applied by pharmaceutical companies worldwide in addition to this protective character these compounds are known to incorporate into the superficial water bodies where they display significant persistence as well as potentially concerning eco toxicological profiles chisvert and salvador 2018 shaath 2010 giokas et al 2007 dÃ­az cruz and barcelÃ³ 2009 despite their potential environmental concerns insight into the fate and behaviour of these compounds is shallow and somewhat ambiguous given the reduced number of studied focused on the topic giokas et al 2007 dÃ­az cruz et al 2008 la farrÃ© et al 2008 furthermore besides being persistent and accumulative in the aquatic environment these compounds are also reported to degrade and lead to the formation of degradation by products with toxicological profiles potentially more troublesome that those of the parental compounds dÃ­az cruz and barcelÃ³ 2009 dÃ­az cruz et al 2008 la farrÃ© et al 2008 santos et al 2012 therefore it is important to study the reactivity of as many uv filters as possible in order to understand their environmental impact and how to properly mitigate or eliminate it unfortunately of all the dozens of existing filters there are only a few studies conducted on this topic covering merely a handful of compounds 2 ethylhexyl 4 dimethylamino benzoate

negreira et al 2012 benzophenone 3 bp3 and benzophenone 8 bp8 duirk et al 2013 the present work has the goal of investigating the degradation reactions of dhhb in aqueous solution either induced by active chlorine or by artificial solar radiation experimental conditions will resemble as much as possible superficial municipal water bodies such as municipal drinking water or swimming pool water the molecular structure of dhhb is provided in fig 1 whilst its physical chemical properties are included in table 1 more objectively this work will provide the degradation kinetics for both photo induced and disinfection induced degradation reactions with the help of high performance liquid chromatography associated with ultraviolet diode array detection hplc uv dad the most prominent disinfection by products will be identified with proper molecular structure elucidation with the help of liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and mass spectrometry lc dad ms the uv absorption ability of the compound will be assessed after exposed to artificial solar radiation by means of a uv vis spectrophotometer finally with the help of an experimental design formulation the modulation of specific environmentally relevant factors will evaluate their influence on the degradation reactions and corresponding degradation rates 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents the main

standard ich guidelines international conference on harmonization of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use ich 1994 1996 namely based on accuracy precision repeatability linearity and detection limit calibration was carried out by analysing 9 standard solutions between the range 0 02500 mg l 6 290 10 8 mol l and 25 00 mg l 6 300 10 5 mol l three trials were prepared and done for each solution calibration curves were all perfectly linear throughout the calibration range and correlation coefficients r2 were all determined to be higher than 0 998 leading to a detection limit of 1 36 Î¼g l 2 3 disinfection induced degradation 2 3 1 reaction kinetics experiments were conducted at neutral ph room temperature in the dark and under constant stirring first a stock solution of dhhb was prepared by dissolving 25 mg of standard compound in 100 00 ml of absolute ethanol final concentration 250 00 mg l or 6 289 10 4 mol l all experiments were prepared by using this stock solution as the source of dhhb the experimental reactors were 250 ml ordinary borosilicate glass vessels containing 1 000 mg l 2 516 10 6 mol l of dhhb and 5 002 mg l 6 716 10 5 mol l of naocl in 100 ml of deionized water this way active chlorine level variation would be considered theoretically negligible along with time an initial aliquot of the solution containing solely dhhb was always analysed by direct injection in the hplc uv dad system providing a record of the initial chromatographic conditions active chlorine naocl was included in the mixture the ph ph 6 4 0 5 and water temperature t 20 7 0 1 c were recorded and monitored and the reaction timer initiated one aliquot of 1000 Î¼l was taken from the reaction mixture at every 20 s of reaction during a 4 min total reaction time frame residual active chlorine in solution was quenched with the addition of 10 Î¼l of a standard 65 g l ascorbic acid aa and the samples were immediately stored at 4 c until the moment of analysis by direct injection in the hplc uv dad system 2 3 2 identification of non volatile dbps for the determination of non volatile dbps the experimental conditions were as described in section 2 3 1 however the reaction was allowed to progress for 10 min and then entirely pre concentrated by spe using 6 ml 500 mg hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb cartridges from waters corporation milford ma the spe cartridges were always previously conditioned with 3 ml of methanol followed by 3 ml of deionized water pre concentration was achieved with the help of a peristaltic pump minipuls 2 from gilson inc middleton wi usa extraction of the compounds adsorbed in the cartridge was carried out with 3 ml of dichloromethane the organic solvent was then evaporated with a careful stream of nitrogen gas the final residue was diluted in 500 Î¼l of methanol and then analysed immediately by direct injection in the lc dad ms system 2 3 3 influence of external variables this part of the work was ensured by using an experimental design formulation approach and the subsequent statistical analysis anova of the results and its response surface calculations the process was enabled by the unscrambler v9 2 camo process as oslo norway software program the purpose of this section of the work was to investigate the significance that common external variables such as the ph water temperature active chlorine and dissolved organic matter dom levels have on the fate and behaviour of dhhb in aqueous solution with this goal in mind two box behnken designs were created one without dom in solution model a and another with dom in solution model b the details of the designs are presented in fig 2 additional information on the experimental conditions is presented in the supplementary material the experimental variables and corresponding general conditions were defined based on knowledge gathered from previous studies dÃ­az cruz et al 2008 sakkas et al 2003 negreira et al 2008 nakajima et al 2009 santos et al 2013 2 4 photo degradation studies the photo degradation experiments were carried out by artificial solar irradiation with the help of a total spectrum solar radiation simulator newport oriel 96 000 with a 150 w ozone free xenon lamp with air mass filters 1 5 global 81 094 and a liquid light guide whose tip was positioned about 1 cm above the surface of the reaction mixtures as in sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 reactions were performed in ordinary borosilicate glass beakers containing 100 ml of deionized water spiked with dhhb to generate a concentration of 1 000 mg l 2 516 10 6 mol l in parallel with the irradiated solutions another equivalent solution was always kept in the dark and ambient temperature also analysed at each step as a control irradiation experiments lasted for a total time frame of six hours with an aliquot of each solution irradiated and control being removed at each hour and analysed first in the uv vis spectrophotometer and then by direct injection in the hplc uv dad system 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection induced degradation 3 1 1 reaction kinetics typical oxidation reactions between organic or inorganic compounds and active chlorine in aqueous solution normally follow a total second order kinetic degradation profile first order for both the compound and chlorine as the literature presents deborde and von gunten 2008 as far as the reaction between dhhb and the total amount of active chlorine in solution naocl t hocl clo and considering the global second order kinetic profile dhhb aq naocl aq products aq which implies the following kinetic law v Î´ dhhb Î´t k app dhhb naocl t dhhb represents the concentration of the filter naocl t is the total concentration of the ph dependent active chlorine species in solution hypochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite anion clo and k app is the apparent global second order rate constant finally under pseudo first order conditions the aforementioned kinetic law can be simplified Î´ dhhb Î´t k obs dhhb the rate constant of which k obs represents the observed pseudo first order rate constant of the reaction k obs k app naocl t as far as the results are concerned fig 3 displays the exponential plot of dhhb levels as a function of reaction time and according to those results dhhb dhhb 0 1 068645e 0 005956t by linear regression it was possible to determine the observed pseudo first order rate constant k obs 0 0060 0 0002 s 1 and the half life period of the compound t 1 2 116 38 3 71 s the data confirms that dhhb is highly reactive in a context of exposure to active chlorine reaching half of its initial concentration slightly under two minutes and achieving a total of about 74 degradation rate at the end of the four minutes of reaction time the only existing study focused on dhhb was published in 2013 grboviÄ et al 2013 and it dealt solely with the mass spectrometry ms determination of by products without approaching the degradation reaction itself subsequently this work intended to fill that gap and investigate the experimental scenario by determining the compound s degradation profile when in contact with active chlorine as well as confirming the non volatile dbps originated in the process it is also important to underline once again that the purpose of the disinfection induced degradation study was to reflect and present an experimental scenario as close as possible to the one usually found in municipal waters namely in what regards the active chlorine concentrations in aqueous solution deborde and von gunten 2008 centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2020 zwiener et al 2007 since there are no other studies dealing with dhhb specifically its degradation reactions profile and kinetic features in exposure to active chlorine an analogue comparison might be more appropriate other works have presented similar studies albeit with different compounds such are the cases of emc and bdm studied by this same research group santos et al 2013 bp4 studied by negreira and collaborators negreira et al 2012 and bp3 and bp8 approached by duirk and colleagues duirk et al 2013 according to negreira negreira et al 2012 bp4 half life periods t 1 2 varied between 3 41 ph 6 3 and 0 45 ph 8 1 minutes in ultrapure water and between 5 25 ph 6 3 and 0 98 ph 8 1 minutes in ordinary municipal water this shows us that reactivity of bp4 seems to increase with the increase of ph which indicates higher reactivity of the filter with hypochlorite anion clo that predominates at alkaline conditions deborde and von gunten 2008 however in the context of municipal water disinfection such context is irrelevant since drinking water disinfection occurs at slightly acidic conditions due to the significantly more efficient role of hypochlorous acid hclo as a disinfecting agent and which predominates at acidic to neutral ph deborde and von gunten 2008 still at slightly acidic or neutral ph bp4 displays lower reactivity than dhhb whilst still being quite reactive itself as for duirk s results duirk et al 2013 the observed first order rate constants k obs obtained were all below one tenth of the value determined in this study for dhhb at ph 6 7 and around the same levels of active chlorine in solution which also indicates much lower reactivity than dhhb under drinking water disinfecting conditions as for the results obtained by this research group for emc and bdm the former presented a half life period of 73 min whilst the latter had a half life period of 119 min under similar experimental conditions both these compounds have proven to be much more stable towards disinfection induced degradation 3 1 2 identification of non volatile dbps the lc dad ms chromatogram displaying the determined mono and dichlorinated dbps of dhhb along with the parental compound and their respective ms spectra is provided in fig 4 additional information namely the proposed mechanisms and molecular structures of the identified dbps as well as all the mass spectra and fragmentations carried out for each compound are included in the supplementary material figs s1 s4 and s5 s11 respectively retention times and most prominent or abundant fragments are included in table 2 through the analysis of the data from table 2 it was possible to clearly identify two dbps of dhhb the mono and dichlorinated forms of the compound the peak at 9 17 min was already known to belong to the parental compound dhhb and the lc dad ms analysis confirmed it the ms analysis of the peak yielded the molecular ion 398 m z which is in accordance with the molecular mass of the filter see table s3 in the supplementary material fragmentation of this peak gave origin to the molecular ions 149 233 and 296 as the most abundant fragments the two remaining peaks were assumed to be potential dbps of dhhb since in parallel to their significance and intensity in the chromatogram their area always varied as a function of variable dhhb or naocl concentrations in solution throughout the studies the peak at retention time 4 92 min exhibited a molecular ion of 466 consistent with the molecular mass of the dichlorinated form of dhhb the fragmentation of this peak led to the molecular ions 149 233 and 364 as the most predominant as far as the peak at retention time 13 37 min it displayed the molecular ion 432 consistent with the molecular mass of the mono chlorinated form of dhhb its fragmentation yielded the ions 330 302 and 348 fig 5 presents the uv absorption spectra of dhhb and both the identified dbps for comparison regarding the dichlorinated dbp as fig 5 shows its uv absorption spectrum is considerably different from the remaining two compounds which were able to retain a somewhat similar uv absorption profile since its absorption band shifts towards 260 nm and with an absorption capacity below 40 of that originally displayed by dhhb grboviÄ reported two apparently different monochlorinated species of dhhb which were not found in this study in any of the experimental scenarios applied the author also did not report the uv absorption spectra of the dichlorinated dbp so we cannot comment of possible differences or similarities according to the literature deborde and von gunten 2008 active chlorine will most likely attack aromatic rings by electrophilic substitution on the benzenic ring particularly in ortho or para positions to important functional groups such the hydroxyl and the tertiary amine groups present in one of dhhb s rings such functional groups are known as ortho and para directors or activators subsequently given the strong ortho and para activating role of the oh and nr2 groups the chlorination reaction of dhhb will most likely result in the successive electrophilic substitution of chlorine into sites 1 ortho position and 2 para position marked in red on fig 6 considering the literature deborde and von gunten 2008 most noteworthy in this case the fact that the electrophilic substitution of chlorine into the ortho position towards the hydroxyl group displays a rate constant 4 times higher than the one reported for the substitution in para position it is safe to assume that the only monochlorinated dbp determined in this work peak at 13 37 min in fig 4 will most likely be the ortho monochlorinated dhhb presented in fig 6 the dichlorinated form of dhhb peak at 4 92 min in fig 4 and structure presented in fig 6 would have been originated from the successive substitution of chlorine into the para position of the already ortho monochlorinated dhhb 3 1 3 influence of external variables detailed information about the analysis of variance anova made on the experimental results is presented in the supplementary material see tables s3 s6 two non design variables were measured or studied the chlorination and effective degradation percentages in order to ascertain the correct effect of the design variables the designs for the chlorination and effective degradation percentages from model a and b are all statistically valid and significant as the analysis presented in section 2 of the supplementary material clearly indicates and details data indicates that it is mostly the ph that influences chlorination and effective degradation in model a with chlorine concentration right below it as for the water temperature it has proven to be not very significant in both chlorination and effective degradation of dhhb figs s12 s15 of the supplementary material show the response surfaces obtained for chlorination and effective degradation respectively by combining the two most significant variables ph and naocl concentration the analysis of fig s12 shows that the highest concentration of non volatile chlorinated by products was found at higher levels of ph and lower levels of active chlorine in solution whilst the lowest amount of those compounds was found at the highest concentration of chlorine and lowest ph values as far as the loss in dhhb concentration see fig s13 the trend is exactly the opposite that is degradation of the compound is achieved at higher levels of chlorine and at lower ph levels nakajima nakajima et al 2009 also reported that the degradation rates of the uv filter 2 ethylhexyl 4 methoxycinnamate emc increased with the decrease in ph our research group also obtained and reported similar findings for emc and yet another uv filter 4 tert butyl 4 methoxydibenzoylmethane bdm santos et al 2013 according to the ph dependence of the hypochlorous acid hypochlorite anion hocl clo equilibrium pka 7 54 at 25 c deborde and von gunten 2008 the hypochlorite anion clearly predominates at higher levels of ph namely at ph 7 5 whereas hypochlorous acid which predominates between 4 ph 7 5 esteves da silva et al 1996 deborde and von gunten 2008 is usually defined as the most efficient chlorine disinfecting agent deborde and von gunten 2008 the results of this study seem to point to a significant and sequential degradation of the non volatile chlorinated by products into smaller and more volatile molecules undetected in the lc dad ms analysis this may explain why the highest concentration of non volatile dbps is found at higher ph and lower concentrations of active chlorine at higher ph values hypochlorite anion which is considered a low efficiency disinfecting agent clearly predominates and together with lower levels of active chlorine in solution seems to lead to a decrease in the degradation rate of the non volatile dbps additionally detection of higher levels of chlorinated dbps at higher ph values also points to reactions of the ionized form of dhhb with hypochlorite anion suggesting that the ionized form of the parental compound may in fact predominate in solution the effective degradation of dhhb that is the detected or accounted total loss of dhhb concentration presented in fig s13 points to those same conclusions degradation of dhhb is indeed found to be much more significant at higher levels of active chlorine in solution and lower ph values conditions where the more efficient hypochlorous acid predominates the bottom line is chlorination of organic compounds is precisely what leads to their degradation so following the variation in concentration of dbps and the establishment of fig s12 for analysis was relevant to identify what seems to be the cause of the instability of these non volatile by products and the inherent increase in their degradation rates at higher levels of active chlorine and higher ph values in model b another design variable dom was included in order to ascertain the effect of ordinary dissolved organic matter commonly found in natural and artificial water environments as was the case with model a data shows that ph is the most influential variable in the chlorination and effective degradation of dhhb in model b dom is known to actively compete with any synthetic organic compounds in solution for the available free active chlorine subsequently it was expected that the chlorination rate and the effective loss in parental compound would decrease with the increase of dom levels in solution however results didn t show a compelling mitigation of degradation rates quite possibly due to the highly reactive nature of dhhb towards free available chlorine figs s14 s15 in the supplementary material display the response surfaces for the chlorination and effective degradation of dhhb respectively by combining the ph and naocl concentration analysis of figs s14 s15 show the same trend as in model a that is degradation of dhhb is more significant at higher levels of chlorine in solution and lower levels of ph 3 2 photo degradation studies as mentioned in section 1 merely one study sakkas et al 2003 focused simultaneously on the disinfection induced and photo induced degradation of uv filters in light of that fact it was the goal of the present work to address those two degradation contexts additionally it is also worth to mention that photo induced degradation of certain uv filters has been the specific focus of several studies rodil et al 2009 maier et al 2001 huong et al 2007 huong et al 2008 the uv filter dhhb also known commercially by the trivial name uvinul a plus is officially described as being outstandingly photostable basf personal care and nutrition gmbh 40789 monheim germany 2018 the purpose of this section of the work was to test that designation and ascertain the stability of the compound when exposed to artificial solar radiation and potentially determine some photo degradation by products if detected results of the present work have shown that dhhb concentration degraded less than 15 from the initial levels after 6 h of exposure to artificial solar radiation no kinetic degradation rate and half life period were determined consequentially since the compound did not degrade significantly or consistently the compound levels reached a sort of concentration plateau in the last 2 h of irradiation which may be a testament to its photo stability attributes considering these findings the degradation rate detected should be considered fairly negligible in the scope of the overall photo stability of the compound at every step of the study an analysis by hplc uv dad was always carried out in order to detect possible by products no peaks besides the one from the filter were ever detected by liquid chromatography hplc uv dad and lc dad ms therefore it must be concluded that this very small amount of degradation rate detected throughout the experiments is not significant enough to yield any measurable amounts of possible by products these results are for instance identical to those found by rodil rodil et al 2009 for filters such as 4 methylbenzylidene camphor mbc benzophenone 3 bp3 or octocrylene oc which were also studied in similar parameters and displayed considerable photo stability throughout the experiments parallel to the chromatographic analysis a spectroscopic study was also carried out in order to measure the potential alterations in the uv absorption capacity of dhhb fig 7 presents the comparison between the uv absorption spectra of dhhb before and after artificial irradiation results indicate that there is a very slight decrease in the absorption capacity of the irradiated solution more thoroughly though using maier s concept of spectral photo inactivation maier et al 2001 it is possible to conclude that the absorption capacity decay was merely 14 98 these results demonstrate that dhhb does display remarkable photo stable characteristics when exposed towards artificial solar radiation despite the fact that the dhhb aqueous solutions were able to remain photo stable throughout artificial irradiation there was one photo exposure effect often observed in photo degradation studies huong et al 2007 huong et al 2008 a main absorption wavelength shift of 15 98 nm in this case from the conventional 361 99 nm prior to irradiation towards 377 97 nm after the process in the global scope of the uv absorption features of dhhb the wavelength shift and absorption capacity decrease might be considered minor and therefore negligible regarding the uv protective character of the filter 4 conclusions dhhb proved to be extremely reactive towards active chlorine and in drinking water disinfection conditions the half life period of the compound was quite low namely 116 3 s and the observed first order rate constant was determined to be 0 0060 0 0002 s 1 the degradation reaction yielded mono cl dhhb and dichlorinated cl2 dhhb non volatile dbps of the parental structure successfully determined by ms analysis as far as external factors on degradation ph and free chlorine levels proved to be the most influential variables either in the presence or absence of dom in solution degradation rates of dhhb were found at higher levels of active chlorine in solution and slightly more acidic ph additionally it was found that the non volatile chlorinated by products seemed to prevail in the opposite conditions which points to their instability and subsequent degradation at higher concentrations of chlorine and lower ph regarding artificial photo stability dhhb proved to be extremely stable to degradation as it is actually commercially described and promoted degradation rates observed were considered to be negligible around 15 in 6 h of exposure to artificial solar radiation and no by products were ever detected in the reaction chromatograms spectroscopic data suggest that there is a slight decrease in the overall absorption capacity of the filter authorship statement the author declares that all persons who meet authorship criteria are

volume while increases the transition zone width compared to the homogeneous modeling is associated with huge amounts of uncertainty proportional to the aquifer heterogeneity itself and 6 the results show that the impact of heterogeneity on the swi indicators is similar under different recharge rates keywords coastal aquifer heterogeneity monte carlo simulation sea level rise bayesian frameworka 1 introduction the management of freshwater resources is a crucial issue due to the increasing water demand caused by population growth groundwater in coastal aquifers is one of the major freshwater resources providing water for different uses such as domestic industrial and agricultural consumption and other socio economic activities siebert et al 2010 fresh groundwater in coastal aquifers is impacted by seawater intrusion swi werner et al 2013 sea level rise slr and variations in recharge due to climate change impacts are challenges for coastal groundwater resources management ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b 2015c besides the scarcity of freshwater resources water quality demands special attention because of swi seawater may invade coastal pumping wells mazi et al 2016 mixing of fresh groundwater with seawater and its salinization are a major issue for water legislators in the countries relying on coastal groundwater resources higher salinization of groundwater resources makes fresh groundwater unusable for the proposed uses ahmed 2017 swi has been the focus of many studies accurate quantification of swi is a difficult not to say impossible task in many cases the hardship for the quantification is related to the non linear nature of flow systems and the heterogeneity of the properties of the porous media although many other factors exist that affect the quantification of swi ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 many researchers have focused on heterogeneity effect on swi in the last few years the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity magnifies the vertical mixing and the dispersion of the plume s front werner et al 2013 pool et al 2015 mehdizadeh et al 2020 table 1 provides a summary of recent studies on heterogeneity issues in porous media based on their purpose and modeling methods as it is mentioned in table 1 both conceptual e g simmons et al 2001 abarca et al 2007a kerrou and renard 2010 pool et al 2015 mahmoodzadeh and

heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field has been a common approach to investigating the heterogeneities of aquifers li et al 2015 as seen in table 1 most of the previous works have used a log normal distribution for generating random hydraulic conductivity fields e g abarca et al 2007a held et al 2005 prieto et al 2006 kerrou and renard 2010 pool et al 2015 the main reason for this choice is that log normal distribution generates a large variation in the hydraulic conductivity field consistent with the field observations spherical and exponential correlation functions have both been used for modeling the spatial correlation while spatial correlation was ignored in some previous works e g rajabi and ketabchi 2017 table 1 shows that the effect of dispersion was analyzed in previous studies e g held et al 2005 abarca et al 2007a kerrou and renard 2010 while it was ignored in some others e g rajabi and ketabchi 2017 mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 ketabchi and jahangir 2019 showed that considering the heterogeneity of the aquifer has a substantial impact on the effective dispersivity in the case of swi overshoot the length of the swi wedge and the transition zone width in heterogeneous aquifers are known indicators which were used in the literature to quantify the heterogeneity impacts on swi abarca 2006 illustrated that considering heterogeneity results in the seaward movement of the swi wedge and also a broader mixing zone in the 2d aquifer yang et al 2015a 2015b used 2d and 3d numerical simulations for modeling 1 m slr impact on swi in a heterogeneous aquifer respectively they demonstrated that the seawater interface moved landward in both 2d and 3d simulations kerrou and renard 2010 showed the significance of the degree of heterogeneity on the seawater interface location their results indicated that the interface moves towards the land in the 3d models while it moves towards the sea in the 2d models one subject that mostly was neglected in the previous studies is distinguishing between the effect of different parameters of the model creating heterogeneity spatial correlation variance and etc on swi status pool et al 2015 explored the effect of heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field combined with tidal oscillations on the 3d dynamics of swi they used monte carlo realizations of log normally distributed hydraulic conductivity fields and for each realization characterized mixing by the spatial moments of concentration using numerical variable density flow and solute transport simulations their study confirmed the findings of kerrou and renard 2010 showing that as the degree of the heterogeneity increases the combined effect of tidal oscillation and the aquifer heterogeneity decreases they showed that aquifer heterogeneity causes the swi wedge to move inland and results in a significantly larger transition zone in 3d model similarly houben et al 2018 highlighted the significance of the model dimensionality in the evaluation of heterogeneous aquifers their results contradicted the displacement of the seawater towards the sea predicted by abarca 2006 and michael et al 2016 mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 quantified the combined impacts of fully geological heterogeneity and coastal flooding events due to storm surge and slr on swi in a 2d unconfined coastal aquifer and highlighted the importance of such impacts in coastal aquifers ketabchi et al 2016a provided a systematic summary of studies related to slr induced swi based on the modeling methods and the processes used in the past two decades significant research efforts were devoted to investigating the impacts of slr and recharge rate variations on swi but none of the previous works considered the effects of slr with the aquifer heterogeneity on swi recently ketabchi and jahangir 2019 investigated such effects on the swi overshoot caused by slr in the literature usually a simplified assumption of an instantaneous slr is considered e g sherif and singh 1999 werner and simmons 2009 watson et al 2010 morgan et al 2013 stigter et al 2014 koussis et al 2015 ketabchi et al 2016a 2016b by assuming an instantaneous slr swi is supposed to occur more rapidly because the entire slr is applied at the start of the simulation period although assuming a gradual slr leads to a more realistic inspection of the problem watson et al 2010 ipcc 2013 few works have examined both instantaneous and gradual slr impacts on swi e g chang et al 2011 morgan et al 2015 mehdizadeh et al 2017 mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 the researchers in the previous studies used different rates of slr morgan et al 2015 considered a rate of 0 01 m year which is consistent with the ipcc 2013 projection for the period 2000 2100 luoma and okkonen 2014 used a rate of 0 09 0 51 m year for different simulation types the gradual slr rate consideration is mostly influenced by the simulation period based on the previous studies the type of slr has a considerable impact on swi characteristics and therefore should not be neglected in investigating swi previous works have mostly used rectangular shapes for modeling their aquifer pool et al 2015 michael et al 2013 2016 however there are examples that irregular domains have also been evaluated e g abarca et al 2007b yechieli et al 2010 yang et al 2015a 2015b the significant impact of aquifer geometry on slr induced responses was well documented in previous studies as depicted by yechieli et al 2010 the modeling boundary profoundly affects the results their work proved that slr impact on swi depends on the coastal topography near the coastline they also demonstrated that considering a boundary slope of 2 5 leads to 400 m landward shift of the seawater interface more examples of studies related to unconfined aquifers with inclined bed boundaries can be found in abarca et al 2007b mazi et al 2014 and ketabchi et al 2016a in addition to the bed slope of the aquifer the irregularity can be initiated from the land surface slope of the aquifer modeling the topographic slopes as a constant surface slope was a common assumption e g abarca et al 2007b koussis et al 2012 2015 in such studies the heterogeneity effect in the hydraulic conductivity field and irregularity of the domain were not considered land surface inundation caused by slr due to topographic slope is a factor affecting swi several studies have considered this impact e g kooi et al 2000 loaiciga et al 2012 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 sefelnasr and sherif 2013 ketabchi et al 2014 the obtained results demonstrated that land surface inundation caused by slr has a considerable impact on the increase of the length of the swi wedge in the flatter coasts table 1 demonstrates that none of the previous works have considered the combined effect of land surface inundation and slr both instantaneous and gradual slr with the aquifer heterogeneity on swi although the heterogeneity was modeled as layers in the previous research e g dagan and zeitoun 1998 dose et al 2014 mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 houben et al 2018 yu and michael 2019 karamouz et al 2020 incorporating the heterogeneity in the spatial field of hydraulic conductivity will result in a more robust evaluation the main objective of this study is to introduce a probabilistic approach and to apply a bayesian framework for investigating heterogeneity effects in hydraulic conductivity field on swi in 2d aquifers in response to slr and variations in recharge rate previous studies results confirm that swi is heavily influenced by the domain and network geometry model dimensionality degree of heterogeneity and the model setup boundary conditions although in the past some studies considered the effect of heterogeneity on swi to the knowledge of the authors this is the first study that considers slr and land surface inundation simultaneously in a heterogeneous unconfined aquifer for the evaluation of swi here 72 scenarios are defined with 50 random hydraulic conductivity fields generated for each scenario next monte carlo simulation is used six swi indicators are identified and analyzed to illustrate the swi effects by two different approaches namely ensemble of the indicators pool et al 2015 and predictive distribution mean evaluation bayesian framework the knowledge about the swi indicators is updated after each simulation using a bayesian updating framework regarding the initial distribution of the principal swi indicators the predictive distribution of these indicators is derived the derived probability distribution encompasses the uncertainty within the parameters jahangir and moghim 2019 and can be used as a tool for aquifer management and further risk analysis 2 materials and tools 2 1 problem setup the aquifer geometry fig 1 and the proposed properties are adopted from ketabchi et al 2016a the case used in this study is a benchmark example previously used by chang et al 2011 ketabchi et al 2016a mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 and ketabchi and jahangir 2019 although the case is hypothetical the original values used for modeling are real and associated with pioneer valley australia chang et al 2011 the problem consists of a 2d unconfined aquifer with the length of 1000 m aquifer thickness of 30 to 35 m mean sea level of 30 m and a constant land surface slope of 0 5 the regional freshwater flux is constant and set to 0 15 m2 day this flux is applied to the right boundary fig 1 also a constant recharge rate of 18 25 mm year freshwater is applied at the top boundary the seaward boundary is seawater hydraulic pressure with a specified salinity when land surface inundation is included the first 200 m of the top boundary can be subjected to seawater hydraulic pressure from the seaward boundary considering the height of slr the lower boundary is impervious all the modeling parameters for the aquifer are listed in table 2 four types of scenarios are considered to assess the problem in this case 1 gradual slr with land surface inundation gslr lsi 2 gradual slr without land surface inundation gslr no lsi 3 instantaneous slr with land surface inundation islr lsi and 4 instantaneous slr without land surface inundation islr no lsi the gradual slr rate is set to 0 01 m year in the instantaneous slr scenarios a simplification assumption of 1 m instantaneous slr was used at the start of the simulation period a constant rate of 0 01 m year for the gradual slr will result in the same slr as the assumed 1 m instantaneous slr after 100 years simulation period ipcc 2013 the associated land surface inundation due to slr is considered in lsi scenarios while it is ignored in no lsi scenarios land surface inundation is considered in the model by addressing a shift in the position of the coastline instigated by the height of slr the coastline shift towards the land is equal to slr divided by the land surface slope ketabchi et al 2014 also based on the predictions of ipcc 2013 and putnam and broecker 2017 mean precipitation and consequently top recharge rate and regional freshwater flux could differ by up to 50 a 50 increase in the regional freshwater flux and the top recharge rate i e w 27 375 mm year and q b 0 225 m2 day is assumed for the wetter scenarios while the drier scenarios are considered by decreasing rate of 50 w 9 125 mm year and q b 0 075 m2 day to investigate the effect of heterogeneity combined with slr on swi for each type of the defined scenarios 50 sets of log normally distributed hydraulic conductivity fields are generated using gcosim3d gomez hernandez and journel 1992 a spherical correlation function is used and the geometric mean expected value of the hydraulic conductivity field is set to 10 m day equal to the hydraulic conductivity of the homogeneous cases similar to ketabchi and jahangir 2019 we assume three sets of variances Ï lnk 2 of 0 5 1 and 2 for the hydraulic conductivity to assess the conductivity variations of the media the degree of heterogeneity considering the correlated structure of geological materials directional correlation lengths Î» x and Î» y are considered anisotropic Î» x Î» y Î» x represents the correlation length in the horizontal direction parallel to the sediment stratification while Î» y is the correlation length in the vertical direction directional correlation lengths determine the media heterogeneity scale and mostly control the degree of statistical anisotropy statistical anisotropy has an impact on the effective hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer which is also affected by the variance of hydraulic conductivity field abarca et al 2007b pool et al 2015 in the present work Î» y 5 m and Î» x 20 m and 40 m are assumed ketabchi and jahangir 2019 therefore six different combinations for the hydraulic conductivity field variance and longitudinal correlation length values three variances and two correlation lengths are tested for four scenarios of gslr lsi gslr no lsi islr lsi and islr no lsi under three settings of recharge rate variations base wetter and drier conditions 72 scenarios in total these scenarios are executed for 50 sets of log normally distributed hydraulic conductivity fields making the total number of the experiments equal to 3600 while each simulation approximately needs nearly 35 to 50 h to complete 2 2 limitations we have assessed our scenarios using the presented case here this case has a single flow configuration characterized by the ratio of convection due to density differences between freshwater and seawater to advection due to the imposed regional freshwater flux and recharge rate while methodologically such assessments could be extended to other geometries and properties different characteristics of convection vs advection it is noted that the findings based on the present case in this study may not hold in other cases also in all scenarios the values of effective porosity and dispersivities are constant although the correlation among hydraulic conductivity effective porosity and dispersivities is partial and complex the heterogeneity of effective porosity and dispersivities reflection is ignored in this study similar to kerrou and renard 2010 and pool et al 2015 2 3 numerical modeling all of the simulations were performed by sutra voss and provost 2010 finite element mesh and boundary conditions are adopted from ketabchi et al 2016a the domain is discretized to 38 544 finite quadrilateral elements 39 071 nodes top and seaward boundaries have a steeper change of hydraulic heads and salinity concentrations therefore horizontal and vertical mesh size change from 1 m to 4 m and 0 15 m to 0 57 m respectively the mesh is more refined near the top and seaward areas the values of correlation lengths and the mesh sizes should be consistent to ensure that the ratio of the correlation lengths to the largest mesh size in each direction is kept larger than five such values guarantee the accuracy of heterogeneity based assessments and control the load of computations pool et al 2015 as mentioned by ketabchi et al 2016a grid convergence was also checked for the mesh size while various finer and coarser discretization schemes in the range of 9636 618 809 nodes were tested also the grid peclet number as the spatial stability criterion was evaluated and it was deduced that the discretization results in a grid peclet number smaller than four voss and provost 2010 more details regarding the mesh dependency analyses are available in ketabchi et al 2016a the initial condition for each simulation in this study is set based on the simulation that is long enough to reach equilibrium under no slr condition a period of 100 years is selected for all simulations as previously used by ketabchi et al 2016a an initial time step of 500 s is selected this initial value is increased by a time step multiplier of 1 2 in a cycle of 10 time steps until it reaches a time step of 90 h the time step selected guarantees the courant number to be less than 0 75 ketabchi et al 2016a the geometry of the model domain its boundaries and an example set of random hydraulic conductivity fields generated are shown in fig 1 2 4 assessment method we use three quantities previously used by pool et al 2015 as our principal swi indicators to assess the heterogeneity effect on swi also to quantify the relative change in each type of the scenarios two ancillary swi indicators are defined these five swi indicators are calculated at the end of the simulation period i e year 100 to assess the temporal salinity mixing behavior along the swi under different heterogeneity conditions the sixth indicator is considered 2 4 1 description of swi indicators 1 the first swi indicator is length of the swi wedge x s which indicates the location that 50 salinity contour lines intersect with the bottom boundary salinity contours can be derived from the following equation 1 f p x y x y c x y p 0 where p is the salinity ratio f 0 5 is the 50 contour line and c x y p is given respectively by 2 c x y p c x y pc s with c x y the salt mass concentration kg m 3 at coordinates x and y and c s is the seawater concentration the length of the swi wedge can be defined as 3 x s f 0 5 x 0 x c x 0 0 5 0 2 the second descriptor is the weighted average transition zone width wat wat is given by 4 wat f 0 1 f 0 9 da b wat where b wat is the averaged thickness of the aquifer in the transition zone and f 0 1 and f 0 9 are 10 and 90 salinity contours the transition zone is defined as the distance between 10 and 90 salinity levels pool et al 2015 3 the third swi indicator is the seawater volume v s v s is the salinized volume bounded by the seaward boundary and 50 salinity contour and is defined as 5 v s f 0 5 da 4 based on the three principal swi indicators for each type of the scenarios e g gslr lsi gslr no lsi islr lsi and islr no lsi the difference between the maximum and minimum of the obtained indicators is defined as r it represents the absolute change of the variables of interest each indicator as the variability of the proposed quantity according to three hydraulic conductivity fields and two correlation lengths six variables in total given by v k k 1 2 and 6 r for each of three principal swi indicators and for both ensemble and probabilistic approach see section 2 4 2 is given by 6 r max v k min v k 5 the relative change r is defined as the value of r divided by the indicator average value avg v k 7 r r avg v k 6 the sixth swi indicator computed in this study is the effective longitudinal dispersion d e which is often used to quantify the salinity mixing in heterogeneous media effective longitudinal dispersion is the temporal variation rate of the effective spatial variance of the salinity distribution Ï s 2 normalized by regional flux rate q b aquifer thickness b and wat under no slr conditions tiedeman and hsieh 2004 pool et al 2015 8 d e bd Ï s 2 dt 2 q b wat no slr 2 4 2 the ensemble and the probability distribution of the swi indicators two different approaches are used to evaluate the heterogeneity effect combined with the slr type and the land surface inundation assumption for calculating the ensemble of the variables in each scenario first we create 50 sets of log normally distributed hydraulic conductivity fields then we use each realization as an input for the model and compute the concentration in the aquifer calculating each of the indicators based on the average of the calculated concentrations will result in the ensemble variables in addition to ensemble analysis swi indicators are evaluated through bayesian modeling to derive the probability distribution of the indicators a hierarchical bayesian framework is used by assuming that each of the variables is normally distributed and both the mean and the precision inverse of the variance are unknown the probability density function of the variables are updated by each new simulation of the sutra model using python scripts through bayes updating formula appendix a a joint probability distribution is considered for mean and precision conjugate priors are used to derive the predictive distribution in closed form the bayesian framework for deriving the distribution of the indicators is referred to as maximum a posteriori and is one the favored parametric methods for distribution fitting parameter estimation in machine learning and pattern recognition bishop 2006 in the previous studies of pool et al 2015 and mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 only the mean of the variables of interest were reported which does not capture the stochastic behavior of swi in heterogeneous aquifers raised from the limited number of simulations and also the intrinsic uncertainty within the indicators in the present research the mean and the probability density function of the variables are both calculated and used for comparing the scenarios results and also uncertainty analysis the details of the two abovementioned approaches for calculating the ensemble and the probability distribution of the variables are provided in appendix a 2 4 3 uncertainty assessment in the present study a hierarchical bayesian method is applied to derive the probability distribution of the indicators for deriving the probability distributions in closed form and also avoiding extra computational load conjugate priors are used because of the computational load of the simulations 50 samples are available for updating the distributions in each scenario configuration to evaluate the accuracy of the obtained mean values numerical bootstrapping with 2500 samples is also applied and the 90 confidence interval of the mean is compared to the distribution of the mean should not be mistaken for predictive distribution see appendix a eq a6 obtained through the bayesian updating one of the benefits of deriving the probability distributions of the indicators instead of only using the point estimates such as mean is that reliability analysis der kiureghian 2005 could be conducted in reliability analysis a failure function should be defined which indicates all the possible failure states of a system the failure function in this study is stated as follows 9 f 3 x s x s hom v s v s hom wat wat hom where x s hom v s hom and wat hom are swi wedge length seawater volume and the weighted average transition zone width for the homogenous cases respectively the function f obtains a negative value if a more extreme state is observed relative to the homogeneous state the probability of observing a negative value for f is called failure probability p f obtaining p f is of great importance for coastal management as it could be leveraged for risk analysis where risk in its most traditional form is defined as p f cost the variables used in the failure function namely x s v s and wat are all random variables with distributions obtained via the introduced bayesian framework these random variables are also correlated to each other in order to evaluate p f monte carlo sampling is conducted where first the joint probability distribution of x s v s and wat is obtained and random samples are taken from their joint probability distribution for approximating f and consequently p f is calculated reliability analysis is conducted for two case sets of Ï lnk 2 0 5 Î» x 20 and Ï lnk 2 2 Î» x 40 it is noted that varied failure functions results in dissimilar failure probabilities the objective of this research is to introduce and apply the bayesian based reliability analysis for assessment of stochastic swi problems the interested reader is directed to der kiureghian 2005 for more details regarding reliability analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 ensemble of indicators the values of all ensemble indicators are depicted in fig 2 these observations are interpreted using the associated behavior of the flow field in the aquifer and temporal behavior of hydraulic pressures in this field to re equilibrate after slr ketabchi and jahangir 2019 in scenarios with the land surface inundation assumption considering the instantaneous slr results in larger values for all the ensemble indicators x s wat v s compared to the scenarios assuming land surface inundation combined with gradual slr however generally in the no lsi scenarios the gradual slr assumption results in the larger ensemble indicators from fig 2 it can be understood that in the scenarios where the land surface inundation condition was used at a specific Î» x i e 20 m or 40 m increasing the Ï lnk 2 will decrease the ensemble values of the swi wedge length and the seawater volume x s and v s and increase the weighted transition zone width respectively wat on the other hand increasing the longitudinal correlation from 20 m to 40 m increases all the ensemble indicators it can be deduced from the obtained ensemble indicators fig 2 that the same behavior caused by altering the heterogeneity parameters is observed whether a land surface inundation is presumed or not however the impact of heterogeneity is influenced by land surface inundation based on the results fig 2 it can be understood that while land surface inundation produces much larger values for x s and v s it does not have a substantial effect on wat the reason is that x s and v s are mainly related to the 50 salinity contour and the associated distance from seaward boundary where the distance is directly related to lsi consideration for different scenarios r and r are listed in table 3 r shows the difference between maximum an minimum obtained values for each indicator all Î» x and Ï lnk 2 in each scenario whereas r indicates the relative change the r shows the variation of resulted ensemble amounts in each scenario hence the results indicate that heterogeneity alters the swi wedge length and the seawater volume more substantially when the land surface inundation condition is ignored while the opposite is observed for the transition zone width in other words changing the heterogeneity parameters resulted in more variation for swi wedge length and the seawater volume in scenarios without lsi consideration while a wider range of values were obtained for transition zone width in scenarios considering lsi through altering heterogeneity parameters values of the swi indicators in the homogeneous case associated with different slr types and land surface inundation conditions are listed in table 4 based on the values listed in table 4 and demonstrated in fig 2 x s and v s are smaller compared to the similar homogeneous cases conversely considering the heterogeneity increases the transition zone width maximum and minimum of all the ensemble indicators are illustrated in fig 3 maximum of the ensemble swi wedge length and the seawater volume x s and v s occur in islr lsi scenario Î» x 40 m and Ï lnk 2 0 5 fig 3a also the maximum of wat occurs in the gslr no lsi scenario Î» x 40 m and Ï lnk 2 2 fig 3b on the other hand the minimum of x s and v s are associated with the islr no lsi scenario Î» x 20 m and Ï lnk 2 2 as depicted in fig 3c also fig 3d illustrates the minimum of wat which is related to the gslr lsi scenario Î» x 20 m and Ï lnk 2 0 5 to investigate the effect of recharge rate variations the wetter and the drier conditions are considered and the obtained results of x s v s and wat are presented in fig 4 the whiskers indicate the drier upper bound and the wetter condition lower bound for each scenario respectively the results show the same general behavior of considered slr land surface inundation and heterogeneity conditions while the recharge rate has a considerable impact on the values of the indicators it is observed that recharge rate s impact is less significant on wat compared to the other main indicators as seen in fig 4c obtained wat range widens as the heterogeneity of the aquifer increases especially for the scenarios without the land surface inundation presumption in the absence of land surface inundation increasing the heterogeneity magnifies the effect of recharge rate variation the land surface inundation is a more controlling factor for the transitional zone width compared to the recharge rate variation the ensemble maximum d e values for the homogenous and the heterogeneous scenarios are determined over 100 years post slr simulation period and shown in fig 5 the maximum values of d e indicate the intensity of widening of the transition zone width as seen in fig 5 both slr type and heterogeneity properties lead to an accelerated changing of the transition zone smaller values of d e are observed while assuming gradual slr i e the rate of d e variations are sharper under the instantaneous slr scenarios faster seawater circulation occurred under instantaneous slr and consequently enhanced values of d e are observed also it can be seen that increasing the values of Ï lnk 2 and Î» x increases the ensemble maximum d e values in addition it is generally observed that as the values of Ï lnk 2 and Î» x is increased the maximum obtained d e exceeds the homogeneous values 3 2 bayesian swi evaluation considering eqs a1 to a9 appendix a the predictive distribution mean for x s v s and wat and each type of the scenarios are illustrated in fig 6 to better evaluate the results we will analyze and classify the results into 7 clusters land surface inundation slr type correlation length effect hydraulic conductivity field variance effect r and r compared with the homogeneous case and uncertainty analysis 3 2 1 assessment of land surface inundation consideration from fig 6 it can be understood that no matter what the longitudinal correlation length or the hydraulic conductivity field variance is chosen the land surface inundation assumption increases the predictive distribution mean Î¼ n of the swi wedge length and the seawater volume x s and v s which is aligned with the ensemble results section 3 1 in scenarios assuming gradual slr the land surface inundation condition causes a smaller wat in comparison with the scenarios without the land surface inundation condition however the scenarios in which instantaneous slr is assumed wat increased in some cases for which the land surface inundation condition is assumed e g Î» x 40 m and Ï lnk 2 0 5 fig 6c the maximum difference between the predictive distribution mean of the scenarios with the assumption of land surface inundation and without it for x s and v s are 260 5 m and 6856 5 m 3 respectively Î» x 40 m and Ï lnk 2 0 5 and Î» x 40 m and Ï lnk 2 0 5 respectively both scenarios are associated with the instantaneous slr scenario the maximum difference between Î¼ n of the transition zone width with and without the land surface inundation assumption is 36 9 m which is associated with the gradual slr scenario Î» x 40 m and Ï lnk 2 0 5 the land surface inundation presumption impact on the indicators values is more significant when the longitudinal correlation length is large and the hydraulic conductivity field variance is small 3 2 2 assessment of slr type consideration in all presumed Ï lnk 2 and Î» x values when land surface inundation is applied instantaneous slr increases all the swi indicators conversely the no land surface inundation condition causes the larger values for all of the mentioned swi indicators in all values of Ï lnk 2 and Î» x when gradual slr is presumed the results confirm that the maximum differences of swi indicators between gradual slr and instantaneous slr occur under the land surface inundation condition see section 3 2 1 the land surface inundation condition has a more considerable impact on the indicators values in comparison with the type of slr gradual or instantaneous 3 2 3 assessment of correlation length effect in all scenarios at a specified Ï lnk 2 increasing Î» x from 20 m to 40 m i e increasing the heterogeneity scale increases Î¼ n for all the principal swi indicators increases this is because an increase in the correlation length induces the larger continuous high velocity channels perpendicular to the coast which makes swi more severe abarca et al 2007a kerrou and renard 2010 morgan et al 2015 it was mentioned in section 3 2 1 that the swi wedge length and the seawater volume increase under the land surface inundation condition in both gradual slr and instantaneous slr scenarios based on the results fig 6 changing Î» x from 20 m to 40 m generally decreases the difference between the land surface inundation and no land surface inundation conditions for x s and v s for the transition zone in Ï lnk 2 0 5 and Ï lnk 2 1 changing Î» x from 20 m to 40 m has a more significant effect when the land surface inundation condition is used in other words higher values of Î» x lead to increases of the predictive distribution mean of the transition zone width in the scenarios with the land surface inundation condition more than other scenarios changing Î» x with a constant Ï lnk 2 does not have much effect on the difference between the instantaneous and the gradual slr scenarios demonstrating that increasing Î» x increases both predictive means in the gradual slr and the instantaneous slr scenarios equally this pattern is similar in the scenarios with no land surface inundation condition however in the instantaneous slr scenarios smaller indicators have been obtained the only exception is when Ï lnk 2 2 wherein increasing Î» x resulted in significant change in the values differences between instantaneous slr and gradual slr for the seawater volume 3 2 4 assessment of the hydraulic conductivity field variance effect in the gradual slr scenarios increasing Ï lnk 2 increases the predictive distribution mean for the transition zone width and reduces the swi wedge length and the seawater volume respectively this relation is dependent on the associated behavior of the flow field in the aquifer in the heterogeneous media flow field forms by an interlinked network of preferential flow paths which includes unconnected high conductivity zones adjacent to the sea boundary the local seawater circulation cells are created due to existing such zones and cause to decrease swi and widen the transition zone morgan et al 2015 when applying land surface inundation gradual and instantaneous slr scenarios results are aligned conversely assuming no land surface inundation condition in the instantaneous slr scenarios results in a different behavior in the scenarios where Î» x is fixed to 20 m the mentioned pattern is repeated and an increase of the predictive distribution mean for the transition zone width and a decrease of the predictive distribution mean for the swi wedge length and the seawater volume are perceived when Î» x 40 m although increasing the Ï lnk 2 similarly enhances the predictive distribution mean of the transition zone width it is observed that increasing Ï lnk 2 from 1 to 2 increases the swi wedge length and the seawater volume 3 2 5 r and r evaluation r and r values for the predictive distribution mean values of the indicators are shown in fig 7 maximum r related to the swi wedge length associated with the islr lsi scenarios for v s and wat maximum r is associated with the gslr lsi and the islr no lsi scenarios respectively r shows the relative change in the predictive distribution mean of the indicators the scenario type for which the maximum r for x s and v s are observed is the gslr no lsi for the transition zone width however the largest r is related to the gslr lsi scenarios it can be understood that the type of scenarios where the extreme r and r values are observed are not identical this proves that the scenarios which have the largest absolute change do not necessarily have the most significant relative change also based on the r results fig 7 the heterogeneity changes the transition zone width more significantly compared to the other indicators it is noted that the extreme r values are all associated with the scenarios that gradual slr is applied 3 2 6 comparison with the homogeneous case the highest predictive distribution mean for each of the swi indicators in all scenario types are given in table 5 for x s and v s the land surface inundation condition causes larger values in both gradual slr and instantaneous slr scenarios the most extreme values for both of these swi indicators are associated with the instantaneous slr scenarios for wat the no land surface inundation condition results in larger values also unlike the other two swi indicators the most extreme amount is related to the gradual slr scenarios largest predictive distribution mean of x s is associated with Ï lnk 2 0 5 and Î» x 40 m where for wat is related to Ï lnk 2 2 and Î» x 40 m the most significant Î¼ n of the seawater volume in all scenarios except the scenario of instantaneous slr without land surface inundation is related to Ï lnk 2 0 5 and Î» x 40 m only in this scenario the extreme value is associated with Ï lnk 2 2 and Î» x 40 m comparing the homogeneous values of the swi indicators mentioned in table 4 and the maximum of the predictive distribution means indicated in table 5 x s and v s have smaller values than the homogeneous swi indicators in all scenarios the transition zone width is higher in all four types of scenarios considering the heterogeneity results in greater values for the transition zone width while it reduces the swi wedge length and the seawater volume for example the relative difference percentage normalized by dividing to the aquifer length between the homogeneous and the maximum minimum heterogeneous x s values associated with the gslr lsi the gslr no lsi the islr lsi and the islr no lsi are 1 3 8 5 4 9 12 4 2 4 10 2 and 7 8 14 0 respectively 3 2 7 uncertainty analysis all the evaluations performed so far have been done through the predictive distribution mean values an important matter to consider is that all the distribution parameters are obtained using a bayesian framework one of the parameters that can be used to demonstrate the uncertainty is the coefficient of variation cv coefficient of variation s of the predictive distribution of the principal swi indicators are shown in fig 8 when assuming gradual slr combined with the land surface inundation condition the coefficient of variation of the predictive distribution increases by increasing Ï lnk 2 at a specified Î» x the extreme coefficient of variations are related to wat 0 21 then x s 0 14 and lastly v s 0 1 in these scenarios it is observed that changing Î» x from 20 m to 40 m causes a noticeable increase in the coefficient of variation where the coefficient of variation of the transition zone is changed more considerably 0 14 to 0 21 in the extreme case similar to the gradual slr scenarios when assuming instantaneous slr combined with the land surface inundation condition when the longitudinal correlation length is constant increasing Ï lnk 2 causes a larger coefficient of variations also when the land surface inundation condition is used changing Î» x from 20 m to 40 m increases the coefficient of variation of all the swi indicators especially wat 0 14 to 0 19 in the extreme case assuming a confidence interval of 5 the type of slr was checked to evaluate whether it has an impact or not on the obtained uncertainties it was interpreted that the change of the coefficient of variation values in the scenarios with different slr assumption is not statistically significant this finding illustrates that the significant factors that influence the uncertainty within the results are associated with the aquifer heterogeneity the least coefficient of variation of the predictive distribution for all the swi indicators is associated with the gradual slr scenario Ï lnk 2 0 5 and Î» x 20 m the minimum coefficient of variation values associated to x s v s and wat are 0 04 0 03 and 0 07 respectively the most extensive coefficient of variation for the swi wedge length 0 23 is related to the islr no lsi scenario Ï lnk 2 2 and Î» x 20 m where for the seawater volume 0 25 and the transition zone 0 24 the islr no lsi Ï lnk 2 2 and Î» x 40 m is the scenario with the highest coefficient of variation it was observed that generally by increasing the heterogeneity parameters the cv of the indicators distributions increases numerical bootstrapping was applied to evaluate how much the updated distribution mean not to be mistaken for predictive distribution see appendix a through bayesian updating is aligned with the 90 confidence interval of the mean obtained through bootstrapping the results for swi wedge length associated with Ï lnk 2 2 and Î» x 40 m are depicted in fig 9 results indicate that the bayesian approach was able to capture the stochastic behavior of swi wedge length the parameter Î³ 0 appendix a and fig 9 is a hyperparameter which controls the behavior of the updated distribution a small value for Î³ 0 suggests that our initial belief about the distribution is not strong whereas a large Î³ 0 indicates strong belief and therefore reluctance to change the initially assumed distribution in this work Î³ 0 is set to 1 as we did not want the results to be biased towards the initial homogeneous distributions the numerical bootstrapping confirms that Î³ 0 1 is a more suitable choice compared to Î³ 0 10 using the probability distribution as a substitute for point estimators like mean and standard deviation of the swi indicators enables us to include the uncertainty within the problem into the analyzing procedure jahangir and moghim 2019 assuming that the derived predictive distributions are approximately normal because of their large degree of freedom for a t distribution we can conclude that the difference between the two normal distribution is also normally distributed the new distribution has a mean equal to the difference between the two means and its variance is similar to the summation of the variances haldar and mahadevan 2000 in sections 3 2 1 to 3 2 6 the difference between two means was calculated the probability of the observed difference is calculated from the derived probability distribution of the differences for example no land surface inundation condition causes a larger predictive distribution mean for the transition zone width when Ï lnk 2 2 and Î» x 40 m compared to when the land surface inundation condition is assumed meanwhile using the probability distribution of the differences there is still a 22 5 chance that in a future event assuming lsi with the same Ï lnk 2 and Î» x the value obtained for the transition zone width will be larger in comparison to when no land surface inundation condition is considered this inference can also be used for comparing the gradual slr and the instantaneous slr scenarios results as well for example when the land surface inundation condition is assumed the difference between the predictive distribution mean of the instantaneous and the gradual slr scenarios Ï lnk 2 0 5 associated with x s are 45 0 m and 47 3 m when the longitudinal correlation lengths are set to 20 m and 40 m respectively not considering the probability will imply that the larger values of Î» x will result in a further increase in the instantaneous slr scenarios compared to the gradual slr scenarios in other words it is concluded that the hydraulic conductivity field correlation length has a more considerable impact when the instantaneous slr assumption is made by taking into the account the resulted probability distribution however there is a 88 probability that in the first case Ï lnk 2 0 5 Î» x 20 m the instantaneous slr results in a larger value while only 80 chance exists in the second case Ï lnk 2 0 5 Î» x 40 m so that the mentioned difference or larger will be seen this indicates that the probability of observing the obtained values likelihood is an important factor which it mostly if not completely was neglected in the studies evaluating slr impacts on the aquifers reliability analysis was conducted using monte carlo sampling the joint probability distributions of the indicators were derived and the probability of the failure function obtaining a value smaller than zero was evaluated the resulted failure probabilities for two case sets of Ï lnk 2 0 5 Î» x 20 m and Ï lnk 2 2 Î» x 40 m are illustrated in fig 10 the results suggest that the probability of observing a more extreme state compared to the homogenous state increases by increasing the heterogeneity of the aquifer this is mostly due to the fact that by increasing heterogeneity of the aquifer wider distributions were obtained and therefore probability of observing extreme values for the indicators was increased also it is indicated that scenarios with lsi assumption are more critical compared to no lsi scenarios even so the introduced problem in this study is conceptual the methodology used to derive the predictive distribution for the swi indicators can be generally used in other similar studies incorporating the uncertainties within the modeling procedure and the indicators values into the evaluation process is of great importance in risk based decision making furthermore the results of this research can be considered essential for water resources planners as it was indicated that the type of heterogeneity and the type slr profoundly affect the behavior of aquifer response to slr in cases with a similar ratio of convection to advection and hence neglecting the aquifer heterogeneity and the type of slr will lead to unrealistic results and therefore amelioration programs will not be effective 4 conclusions this research systematically investigated the heterogeneity effect combined with the land surface inundation condition both the instantaneous and the gradual slr assumptions on swi in a 2d unconfined aquifer swi was characterized using six swi indicators two different approaches i e the ensemble of the swi indicators and the probability distribution of the principal swi indicators were used to assess the indicators the key findings are as follows 1 when land surface inundation is applied based on both ensemble and bayesian approaches the swi wedge length and the seawater volume have larger values in the instantaneous slr compared to the gradual slr scenarios with the same Ï lnk 2 and Î» x for the transition zone width the land surface inundation assumption causes larger values in the gradual slr scenarios based on the ensemble approach while concluding by the predictive distribution mean values the instantaneous slr scenarios have greater values when ignoring the land surface inundation effect the two approaches are similar illustrating that gradual slr results in greater values of all indicators both approaches indicate that the heterogeneity has a more considerable effect on x s and v s where no land surface inundation condition is used 2 both approaches show that for a constant Ï lnk 2 increasing Î» x will increase all swi indicators which confirms that the hydraulic conductivity field longitudinal correlation significantly affects swi for a specific Î» x increasing Ï lnk 2 decreased the swi wedge length and the seawater volume while the value of the transition zone width increased increasing the degree of the aquifer heterogeneity resulted in larger d e values while ignoring the land surface inundation effects increases and decreases the values of d e in instantaneous slr and gradual slr respectively 3 recharge rate variations have a considerable impact on all swi indicators the larger values of recharge rate result in smaller values of the swi wedge length the seawater volume and the transition zone width it was observed that the heterogeneity affected the swi indicators similarly when the recharge rate was altered while the bound formed by the wetter and the drier conditions is almost constant for x s and v s increasing the heterogeneity of the aquifer results in a wider wat bound 4 increasing Ï lnk 2 and Î» x both increase the coefficient of variation of the results where the effect of Ï lnk 2 is more considerable almost all the predictive distributions have a coefficient of variation larger than 0 05 which signifies the importance of using a probabilistic framework instead of using point estimators the reliability analysis indicated that increasing the heterogeneity of the aquifer increases the probability of observing a more extreme state compared to homogeneous state where scenarios considering land surface inundation proved to be more critical than those which did not take land surface inundation into account 5 numerical bootstrapping showed that the bayesian approach could be considered as an alternative to bootstrapping for stochastic analysis of heterogeneity the derived probability distributions for mean of the indicators were in compliance with the 90 confidence interval for the mean of the indicators obtained by bootstrapping the bayesian approach has two major advantages over bootstrapping it is more computationally affordable and it could be used for risk evaluation in reliability analysis the results of the present study are associated with a conceptual model where the model parameters were taken from a real case however the bayesian probabilistic framework introduced could be applied for assessment of swi in modeling of cases where the impact of input data uncertainty is of interest especially in real cases which mostly in situ measurements are erroneous or limited this study highlighted the importance of the geologic and slr impact conceptualization on swi where the results methodology could be used for evaluating uncertainties in the model input parameters of real world problems also minimizing the error of the most significant input parameters through reliability analysis introduced for real case aquifers could assist water resource planners with an uncertainty decision making tool for improving the measurement apparatus procedure related to the most significant model input data further work include but are not limited to applying the introduced framework for assessing the effect of type of heterogeneity on spatial distributions of salinity and submarine groundwater discharge in a real case extending the experiments to 3d swi modeling in heterogeneous aquifers and coupling the bayesian

1457,seawater intrusion swi is influenced by a variety of coastal phenomena such as sea level rise slr inundation of low lying coastal regions coastal storms recharge rate variations and pumping induced saltwater upconing quantification of the influence of heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field on swi combined with slr land surface inundation and recharge rate variations in an unconfined aquifer is the main objective of the present study the principal swi indicators used in this study are length of the swi wedge seawater volume and weighted average transition zone width characterized by the hydraulic conductivity field variance Ï lnk 2 the longitudinal correlation length Î» x the type of slr gradual or instantaneous slr the land surface inundation consideration and the recharge rate variations 72 scenarios have been introduced and for each of them 50 sets of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields have been generated based on two approaches namely ensemble monte carlo and a bayesian framework it is demonstrated that 1 the land surface inundation consideration increases the swi wedge length and the seawater volume regardless of the type of slr while it decreases the weighted average transition zone width in gradual slr scenarios 2 Î» x has a more significant impact on swi characteristics compared to Ï lnk 2 3 increasing the degree of aquifer heterogeneity results in larger effective dispersion values 4 numerical bootstrapping suggests that the introduced bayesian framework could be adopted as an alternative to computationally demanding methods such as bootstrapping for stochastic analysis of swi 5 reliability analysis indicates the general belief that considering the heterogeneity decreases the swi wedge length and the seawater volume while increases the transition zone width compared to the homogeneous modeling is associated with huge amounts of uncertainty proportional to the aquifer heterogeneity itself and 6 the results show that the impact of heterogeneity on the swi indicators is similar under different recharge rates keywords coastal aquifer heterogeneity monte carlo simulation sea level rise bayesian frameworka 1 introduction the management of freshwater resources is a crucial issue due to the increasing water demand caused by population growth groundwater in coastal aquifers is one of the major freshwater resources providing water for different uses such as domestic industrial and agricultural consumption and other socio economic activities siebert et al 2010 fresh groundwater in coastal aquifers is impacted by seawater intrusion swi werner et al 2013 sea level rise slr and variations in recharge due to climate change impacts are challenges for coastal groundwater resources management ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b 2015c besides the scarcity of freshwater resources water quality demands special attention because of swi seawater may invade coastal pumping wells mazi et al 2016 mixing of fresh groundwater with seawater and its salinization are a major issue for water legislators in the countries relying on coastal groundwater resources higher salinization of groundwater resources makes fresh groundwater unusable for the proposed uses ahmed 2017 swi has been the focus of many studies accurate quantification of swi is a difficult not to say impossible task in many cases the hardship for the quantification is related to the non linear nature of flow systems and the heterogeneity of the properties of the porous media although many other factors exist that affect the quantification of swi ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 many researchers have focused on heterogeneity effect on swi in the last few years the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity magnifies the vertical mixing and the dispersion of the plume s front werner et al 2013 pool et al 2015 mehdizadeh et al 2020 table 1 provides a summary of recent studies on heterogeneity issues in

heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field has been a common approach to investigating the heterogeneities of aquifers li et al 2015 as seen in table 1 most of the previous works have used a log normal distribution for generating random hydraulic conductivity fields e g abarca et al 2007a held et al 2005 prieto et al 2006 kerrou and renard 2010 pool et al 2015 the main reason for this choice is that log normal distribution generates a large variation in the hydraulic conductivity field consistent with the field observations spherical and exponential correlation functions have both been used for modeling the spatial correlation while spatial correlation was ignored in some previous works e g rajabi and ketabchi 2017 table 1 shows that the effect of dispersion was analyzed in previous studies e g held et al 2005 abarca et al 2007a kerrou and renard 2010 while it was ignored in some others e g rajabi and ketabchi 2017 mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 ketabchi and jahangir 2019 showed that considering the heterogeneity of the aquifer has a substantial impact on the effective dispersivity in the case of swi overshoot the length of the swi wedge and the transition zone width in heterogeneous aquifers are known indicators which were used in the literature to quantify the heterogeneity impacts on swi abarca 2006 illustrated that considering heterogeneity results in the seaward movement of the swi wedge and also a broader mixing zone in the 2d aquifer yang et al 2015a 2015b used 2d and 3d numerical simulations for modeling 1 m slr impact on swi in a heterogeneous aquifer respectively they demonstrated that the seawater interface moved landward in both 2d and 3d simulations kerrou and renard 2010 showed the significance of the degree of heterogeneity on the seawater interface location their results indicated that the interface moves towards the land in the 3d models while it moves towards the sea in the 2d models one subject that mostly was neglected in the previous studies is distinguishing between the effect of different parameters of the model creating heterogeneity spatial correlation variance and etc on swi status pool et al 2015 explored the effect of heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field combined with tidal oscillations on the 3d dynamics of swi they used monte carlo realizations of log normally distributed hydraulic conductivity fields and for each realization characterized mixing by the spatial moments of concentration using numerical variable density flow and solute transport simulations their study confirmed the findings of kerrou and renard 2010 showing that as the degree of the heterogeneity increases the combined effect of tidal oscillation and the aquifer heterogeneity decreases they showed that aquifer heterogeneity causes the swi wedge to move inland and results in a significantly larger transition zone in 3d model similarly houben et al 2018 highlighted the significance of the model dimensionality in the evaluation of heterogeneous aquifers their results contradicted the displacement of the seawater towards the sea predicted by abarca 2006 and michael et al 2016 mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 quantified the combined impacts of fully geological heterogeneity and coastal flooding events due to storm surge and slr on swi in a 2d unconfined coastal aquifer and highlighted the importance of such impacts in coastal aquifers ketabchi et al 2016a provided a systematic summary of studies related to slr induced swi based on the modeling methods and the processes used in the past two decades significant research efforts were devoted to investigating the impacts of slr and recharge rate variations on swi but none of the previous works considered the effects of slr with the aquifer heterogeneity on swi recently ketabchi and jahangir 2019 investigated such effects on the swi overshoot caused by slr in the literature usually a simplified assumption of an instantaneous slr is considered e g sherif and singh 1999 werner and simmons 2009 watson et al 2010 morgan et al 2013 stigter et al 2014 koussis et al 2015 ketabchi et al 2016a 2016b by assuming an instantaneous slr swi is supposed to occur more rapidly because the entire slr is applied at the start of the simulation period although assuming a gradual slr leads to a more realistic inspection of the problem watson et al 2010 ipcc 2013 few works have examined both instantaneous and gradual slr impacts on swi e g chang et al 2011 morgan et al 2015 mehdizadeh et al 2017 mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 the researchers in the previous studies used different rates of slr morgan et al 2015 considered a rate of 0 01 m year which is consistent with the ipcc 2013 projection for the period 2000 2100 luoma and okkonen 2014 used a rate of 0 09 0 51 m year for different simulation types the gradual slr rate consideration is mostly influenced by the simulation period based on the previous studies the type of slr has a considerable impact on swi characteristics and therefore should not be neglected in investigating swi previous works have mostly used rectangular shapes for modeling their aquifer pool et al 2015 michael et al 2013 2016 however there are examples that irregular domains have also been evaluated e g abarca et al 2007b yechieli et al 2010 yang et al 2015a 2015b the significant impact of aquifer geometry on slr induced responses was well documented in previous studies as depicted by yechieli et al 2010 the modeling boundary profoundly affects the results their work proved that slr impact on swi depends on the coastal topography near the coastline they also demonstrated that considering a boundary slope of 2 5 leads to 400 m landward shift of the seawater interface more examples of studies related to unconfined aquifers with inclined bed boundaries can be found in abarca et al 2007b mazi et al 2014 and ketabchi et al 2016a in addition to the bed slope of the aquifer the irregularity can be initiated from the land surface slope of the aquifer modeling the topographic slopes as a constant surface slope was a common assumption e g abarca et al 2007b koussis et al 2012 2015 in such studies the heterogeneity effect in the hydraulic conductivity field and irregularity of the domain were not considered land surface inundation caused by slr due to topographic slope is a factor affecting swi several studies have considered this impact e g kooi et al 2000 loaiciga et al 2012 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 sefelnasr and sherif 2013 ketabchi et al 2014 the obtained results demonstrated that land surface inundation caused by slr has a considerable impact on the increase of the length of the swi wedge in the flatter coasts table 1 demonstrates that none of the previous works have considered the combined effect of land surface inundation and slr both instantaneous and gradual slr with the aquifer heterogeneity on swi although the heterogeneity was modeled as layers in the previous research e g dagan and zeitoun 1998 dose et al 2014 mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 houben et al 2018 yu and michael 2019 karamouz et al 2020 incorporating the heterogeneity in the spatial field of hydraulic conductivity will result in a more robust evaluation the main objective of this study is to introduce a probabilistic approach and to apply a bayesian framework for investigating heterogeneity effects in hydraulic conductivity field on swi in 2d aquifers in response to slr and variations in recharge rate previous studies results confirm that swi is heavily influenced by the domain and network geometry model dimensionality degree of heterogeneity and the model setup boundary conditions although in the past some studies considered the effect of heterogeneity on swi to the knowledge of the authors this is the first study that considers slr and land surface inundation simultaneously in a heterogeneous unconfined aquifer for the evaluation of swi here 72 scenarios are defined with 50 random hydraulic conductivity fields generated for each scenario next monte carlo simulation is used six swi indicators are identified and analyzed to illustrate the swi effects by two different approaches namely ensemble of the indicators pool et al 2015 and predictive distribution mean evaluation bayesian framework the knowledge about the swi indicators is updated after each simulation using a bayesian updating framework regarding the initial distribution of the principal swi indicators the predictive distribution of these indicators is derived the derived probability distribution encompasses the uncertainty within the parameters jahangir and moghim 2019 and can be used as a tool for aquifer management and further risk analysis 2 materials and tools 2 1 problem

et al 2011 the problem consists of a 2d unconfined aquifer with the length of 1000 m aquifer thickness of 30 to 35 m mean sea level of 30 m and a constant land surface slope of 0 5 the regional freshwater flux is constant and set to 0 15 m2 day this flux is applied to the right boundary fig 1 also a constant recharge rate of 18 25 mm year freshwater is applied at the top boundary the seaward boundary is seawater hydraulic pressure with a specified salinity when land surface inundation is included the first 200 m of the top boundary can be subjected to seawater hydraulic pressure from the seaward boundary considering the height of slr the lower boundary is impervious all the modeling parameters for the aquifer are listed in table 2 four types of scenarios are considered to assess the problem in this case 1 gradual slr with land surface inundation gslr lsi 2 gradual slr without land surface inundation gslr no lsi 3 instantaneous slr with land surface inundation islr lsi and 4 instantaneous slr without land surface inundation islr no lsi the gradual slr rate is set to 0 01 m year in the instantaneous slr scenarios a simplification assumption of 1 m instantaneous slr was used at the start of the simulation period a constant rate of 0 01 m year for the gradual slr will result in the same slr as the assumed 1 m instantaneous slr after 100 years simulation period ipcc 2013 the associated land surface inundation due to slr is considered in lsi scenarios while it is ignored in no lsi scenarios land surface inundation is considered in the model by addressing a shift in the position of the coastline instigated by the height of slr the coastline shift towards the land is equal to slr divided by the land surface slope ketabchi et al 2014 also based on the predictions of ipcc 2013 and putnam and broecker 2017 mean precipitation and consequently top recharge rate and regional freshwater flux could differ by up to 50 a 50 increase in the regional freshwater flux and the top recharge rate i e w 27 375 mm year and q b 0 225 m2 day is assumed for the wetter scenarios while the drier scenarios are considered by decreasing rate of 50 w 9 125 mm year and q b 0 075 m2 day to investigate the effect of heterogeneity combined with slr on swi for each type of the defined scenarios 50 sets of log normally distributed hydraulic conductivity fields are generated using gcosim3d gomez hernandez and journel 1992 a spherical correlation function is used and the geometric mean expected value of the hydraulic conductivity field is set to 10 m day equal to the hydraulic conductivity of the homogeneous cases similar to ketabchi and jahangir 2019 we assume three sets of variances Ï lnk 2 of 0 5 1 and 2 for the hydraulic conductivity to assess the conductivity variations of the media the degree of heterogeneity considering the correlated structure of geological materials directional correlation lengths Î» x and Î» y are considered anisotropic Î» x Î» y Î» x represents the correlation length in the horizontal direction parallel to the sediment stratification while Î» y is the correlation length in the vertical direction directional correlation lengths determine the media heterogeneity scale and mostly control the degree of statistical anisotropy statistical anisotropy has an impact on the effective hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer which is also affected by the variance of hydraulic conductivity field abarca et al 2007b pool et al 2015 in the present work Î» y 5 m and Î» x 20 m and 40 m are assumed ketabchi and jahangir 2019 therefore six different combinations for the hydraulic conductivity field variance and longitudinal correlation length values three variances and two correlation lengths are tested for four scenarios of gslr lsi gslr no lsi islr lsi and islr no lsi under three settings of recharge rate variations base wetter and drier conditions 72 scenarios in total these scenarios are executed for 50 sets of log normally distributed hydraulic conductivity fields making the total number of the experiments equal to 3600 while each simulation approximately needs nearly 35 to 50 h to complete 2 2 limitations we have assessed our scenarios using the presented case here this case has a single flow configuration characterized by the ratio of convection due to density differences between freshwater and seawater to advection due to the imposed regional freshwater flux and recharge rate while methodologically such assessments could be extended to other geometries and properties different characteristics of convection vs advection it is noted that the findings based on the present case in this study may not hold in other cases also in all scenarios the values of effective porosity and dispersivities are constant although the correlation among hydraulic conductivity effective porosity and dispersivities is partial and complex the heterogeneity of effective porosity and dispersivities reflection is ignored in this study similar to kerrou and renard 2010 and pool et al 2015 2 3 numerical modeling all of the simulations were performed by sutra voss and provost 2010 finite element mesh and boundary conditions are adopted from ketabchi et al 2016a the domain is discretized to 38 544 finite quadrilateral elements 39 071 nodes top and seaward boundaries have a steeper change of hydraulic heads and salinity concentrations therefore horizontal and vertical mesh size change from 1 m to 4 m and 0 15 m to 0 57 m respectively the mesh is more refined near the top and seaward areas the values of correlation lengths and the mesh sizes should be consistent to ensure that the ratio of the correlation lengths to the largest mesh size in each direction is kept larger than five such values guarantee the accuracy of heterogeneity based assessments and control the load of computations pool et al 2015 as mentioned by ketabchi et al 2016a grid convergence was also checked for the mesh size while various finer and coarser discretization schemes in the range of 9636 618 809 nodes were tested also the grid peclet number as the spatial stability criterion was evaluated and it was deduced that the discretization results in a grid peclet number smaller than four voss and provost 2010 more details regarding the mesh dependency analyses are available in ketabchi et al 2016a the initial condition for each simulation in this study is set based on the simulation that is long enough to reach equilibrium under no slr condition a period of 100 years is selected for all simulations as previously used by ketabchi et al 2016a an initial time step of 500 s is selected this initial value is increased by a time step multiplier of 1 2 in a cycle of 10 time steps until it reaches a time step of 90 h the time step selected guarantees the courant number to be less than 0 75 ketabchi et al 2016a the geometry of the model domain its boundaries and an example set of random hydraulic conductivity fields generated are shown in fig 1 2 4 assessment method we use three quantities previously used by pool et al 2015 as our principal swi indicators to assess the heterogeneity effect on swi also to quantify the relative change in each type of the scenarios two ancillary swi indicators are defined these five swi indicators are calculated at the end of the simulation period i e year 100 to assess the temporal salinity mixing behavior along the swi under different heterogeneity conditions the sixth indicator is considered 2 4 1 description of swi indicators 1 the first swi indicator is length of the swi wedge x s which indicates the location that 50 salinity contour lines intersect with the bottom boundary salinity contours can be derived from the following equation 1 f p x y x y c x y p 0 where p is the salinity ratio f 0 5 is the 50 contour line and c x y p is given respectively by 2 c x y p c x y pc s with c x y the salt mass concentration kg m 3 at coordinates x and y and c s is the seawater concentration the length of the swi wedge can be defined as 3 x s f 0 5 x 0 x c x 0 0 5 0 2 the second descriptor is the weighted average transition zone width wat wat is given by 4 wat f 0 1 f 0 9 da b wat where b wat is the averaged thickness of the aquifer in the transition zone and f 0 1 and f 0 9 are 10 and 90 salinity contours the transition zone is defined as the distance between 10 and 90 salinity levels pool et al 2015 3 the third swi indicator is the seawater volume v s v s is the salinized volume bounded by the seaward boundary and 50 salinity contour and is defined as 5 v s f 0 5 da 4 based on the three principal swi indicators for each type of the scenarios e g gslr lsi gslr no lsi islr lsi and islr no lsi the difference between the maximum and minimum of the obtained indicators is defined as r it represents the absolute change of the variables of interest each indicator as the variability of the proposed quantity according to three hydraulic conductivity fields and two correlation lengths six variables in total given by v k k 1 2 and 6 r for each of three principal swi indicators and for both ensemble and probabilistic approach see section 2 4 2 is given by 6 r max v k min v k 5 the relative change r is defined as the value of r divided by the indicator average value avg v k 7 r r avg v k 6 the sixth swi indicator computed in this study is the effective longitudinal dispersion d e which is often used to quantify the salinity mixing in heterogeneous media effective longitudinal dispersion is the temporal variation rate of the effective spatial variance of the salinity distribution Ï s 2 normalized by regional flux rate q b aquifer thickness b and wat under no slr conditions tiedeman and hsieh 2004 pool et al 2015 8 d e bd Ï s 2 dt 2 q b wat no slr 2 4 2 the ensemble and the probability distribution of the swi indicators two different approaches are used to evaluate the heterogeneity effect combined with the slr type and the land surface inundation assumption for calculating the ensemble of the variables in each scenario first we create 50 sets of log normally distributed hydraulic conductivity fields then we use each realization as an input for the model and compute the concentration in the aquifer calculating each of the indicators based on the average of the calculated concentrations will result in the ensemble variables in addition to ensemble analysis swi indicators are evaluated through bayesian modeling to derive the probability distribution of the indicators a hierarchical bayesian framework is used by assuming that each of the variables is normally distributed and both the mean and the precision inverse of the variance are unknown the probability density function of the variables are updated by each new simulation of the sutra model using python scripts through bayes updating formula appendix a a joint probability distribution is considered for mean and precision conjugate priors are used to derive the predictive distribution in closed form the bayesian framework for deriving the distribution of the indicators is referred to as maximum a posteriori and is one the favored parametric methods for distribution fitting parameter estimation in machine learning and pattern recognition bishop 2006 in the previous studies of pool et al 2015 and mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 only the mean of the variables of interest were reported which does not capture the stochastic behavior of swi in heterogeneous aquifers raised from the limited number of simulations and also the intrinsic uncertainty within the indicators in the present research the mean and the probability density function of the variables are both calculated and used for comparing the scenarios results and also uncertainty analysis the details of the two abovementioned approaches for calculating the ensemble and the probability distribution of the variables are provided in appendix a 2 4 3 uncertainty assessment in the present study a hierarchical bayesian method is applied to derive the probability distribution of the indicators for deriving the probability distributions in closed form and also avoiding extra computational load conjugate priors are used because of the computational load of the simulations 50 samples are available for updating the distributions in each scenario configuration to evaluate the accuracy of the obtained mean values numerical bootstrapping with 2500 samples is also applied and the 90 confidence interval of the mean is compared to the distribution of the mean should not be mistaken for predictive distribution see appendix a eq a6 obtained through the bayesian updating one of the benefits of deriving the probability distributions of the indicators instead of only using the point estimates such as mean is that reliability analysis der kiureghian 2005 could be conducted in reliability analysis a failure function should be defined which indicates all the possible failure states of a system the failure function in this study is stated as follows 9 f 3 x s x s hom v s v s hom wat wat hom where x s hom v s hom and wat hom are swi wedge length seawater volume and the weighted average transition zone width for the homogenous cases respectively the function f obtains a negative value if a more extreme state is observed relative to the homogeneous state the probability of observing a negative value for f is called failure probability p f obtaining p f is of great importance for coastal management as it could be leveraged for risk analysis where risk in its most traditional form is defined as p f cost the variables used in the failure function namely x s v s and wat are all random variables with distributions obtained via the introduced bayesian framework these random variables are also correlated to each other in order to evaluate p f monte carlo sampling is conducted where first the joint probability distribution of x s v s and wat is obtained and random samples are taken from their joint probability distribution for approximating f and consequently p f is calculated reliability analysis is conducted for two case sets of Ï lnk 2 0 5 Î» x 20 and Ï lnk 2 2 Î» x 40 it is noted that varied failure functions results in dissimilar failure probabilities the objective of this research is to introduce and apply the bayesian based reliability analysis for assessment of stochastic swi problems the interested reader is directed to der kiureghian 2005 for more details regarding reliability analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 ensemble of indicators the values of all ensemble indicators are depicted in fig 2 these observations are interpreted using the associated behavior of the flow field in the aquifer and temporal behavior of hydraulic pressures in this field to re equilibrate after slr ketabchi and jahangir 2019 in scenarios with the land surface inundation assumption considering the instantaneous slr results in larger values for all the ensemble indicators x s wat v s compared to the scenarios assuming land surface inundation combined with gradual slr however generally in the no lsi scenarios the gradual slr assumption results in the larger ensemble indicators from fig 2 it can be understood that in the scenarios where the land surface inundation condition was used at a specific Î» x i e 20 m or 40 m increasing the Ï lnk 2 will decrease the ensemble values of the swi wedge length and the seawater volume x s and v s and increase the weighted transition zone width respectively wat on the other hand increasing the longitudinal correlation from 20 m to 40 m increases all the ensemble indicators it can be deduced from the obtained ensemble indicators fig 2 that the same behavior caused by altering the heterogeneity parameters is observed whether a land surface inundation is presumed or not however the impact of heterogeneity is influenced by land surface inundation based on the results fig 2 it can be understood that while land surface inundation produces much larger values for x s and v s it does not have a substantial effect on wat the reason is that x s and v s are mainly related to the 50 salinity contour and the associated distance from seaward boundary where the distance is directly related to lsi consideration for different scenarios r and r are listed in table 3 r shows the difference between maximum an minimum obtained values for each indicator all Î» x and Ï lnk 2 in each scenario whereas r indicates the relative change the r shows the variation of resulted ensemble amounts in each scenario hence the results indicate that heterogeneity alters the swi wedge length and the seawater volume more substantially when the land surface inundation condition is ignored while the opposite is observed for the transition zone width in other words changing the heterogeneity parameters resulted in more variation for swi wedge length and the seawater volume in scenarios without lsi consideration while a wider range of values were obtained for transition zone width in scenarios considering lsi through altering heterogeneity parameters values of the swi indicators in the homogeneous case associated with different slr types and land surface inundation conditions are listed in table 4 based on the values listed in table 4 and demonstrated in fig 2 x s and v s are smaller compared to the similar homogeneous cases conversely considering the heterogeneity increases the transition zone width maximum and minimum of all the ensemble indicators are illustrated in fig 3 maximum of the ensemble swi wedge length and the seawater volume x s and v s occur in islr lsi scenario Î» x 40 m and Ï lnk 2 0 5 fig 3a also the maximum of wat occurs in the gslr no lsi scenario Î» x 40 m and Ï lnk 2 2 fig 3b on the other hand the minimum of x s and v s are associated with the islr no lsi scenario Î» x 20 m and Ï lnk 2 2 as depicted in fig 3c also fig 3d illustrates the minimum of wat which is related to the gslr lsi scenario Î» x 20 m and Ï lnk 2 0 5 to investigate the effect of recharge rate variations the wetter and the drier conditions are considered and the obtained results of x s v s and wat are presented in fig 4 the whiskers indicate the drier upper bound and the wetter condition lower bound for each scenario respectively the results show the same general behavior of considered slr land surface inundation and heterogeneity conditions while the recharge rate has a considerable impact on the values of the indicators it is observed that recharge rate s impact is less significant on wat compared to the other main indicators as seen in fig 4c obtained wat range widens as the heterogeneity of the aquifer increases especially for the scenarios without the land surface inundation presumption in the absence of land surface inundation increasing the heterogeneity magnifies the effect of recharge rate variation the land surface inundation is a more controlling factor for the transitional zone width compared to the recharge rate variation the ensemble maximum d e values for the homogenous and the heterogeneous scenarios are determined over 100 years post slr simulation period and shown in fig 5 the maximum values of d e indicate the intensity of widening of the transition zone width as seen in fig 5 both slr type and heterogeneity properties lead to an accelerated changing of the transition zone smaller values of d e are observed while assuming gradual slr i e the rate of d e variations are sharper under the instantaneous slr scenarios faster seawater circulation occurred under instantaneous slr and consequently enhanced values of d e are observed also it can be seen that increasing the values of Ï lnk 2 and Î» x increases the ensemble maximum d e values in addition it is generally observed that as the values of Ï lnk 2 and Î» x is increased the maximum obtained d e exceeds the homogeneous values 3 2 bayesian swi evaluation considering eqs a1 to a9 appendix a the predictive distribution mean for x s v s and wat and each type of the scenarios are illustrated in fig 6 to better evaluate the results we will analyze and classify the results into 7 clusters land surface inundation slr type correlation length effect hydraulic conductivity field variance effect r and r compared with the homogeneous case and uncertainty analysis 3 2 1 assessment of land surface inundation consideration from fig 6 it can be understood that no matter what the longitudinal correlation length or the hydraulic conductivity field variance is chosen the land surface inundation assumption increases the predictive distribution mean Î¼ n of the swi wedge length and the seawater volume x s and v s which is aligned with the ensemble results section 3 1 in scenarios assuming gradual slr the land surface inundation condition causes a smaller wat in comparison with the scenarios without the land surface inundation condition however the scenarios in which instantaneous slr is assumed wat increased in some cases for which the land surface inundation condition is assumed e g Î» x 40 m and Ï lnk 2 0 5 fig 6c the maximum difference between the predictive distribution mean of the scenarios with the assumption of land surface inundation and without it for x s and v s are 260 5 m and 6856 5 m 3 respectively Î» x 40 m and Ï lnk 2 0 5 and Î» x 40 m and Ï lnk 2 0 5 respectively both scenarios are associated with the instantaneous slr scenario the maximum difference between Î¼ n of the transition zone width with and without the land surface inundation assumption is 36 9 m which is associated with the gradual slr scenario Î» x 40 m and Ï lnk 2 0 5 the land surface inundation presumption impact on the indicators values is more significant when the longitudinal correlation length is large and the hydraulic conductivity field variance is small 3 2 2 assessment of slr type consideration in all presumed Ï lnk 2 and Î» x values when land surface inundation is applied instantaneous slr increases all the swi indicators conversely the no land surface inundation condition causes the larger values for all of the mentioned swi indicators in all values of Ï lnk 2 and Î» x when gradual slr is presumed the results confirm that the maximum differences of swi indicators between gradual slr and instantaneous slr occur under the land surface inundation condition see section 3 2 1 the land surface inundation condition has a more considerable impact on the indicators values in comparison with the type of slr gradual or instantaneous 3 2 3 assessment of correlation length effect in all scenarios at a specified Ï lnk 2 increasing Î» x from 20 m to 40 m i e increasing the heterogeneity scale increases Î¼ n for all the principal swi indicators increases this is because an increase in the correlation length induces the larger continuous high velocity channels perpendicular to the coast which makes swi more severe abarca et al 2007a kerrou and renard 2010 morgan et al 2015 it was mentioned in section 3 2 1 that the swi wedge length and the seawater volume increase under the land surface inundation condition in both gradual slr and instantaneous slr scenarios based on the results fig 6 changing Î» x from 20 m to 40 m generally decreases the difference between the land surface inundation and no land surface inundation conditions for x s and v s for the transition zone in Ï lnk 2 0 5 and Ï lnk 2 1 changing Î» x from 20 m to 40 m has a more significant effect when the land surface inundation condition is used in other words higher values of Î» x lead to increases of the predictive distribution mean of the transition zone width in the scenarios with the land surface inundation condition more than other scenarios changing Î» x with a constant Ï lnk 2 does not have much effect on the difference between the instantaneous and the gradual slr scenarios demonstrating that increasing Î» x increases both predictive means in the gradual slr and the instantaneous slr scenarios equally this pattern is similar in the scenarios with no land surface inundation condition however in the instantaneous slr scenarios smaller indicators have been obtained the only exception is when Ï lnk 2 2 wherein increasing Î» x resulted in significant change in the values differences between instantaneous slr and gradual slr for the seawater volume 3 2 4 assessment of the hydraulic conductivity field variance effect in the gradual slr scenarios increasing Ï lnk 2 increases the predictive distribution mean for the transition zone width and reduces the swi wedge length and the seawater volume respectively this relation is dependent on the associated behavior of the flow field in the aquifer in the heterogeneous media flow field forms by an interlinked network of preferential flow paths which includes unconnected high conductivity zones adjacent to the sea boundary the local seawater circulation cells are created due to existing such zones and cause to decrease swi and widen the transition zone morgan et al 2015 when applying land surface inundation gradual and instantaneous slr scenarios results are aligned conversely assuming no land surface inundation condition in the instantaneous slr scenarios results in a different behavior in the scenarios where Î» x is fixed to 20 m the mentioned pattern is repeated and an increase of the predictive distribution mean for the transition zone width and a decrease of the predictive distribution mean for the swi wedge length and the seawater volume are perceived when Î» x 40 m although increasing the Ï lnk 2 similarly enhances the predictive distribution mean of the transition zone width it is observed that increasing Ï lnk 2 from 1 to 2 increases the swi wedge length and the seawater volume 3 2 5 r and r evaluation r and r values for the predictive distribution mean values of the indicators are shown in fig 7 maximum r related to the swi wedge length associated with the islr lsi scenarios for v s and wat maximum r is associated with the gslr lsi and the islr no lsi scenarios respectively r shows the relative change in the predictive distribution mean of the indicators the scenario type for which the maximum r for x s and v s are observed is the gslr no lsi for the transition zone width however the largest r is related to the gslr lsi scenarios it can be understood that the type of scenarios where the extreme r and r values are observed are not identical this proves that the scenarios which have the largest absolute change do not necessarily have the most significant relative change also based on the r results fig 7 the heterogeneity changes the transition zone width more significantly compared to the other indicators it is noted that the extreme r values are all associated with the scenarios that gradual slr is applied 3 2 6 comparison with the homogeneous case the highest predictive distribution mean for each of the swi indicators in all scenario types are given in table 5 for x s and v s the land surface inundation condition causes larger values in both gradual slr and instantaneous slr scenarios the most extreme values for both of these swi indicators are associated with the instantaneous slr scenarios for wat the no land surface inundation condition results in larger values also unlike the other two swi indicators the most extreme amount is related to the gradual slr scenarios largest predictive distribution mean of x s is associated with Ï lnk 2 0 5 and Î» x 40 m where for wat is related to Ï lnk 2 2 and Î» x 40 m the most significant Î¼ n of the seawater volume in all scenarios except the scenario of instantaneous slr without land surface inundation is related to Ï lnk 2 0 5 and Î» x 40 m only in this scenario the extreme value is associated with Ï lnk 2 2 and Î» x 40 m comparing the homogeneous values of the swi indicators mentioned in table 4 and the maximum of the predictive distribution means indicated in table 5 x s and v s have smaller values than the homogeneous swi indicators in all scenarios the transition zone width is higher in all four types of scenarios considering the heterogeneity results in greater values for the transition zone width while it reduces the swi wedge length and the seawater volume for example the relative difference percentage normalized by dividing to the aquifer length between the homogeneous and the maximum minimum heterogeneous x s values associated with the gslr lsi the gslr no lsi the islr lsi and the islr no lsi are 1 3 8 5 4 9 12 4 2 4 10 2 and 7 8 14 0 respectively 3 2 7 uncertainty analysis all the evaluations performed so far have been done through the predictive distribution mean values an important matter to consider is that all the distribution parameters are obtained using a bayesian framework one of the parameters that can be used to demonstrate the uncertainty is the coefficient of variation cv coefficient of variation s of the predictive distribution of the principal swi indicators are shown in fig 8 when assuming gradual slr combined with the land surface inundation condition the coefficient of variation of the predictive distribution increases by increasing Ï lnk 2 at a specified Î» x the extreme coefficient of variations are related to wat 0 21 then x s 0 14 and lastly v s 0 1 in these scenarios it is observed that changing Î» x from 20 m to 40 m causes a noticeable increase in the coefficient of variation where the coefficient of variation of the transition zone is changed more considerably 0 14 to 0 21 in the extreme case similar to the gradual slr scenarios when assuming instantaneous slr combined with the land surface inundation condition when the longitudinal correlation length is constant increasing Ï lnk 2 causes a larger coefficient of variations also when the land surface inundation condition is used changing Î» x from 20 m to 40 m increases the coefficient of variation of all the swi indicators especially wat 0 14 to 0 19 in the extreme case assuming a confidence interval of 5 the type of slr was checked to evaluate whether it has an impact or not on the obtained uncertainties it was interpreted that the change of the coefficient of variation values in the scenarios with different slr assumption is not statistically significant this finding illustrates that the significant factors that influence the uncertainty within the results are associated with the aquifer heterogeneity the least coefficient of variation of the predictive distribution for all the swi indicators is associated with the gradual slr scenario Ï lnk 2 0 5 and Î» x 20 m the minimum coefficient of variation values associated to x s v s and wat are 0 04 0 03 and 0 07 respectively the most extensive coefficient of variation for the swi wedge length 0 23 is related to the islr no lsi scenario Ï lnk 2 2 and Î» x 20 m where for the seawater volume 0 25 and the transition zone 0 24 the islr no lsi Ï lnk 2 2 and Î» x 40 m is the scenario with the highest coefficient of variation it was observed that generally by increasing the heterogeneity parameters the cv of the indicators distributions increases numerical bootstrapping was applied to evaluate how much the updated distribution mean not to be mistaken for predictive distribution see appendix a through bayesian updating is aligned with the 90 confidence interval of the mean obtained through bootstrapping the results for swi wedge length associated with Ï lnk 2 2 and Î» x 40 m are depicted in fig 9 results indicate that the bayesian approach was able to capture the stochastic behavior of swi wedge length the parameter Î³ 0 appendix a and fig 9 is a hyperparameter which controls the behavior of the updated distribution a small value for Î³ 0 suggests that our initial belief about the distribution is not strong whereas a large Î³ 0 indicates strong belief and therefore reluctance to change the initially assumed distribution in this work Î³ 0 is set to 1 as we did not want the results to be biased towards the initial homogeneous distributions the numerical bootstrapping confirms that Î³ 0 1 is a more suitable choice compared to Î³ 0 10 using the probability distribution as a substitute for point estimators like mean and standard deviation of the swi indicators enables us to include the uncertainty within the problem into the analyzing procedure jahangir and moghim 2019 assuming that the derived predictive distributions are approximately normal because of their large degree of freedom for a t distribution we can conclude that the difference between the two normal distribution is also normally distributed the new distribution has a mean equal to the difference between the two means and its variance is similar to the summation of the variances haldar and mahadevan 2000 in sections 3 2 1 to 3 2 6 the difference between two means was calculated the probability of the observed difference is calculated from the derived probability distribution of the differences for example no land surface inundation condition causes a larger predictive distribution mean for the transition zone width when Ï lnk 2 2 and Î» x 40 m compared to when the land surface inundation condition is assumed meanwhile using the probability distribution of the differences there is still a 22 5 chance that in a future event assuming lsi with the same Ï lnk 2 and Î» x the value obtained for the transition zone width will be larger in comparison to when no land surface inundation condition is considered this inference can also be used for comparing the gradual slr and the instantaneous slr scenarios results as well for example when the land surface inundation condition is assumed the difference between the predictive distribution mean of the instantaneous and the gradual slr scenarios Ï lnk 2 0 5 associated with x s are 45 0 m and 47 3 m when the longitudinal correlation lengths are set to 20 m and 40 m respectively not considering the probability will imply that the larger values of Î» x will result in a further increase in the instantaneous slr scenarios compared to the gradual slr scenarios in other words it is concluded that the hydraulic conductivity field correlation length has a more considerable impact when the instantaneous slr assumption is made by taking into the account the resulted probability distribution however there is a 88 probability that in the first case Ï lnk 2 0 5 Î» x 20 m the instantaneous slr results in a larger value while only 80 chance exists in the second case Ï lnk 2 0 5 Î» x 40 m so that the mentioned difference or larger will be seen this indicates that the probability of observing the obtained values likelihood is an important factor which it mostly if not completely was neglected in the studies evaluating slr impacts on the aquifers reliability analysis was conducted using monte carlo sampling the joint probability distributions of the indicators were derived and the probability of the failure function obtaining a value smaller than zero was evaluated the resulted failure probabilities for two case sets of Ï lnk 2 0 5 Î» x 20 m and Ï lnk 2 2 Î» x 40 m are illustrated in fig 10 the results suggest that the probability of observing a more extreme state compared to the homogenous state increases by increasing the heterogeneity of the aquifer this is mostly due to the fact that by increasing heterogeneity of the aquifer wider distributions were obtained and therefore probability of observing extreme values for the indicators was increased also it is indicated that scenarios with lsi assumption are more critical compared to no lsi scenarios even so the introduced problem in this study is conceptual the methodology used to derive the predictive distribution for the swi indicators can be generally used in other similar studies incorporating the uncertainties within the modeling procedure and the indicators values into the evaluation process is of great importance in risk based decision making furthermore the results of this research can be considered essential for water resources planners as it was indicated that the type of heterogeneity and the type slr profoundly affect the behavior of aquifer response to slr in cases with a similar ratio of convection to advection and hence neglecting the aquifer heterogeneity and the type of slr will lead to unrealistic results and therefore amelioration programs will not be effective 4 conclusions this research systematically investigated the heterogeneity effect combined with the land surface inundation condition both the instantaneous and the gradual slr assumptions on swi in a 2d unconfined aquifer swi was characterized using six swi indicators two different approaches i e the ensemble of the swi indicators and the probability distribution of the principal swi indicators were used to assess the indicators the key findings are as follows 1 when land surface inundation is applied based on both ensemble and bayesian approaches the swi wedge length and the seawater volume have larger values in the instantaneous slr compared to the gradual slr scenarios with the same Ï lnk 2 and Î» x for the transition zone width the land surface inundation assumption causes larger values in the gradual slr scenarios based on the ensemble approach while concluding by the predictive distribution mean values the instantaneous slr scenarios have greater values when ignoring the land surface inundation effect the two approaches are similar illustrating that gradual slr results in greater values of all indicators both approaches indicate that the heterogeneity has a more considerable effect on x s and v s where no land surface inundation condition is used 2 both approaches show that for a constant Ï lnk 2 increasing Î» x will increase all swi indicators which confirms that the hydraulic conductivity field longitudinal correlation significantly affects swi for a specific Î» x increasing Ï lnk 2 decreased the swi wedge length and the seawater volume while the value of the transition zone width increased increasing the degree of the aquifer heterogeneity resulted in larger d e values while ignoring the land surface inundation effects increases and decreases the values of d e in instantaneous slr and gradual slr respectively 3 recharge rate variations have a considerable impact on all swi indicators the larger values of recharge rate result in smaller values of the swi wedge length the seawater volume and the transition zone width it was observed that the heterogeneity affected the swi indicators similarly when the recharge rate was altered while the bound formed by the wetter and the drier conditions is almost constant for x s and v s increasing the heterogeneity of the aquifer results in a wider wat bound 4 increasing Ï lnk 2 and Î» x both increase the coefficient of variation of the results where the effect of Ï lnk 2 is more considerable almost all the predictive distributions have a coefficient of variation larger than 0 05 which signifies the importance of using a probabilistic framework instead of using point estimators the reliability analysis indicated that increasing the heterogeneity of the aquifer increases the probability of observing a more extreme state compared to homogeneous state where scenarios considering land surface inundation proved to be more critical than those which did not take land surface inundation into account 5 numerical bootstrapping showed that the bayesian approach could be considered as an alternative to bootstrapping for stochastic analysis of heterogeneity the derived probability distributions for mean of the indicators were in compliance with the 90 confidence interval for the mean of the indicators obtained by bootstrapping the bayesian approach has two major advantages over bootstrapping it is more computationally affordable and it could be used for risk evaluation in reliability analysis the results of the present study are associated with a conceptual model where the model parameters were taken from a real case however the bayesian probabilistic framework introduced could be applied for assessment of swi in modeling of cases where the impact of input data uncertainty is of interest especially in real cases which mostly in situ measurements are erroneous or limited this study highlighted the importance of the geologic and slr impact conceptualization on swi where the results methodology could be used for evaluating uncertainties in the model input parameters of real world problems also minimizing the error of the most significant input parameters through reliability analysis introduced for real case aquifers could assist water resource planners with an uncertainty decision making tool for improving the measurement apparatus procedure related to the most significant model input data further work include but are not limited to applying the introduced framework for assessing the effect of type of heterogeneity on spatial distributions of salinity and submarine groundwater discharge in a real case extending the experiments to 3d swi modeling in heterogeneous aquifers and coupling the bayesian

1458,prediction of drainage quantity and quality is critical to reduce the environmental risks associated with weathering mine waste rock reactive transport models can be effective tools to understand and disentangle the processes underlying waste rock weathering and drainage but their validity and applicability can be impaired by poor parametrization and the non uniqueness conundrum here a process based multicomponent reactive transport model is presented to interpret and quantify the processes affecting drainage quantity and quality from 15 waste rock experiments from the antamina mine peru the deployed uniform flow formulation and consistent set of geochemical rate equations could be calibrated almost exclusively with measured bulk waste rock properties in experiments ranging from 2 kg to 6500 tons in size the quantitative agreement between simulated dynamics and the observed drainage records for systems with a variety of rock lithologies and over a wide range of ph supports the proposed selection of processes the controls of important physicochemical processes and feedbacks such as secondary mineral precipitation surface passivation oxygen limitations were confirmed through sensitivity analyses our work shows that reactive transport models with a consistent formulation and evidence based parametrization can be used to explain waste rock drainage dynamics across laboratory to field scales keywords reactive transport modelling acid rock drainage water quality coupled processes 1 introduction mining operations around the world produce millions of tons of waste materials every year including waste rock that is stored on site in tall piles hudson edwards and dold 2015 waste rock piles require effective management to reduce environmental risks associated with the oxidation of minerals that can mobilize contaminants and lead to deterioration of downstream water quality e g acid rock drainage akcil and koldas 2006 lindsay et al 2009 amos et al 2015 a quantitative understanding of the processes controlling waste rock weathering and drainage rates is required to develop predictive models for strategic waste management planning similar to the so called 5p rule of economics it can be said that proper prediction prevents poor performance for which reactive transport models constitute an attractive tool to disentangle the strongly coupled hydrogeochemical processes hence a growing number of reactive transport modelling studies is dedicated to waste rock piles linklater et al 2005 molson et al 2012 demers et al 2013 shokri et al 2016

or co disposal techniques haug and pauls 2002 aubertin et al 2009 martin et al 2017 raymond et al 2020b various coupled physicochemical processes control the overall drainage dynamics of an exposed waste rock pile amos et al 2015 principal geochemical reactions include primary sulfide carbonate and silicate mineral dissolution and secondary mineral precipitation geochemical reaction rates are controlled by mineral abundance and particle size i e reactive surface area erguler and erguler 2015 often aggregated to describe waste rock reactivity lawrence and wang 1996 blowes et al 2003 price 2009 elghali et al 2019 and local geochemical conditions such as ph oxygen concentration and temperature relevant physical transport processes include gas heat and water transport through the unsaturated waste rock water infiltration is typically non uniform in waste rock piles that have a wide range of particle sizes orders of magnitude discrepancies may exist between the transport times of drainage fronts and thus dissolved solutes in addition mineral dissolution and precipitation can impact reactive surface area and porosity and thereby associated physical transport parameters seigneur et al 2019 gas reactions o2 consumption and co2 production induce concentration gradients that trigger diffusive gas transport respectively oxygen ingress has been shown to limit weathering rates in large systems with reactive materials vriens et al 2019c furthermore heat production from sulfide oxidation in large waste rock piles can result in temperatures as high as 70c lefebvre et al 2001 and induce thermal gas convection and impact geochemical equilibria and reaction rates all of the above processes are subject to vary with significant heterogeneity from small scale mineral impurities and textural variability to macroscale material heterogeneity e g as a result of rock blending and structural features such as traffic surfaces atherton 2017 wilson et al 2018 raymond et al 2020a the predictive success of a mechanistic model relies on identifying and taking into account the relevant processes and heterogeneities it is unpractical and unrealistic to quantify all these processes feedbacks and heterogeneities existing in waste rock piles reactive transport models are often constructed as simple as possible as complicated as necessary and incorporate only a select number of processes known or assumed to be relevant in the studied systems this selection will change with the goal of the model fit for purpose and availability of field data to parameterize the considered processes which complicates the deployment and cross validation of reactive transport models between sites only in few cases is the exclusion of certain processes justified by actual field data e g in situ temperature measurements to estimate thermal convection lefebvre et al 2001 the number of model parameters increases with the number of considered processes and over parametrization for the sake of fitting is a valid concern when field data is limited and physical parameters are challenging to quantify such as gas permeability preferential flow in piles with boulder sized waste rock as a result non uniqueness the multiple combinations of parametrized processes can be used to reproduce data carrera and neuman 1986 bethke 2007 is of particular concern when interpreting reactive transport simulations of waste rock systems finally waste rock models are often parameterized with physicochemical properties from small scale static and kinetic laboratory tests but the values of model parameters determined at small scales often differ from those needed in models at larger spatiotemporal scales i e hundreds of meters tall piles certain processes irrelevant to weathering rates in laboratory tests will gain significance at increasing scale thermal gradients and gas transport limitations preferential flow phenomena scaling factors have been proposed to facilitate the extrapolation of laboratory parameters onto practice relevant dimensions strÃ¶mberg and banwart 1999 malmstrÃ¶m et al 2000 plante et al 2014 but these are typically semi empirical correction factors based on limited mechanistic evidence process based reactive transport simulations constitute an alternative tool for waste rock drainage prediction provided that the critical processes and feedbacks are identified and reliable data are available to characterize these to this end we developed a process based reactive transport framework and use data from a long term multiscale research program at the antamina mine in peru to investigate physicochemical processes in the weathering of waste rock at antamina multiple types of waste rock have been extensively characterized hydraulically mineralogically and physically and weathered at different spatiotemporal scales providing a unique opportunity to quantify the relevance of individual weathering processes we focus on processes that could be well constrained experimentally i e grain size porosity hydraulic parameters and mineralogy and deploy a consistent model formulation across all experiments and waste rock types the adopted consistent model formulation is built on a one dimensional uniform flow description for all investigated experiments offering the opportunity for evidence based parametrization the limitations and scale dependence of the adopted model framework for larger scale heterogeneous systems is the focus of an associated article vriens et al 2020 this work uses the same model framework to examine individual processes underlying drainage dynamics across these experimental scales this work is structured as follows section 2 describes the reactive transport

compute the relative permeability and linkage between liquid saturation and hydraulic head see si all experiments were simulated as uniform 1d vertical flow systems where downward infiltration dominated the flow regime due to their limited heterogeneity and spatial scale i e limited lateral flow dispersion one dimensional vertical models are suited to describe the smaller scale experiments humidity cells field barrels and laboratory column as was shown by previous studies wilson et al 2018 pabst et al 2017 as larger scale piles usually display more heterogeneous flow dual porosity and dual permeability description might be more suited to capture preferential flow phenomena and short term drainage dynamics however dual domain formulations require additional parameters e g inter domain exchange terms that are challenging to constrain experimentally arora et al 2011 moreira et al 2016 additionally the impact of dual domain dynamics on mass loadings over a yearly timescale is unclear as will be shown below a uniform flow formulation was considered satisfactory for the purpose of this study which is to focus on the long term trends in the drainage geochemistry the mesoscale experimental piles represent a possibility to assess the capability of simplified model formulations to reproduce and predict long term drainage dynamics on larger scales vriens et al 2020 initial conditions for the unsaturated flow problem are constrained by volumetric water contents that were measured in the composite laboratory column as well as in the experimental piles representative average values were estimated for the field barrels the transient infiltration rate i e precipitation evapotranspiration at the top boundary and a constant volumetric water content at the bottom were selected to match observed outflow rates the humidity cell experimental wetting drying cycles complete saturation followed by gradual drying were mimicked by an averaged continuous flow that produced

top of the domain while a free exit is modeled at the bottom boundary all models utilize 2 cm gridblocks except the model for the experimental pile which was modeled using a coarser mesh 10 cm convergence is reached when the maximum concentration relative evolution between two successive iterations over every species and every node is below 10 6 convergence is assumed to not be reached above a certain number of newton raphson iteration after which min3p reduces the timestep also when the solver requires more than 12 iterations timestep is reduced the maximum allowed timestep was set to 12 h 2 2 2 geochemical reactions major minerals present in the waste rocks table s3 include the sulfide minerals pyrite chalcopyrite sphalerite molybdenite and galena other non sulfide primary phases included calcite and silicate minerals biotite albite quartz anorthite muscovite and wollastonite based on previous observations the following secondary minerals were considered gypsum ferrihydrite powellite conlan et al 2012 amorphous silica and aluminum wulfenite jarosite willemite skierszkan et al 2016 as well as several cu zn oxyhydr oxides sulfates and carbonates vriens et al 2019a the considered minerals are summarized up in table s5 and their rate expressions are given in table s6 we distinguished between quasi equilibrium and kinetic rate expressions for fast and reversible versus slower and irreversible dissolution reactions respectively reversible and fast reactions can effectively be described by generalized transition state theory rate expressions mayer et al 2002 lasaga and kirkpatrick 2018 with q m and k m representing respectively the ion activity product and the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and k eff the rate constant in mol dmbulk 3 s 1 4 r m k eff 1 q m k m for large rate coefficients this equation yields quasi equilibrium conditions if the mineral phase in question is present aqueous and gaseous equilibrium constants as well as aqueous speciation chemistry constants were adopted from the minteq v4 database irreversible slower mineral dissolution reactions were described by kinetic rate expressions adopted from the literature rate laws for sulfide and silicate minerals have been widely studied e g rimstidt et al 1994 all rate laws depend upon the experimental conditions and literature rate expressions are usually contain surface area normalized rate constants in mol m 2 s 1 and were corrected by what will be referred to as the reactive surface area a eff in m2 dmbulk 3 to capture sulfide oxidation by dissolved oxygen and ferric ion singer and stumm 1970 in a single rate expression the pyrite and sphalerite rate laws were adapted from williamson and rimstidt 1994 and pan et al 2012 respectively in the forms 5 r

and kimball et al 2010 were mostly developed under acidic conditions 1 ph 3 not representative of the wide range of drainage conditions encountered in our experiments 2 ph 9 furthermore chalcopyrite rate laws for ph 3 exhibited a high order dependence on ph h 1 68 considering the progressive acidification of over 5 ph units observed in some antamina experiments use of such a law would yield oxidation rates increasing by over 8 orders of magnitude therefore the oxidation of chalcopyrite but also that of molybdenite and galena was described by a simple first order dependence on dissolved oxygen 7 r chalcopyrite a eff chalco o 2 aq literature adopted kinetic rate expressions for all considered sulfide and silicate phases are summarized in table 1 2 3 model parametrization and calibration the reactive transport formulation was applied consistently to the 15 investigated experiments for all experiments system geometry table s1 waste rock bulk density and mineral abundance was measured and directly adopted only identified minerals table s3 were considered to calibrate the initial mineralogy for all experiments other than the humidity cells hydraulic parameters porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity and van genuchten parameters were adopted from previous tracer test analyses summarized in table s1 in all simulations the sames values of dispersivity Î´ specific storage coefficient s s and diffusivities d 0 g and d 0 l were used table s1 the only differences among the simulations of the various experiments were therefore i initial and boundary conditions for flow initial water content and recharge at the top boundary and ii effective mineral rate constants k eff eq 4 and surface area a eff in eqs 5 6 and 7 values as in table s6 for each simulation calibration proceeded in two steps first initial head conditions for flow were set to be representative of the average observed water content volumetric water content and the recharge boundary conditions were calibrated to reproduce the observed outflow except for the piles where recharge was calibrated to the observed weather record vriens et al 2019a once hydraulics were calibrated and subsequently fixed reactive surface area and effective rate coefficients a eff and k eff were adjusted to reproduce leachate concentrations in an informal trial and error fashion emphasis was placed on reproduction of long term drainage concentrations rather than initial spikes in the drainage concentrations arising from flushing of pre experimentally precipitated salts as such a eff and k eff values represent the sole geochemical calibration factors and aggregate all influences of other unaccounted processes on the outflow chemistry e g influence of temperature a number of hydrogeochemical

changes fall in the same category simulated changes in the volumes of mineral phases were small less than 10 for the most reactive waste rock the exclusion of other processes e g preferential flow and evolution of reactivity could not be justified from experimental evidence but limited or no data was available to support their parametrization across the investigated experiments hence these processes were not considered in line with our approach to develop a model as simple as possible as complicated as necessary and the effects of these unresolved processes are integrated by the fitted geochemical rate constants a quantitative analysis of these unresolved contributions is the primary focus of vriens et al 2020 while this study examines the ability of the model formulation and individual considered processes to capture long term drainage dynamics across experimental scales 2 4 sensitivity analyses individual processes and feedbacks were investigated through a sequence of sensitivity analyses run on calibrated simulation models specifically we considered the role of secondary mineral reaction rates sensitivity on k eff evolution of reactive surface area temporal evolution of a eff and the influence of hydraulic parameters and volumetric water content on drainage dynamics details and results of these sensitivity analyses can be found in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 humidity cells the humidity cell tests contained relatively homogeneous sieved waste rock with narrow particle size distributions and displayed no drainage acidification during the short term up to 40 weeks they were run the simulated compositions in all investigated humidity cell experiments are in good agreement with measured compositions fig 1 in all humidity cell experiments neutral drainage ph was observed simulations suggest that this is because of a stoichiometrically balanced sulfide oxidation and calcite dissolution whose rates were approximately 10 5 mol dmbulk 3 day 1 across waste rock types fig 2 these reasonable weathering rates suggest that no significant oxygen limitation occurs within the one week wetting cycles calibrated pyrite reactive surface area and calcite effective rate coefficients varied less than a factor 4 between all the investigated experiments table s6 humidity cell experiments are designed to examine whether the ap np balance affects the ultimate acidity and composition of drainage when all potential weathering products are mobilized as such humidity cells are assumed to not reach mineral saturation sapsford et al 2009 maest and nordstrom 2017 yet simulations reveal that some secondary mineral phases were close to saturation si 1 fig 2 precipitation of secondary fe oxyhydr oxides generalized as ferrihydrite in the model and a copper hydroxide cu oh 2 tenorite in the minteq database induced below detection limits concentrations of fe and cu in the drainage respectively simulations suggest that 50 150 mg kg of ferrihydrite 1 3 mmol over the 2 kg waste rock precipitated by the end of each humidity cell experiment low drainage concentrations of zn are primarily due to low zn abundance except for hc5 and the circumneutral ph which does not promote sphalerite oxidation eq 6 other near saturated secondary mineral phases included wulfenite whose precipitation attenuates mo as shown for humidity cell hc1 in figs 1 and 2 the simulated low cumulative precipitation of these secondary phases through time fig 2 indicates that these minerals would not be readily detectable with conventional mineralogical techniques humidity cell experiments with skarn and intrusive waste rock released significant ca and sulfate during the first 20 days possibly related to the dissolution of secondary gypsum that had precipitated on the waste rock prior to the start of the kinetic tests indeed inclusion of a small amount of gypsum 0 02 volume fraction to the mineral assemblage led to a better representation of the observed first flush dashed red line in fig 1 but was not further adopted in other simulations to ensure consistency across experiments 3 2 field barrels compared to the humidity cells field barrel experiments contained greater than two orders of magnitude more waste rock and were run more than 10 times longer for 9 years and under field conditions a wide range of drainage signatures was observed in the suite of field barrels ranging from meta stable seasonally oscillating circumneutral drainage to gradually acidifying drainage with orders of magnitude increases in metal loads fig 3 simulated drainage chemistries reproduce observed values for all investigated waste rock types fig 3 and additional field barrels in fig s3 including an accurate representation of temporal oscillation in drainage quality and quantity simulated volumetric water content and oxygen profiles can be found in fig s2 the seasonal variation in flow rates simulated for the field barrel experiments fig s1 affect the temporal evolution in simulated drainage chemistry fig 3 elevated infiltration during the wet season increases the waste rock water content and dilutes solutes simulated mineral dissolution rates e g r pyrite from eq 5 also oscillate in time fig 4 potentially due to the evolution of the air filled porosity that impacts oxygen supply to the waste rock in the field barrels simulations indicate that oxygen levels generally remain very close to atmospheric levels fig s2 with a minimum oxygen content of 70 compared to ambient conditions even for the most reactive field barrel even though oxygen depletion was therefore probably limited simulations suggest that small variations in oxygen and water content still impact sulfide oxidation rates through the evolution of ferrous and ferric iron concentrations eq 5 coarser grained materials like fb m1 table s2 are drier fig s2 less reactive and therefore have a rather constant oxygen profile fig s2 and stable oxidation rates fig 4 compared to finer grained and more reactive materials fb s4 or fb i9 also calcite weathering rates seem to be strongly correlated to the volumetric water content even for low reactivity field barrel with steady oxidation rates fb m1 on fig 4 this is further confirmed by sensitivity analysis fig s7 field barrels fb i2 intrusive fb s1 and fb s4 skarn fb h1 hornfels and fb m1 marble remained circumneutral for the 10 year study period however drainage from field barrel fb i9 intrusive transitioned from 6 5 to ph 3 within 3 years associated with orders of magnitude increasing concentrations of sulfate cu and zn fig 3 simulations show that this acidification was caused by depletion of calcite initially present in the field barrel 0 1 wt see table s3 within the first two years fig 4 the absence of buffering by calcite initiated a feedback where pyrite and sphalerite oxidations was accelerated through the decreasing ph and increasing ferric iron concentration eqs 5 and 6 fig 4 the model was able to capture such rate increases without adjustments to the fitted rate parameters because the rate expressions explicitly accounted for ph and dissolved iron concentrations eqs 5 and 6 simulations show that acid was buffered in fb i9 principally by dissolution of amorphous fe oxides ferrihydrite in fig 4 dissolves after 4 years and subsequently by dissolution of silicate phases such as wollastonite present at 2 wt in fb i9 table s3 albite and biotite fig 4 this sequence of mineral dissolution under increasingly acidic conditions reflects a typical acid rock drainage neutralization series sherlock et al 1995 amos et al 2015 vriens et al 2019a a number of secondary mineral phases identified in the field barrel experiments by st arnault et al 2019 and vriens et al 2019b were near saturation in the simulation including gypsum various fe cu oxyhydr oxides and cu hydroxy sulfates as well as willemite wulfenite and powellite as shown through their precipitation depicted in fig 4 this supports the notion that significant metal attenuation takes place under neutral drainage conditions for instance simulations suggest that 1 mol of secondary cu hydroxy sulfates 450 g of brochantite and 350 g of antlerite over the 350 kg waste rock precipitated in field barrel fb i9 during the first 4 years fig 4 with a conversion from brochantite to antlerite once acidic conditions developed within fb i9 both these phases rapidly re dissolved the net effect of this re dissolution coupled to the ongoing chalcopyrite oxidation explains the cu mobilization spike observed after 2 years fig 3 moreover precipitation of jarosite 1 4 g kg of waste rock acts to attenuate fe as ferrihydrite starts to dissolve under acidic ph fig 4 typically simulated drainage composition was highly sensitive to the secondary mineral assemblage as illustrated by the effect of the ferrihydrite reaction rate illustrated by a sensitivity analysis fig s5 in si the limit case where ferrihydrite is inert or not included in the model induces more acidic conditions in the drainage with a positive feedback on oxidation rates of primary minerals and therefore the overall sulfate loading these examples demonstrate the value of modelling to help identify secondary mineral controls that because of their low abundances or amorphicity would be challenging to determine experimentally in heterogeneous weathered waste rock there are other explanations for the limited buffering capacity of field barrel fb i9 a progressive passivation through secondary mineral precipitation e g st arnault et al 2019 or a reactivity decrease caused by preferential weathering of finer calcite grains beckingham et al 2016 seigneur et al 2019 as shown in the sensitivity analysis in the si fig s6 a better agreement between simulated and measured ca concentrations can be obtained by progressively reducing calcite reactivity k eff during dissolution the shrinking core model ritchie 1994 levenspiel 1998 or other approaches e g jeen et al 2007 to model the impact of precipitation on the decrease in reactivity could be considered to address decreasing mineral reactivity over the course of weathering however these approaches may also lack in experimental evidence to be properly parametrized e g the thickness and diffusivity of reactive rim that we are able to capture the essential solute mobilization dynamics from materials subject to field conditions displaying variable geochemical drainage conditions 2 ph 9 with different hydraulic behavior and geochemical properties which can be a priori estimated based on bulk average characterization of the waste rock systems demonstrates the robustness of our modelling approach the fitted pyrite reactive surface areas used in the field barrel simulations varied from each other by less than one order of magnitude and were generally two orders of magnitude lower than those used in the humidity cells simulations table s6 this difference is associated to the coarser grained rock and the effects of lower ambient temperature in the field barrels vriens et al 2020 the fitted pyrite reactive surface area for waste rock in fb i9 was lower than for fb i2 a similar reactive instrusive waste rock but with relatively larger grain size table s2 a strong correlation exists between the physical surface areas deduced from particle size distributions and fitted reactive surface areas vriens et al 2020 despite a lower surface area acid generation in fb i9 results from the low carbonate table s1 and high chalcopyrite tables s3 and s4 contents 3 3 composite laboratory column although similar in size to the field barrels and of shorter duration the laboratory column experiment added complexity because it was composed of three different waste rock types that were vertically stacked the bottom drainage carried the aggregate signal of all waste rock types yet observed drainage rates and internal moisture content profiles fig s1 and top right of fig 6 respectively could be well captured by our model using unadjusted hydraulic properties that were fixed for each waste rock layer simulated drainage chemistries generally agree with observations as well fig 5 the initial important flush of oxidation product observed for many elements fig 5 is because of the progressive build up occurring during the wetting up of the column the first 120 days where no outflow occurred and can be observed from the element concentration profiles fig 6 the laboratory column experiment produced basal drainage that was mildly acidic 4 5 ph 5 drainage was not sampled from within the column from the individual waste rock layers the simulated outflow chemistry matched that of the outflow when acidity was simulated as mostly produced in the uppermost layers that contained reactive waste rock with high sulfide content up to 6 wt table s3 and low np ap ratios at rates of up to 10 5 mol dmbulk 3 day 1 see fig s4 local porewater ph in the uppermost column layers dropped to ph 2 5 while sulfide oxidation and acidity production were negligible in the bottom marble rock these sulfide oxidation rates are comparable to those simulated for field barrels with similarly reactive waste rock e g up to 10 5 mol dmbulk 3 day 1 fb i9 fig 4 simulated pyrite reactive surface areas for the column top layer were higher those used in the field barrels but lower than the humidity cells the simulations suggest that wollastonite which was identified in the central part of the column table s3 is the primary buffering phase in the more reactive waste rock segments 10 5 mol dmbulk 3 day 1 see fig s4 several mineral phases were saturated in the top waste rock layers fig 6 e g amorphous silica and fe oxides as well as jarosite and cu hydroxy sulfate phases these are the same mineral phases important to obtain a quantitative agreement between measured and simulated acidic drainage of field barrel fb i9 which had waste rock similar to that in the top layers in the laboratory column our reactive transport framework therefore suggests that incorporation of these phases is important for simulating acid rock drainage the fact that the composite column drainage had a ph 5 implies that neutralization of acidic drainage percolating from the uppermost layers in the lower marble layer was not very effective this is surprising considering that the bottom marble layer consisted virtually exclusively of carbonates and silicates up to 75 wt calcite table s3 the ineffective neutralization can be explained by smaller relative surface areas coarse grains within this layer see table s2 and a shorter contact time with percolating drainage through flow channeling despite the observed limited neutralization the drainage contains significant ca 500 mg l which cannot have been solely produced from wollastonite dissolution as indicated by the low aqueous si concentrations as the drainage composition is in equilibrium with gypsum throughout the duration of the laboratory experiment fig 6 the slightly acidic ph and high ca and sulfate concentrations likely are due to the dissolution of pre existing gypsum which formed during waste rock storage prior to the experimental period blackmore et al 2018b pre experimental gypsum could act as a passivation agent reducing calcite dissolution during the experiment st arnault et al 2019 as only one single seasonal infiltration cycle was applied these simulations depend strongly on the uncertain initial first flush conditions further research over several pore volumes of infiltration is required to disentangle the roles of surface area passivation and flow channeling on the observed drainage dynamics 3 4 experimental piles the experimental waste rock piles are the largest experiments in the antamina research program while seasonal flow variability for the smaller scale systems examined thus far could be quantitatively reproduced by the adopted uniform flow description seasonal variation in drainage rates from the larger experimental piles was significantly muted even though cumulative long term dynamics were well captured fig s1 this suggests that a uniform description may be valid for smaller scale experiments with limited physical heterogeneity but a single domain flow description cannot reproduce seasonal oscillations at larger scales because of the increased heterogeneity and contribution of preferential flow paths this aligns with tracer test results from antamina that have shown that matrix flow dominates transport at smaller scales but that multi domain flow formulations better capture solute dynamics from larger scale experiments with strong contrasts in hydraulic properties blackmore et al 2014 pedretti et al 2017 with fast flow amounting up to 15 of the total flow additional research is required to study how representative our single continuum mineral rates are compared to those in a multiple continuum formulation and whether the single continuum approach can be applied at even larger spatial scales while drainage from sublysimeter piles 1c and 3c remained neutral over the course of a decade drainage in pile 2c acidified over several years fig 7 similar to what was observed for field barrel fb i9 both systems consisted of reactive sulfide rich waste rock vriens et al 2019a oxygen distributions can be highly non uniform throughout the piles vriens et al 2019c even though no significant thermal gradients have been observed in the experimental piles advective driven supply of oxygen through the height of the pile is likely especially near the atmospheric boundaries vriens et al 2019c indeed in large scale waste rock piles the generally coarser particles and larger pores promote oxygen ingress by barometric wind driven advection through the pile batters amos et al 2009 vriens et al 2018 2019c our simulation of pile 2c suggests that a purely diffusive flux from oxygen from the top boundary is not sufficient to maintain sulfide oxidation rates high enough to produce the measured sulfate concentrations in the leachates 50 g l 1 this suggests that oxygen depletion is unlikely and that oxygen is supplied laterally through the pile batters by either diffusion and possibly advection a lateral oxygen source is represented in the 1 d model as a constant oxygen pressure through the height of the pile 2c our adopted reactive transport framework and pile geometry do not explicitly include oxygen transport through sideward ingress into the piles therefore the experimental waste rock piles serve as a final test of the adopted one dimensional uniform model formulation to reproduce waste rock drainage dynamics at larger scales the material in experimental pile 2c is similar to that in field barrel fb i9 tables s3 and s4 and a quantitative comparison of reactive transport parameters between these two experiments can provide useful information regarding scale dependence of the adopted model vriens et al 2020 simulated sulfide oxidation rates in piles 1 3 varied between 10 9 and 10 6 mol dmbulk 3 day 1 and align with bulk weathering rates that were experimentally determined from drainage loading rates temperature profiles and in situ poregas measurements i e converted to molar units 10 7 and 10 10 mol s dmbulk 3 day 1 vriens et al 2019a simulated pyrite reactive surface areas for the experimental piles were more than one order of magnitude lower compared to the field barrels the reproduction of drainage acidification in pile 2c drainage was accompanied by acid buffering dissolution of carbonate fe al oxides and silicate minerals fig 8 similar to the neutralization sequence described for fb i9 above fig 4 with influence of cu sulfate antlerite brochantite and jarosite additionally simulated precipitation of secondary minerals aligned between simulations of fb i9 and pile 2c fig 4 and fig 8 with a general one order of magnitude lower cumulative precipitation our reactive transport framework was able to simulate both fb i9 and pile 2c systems with same rock but on different scales using similar geochemical factors sulfide and silicate reactive surface areas and calcite effective rate constants table s6 finally in all experimental piles simulated drainage quality was strongly influenced by equilibria with calcite ferrihydrite and gypsum fig 8 simulated zinc concentrations were regulated by the precipitation dissolution of willemite a zinc silicate which has been previously identified at antamina as a candidate for zinc attenuation skierszkan et al 2016 the larger sizes of the waste rock piles and higher average hydraulic residence time of 1 year in the piles much longer than those in the smaller scale experiments investigated allowed secondary minerals precipitates to larger extents this yields a higher sensitivity to secondary mineral reaction rates compared to smaller scale field barrel fb i9 fig s5 4 conclusions reactive transport modelling of coupled geochemical and physical transport processes governing waste rock weathering and drainage is prone to uncertainties associated with process selection and parameterization the consistent reactive transport model we used to simulate the widely varying waste rock systems represents a trade off between data availability resolution and quality versus model sophistication and parameter identifiability well constrained processes with high quality data allowed some processes and properties to be represented with higher confidence we have a reasonably good control on bulk average mineral abundances and therefore waste rock reactivity as well as on grain size distributions and hydraulic tracer tested parameters of the waste rock yet some features such as the details of internal heterogeneity within the larger scale piles remained unquantifiable e g permeability and require calibration the deployed 1 d single domain approach captured trends of smaller scale experiments with good mass balance but it sacrificed spatiotemporal accuracy for identifiable model parameters on longer term larger scale experiments fit for the purpose of assessing long term drainage patterns but perhaps not shorter time scale fluctuations or the geochemistry at specific internal locations still it remains to be determined how the misrepresentation of internal saturation profiles affects mineral reaction rates and our upscaling approach the presented model was applied to quantify individual processes and feedbacks contributing to drainage dynamics simulations show that oxygen availability reduced mineral reaction rates predominantly in simulations of larger scale experiments 10 m with reactive several wt s waste rock reactive mineral surface areas estimated from physical grain size distributions provided consistent proportionality and could be used to reproduce weathering dynamics of the same rock types on different experimental scales finally our reactive transport model revealed that secondary minerals play a critical role in controlling drainage quality with key phases in the simulated experiments being based on experimental identification in prior studies e g gypsum fe oxyhydroxides as well as less abundant phases such as antlerite and brochantite while antlerite and brochantite may serve as surrogates for all cu sulfates observational data suggests low abundance and poor crystallinity less abundant secondary phases were crucial to reproduce certain drainage dynamics for instance cu mobilization under acidifying conditions in field barrel fb i9 and experimental pile 2c our results highlight the use of process oriented and field parameterized models to resolve dynamics that are challenging to identify experimentally especially from smaller scale tests of shorter duration overall we have shown that a well chosen model formulation applied consistently and utilizing readily available parameters and thermodynamic data can explain drainage dynamics from waste rock systems across several orders of magnitude different scales while only fitting key reaction rate parameters many of the most consequential properties particularly mineral abundances and grain size distributions can be constrained a priori reducing the uncertainty and number of fitting parameters that must be determined hence our model formulation is useful to explain the processes in the experiments examined here and may be useful for similar and larger scale systems however some processes such as heat transport and gas migration convection or preferential flow blackmore et al 2014 are negligible on the scales examined here applicability of our approach is thus restricted to relatively small scale experiment displaying low degrees of heterogeneity similarly its performance for predictive purposes remains to be demonstrated vriens et al 2020 as processes affecting mineral reactivity and weathering rates on longer timescales e g reduced through passivation were not considered despite these uncertainties this work demonstrates that evidence based reactive transport models that explicitly account for key processes and are parametrized experimentally may be used to examine and possibly predict waste rock weathering dynamics across a laboratory to practice scale range contributing to improved risk

1458,prediction of drainage quantity and quality is critical to reduce the environmental risks associated with weathering mine waste rock reactive transport models can be effective tools to understand and disentangle the processes underlying waste rock weathering and drainage but their validity and applicability can be impaired by poor parametrization and the non uniqueness conundrum here a process based multicomponent reactive transport model is presented to interpret and quantify the processes affecting drainage quantity and quality from 15 waste rock experiments from the antamina mine peru the deployed uniform flow formulation and consistent set of geochemical rate equations could be calibrated almost exclusively with measured bulk waste rock properties in experiments ranging from 2 kg to 6500 tons in size the quantitative agreement between simulated dynamics and the observed drainage records for systems with a variety of rock lithologies and over a wide range of ph supports the proposed selection of processes the controls of important physicochemical processes and feedbacks such as secondary mineral precipitation surface passivation oxygen limitations were confirmed through sensitivity analyses our work shows that reactive transport models with a consistent formulation and evidence based parametrization can be used to explain waste rock drainage dynamics across

unsaturated waste rock water infiltration is typically non uniform in waste rock piles that have a wide range of particle sizes orders of magnitude discrepancies may exist between the transport times of drainage fronts and thus dissolved solutes in addition mineral dissolution and precipitation can impact reactive surface area and porosity and thereby associated physical transport parameters seigneur et al 2019 gas reactions o2 consumption and co2 production induce concentration gradients that trigger diffusive gas transport respectively oxygen ingress has been shown to limit weathering rates in large systems with reactive materials vriens et al 2019c furthermore heat production from sulfide oxidation in large waste rock piles can result in temperatures as high as 70c lefebvre et al 2001 and induce thermal gas convection and impact geochemical equilibria and reaction rates all of the above processes are subject to vary with significant heterogeneity from small scale mineral impurities and textural variability to macroscale material heterogeneity e g as a result of rock blending and structural features such as traffic surfaces atherton 2017 wilson et al 2018 raymond et al 2020a the predictive success of a mechanistic model relies on identifying and taking into account the relevant processes and heterogeneities it is unpractical and unrealistic to quantify all these processes feedbacks and heterogeneities existing in waste rock piles reactive transport models are often constructed as simple as possible as complicated as necessary and incorporate only a select number of processes known or assumed to be relevant in the studied systems this selection will change with the goal of the model fit for purpose and availability of field data to parameterize the considered processes which complicates the deployment and cross validation of reactive transport models between sites only in few cases is the exclusion of certain processes justified by actual field data e g in situ temperature measurements to estimate thermal convection lefebvre et al 2001 the number of model parameters increases with the number of considered processes and over parametrization for the sake of fitting is a valid concern when field data is limited and physical parameters are challenging to quantify such as gas permeability preferential flow in piles with boulder sized waste rock as a result non uniqueness the multiple combinations of parametrized processes can be used to reproduce data carrera and neuman 1986 bethke 2007 is of particular concern when interpreting reactive transport simulations of waste rock systems finally waste rock models are often parameterized with physicochemical properties from small scale static and kinetic laboratory tests but the values of model parameters determined at small scales often differ from those needed in models at larger spatiotemporal scales i e hundreds of meters tall piles certain processes irrelevant to weathering rates in laboratory tests will gain significance at increasing scale thermal gradients and gas transport limitations preferential flow phenomena scaling factors have been proposed to facilitate the extrapolation of laboratory parameters onto practice relevant dimensions strÃ¶mberg and banwart 1999 malmstrÃ¶m et al 2000 plante et al 2014 but these are typically semi empirical correction factors based on limited mechanistic evidence process based reactive transport simulations constitute an alternative tool for waste rock drainage prediction provided that the critical processes and feedbacks are identified and reliable data are available to characterize these to this end we developed a process based reactive transport framework and use data from a long term multiscale research program at the antamina mine in peru to investigate physicochemical processes in the weathering of waste rock at antamina multiple types of waste rock have been extensively characterized hydraulically mineralogically and physically and weathered at different spatiotemporal scales providing a unique opportunity to quantify the relevance of individual weathering processes we focus on processes that could be well constrained experimentally i e grain size porosity hydraulic parameters and mineralogy and deploy a consistent model formulation across all experiments and

compute the relative permeability and linkage between liquid saturation and hydraulic head see si all experiments were simulated as uniform 1d vertical flow systems where downward infiltration dominated the flow regime due to their limited heterogeneity and spatial scale i e limited lateral flow dispersion one dimensional vertical models are suited to describe the smaller scale experiments humidity cells field barrels and laboratory column as was shown by previous studies wilson et al 2018 pabst et al 2017 as larger scale piles usually display more heterogeneous flow dual porosity and dual permeability description might be more suited to capture preferential flow phenomena and short term drainage dynamics however dual domain formulations require additional parameters e g inter domain exchange terms that are challenging to constrain experimentally arora et al 2011 moreira et al 2016 additionally the impact of dual domain dynamics on mass loadings over a yearly timescale is unclear as will be shown below a uniform flow formulation was considered satisfactory for the purpose of this study which is to focus on the long term trends in the drainage geochemistry the mesoscale experimental piles represent a possibility to assess the capability of simplified model formulations to reproduce and predict long term drainage dynamics on larger scales vriens et al 2020 initial conditions for the unsaturated flow problem are constrained by volumetric water contents that were measured in the composite laboratory column as well as in the experimental piles representative average values were estimated for the field barrels the transient infiltration rate i e precipitation evapotranspiration at the top boundary and a constant volumetric water content at the bottom were

convergence is reached when the maximum concentration relative evolution between two successive iterations over every species and every node is below 10 6 convergence is assumed to not be reached above a certain number of newton raphson iteration after which min3p reduces the timestep also when the solver requires more than 12 iterations timestep is reduced the maximum allowed timestep was set to 12 h 2 2 2 geochemical reactions major minerals present in the waste rocks table s3 include the sulfide minerals pyrite chalcopyrite sphalerite molybdenite and galena other non sulfide primary phases included calcite and silicate minerals biotite albite quartz anorthite muscovite and wollastonite based on previous observations the following secondary minerals were considered gypsum

2019a the considered minerals are summarized up in table s5 and their rate expressions are given in table s6 we distinguished between quasi equilibrium and kinetic rate expressions for fast and reversible versus slower and irreversible dissolution reactions respectively reversible and fast reactions can effectively be described by generalized transition state theory rate expressions mayer et

storage coefficient s s and diffusivities d 0 g and d 0 l were used table s1 the only differences among the simulations of the various experiments were therefore i initial and boundary conditions for flow initial water content and recharge at the top boundary and ii effective mineral rate constants k eff eq 4 and surface area a eff in eqs 5 6 and 7 values as in table s6 for each simulation calibration proceeded in two steps first initial head conditions for flow were set to be representative of the average observed water content volumetric water content and the recharge boundary conditions were calibrated to reproduce the observed outflow except for the piles where recharge was calibrated to the observed weather record vriens et al 2019a once hydraulics were calibrated and subsequently fixed reactive surface area and effective rate coefficients a eff and k eff were adjusted to reproduce leachate concentrations in an informal trial and error fashion emphasis was placed on reproduction of long term drainage concentrations rather than initial spikes in the drainage concentrations arising from flushing of pre experimentally precipitated salts as such a eff and k eff

changes fall in the same category simulated changes in the volumes of mineral phases were small less than 10 for the most reactive waste rock the exclusion of other processes e g preferential flow and evolution of reactivity could not be justified from experimental evidence but limited or no data was available to support their parametrization across the investigated experiments hence these processes were not considered in line with our approach to develop a model as simple as possible as complicated as necessary and the effects of these unresolved processes are integrated by the fitted geochemical rate constants a quantitative analysis of these unresolved contributions is the primary focus of vriens et al 2020 while this study examines the ability of the model formulation and individual considered processes to capture long term drainage dynamics across experimental scales 2 4 sensitivity analyses individual processes and feedbacks were investigated through a sequence of sensitivity analyses run on calibrated simulation models specifically we considered the role of secondary mineral reaction rates sensitivity on k eff evolution of reactive surface area temporal evolution of a eff and the influence of hydraulic parameters and volumetric water content on drainage dynamics details and results of these sensitivity analyses can be found in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 humidity cells the humidity cell tests contained relatively homogeneous sieved waste rock with narrow particle size distributions and displayed no drainage acidification during the short term up to 40 weeks they were run the simulated compositions in all investigated humidity cell experiments are in good agreement with measured compositions fig 1 in all humidity cell experiments neutral drainage ph was observed simulations suggest that this is because of a stoichiometrically balanced sulfide oxidation and calcite dissolution whose rates were approximately 10 5 mol dmbulk 3 day 1 across waste rock types fig 2 these reasonable weathering rates suggest that no significant oxygen limitation occurs within the one week wetting cycles calibrated pyrite reactive surface area and calcite effective rate coefficients varied less than a factor 4 between all the investigated experiments table s6 humidity cell experiments are designed to examine whether the ap np balance affects the ultimate acidity and composition of drainage when all potential weathering products are mobilized as such humidity cells are assumed to not reach mineral saturation sapsford et al 2009 maest and nordstrom 2017 yet simulations reveal that some secondary mineral phases were close to saturation si 1 fig 2 precipitation of secondary fe oxyhydr oxides generalized as ferrihydrite in the model and a copper hydroxide cu oh 2 tenorite in the minteq database induced below detection limits concentrations of fe and cu in the drainage respectively simulations suggest that 50 150 mg kg of ferrihydrite 1 3 mmol over the 2 kg waste rock precipitated by the end of each humidity cell experiment low drainage concentrations of zn are primarily due to low zn abundance except for hc5 and the circumneutral ph which does not promote sphalerite oxidation eq 6 other near saturated secondary mineral phases included wulfenite whose precipitation attenuates mo as shown for humidity cell hc1 in figs 1 and 2 the simulated low cumulative precipitation of these secondary phases through time fig 2 indicates that these minerals would not be readily detectable with conventional mineralogical techniques humidity cell experiments with skarn and intrusive waste rock released significant ca and sulfate during the first 20 days possibly related to the dissolution of secondary gypsum that had precipitated on the waste rock prior to the start of the kinetic tests indeed inclusion of a small amount of gypsum 0 02 volume fraction to the mineral assemblage led to a better representation of the observed first flush dashed red line in fig 1 but was not further adopted in other simulations to ensure consistency across experiments 3 2 field barrels compared to the humidity cells field barrel experiments contained greater than two orders of magnitude more waste rock and were run more than 10 times longer for 9 years and under field conditions a wide range of drainage signatures was observed in the suite of field barrels ranging from meta stable seasonally oscillating circumneutral drainage to gradually acidifying drainage with orders of magnitude increases in metal loads fig 3 simulated drainage chemistries reproduce observed values for all investigated waste rock types fig 3 and additional field barrels in fig s3 including an accurate representation of temporal oscillation in drainage quality and quantity simulated volumetric water content and oxygen profiles can be found in fig s2 the seasonal variation in flow rates simulated for the field barrel experiments fig s1 affect the temporal evolution in simulated drainage chemistry fig 3 elevated infiltration during the wet season increases the waste rock water content and dilutes solutes simulated mineral dissolution rates e g r pyrite from eq 5 also oscillate in time fig 4 potentially due to the evolution of the air filled porosity that impacts oxygen supply to the waste rock in the field barrels simulations indicate that oxygen levels generally remain very close to atmospheric levels fig s2 with a minimum oxygen content of 70 compared to ambient conditions even for the most reactive field barrel even though oxygen depletion was therefore probably limited simulations suggest that small variations in oxygen and water content still impact sulfide oxidation rates through the evolution of ferrous and ferric iron concentrations eq 5 coarser grained materials like fb m1 table s2 are drier fig s2 less reactive and therefore have a rather constant oxygen profile fig s2 and stable oxidation rates fig 4 compared to finer grained and more reactive materials fb s4 or fb i9 also calcite weathering rates seem to be strongly correlated to the volumetric water content even for low reactivity field barrel with steady oxidation rates fb m1 on fig 4 this is further confirmed by sensitivity analysis fig s7 field barrels fb i2 intrusive fb s1 and fb s4 skarn fb h1 hornfels and fb m1 marble remained circumneutral for the 10 year study period however drainage from field barrel fb i9 intrusive transitioned from 6 5 to ph 3 within 3 years associated with orders of magnitude increasing concentrations of sulfate cu and zn fig 3 simulations show that this acidification was caused by depletion of calcite initially present in the field barrel 0 1 wt see table s3 within the first two years fig 4 the absence of buffering by calcite initiated a feedback where pyrite and sphalerite oxidations was accelerated through the decreasing ph and increasing ferric iron concentration eqs 5 and 6 fig 4 the model was able to capture such rate increases without adjustments to the fitted rate parameters because the rate expressions explicitly accounted for ph and dissolved iron concentrations eqs 5 and 6 simulations show that acid was buffered in fb i9 principally by dissolution of amorphous fe oxides ferrihydrite in fig 4 dissolves after 4 years and subsequently by dissolution of silicate phases such as wollastonite present at 2 wt in fb i9 table s3 albite and biotite fig 4 this sequence of mineral dissolution under increasingly acidic conditions reflects a typical acid rock drainage neutralization series sherlock et al 1995 amos et al 2015 vriens et al 2019a a number of secondary mineral phases identified in the field barrel experiments by st arnault et al 2019 and vriens et al 2019b were near saturation in the simulation including gypsum various fe cu oxyhydr oxides and cu hydroxy sulfates as well as willemite wulfenite and powellite as shown through their precipitation depicted in fig 4 this supports the notion that significant metal attenuation takes place under neutral drainage conditions for instance simulations suggest that 1 mol of secondary cu hydroxy sulfates 450 g of brochantite and 350 g of antlerite over the 350 kg waste rock precipitated in field barrel fb i9 during the first 4 years fig 4 with a conversion from brochantite to antlerite once acidic conditions developed within fb i9 both these phases rapidly re dissolved the net effect of this re dissolution coupled to the ongoing chalcopyrite oxidation explains the cu mobilization spike observed after 2 years fig 3 moreover precipitation of jarosite 1 4 g kg of waste rock acts to attenuate fe as ferrihydrite starts to dissolve under acidic ph fig 4 typically simulated drainage composition was highly sensitive to the secondary mineral assemblage as illustrated by the effect of the ferrihydrite reaction rate illustrated by a sensitivity analysis fig s5 in si the limit case where ferrihydrite is inert or not included in the model induces more acidic conditions in the drainage with a positive feedback on oxidation rates of primary minerals and therefore the overall sulfate loading these examples demonstrate the value of modelling to help identify secondary mineral controls that because of their low abundances or amorphicity would be challenging to determine experimentally in heterogeneous weathered waste rock there are other explanations for the limited buffering capacity of field barrel fb i9 a progressive passivation through secondary mineral precipitation e g st arnault et al 2019 or a reactivity decrease caused by preferential weathering of finer calcite grains beckingham et al 2016 seigneur et al 2019 as shown in the sensitivity analysis in the si fig s6 a better agreement between simulated and measured ca concentrations can be obtained by progressively reducing calcite reactivity k eff during dissolution the shrinking core model ritchie 1994 levenspiel 1998 or other approaches e g jeen et al 2007 to model the impact of precipitation on the decrease in reactivity could be considered to address decreasing mineral reactivity over the course of weathering however these approaches may also lack in experimental evidence to be properly parametrized e g the thickness and diffusivity of reactive rim that we are able to capture the essential solute mobilization dynamics from materials subject to field conditions displaying variable geochemical drainage conditions 2 ph 9 with different hydraulic behavior and geochemical properties which can be a priori estimated based on bulk average characterization of the waste rock systems demonstrates the robustness of our modelling approach the fitted pyrite reactive surface areas used in the field barrel simulations varied from each other by less than one order of magnitude and were generally two orders of magnitude lower than those used in the humidity cells simulations table s6 this difference is associated to the coarser grained rock and the effects of lower ambient temperature in the field barrels vriens et al 2020 the fitted pyrite reactive surface area for waste rock in fb i9 was lower than for fb i2 a similar reactive instrusive waste rock but with relatively larger grain size table s2 a strong correlation exists between the physical surface areas deduced from particle size distributions and fitted reactive surface areas vriens et al 2020 despite a lower surface area acid generation in fb i9 results from the low carbonate table s1 and high chalcopyrite tables s3 and s4 contents 3 3 composite laboratory column although similar in size to the field barrels and of shorter duration the laboratory column experiment added complexity because it was composed of three different waste rock types that were vertically stacked the bottom drainage carried the aggregate signal of all waste rock types yet observed drainage rates and internal moisture content profiles fig s1 and top right of fig 6 respectively could be well captured by our model using unadjusted hydraulic properties that were fixed for each waste rock layer simulated drainage chemistries generally agree with observations as well fig 5 the initial important flush of oxidation product observed for many elements fig 5 is because of the progressive build up occurring during the wetting up of the column the first 120 days where no outflow occurred and can be observed from the element concentration profiles fig 6 the laboratory column experiment produced basal drainage that was mildly acidic 4 5 ph 5 drainage was not sampled from within the column from the individual waste rock layers the simulated outflow chemistry matched that of the outflow when acidity was simulated as mostly produced in the uppermost layers that contained reactive waste rock with high sulfide content up to 6 wt table s3 and low np ap ratios at rates of up to 10 5 mol dmbulk 3 day 1 see fig s4 local porewater ph in the uppermost column layers dropped to ph 2 5 while sulfide oxidation and acidity production were negligible in the bottom marble rock these sulfide oxidation rates are comparable to those simulated for field barrels with similarly reactive waste rock e g up to 10 5 mol dmbulk 3 day 1 fb i9 fig 4 simulated pyrite reactive surface areas for the column top layer were higher those used in the field barrels but lower than the humidity cells the simulations suggest that wollastonite which was identified in the central part of the column table s3 is the primary buffering phase in the more reactive waste rock segments 10 5 mol dmbulk 3 day 1 see fig s4 several mineral phases were saturated in the top waste rock layers fig 6 e g amorphous silica and fe oxides as well as jarosite and cu hydroxy sulfate phases these are the same mineral phases important to obtain a quantitative agreement between measured and simulated acidic drainage of field barrel fb i9 which had waste rock similar to that in the top layers in the laboratory column our reactive transport framework therefore suggests that incorporation of these phases is important for simulating acid rock drainage the fact that the composite column drainage had a ph 5 implies that neutralization of acidic drainage percolating from the uppermost layers in the lower marble layer was not very effective this is surprising considering that the bottom marble layer consisted virtually exclusively of carbonates and silicates up to 75 wt calcite table s3 the ineffective neutralization can be explained by smaller relative surface areas coarse grains within this layer see table s2 and a shorter contact time with percolating drainage through flow channeling despite the observed limited neutralization the drainage contains significant ca 500 mg l which cannot have been solely produced from wollastonite dissolution as indicated by the low aqueous si concentrations as the drainage composition is in equilibrium with gypsum throughout the duration of the laboratory experiment fig 6 the slightly acidic ph and high ca and sulfate concentrations likely are due to the dissolution of pre existing gypsum which formed during waste rock storage prior to the experimental period blackmore et al 2018b pre experimental gypsum could act as a passivation agent reducing calcite dissolution during the experiment st arnault et al 2019 as only one single seasonal infiltration cycle was applied these simulations depend strongly on the uncertain initial first flush conditions further research over several pore volumes of infiltration is required to disentangle the roles of surface area passivation and flow channeling on the observed drainage dynamics 3 4 experimental piles the experimental waste rock piles are the largest experiments in the antamina research program while seasonal flow variability for the smaller scale systems examined thus far could be quantitatively reproduced by the adopted uniform flow description seasonal variation in drainage rates from the larger experimental piles was significantly muted even though cumulative long term dynamics were well captured fig s1 this suggests that a uniform description may be valid for smaller scale experiments with limited physical heterogeneity but a single domain flow description cannot reproduce seasonal oscillations at larger scales because of the increased heterogeneity and contribution of preferential flow paths this aligns with tracer test results from antamina that have shown that matrix flow dominates transport at smaller scales but that multi domain flow formulations better capture solute dynamics from larger scale experiments with strong contrasts in hydraulic properties blackmore et al 2014 pedretti et al 2017 with fast flow amounting up to 15 of the total flow additional research is required to study how representative our single continuum mineral rates are compared to those in a multiple continuum formulation and whether the single continuum approach can be applied at even larger spatial scales while drainage from sublysimeter piles 1c and 3c remained neutral over the course of a decade drainage in pile 2c acidified over several years fig 7 similar to what was observed for field barrel fb i9 both systems consisted of reactive sulfide rich waste rock vriens et al 2019a oxygen distributions can be highly non uniform throughout the piles vriens et al 2019c even though no significant thermal gradients have been observed in the experimental piles advective driven supply of oxygen through the height of the pile is likely especially near the atmospheric boundaries vriens et al 2019c indeed in large scale waste rock piles the generally coarser particles and larger pores promote oxygen ingress by barometric wind driven advection through the pile batters amos et al 2009 vriens et al 2018 2019c our simulation of pile 2c suggests that a purely diffusive flux from oxygen from the top boundary is not sufficient to maintain sulfide oxidation rates high enough to produce the measured sulfate concentrations in the leachates 50 g l 1 this suggests that oxygen depletion is unlikely and that oxygen is supplied laterally through the pile batters by either diffusion and possibly advection a lateral oxygen source is represented in the 1 d model as a constant oxygen pressure through the height of the pile 2c our adopted reactive transport framework and pile geometry do not explicitly include oxygen transport through sideward ingress into the piles therefore the experimental waste rock piles serve as a final test of the adopted one dimensional uniform model formulation to reproduce waste rock drainage dynamics at larger scales the material in experimental pile 2c is similar to that in field barrel fb i9 tables s3 and s4 and a quantitative comparison of reactive transport parameters between these two experiments can provide useful information regarding scale dependence of the adopted model vriens et al 2020 simulated sulfide oxidation rates in piles 1 3 varied between 10 9 and 10 6 mol dmbulk 3 day 1 and align with bulk weathering rates that were experimentally determined from drainage loading rates temperature profiles and in situ poregas measurements i e converted to molar units 10 7 and 10 10 mol s dmbulk 3 day 1 vriens et al 2019a simulated pyrite reactive surface areas for the experimental piles were more than one order of magnitude lower compared to the field barrels the reproduction of drainage acidification in pile 2c drainage was accompanied by acid buffering dissolution of carbonate fe al oxides and silicate minerals fig 8 similar to the neutralization sequence described for fb i9 above fig 4 with influence of cu sulfate antlerite brochantite and jarosite additionally simulated precipitation of secondary minerals aligned between simulations of fb i9 and pile 2c fig 4 and fig 8 with a general one order of magnitude lower cumulative precipitation our reactive transport framework was able to simulate both fb i9 and pile 2c systems with same rock but on different scales using similar geochemical factors sulfide and silicate reactive surface areas and calcite effective rate constants table s6 finally in all experimental piles simulated drainage quality was strongly influenced by equilibria with calcite ferrihydrite and gypsum fig 8 simulated zinc concentrations were regulated by the precipitation dissolution of willemite a zinc silicate which has been previously identified at antamina as a candidate for zinc attenuation skierszkan et al 2016 the larger sizes of the waste rock piles and higher average hydraulic residence time of 1 year in the piles much longer than those in the smaller scale experiments investigated allowed secondary minerals precipitates to larger extents this yields a higher sensitivity to secondary mineral reaction rates compared to smaller scale field barrel fb i9 fig s5 4 conclusions reactive transport modelling of coupled geochemical and physical transport processes governing waste rock weathering and drainage is prone to uncertainties associated with process selection and parameterization the consistent reactive transport model we used to simulate the widely varying waste rock systems represents a trade off between data availability resolution and quality versus model sophistication and parameter identifiability well constrained processes with high quality data allowed some processes and properties to be represented with higher confidence we have a reasonably good control on bulk average mineral abundances and therefore waste rock reactivity as well as on grain size distributions and hydraulic tracer tested parameters of the waste rock yet some features such as the details of internal heterogeneity within the larger scale piles remained unquantifiable e g permeability and require calibration the deployed 1 d single domain approach captured trends of smaller scale experiments with good mass balance but it sacrificed spatiotemporal accuracy for identifiable model parameters on longer term larger scale experiments fit for the purpose of assessing long term drainage patterns but perhaps not shorter time scale fluctuations or the geochemistry at specific internal locations still it remains to be determined how the misrepresentation of internal saturation profiles affects mineral reaction rates and our upscaling approach the presented model was applied to quantify individual processes and feedbacks contributing to drainage dynamics simulations show that oxygen availability reduced mineral reaction rates predominantly in simulations of larger scale experiments 10 m with reactive several wt s waste rock reactive mineral surface areas estimated from physical grain size distributions provided consistent proportionality and could be used to reproduce weathering dynamics of the same rock types on different experimental scales finally our reactive transport model revealed that secondary minerals play a critical role in controlling drainage quality with key phases in the simulated experiments being based on experimental identification in prior studies e g gypsum fe oxyhydroxides as well as less abundant phases such as antlerite and brochantite while antlerite and brochantite may serve as surrogates for all cu sulfates observational data suggests low abundance and poor crystallinity less abundant secondary phases were crucial to reproduce certain drainage dynamics for instance cu mobilization under acidifying conditions in field barrel fb i9 and experimental pile 2c our results highlight the use of process oriented and field parameterized models to resolve dynamics that are challenging to identify experimentally especially from smaller scale tests of shorter duration overall we have shown that a well chosen model formulation applied consistently and utilizing readily available parameters and thermodynamic data can explain drainage dynamics from waste rock systems across several orders of magnitude different scales while only fitting key reaction rate parameters many of the most consequential properties particularly mineral abundances and grain size distributions can be constrained a priori reducing the uncertainty and number of fitting parameters that must be determined hence our model formulation is useful to explain the processes in the experiments examined here and may be useful for similar and larger scale systems however some processes such as heat transport and gas migration convection or preferential flow blackmore et al 2014 are negligible on the scales examined here applicability of our approach is thus restricted to relatively small scale experiment displaying low degrees of heterogeneity similarly its performance for predictive purposes remains to be demonstrated vriens et al 2020 as processes affecting mineral reactivity and weathering rates on longer timescales e g reduced through passivation were not considered despite these uncertainties this work demonstrates that evidence based reactive transport models that explicitly account for key processes and are parametrized experimentally may be used to examine and possibly predict waste rock weathering dynamics across a laboratory to practice scale range contributing to improved risk

1459,groundwater pollution is a global issue in highly populated areas the eastern nile delta region is a typical example especially around artificial wastewater drains in the present work a multidisciplinary approach using hydrogeochemical geostatistical microbiological and geophysical data was applied to determine the vulnerability conditions and to identify potential pathways through which contaminants could potentially percolate to shallow aquifers in the southern boundary of the eastern nile delta an organized groundwater sampling was conducted for hydrogeochemical investigation in rural areas along the belbies unlined drain this drain is known of being heavily polluted by agricultural and municipal wastewater the hydrogeochemical analysis reveals high pollution levels by pb cd and cr for most of the collected shallow groundwater samples nearby the drain additionally no3 fecal and total coliform bacteria were observed in many samples with high concentrations six factors were distinguished on the basis of principal component analysis and varimax rotation with total variance more than 78 these factors reflected sewage contamination lithogenic and anthropogenic effects on the shallow groundwater hierarchical cluster analysis revealed two main clusters of groundwater groups accordingly electrical resistivity tomography ert was carried out in the areas of the distinguished clusters to locate potential preferential flow paths and horizons of lateral flow around the drain the obtained resistivity models illustrate breakthrough behavior in parts of the measured profiles due to the presence of permeable paths close to the drain the applied integrative approach is valuable for understanding the ambiguities during the interpretation process and for characterizing water quality and the aquifer vulnerability conditions additionally it may guide to understand the surface water groundwater links in order to supply the growing population with safe water keywords nile delta aquifer groundwater pollution hierarchical cluster analysis fecal coliform electrical resistivity tomography preferential flow paths 1 introduction shallow groundwater aquifers are major water resource for human demands in many regions of the world especially with continuous increase in population urbanization and developmental activities levy et al 2011 consequently there is an urgent need for determining the contamination pathways and sources to prevent their invasion to the groundwater thus the early warning of groundwater pollution is important for mitigation and control of pollution seepage from wastewater disposal systems dumpsites sewage ponds and other anthropogenic activities huan et al 2020 in egypt and other developed countries the chemical and bacterial contaminants can percolate from the unplanned disposal systems into shallow groundwater aquifers where the raw wastewater are dumped into adjacent waterways nile river irrigation canals and agricultural drains and led to significant hydrological and environmental degradation xu et al 2008 in addition there is a high potential risk for groundwater pollution in dumping sites of wastewater where it can affect shallow groundwater wells bengtsson et al 1994 matias et al 1994 in such environments the understanding and maintaining of bacterial and chemical pollutants existing in shallow groundwater aquifers through the vadose zone and interface with surface water has become management significance kausch et al 2020 in the nile delta as an example of high population densities fig 1 the unlined wastewater disposal systems and dumpsites can be a source of groundwater pollution particularly at shallow depths through permeable soils datta et al 1997 elevated levels of toxic metals in the groundwater pose substantial risks to local resource users and to the natural environment chabukdhara et al 2017 therefore the groundwater shows a considerable variation in terms of quality and suitability arising from transport of surface contaminants from these disposal systems or via overuse of shallow groundwater under such conditions shallow groundwater aquifers that are heavily used for drinking purposes must be monitored continuously to determine their quality and to what extent they have degraded kelly and wilson 2002 numerous drains such as belbies el qalyubia and bahr el baqar drains dissect the southeastern part of nile delta area fig 1 such drains are designed to transmit contaminated water arising from irrigation return flow and industrial wastewater as well as sewage the untreated or partially treated wastewater of east cairo is discharged to gabal el asfar treatment plant in east cairo that is in turn move to the belbies drain 60 km length that join to the el qalyubia drain about 70 km long fig 1 zhu et al 1999 revealed that the water quality parameters measured along bahr el baqar drain exceeded the legal limits these drains contain high concentrations of ammonia heavy metals sodium chloride and coliform bacteria saad 1997 taha et al 2004 therefore the groundwater quality in el qalyubia sharkia and ismailia regions in the eastern nile delta is greatly influenced by domestic and agricultural activities and polluted by nitrates and phosphates by virtue of pervasive use of chemical fertilizers taha et al 2004 moreover in belbies and new cities which are located north and east cairo industrial activities are dominant beside some agricultural activities representing the main source of pollution stahl et al 2009 for sustainable management of shallow groundwater in such conditions understanding of pollution sources recharge process in vadose zone flow direction and monitoring of water quality is needed amya et al 2018 several approaches can be used for understanding the transport of wastewater and recharge process in vadose zone for instance the high resolution geophysics and hydrogeophysical techniques can be applied as a monitoring tool for qualitative understanding of the flow of contaminants and migration patterns in the subsurface from disposal systems e g soupios and karaoulis 2015 rani et al 2016 simyrdanis et al 2018 rani et al 2019 soldi et al 2019 commer et al 2020 routinely the hydrogeochemical characteristics multivariate statistics and graphical analysis can be used to evaluate the origin of dissolved salts and pollutants in groundwater mattern et al 2009 kolsi et al 2013 chen et al 2013 matiatos 2016 minet et al 2017 busico et al 2018 jia et al 2020 practically this kind of investigations has been employed successfully in homogenous soils to obtain direct quantitative information about the origin and degree of pollution however it is considered as one dimensional 1d and locally representative in the heterogeneous aquifers while the scope of the present research is to identify the preferential pathways for fluids and surface contaminants using an integrative approach several recent studies in other regions have addressed the importance of hydrogeochemical and geophysical based techniques to evaluate the degree of contamination and flow patterns in the near surface soils gemail et al 2011 leitÃ£o et al 2014 koda et al 2017 gemail et al 2017a boy roura et al 2018 valiente et al 2018 lamb et al 2019 song et al 2020 and others these approaches demonstrated that the combination of different techniques could help in finding the paths and sources of pollutants and understanding the wastewater and groundwater processes in different aquifer types however in some places as in the present case study it is difficult to use the electrical conductivity properties for identifying the chemical response of contaminants where the groundwater and wastewater exhibit close tds and ph trends in addition to heterogeneities of the soil material to develop the approach the statistical factor analysis of several hydrogeochemical parameters and fecal coliform analyses were employed with electrical resistivity tomography ert technique to determine the vulnerability conditions and to identify potential pathways and determine the impact of unlined disposal systems on shallow groundwater aquifer moreover the hierarchical clustering technique the average linkage between groups was applied to define the similar groups that could be spatially delineated and facilitate the use of other techniques such as ert to trace pollution pathways additionally the use of major ion s variation diagrams can help to characterize the possible ionic sources and detach those of anthropogenic impacts the south eastern boundary of the nile delta area was selected as a case study to apply the suggested approach along the belbies drain fig 1 accordingly water sampling was applied for the area nearby and around the belbies drain factor analysis and cluster analysis were used and combined with microbiological analysis fecal coliforms to validate and interpret the chemical results of the collected samples and to assess groundwater quality the electrical resistivity tomography ert as a geophysical imaging tool was employed in the highly vulnerable zones to map the preferential flow paths of wastewater in the vadose zone in the considered area 2 geological and hydrogeological site characterization the considered area is covered mainly by the holocene nile deposits consisting of nile silt sand and sandy clay deposits with thickness varying from place to place ranging from 0 to 20 m fig 2 it is underlain by the pleistocene sediments which are formed mainly of sand and gravels with intercalations of clay lenses these sediments have a variable thickness at the eastern parts of the nile delta ranging from zero in the south to nearly 600 m while at the northwestern parts they may reach 900 m khalil et al 1988 mansour 2020 the oligocene basalt appears on the surface as small exposure in the southern parts of the study area at abu zaabal region fig 2 the oligocene rocks are dominated by sands gravels and fractured basalt the thickness of these rocks varies from 30 to 100 m and act as a deep aquifer below the basaltic sheets capping basalt may about 30 m overlie the fluviatile sands and gravels the miocene sediments are present in some places of the study area and composed of alternating sandy limestone and sandy marls of shallow marine origin ismailia freshwater canal is located in the southeastern fringes of east nile delta and is characterized by higher water level than groundwater level representing the main source for groundwater recharge in east nile delta rigw and iwaco 1983 the open drains in the nile delta have a total length of 18 000 km bed widths varying from 1 to 30 m and depths from 2 5 to 6 m and generally have a water level maintained at 2 5 m dri 2004 the canal and drains pass through the holocene deposits in the area to the east of the damietta branch and shift to move through the pleistocene deposits in the far eastern parts fig 2 the surface drainage system receives raw liquid wastes and effluents from nearby villages and factories posing threats to the shallow aquifers whenever the sediments are dominated by sand and silty nature along and around the belbies drain many hand dug and irrigation wells were drilled at shallow depths 15 40 m and used for drinking irrigation and industrial purposes especially in unplanned population areas that contain many houses and small factories that are lacking safe water the chance for groundwater pollution is increased in the east nile delta due to extensive agriculture and industrial activities and use of return flow for irrigation abo el fadl 2013 the main groundwater bearing deposits in the study area are the quaternary aquifer that is represented by an upper holocene aquitard fig 2b and c and a lower pleistocene aquifer rigw 1989 taha et al 1997 yehia 2000 farid 1985 sherif et al 2012 nofal et al 2015 in the southern and middle parts of the delta the aquifer exhibits leaky conditions and near the western and eastern borders it represents unconfined conditions where the top holocene deposits are almost absent fig 2c the aquifer hydraulic conductivity in the area south of the ismailia canal which is close to most of the investigated area is 43 2 m day while the transmissivity is 2836 m2

northwest directions rigw 1989 the interaction between the surface and groundwater systems is seasonally variable sherif et al 2012 the contamination of shallow groundwater aquifer in the east nile delta region is a factor of the hydraulic connection between surface water system drains and irrigation canals and the aquifer accordingly the section of the belbies drain that incises in the holocene aquitard dominated by sand and sandy clay deposits promotes contaminant migration to the shallow aquifer than when it incises in clay deposits elewa 2010 abd elaty et al 2019 the recharge sources in the quaternary aquifer are irrigation canals and drainage networks in the eastern nile delta region while the discharge take place through groundwater withdrawals from the wide distributed water wells and upward leakage elewa 2010 el fakharany et al 2017 3 methodology the flowchart of methodology was described in fig 4 a campaign was conducted to areas around the belbies unlined drain in october 2018 for collecting water samples from the shallow aquifer along the drain twenty nine groundwater samples were collected in addition to one surface water sample from the belbies drain fig 3 the drain sample was selected as a reference polluted point from the central zone of the belbies drain nearby the zone where most of the collected groundwater was sampled at al monier el zawamel and abu zaabal locations fig 3 this zone is a path for all types of pollutants discharged to the drain from the start point at gabal el asfar treatment plant and return irrigation flow direct wastewater and industrial wastes fig 3 comparison of some anthropogenic parameters in the drain water with those in previous studies i e taha et al 2004 stahl et al 2009 saber et al 2015 showed that their values are comparable to the current sample confirming contamination and indicating the credibility of using the selected drain sample as a reference point for comparison with groundwater samples the samples were collected from shallow wells at different depths from 15 to 40 m from ground surface these wells mainly drilled illegally by farmers and local habitants in the vicinity of the belbies drain as in el zawamel al monier el khanka and belbies villages and cities for irrigation drinking and domestic purposes using standard calibrated field equipment the ph temperature t total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ the collected samples were put in acid washed airtight polyethylene bottles washed with water at the sampling site and then filled to the top water samples were collected in three bottles one for the major ions cations and anions and another for heavy metals where samples were filtered through 0 45 Î¼m membrane filter and acidified by ultra pure nitric acid to ph less than 2 while the last bottle was for microbiology coliform bacteria finally the collected samples were set in iceboxes and kept refrigerated before being transported to the laboratory the laboratory analysis includes major cations k na mg2 and ca2 and major anions cl so4 2 and hco3 and no3 additionally some trace elements were analyzed such as cu ni cd cr pb and zn using icp oes model icap 6200 duo of the company thermo scientific for bacteriological analysis fecal coliform fc and total coliform tc were determined using membrane filter technique by a filtration system completed with stainless steel autoclavable manifold and oil free millipore vacuum pressure pump the analysis time of total coliform and fecal coliform did not exceed 6 24 h results were recorded in cfu 100 ml most of shallow groundwater contamination studies aim to identify specific source of contamination based on physical and or chemical characterizations of groundwater and surface contaminants olmez et al 1994 in case of multiple source contamination or soil heterogeneity as in agricultural areas southern nile delta is a good example it is difficult if not impossible to use the chemical approaches for delineating the contamination sources therefore the statistical factor and cluster analyses are important for the determination of groundwater chemistry zonation and hydrogeochemical behavior of groundwater sarangi et al 2005 el alfy et al 2015 el alfy et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 masoud et al 2018 masoud et al 2019 cluster analysis was used by gÃ¼ler et al 2002 to determine the quality of surface water and groundwater ryberg 2006 applied hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis to determine the water quality of lake sakakawea central north dakota therefore the statistical treatment of data q mode cluster analysis and factor analysis was done using the statistical package for social sciences spss 17 0 chemical calculations were performed using phreeqci charlton et al 1997 maps were processed using erdas imagine leica geosystem 2000 and arcmap 10 3 software package based on the cluster and factor analysis results the geophysical measurements in the form of dc resistivity surveys 1d and 2d were applied in the vulnerable zones to visualize and detect the expected pathways of the wastewater in the topmost soil around the main drain the vertical electrical sounding ves technique was applied using schlumberger array due to its sensitivity for shallow variations above aquifer zone the apparent resistivity of the different soils can be determined based on the measured potential difference and the applied current and the distance between the electrodes the measured resistivity is inverted to true resistivity and thickness for each soil type and can apply for mapping the structural disturbances in vertical and horizontal directions such as fault or fracture systems and layer boundaries to study its impact on solute transport in the shallow zones over the aquifer system gemail 2015 the collected apparent resistivities at each site were inverted using ip2win software bobachev et al 2003 in this technique the forward modeling was created using the linear filtering algorithm which provides rapid and accurate models covering all the reasonable geologic circumstances additional geological and field observations were used to calibrate the obtained resistivity models and outline the lithologic boundaries in each site several recent field scale studies have been successfully employed the dc resistivity surveys 1d 2d in quantitatively estimating the hydraulic properties of groundwater aquifers and associated solute transport in the vadose zone e g gemail et al 2004 farzamian et al 2015 kazakis et al 2016 perdomo et al 2018 the main objective of these hydrogeophysical studies was to predict the hydraulic parameters of an aquifer from geophysical data using the empirical relationships of both aquifer resistivity and conventional pumping test data however in the present case study the heterogeneities in the aquifer system are practically challenging and the estimated hydraulic conductivity from resistivity data is considered as in situ or local scale bowling et al 2005 due to the broad spatial variations in lithostratigraphic facies along the main drain therefore the ves survey is a one dimensional 1d mapping technique and is thus prone to high uncertainty in short distance lateral variations as in case of pollution pathways or near surface permeable zones thus the combination of 1d resistivity sounding and ert technique 2d with hydrogeochemical data is the obvious choice for detecting the movement and percolation of the wastewater within soil zone to shallow aquifer groundwater el eraki et al 2010 gemail 2012 seferou et al 2013 papadopoulos et al 2014 gemail et al 2017a simyrdanis et al 2018 yang et al 2019 in environmental applications 2d ert surveys have applicability for mapping the lithologic variations around and beneath the surface pollutants sand rich zones where the presence of these permeable zones may act as a vulnerable zone and the waste water can percolate to the shallow aquifers sorensen et al 2005 gemail et al 2017b accordingly three vulnerable sites al monier gabal el asfar and el zawamel villages were selected for more detailed mapping using ert surveys fig 3 these sites are located close to the belbies main drain and characterized by known problematic conditions in the soils and groundwater in addition to the anomalous results of the prior water quality analysis and cluster classification the ert profiles were carried out using siber 48 48 channels multi electrode system to automate the data collection as much as possible the apparent resistivities were collected along 235 m profile with 5 m minimum electrode spacing and data level n 15 these parameters allow for imaging of the variations in the uppermost part of the aquifer to a depth of 30 m during the field measurements the resistivity meter obtained the apparent resistivity and estimated the standard deviation errors q from repeated cycles observations with a standard deviation error of more than 5 were repeated or discarded to obtain the true 2d distribution of soil resistivity the apparent resistivity data were inverted using the program res2dinv loke and barker 1996 in which a 2d resistivity model of the subsurface was calculated for the input apparent resistivity data the program uses an array of rectangular blocks to model the subsurface structures and calculates resistivity values that agree with the actual measurements using finite element fe algorithm there are two options for data inversion in the program robust inversion method claerbout and muir 1973 which is more suitable to situations involving abrupt change in resistivity between adjacent blocks due to fractures faults or rock discontinuities as in the present case in al monier site and smoothness constrained least squares technique degroot hedlin and constable 1990 loke and barker 1996 which is preferable when there is smooth variation in resistivity values as in the other two sites gabal el asfar and el zawamel sites where the sandy soil dominates in this region 4 results and discussion 4 1 major dissolved constituents understanding of the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater can help in assessment of the pollutant flow patterns the water rock interaction as well as the water quality here the samples have a ph range from 6 2 to 7 89 where most of the groundwater are near neutral with total dissolved salts tds from 212 to 1143 ppm while the ph of the drain water is 7 79 with tds value of 1158 ppm table 1 therefore it is often hard to express the source of groundwater contamination in such case based on the hydrogeochemical properties only as mentioned earlier in the literature of the present multidisciplinary approach the water samples in the area exhibit two major water types of na hco3 and nacl except for samples 7 8 and 9 that show ca hco3 water type the na hco3 type shows dominance of alkali metals over alkaline earths and weak acidic anions over strong acidic anions while the nacl type shows dominance of strong acidic anions over weak acidic anions the third type is characterized by higher concentrations of alkaline earth elements relative to alkali elements and weak acidic anions relative to strong acidic anions fig 5 the water from the belbies drain sample 30 shows nacl water type table 1 therefore the dominant water type nacl indicates the possibility of halite dissolution or may be possibly due to the impact of wastewater leakage where the majorities of these samples were collected from the residential areas along the belbies drain 4 2 groundwater chemistry the water chemistry is greatly influenced by reactions with rock minerals accordingly other processes that affect the ion concentrations could be deduced from variation diagrams fig 6 the results from the water analysis were presented on x y relations and the possible reactions were inferred most of the water samples plot below the 1 2 line in the hco3 ca2 variation diagram fig 6a indicating that neither calcite nor dolomite dissolution control the concentration of calcium and bicarbonate in the samples the excess bicarbonate could be attributed to biological processes or dissolution of atmospheric co2 according to the reaction 1 the plot of so4 versus ca2 indicate that the collected samples have calcium content over than expected above the 1 1 line from gypsum dissolution indicating that gypsum is not a source for calcium and sulfate in the water samples undersaturation with respect to gypsum as seen in figs 6b and 7 c the high sulfate contents 30 8 66 4 ppm in the samples 5 8 13 15 16 17 28 and 30 could be due to pollution sources and fertilizers 1 co 2 h 2 o h 2 co 3 h hco 3 some samples are undersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite indicating that the dissolution of these minerals cannot explain the groundwater mineralization in the study area fig 7a and b nonetheless the saturation indices increase gradually with increasing salinity till they reach near and slightly oversaturation in case of calcite and dolomite fig 7a and b the distribution of samples in bivariate plots of fig 6 c d and e indicates that na and k dominate over ca2 and mg2 that are contributing substantially to the groundwater chemistry this could be explained by silicate weathering or ion exchange and suggest that bicarbonate is not as effective to the calcium concentrations as sulfate the plot of sodium against chloride shows that the samples 8 17 18 19 22 and 30 are controlled by halite dissolution data plot along the 1 1 line fig 6f however the rest of the water samples show increase of sodium over than expected from halite dissolution indicating other possible processes such as silicate weathering reaction 2 or cation exchange reactions 3 and 4 as shown in fig 6 g and h all water samples are undersaturated with respect to halite where the saturation index increases gradually with increasing total dissolved salts tds fig 7d 2 2naalsi 3 o 8 2h 9 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 2 na 4 h 4 sio 4 3 2 na ex ca 2 2 na ca ex 4 2 na ex mg 2 2 na mg ex accordingly the major categorizations and hydrogeochemical properties of the shallow groundwater varied along the belbies drain indicating an anthropogenic influence from irrigation activities and or percolation of wastewater from the unlined drain bicarbonates are controlled by dissolution of atmospheric gas and biological processes chlorides and sulfates are possibly controlled by pollution and fertilizer applications silicate weathering or cation exchange is the possible processes for the high sodium and potassium contents whereas calcium and magnesium are controlled by cation exchange reactions nitrates are a common source of pollution having ranges from 5 to 122 ppm samples exceeding the world health organization guideline who 2017 50 ppm for nitrate are 3 12 and 30 while most of them exceed the environmental protection agency epa 2009 level 10 ppm except 10 11 19 24 28 and 29 tables 1 and 2 the high nitrate values reflect the impact of the heavily application of agricultural fertilizers and the seepage from the belbies drain to nearby shallow groundwater due to uncontrolled pumping 4 3 trace element concentration the concentrations of trace elements are presented in the clustered column chart fig 8 and table 1 all samples show cu concentrations below the guideline limits of who 2017 and epa 2009 table 2 and fig 8 the majority of the groundwater samples have ni concentrations below the guidelines set by who 2017 0 07 ppm groundwater samples of ni concentrations higher than the guideline value are 3 6 7 13 16 21 22 24 25 27 and 28 which indicates the influence of the contaminated drain water or the agricultural return flow on the shallow groundwater aquifer as a result of continuous pumping samples which have cd levels below the maximum permissible limit of 0 003 ppm set by who 2017 are 8 21 23 and 24 and those lacking cd contents are 9 10 12 and 16 fig 8 table 2 nonetheless the rest of samples have cd content higher than the permissible limit the saturation index of otavite cdco3 for most of the water samples is oversaturated fig 9a confirming an anthropogenic source for cd the maximum permissible limit of cr in drinking water is 0 05 ppm who 2017 thus all samples beside the drain sample show cr concentrations far exceed the guideline of who 2017 table 1 indicating the contamination by wastewater the exceedance ranges from 6 fold in sample 29 to 12 fold in sample 30 fig 8 the saturation index of mgcr2o4 of all water samples is oversaturated fig 9b increasing with increasing ph and explaining the high concentration of cr in these samples with respect to pb concentration the most of collected samples exhibit concentrations higher than the guideline recognized by who 2017 0 01 ppm as seen in fig 8 and table 1 these high pb concentrations indicating high level of contamination in shallow groundwater particularly in the adjacent regions to the belbies drain the drain water show a high value in pb by 99 fold than the who 2017 guideline the saturation index of cerussite pbco3 of most of the water samples is oversaturated fig 9c asserting an anthropogenic source for pb the saturation indices of otavite and cerussite show similar trends against ph fig 9 a and c indicating the effect of anthropogenic impact on the groundwater the results of zinc zn reveals that the obtained values for shallow groundwater in the area is far below the limit set by who 3 ppm and epa 5 ppm however the maximum value of 0 634 ppm was reported at gabal el asfar farm southwest of the area in groundwater sample 16 while the zn value in the drain water was 0 78 ppm fig 8 4 4 microbiology total coliform tc and fecal coliform fc were evaluated in the collected samples to confirm the presence of pathogens and possible fecal pollution the obtained results were matched to the who quality standards for drinking water table 1 considering the water sample no 30 as a reference from surface wastewater the distributions of tc and fc show the highest values in samples 3 8 11 12 13 and 15 which have also high values of sulfates and nitrates fig 10 table 1 most of these samples are located in the southwest parts of area where the drain runs over sand rich soils groundwater samples that only have total coliforms include 2 4 6 7 18 and 20 the drain water shows highest contamination by total and fecal coliforms the presence of tc and fc and anomalous concentration of nitrates in the shallow groundwater samples is a direct evidence for the seepage from the belbies drain water 4 5 statistical analysis 4 5 1 descriptive statistics the ranges means and standard deviations of the analyzed variables are shown in table 2 the results were compared with the guideline values set by the environmental protection agency epa 2009 the world health organization who 2017 and by the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme 1999 most of the analyzed variables have concentrations below the guidelines set for drinking except for cd cr and pb which far exceed the limits 4 5 2 multivariate statistical analyses 4 5 2 1 factor analysis factor analysis is a statistical approach that can be employed to study interrelationships among large number of variables this approach involves finding a way to condense the information in a variety of original variables into a smaller collection of uncorrelated key components factors with minimal information loss hair et al 1992 abu salem et al 2017 el alfy et al 2018 principal component analysis pca was applied to infer the processes governing the concentration of ions factors with eigen values greater than 1 were extracted kaiser 1960 and the factor loadings of each original variable were examined on the basis of eigen values and varimax rotation six factors were distinguished to explain most of the variability total variance was about 78 for the water samples table 3 the first factor f1 is statistically dominant and accounts for about 25 of the total variance this factor is characterized by strong positive loadings on ec tds na cl and hco3 ca is moderately positively loaded this factor could be termed the salinity factor and indicates the lithogenic effect on the groundwater the second factor f2 explains 15 of the total variance and shows strong positive loadings on fecal coliform total coliform and nitrate showing the effect of sewage contamination furthermore the third factor f3 describes 14 of the total variance and shows strong positive loadings on pb k cr and so4 indicating anthropogenic input for these elements the fourth factor f4 explains 9 of the total variance and shows a strong positive loading on mg temperature and cu the fifth factor f5 accounts for 8 of the total variance and shows a strong positive loading on ni and zn indicating anthropogenic impacts on the groundwater the final factor f6 accounts for 7 of the total variance and shows a moderate positive loading on cr and strong negative loading on cd table 3 and fig 11 4 5 2 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca is one of the ways used to find different classes and groups within the investigated data with the results being represented as a dendrogram davis 1986 on the basis of visual examination of the dendrogram of the studied groundwater samples two main clusters a and b were observed at the presented phenon line fig 12a using twenty variables temperature ph electrical conductivity tds k na mg2 ca2 cl so4 2 hco3 no3 cu ni cd cr pb zn total coliform and fecal coliform cluster a is the main cluster and includes 23 groundwater samples fig 12 which are qualified to have insignificant pollution where the most of these samples occupy the northern parts of the area fig 12b geologically this area is covered by inhomogeneous silt and clay cap 5 10 m thick that forms the agricultural soil and incompletely protect the quaternary aquifer towards the north and northeast of the nile delta the cluster a is further subdivided into two subgroups a1 and a2 the means of the applied chemical parameters of each subgroup produced by the hca analysis are presented in table 4 subgroup a1 shows the lowest mean of tds values 385 ppm the lowest mean concentrations of na ca cl and so4 while the presence of noticeable bacteria of total and fecal coliforms especially in samples 3 and 8 at al monier and el zawamel villages respectively fig 12b and is attributed to the local heterogeneities of the clay cap the second subgroup a2 comprises seven samples 6 26 27 22 23 16 and1 which are characterized by high tds values than subgroup a1 mean 668 ppm and high na ca cl hco3 and so4 this subgroup possibly shows the effect of freshwater recharge of the ismailia canal to the south of the area on the other hand cluster b is subdivided into subgroup b1 and b2 table 4 subgroup b1 shows higher mean of tds values 1026 ppm and higher na ca cl so4 hco3 and no3 in addition to the highest mean of tc and fc the water samples of this subgroup 13 14 12 5 and 15 have the signature of the belbies drain sample 30 table 1 of high salinity high nitrate and high bacterial counts samples 12 and 13 fig 12a indicating the effect of possible contaminations from this drain subgroup b2 has only one member 17 a sample that is distinguished by significantly higher tds 1114 ppm highest cl so4 and pb and lacking bacterial pollution table 4 where this sample is located nearby industrial wastewater discharge 4 6 geophysical measurements the obtained models from the inverted schlumberger soundings represent multi layered structures reflecting the degree of saturation and clay content in the subsoil above the aquifer layer fig 13 the interpreted resistivities Ïi and thicknesses hi of layers above the aquifer zone were employed to calculate the hydraulic resistance kirsh 2006 or the integrated electrical conductivity iec rottger et al 2005 gemail et al 2011 in which the hydraulic conductivity ki is replaced by electrical conductivity 1 Ïi where it is not practicable to be carried out by traditional pumping tests in shallow wells vogelgesang et al 2020 the unit of integrated electrical conductivity iec is ohm 1 or siemens s can be estimated at each ves point by eq 5 5 iec i 1 n h i 1 Ï i where Ï i 1 Ï i accordingly the lowest values of the estimated iec indicate high hydraulic conductivity as in sand rich soils with low thickness of the protection zone in contrast the high value zones will have low resistivities and great thickness of clay and fine materials cap giving the low vulnerability or high protection level as practical example if the protection zone is 8 m thick and consists of homogenous clay with resistivity value of 4 Ï m the estimated iec value in this case will be 2 ohm 1 and will be reduced when the clay cap is mixed with sand thin layer with higher resistivity than the clay background therefore the calculated iec values at sites of ves1 and ves2 al monier site are 0 175 and 0 15 ohm 1 respectively where both points are located in the high vulnerable zone to validate the cluster analysis of water samples cluster b fig 12b thus providing rapid flow paths of wastewater in contrast these values relatively increase in el zawamel site ves3 and gabal el asfar ves4 to reach 2 1 and 1 6 ohm 1 respectively where the protective layers are discontinuous and heterogeneous of clay and fine sand soils thus the analysis of the resistivity curves exhibits the variations in soil characterization in each site as follows 4 6 1 al monier site al monier site was selected as highly vulnerable zone based on the statistical chemical and microbiological analysis of the collected water samples along the main drain compared with water sample 30 as a reference sample from the drain water the collected groundwater samples 3 and 12 are characterized by anomalous increase in the total and fecal coliforms in addition to nitrate fig 10 with sharp boundaries between clusters a and b fig 12 indicating a direct connection between the surface drain and shallow groundwater aquifer from the geological point of view the site is characterized by complex geology where the highly fractured basalt of the oligocene is exposed far away 2 km in the northwestern border at abu zaabal area fig 2 in addition the main drain in al monier runs partly over the uplifted miocene sands and localized limestone thin beds as indicated from the removed rock boulders from the drain bottom fig 14a and b there is also circumstantial evidence from the drilled boreholes in the area that the depth of these boreholes is changed rapidly and does not exceed than 26 m due to the shallow basaltic rocks in this case the presence of well defined preferential flow paths in the vadose zone e g fractures porous media is highly relevant in assessing aquifer vulnerability to pass contaminated wastewater foster 1998 to understand the flow mechanisms of wastewater to saturated shallow aquifers three ert profiles were carried out crossing the sharp boundaries between zone a and b to image the preferential flow paths in the fractured porous media as mentioned above in the ert survey wenner beta wb was selected which has a better vertical resolution together with realistically good horizontal resolution loke 2020 and can be used to detect rapid changes in the vadose zone the geological interpretation of the measured schlumberger sounding points ves 1 and 2 fig 13 a and b indicates that the soil sequence in al monier site shows large variation in the vertical resistivity distribution according to the lithologic composition and depth of subsurface layers around the main drain as seen in the resistivity curves fig 13 the abrupt increase in resistivity values at shallow depths 2 3 m indicate a concrete structure where the miocene limestone thin bed is locally uplifted in the area this part is underlain by saturated silt and sands with low resistivity values about 10 Ï m by considering the depths of the drilled boreholes in the area the high resistivity values in the basal part of the aquifer layer 20 26 m depth is attributed to fractured oligocene basalt to address the preferential wastewater flow paths in the study site the elongated inverted wb profile p3 was compiled with its perpendicular lines p1 and p2 as presented in fig 15 additionally the collected water samples with anomalous total coliform and fecal coliform as well as the suggested boundaries between the vulnerable zones a and b were presented on the figure to illustrate the expected flow paths around the main drain fig 15 the inverted ert models are presented with a same color scale for direct comparison and easily detect the subsurface conditions results from the inverted ert profiles indicate that a resistive sandy limestone bed appeared as shallow as 5 m deep in the area with the exception of an area east of profile p3 where the main drain is cross cutting the uplifted bedrock in this area as indicated from the removed limestone blocks during the deepening of drain in 2003 fig 14 a and b this bedrock is covered by the surficial quaternary clay and silt which is appeared as well defined low resistivity cap along p1 and p2 the disjointed nature of the anomalous higher resistivity bedrock which is cross cut laterally in numerous zones by lower resistivity values suggests the presence of fractures and loose sands in the subsurface along the three profiles fig 15 these fractures and absence of the protection bedrock in the area can move wastewater from the drain very quickly in the direction of pumping wells as appeared in water samples 3 4 and 12 these conductive zones in the sandy limestone with thinning or absence of the quaternary clay cap define areas where the shallow aquifer is only slightly protected if at all from surface wastewater these zones are suggested as highly vulnerable regions this is verified by the high concentrations of pb cr and zn in the groundwater samples 1 2 3 4 and 12 in fig 8 as well as the anomalous increasing in the total coliform and fecal coliform and nitrate concentrations samples 2 3 and 12 in fig 10 a low resistivity underlying layer 10 30 Ï m is appeared along the three profiles corresponding to the miocene sandy aquifer which is recharged mainly from ismailia freshwater canal towards the southern end of p2 sample 2 in addition to the percolated wastewater from the main drain and irrigation canals samples 1 3 4 and 12 the deeper part of the inverted sections shows a resistive target 75 Ï m with sharp boundaries with upper sand aquifer which is attributed to the uplifted oligocene fractured basalt 4 6 2 gabal el asfar site the gabal el asfar site is located to the south west of the previous site and considered as highly vulnerable site based on the cluster analysis fig 12 and high concentrations of pb zn and cr water samples 13 16 and 17 in fig 3 according to abdel shafy and abdel sabour 2006 the first 2 m soil profile in that site contains more than 75 sand and gravels with clay particles vary from 0 5 in the uncultivated lands to more than 20 in the cultivated lands for many years the area has been irrigated with primary treated raw sewage effluent through a drainage system running in sandy soil gemail 2012 however the area is underlain by the sand and gravel aquifer of the pleistocene which is capped in parts by two thin clay beds as seen in the obtained model of ves 3 fig 13 c therefore the vulnerability conditions in the area are based mainly on the thicknesses and discontinuities of clays in the overburden to fully understand this situation pole dipole array pd was applied for imaging the layering structure that can easily detect clay discontinuities in the cap zone as mentioned before the rapid smoothness least squares technique was applied to invert the measured ert profile where the soil sequence in the area changes smoothly from surface silty sand to clay and sandy clay then saturated sand and gravels aquifer as seen in the inverted section of fig 16 the pd profile was spread along open sub drain to achieve sufficient coverage of the preferential wastewater flow paths in heterogeneous sands and clay soil this sub drain runs on graded sand soil with 4 m depth and transports the raw industrial wastewater towards the belbies main drain after gabal el asfar treatment plant fig 14 c and d fig 16 illustrates the final inverted section of the ert profile in which the upper resistive layer consists of graded sand with a thickness of 3 4 m within the surface layer a conductive spots or bands 8 Ï m are visible and can be attributed to permeable pathways which are the source of possible outflows of industrial wastewater from the closed sub drain this heterogeneous topsoil is followed by a conductive saturated zone at depth of 4 m downwards to 15 m in particular the conductive anomalies at that depth are attributed to the high salinity of perched untreated wastewater or clay distributions along the line on the other hand a gradual increase in the resistivity values can be seen towards the main drain due to the leakage of treated wastewater with low salinity about 720 ppm gemail 2012 compared with untreated industrial wastewater in the sub drain fig 14 c additionally the vertical and lateral percolation of wastewater along the line is affected by the gentle topography which acts to rise the vertical infiltration through the permeable pathways in the topsoil then runs towards the main drain the deeper part of the inverted section shows a relatively high resistivity zone which is decreased gradually towards the main drain reflecting the degree of saturation and lateral outflows the closest water sample 13 to the profile contains appreciable values of total and fecal coliforms with high nitrates fig 10 confirming the role of the topsoil permeable zone for wastewater infiltration additionally to the east of the profile maximum concentrations of zn and pb were recorded in samples 16 and 17 respectively fig 8 the high values of trace element in the area are attributed to the clay discontinuities in the eastern side of the area gemail 2012 4 6 3 el zawamel site the third site is el zawamel village east to the previous two sites which is represented by cluster a based on hca fig 12 this area is a part of the main quaternary aquifer of nile delta which is covered by clay silt cap of holocene deposits with a thickness varies between 5 m to 10 m as indicated from the dug wells in the area embaby et al 2014 in this case the clay silt topsoil acts as semi pervious aquitard and the wastewater in the open drainage system i e belbies drain can penetrate into through the vadose zone and reach the aquifer down to a depth of 15 20 m below the surface gemail et al 2017a therefore the presence of permeable materials such as sands silt lenses within the soil cap can increase the intrinsic permeability and facilitate the vertical penetration of wastewater around the main drain schlumberger vertical electrical sounding ves 4 was measured close to the main drain to determine the vertical layer distribution above the aquifer zone as seen in fig 13 d accordingly the topsoil above the aquifer in the area consists of clay silt deposits 8 Ï m and extends to 8 m depth at that point five groundwater samples were collected in this site for chemical and bacterial analyses the samples 8 9 10 and 11 for location see fig 3 are closer to the drain while the sample 29 is located close to the ismailia freshwater canal and far away from the drain with 650 m as seen in fig 8 these samples are characterized by relatively low contents of heavy metals such as pb cr zn compared with the samples in the previous two sites on the other hand the anomalous value of the total coliform and fecal coliform is recorded only at sample 8 at the western side of the main drain the sample 29 was considered as reference sample where the aquifer at that point is recharged mainly from ismailia canal as indicated from its minimum values of pb with no values of fecal coliform in this site these anomalous values of the heavy metals and fecal coliform are related to the spatial distribution of the collected samples reflecting the amount of percolated wastewater based on the heterogeneities in the topsoil to image the lateral and vertical heterogeneities in the clay silt cap a wb profile was acquired 240 m length inside the main drain between samples 8 and 9 where the contents of fecal coliform are totally different in this short distance fig 17 shows wb inverted profile demonstrating the resistivity distributions in the layers above the groundwater aquifer along this profile the surface area is affected by clay and silt cover where the resistivity in the topmost soil is less than 8 Ï m with anomalous high resistivity spots at shallow depths these discontinuities in resistivity distribution within the protection clay cap are considered as being attributed to local sand bodies with relatively higher hydraulic conductivity compared to the clay background in the western side of the profile the appearance of the sand lenses close to and beneath the open drain explains the faecally contaminated discharge and high pollution load in water sample 8 due to the sand rich soils that act as permeable pathways for leakage of wastewater to the upper zone of aquifer at 9 m depth as seen in fig 17 the other side of the profile around sample 9 shows a thick about 15 m quite low resistivity surface layer probably clay rich in nature below which the resistivity rises with well defined boundary to 80 Ï m or more at a depth of around 25 m in such case the abrupt changes from relatively low resistivity values in the topmost soil to high values in the aquifer zone indicate the variation in the clay content and the groundwater quality where the upper parts is recharged from the perched wastewater while lower parts is recharged from the freshwater of ismailia canal to the east in the middle parts at 120 m distance it appears likely more localized low resistivity anomaly below sand windows high resistivity and extends to more than 35 m depth fig 17 which could be interpreted as high vulnerability conditions due to the heterogeneities in the clay cap in such places any discharge of pollutants or application of harmful chemicals and fertilizers in agricultural activities may reach directly to the groundwater or may percolate to the vadose zone and reach to the upper parts of the aquifer as in here the identification of such areas and their protection from fecal pollution will be of paramount importance to reduce the pollution risk by considering the safe depths of water wells the pumping rate and effective design of disposal networks in these areas the results obtained across the field sites in this study are comparable to those reported in previous studies including the determination of the hydraulic properties and the spatial patterns of wastewater flow within the southern boundaries of the nile delta aquifer as indicated in the southern vulnerable zone al monier and gabal el asfar sites sherif and al rashed 2001 simulated the groundwater contamination in the nile delta aquifer through the unsaturated zone using the sutra model and concluded that the over pumping from shallow wells was the main source of groundwater pollution and the future pumping should be reduced in the western and eastern boundaries of the nile delta in addition gemail 2012 employed the dc resistivity measurements to calculate the aquifer vulnerability index avi in the gabal el asfar farm and differentiated the area into vulnerable and highly vulnerable zones based on the clay discontinuities in the unsaturated zone confirming the results of hierarchical cluster analysis hca and ert in the present research to the north of the present study area abd elaty et al 2019 simulated the impact of bahr el baqar polluted drain and ismailia freshwater canal using numerical modeling of modflow and mt3mds to identify the contamination process of the shallow groundwater and they recommended using geo membrane lining materials and installing cut off walls in the drain sides for minimizing the solute transport into the unconfined aquifers as in the present case study thus the comparison of these results shows that the proposed multidisciplinary approach can be a helpful cost effective complement for monitoring contaminant transport to shallow heterogeneous groundwater aquifers in which the groundwater chemistry with geostatistical and fecal analyses can be powerful in identifying the aquifer vulnerability to surface contamination on a regional scale while the ert dense dataset of local scale can be used to delineate the lateral heterogeneity of the aquifer media and detect the permeable windows for leaching contaminants the traditional ves measurement determines the aquifer characterization at a single point scale 5 conclusion and recommendations the applied multidisciplinary approach in this work using hydrogeochemical geostatistical geophysical and microbiological data could be considered as a good qualitative practice revealing the enrolment and mobilization of surface contaminants and their flow paths in the vadose zone this integrative approach can be employed in similar circumstances elsewhere with results potentially allowing for targeted wastewater management strategies and to determine the competence of disposal systems in urban regions it is possible to apply the approach to determine the permeable zones in the heterogeneous soil sequence where the wastewater preferentially flows around and underneath point source pollution hydrogeochemical investigation of the collected shallow groundwater samples distinguished three water types namely na hco3 na cl and ca hco3 additionally high concentrations of total and fecal coliform and nitrates in many water samples were observed indicating the effect of seepage from the belbies unlined drain due to intensive abstraction rates this finding is also confirmed by the high concentrations of trace elements i e pb cr and cd the constructed variation diagrams indicated that the groundwater in the southeastern boundaries of the nile delta region is affected by wastewater pollution sources fertilizers and ion exchange processes the results of hierarchical cluster analysis have been demonstrated spatially to show the aerial distribution of different chemical groups revealing two main clusters with different vulnerability conditions six factors have been extracted from dimensional reduction of data representing 78 of the total variance these factors and clusters indicated the impact of polluted unlined belbies drain on the nearby shallow groundwater aquifer therefore the pollution pathways were determined by carrying out field 2d resistivity measurements in the distinguished cluster zones accordingly there is strong evidence from 2d resistivity signatures heavy metal loads and fecal coliform to suggest that the belbies drain at al monier and gabal el asfar sites represents a high contamination potential the identification of geological and hydrogeochemical characteristics of such locations using ert profiling and statistical analysis could be helpful to assess and manage the impact of fecal pollution around this kind of disposal system the complementary results of the obtained 2d resistivity sections show the importance of ert technique as a non invasive low cost and less time consuming method for subsurface mapping ert can be employed in combination with traditional hydrogeochemical methods to provide very extensive and detailed information about near surface geology and contaminant flow paths and guide a more effective placement of safe water wells overall this research demonstrates the improved interpretability of ert method in the context of aqueous contaminated sites with novel contributions of geostatistical and microbiological indications for mapping realistic flow paths of the shallow aquifers as a whole this work reveals that ert exhibits significant potential as a non invasive monitoring tool in different aquifer types additionally the use of multivariate statistical analyses factor and hierarchical cluster analysis hca and fecal coliform assessment as additional sources of validation is a great prospective of this work the obtained results are greatly helpful in the design of an effective monitoring system for assessing the pollution risk in the area continuous monitoring of groundwater quality and determination of pollution sources is very important to groundwater management and development attention should be focused upon the impact on human health and to address groundwater quality issues therefore the result of this research will be shared with the local government and decision makers to avoid the human health risk and infections caused by drinking polluted groundwater and determine if more precautions should be taken to remediate the current situation and sustainable management of groundwater as important resource in the arid regions additionally a recommended protocol needs to specify that human activities related to overuse and misuse of groundwater and usage of wastewater for irrigation which may have a negative impact on the groundwater environment shall be banned or restricted in the vulnerable zone of the southern part of the studied area in future and based on the current results the threats of pollution and the level of protection should be more carefully determined in the area where the wastes show rapid downward flow into the shallow sand aquifer due intensive pumping it is expected that the groundwater quality in the inferred vulnerable areas changes laterally and vertically in the vadose zone thus the future works should focus on the numerical flow and transport modeling in the southern parts of the area to simulate the groundwater lateral flow far away the main drain a qualitative correlation between hydrological flow model and ert results will provide a full understanding of the mechanism and scenario of solute transport in the risk zone in addition the hydraulic conductivity determination should be carried out through driller samples and pumping tests around the disposal system in the area ert profiles in the risk zone can use in combination with the measured hydraulic conductivity to improve the quality of the obtained groundwater flow models especially in sites with local scale heterogeneity in the vulnerable regions credit author statement khaled gemail

1459,groundwater pollution is a global issue in highly populated areas the eastern nile delta region is a typical example especially around artificial wastewater drains in the present work a multidisciplinary approach using hydrogeochemical geostatistical microbiological and geophysical data was applied to determine the vulnerability conditions and to identify potential pathways through which contaminants could potentially percolate to shallow aquifers in the southern boundary of the eastern nile delta an organized groundwater sampling was conducted for hydrogeochemical investigation in rural areas along the belbies unlined drain this drain is known of being heavily polluted by agricultural and municipal wastewater the hydrogeochemical analysis reveals high pollution levels by pb cd and cr for most of the collected shallow groundwater samples nearby the drain additionally no3 fecal and total coliform bacteria were observed in many samples with high concentrations six factors were distinguished on the basis of principal component analysis and varimax rotation with total variance more than 78 these factors reflected sewage contamination lithogenic and anthropogenic effects on the shallow groundwater hierarchical cluster analysis revealed two main clusters of groundwater groups accordingly electrical resistivity tomography ert was carried out in the areas of the distinguished clusters to locate potential preferential flow paths and horizons of lateral flow around the drain the obtained resistivity models illustrate breakthrough behavior in parts of the measured profiles due to the presence of permeable paths close to the drain the applied integrative approach is valuable for understanding the ambiguities during the interpretation process and for characterizing water quality and the aquifer vulnerability conditions additionally it may guide to understand the surface water groundwater links in order to supply the growing population with safe water keywords nile delta aquifer groundwater pollution hierarchical cluster analysis fecal coliform electrical resistivity tomography preferential flow paths 1 introduction shallow groundwater aquifers are major water resource for human demands in many regions of the world especially with continuous increase in population urbanization and developmental activities levy et al 2011 consequently there is an urgent need for determining the contamination pathways and sources to prevent their invasion to the groundwater thus the early warning of groundwater pollution is important for mitigation and control of pollution seepage from wastewater disposal systems dumpsites sewage ponds and other anthropogenic activities huan et al 2020 in egypt and other developed countries the chemical and bacterial contaminants can percolate from the unplanned disposal systems into shallow groundwater aquifers where the raw wastewater are dumped into adjacent waterways nile river irrigation canals and agricultural drains and led to significant hydrological and environmental degradation xu et al 2008 in addition there is a high potential risk for groundwater pollution in dumping sites of wastewater where it can affect shallow groundwater wells bengtsson et al 1994 matias et al 1994 in such environments the understanding and maintaining of bacterial and chemical pollutants existing in shallow groundwater aquifers through the vadose zone and interface with surface water has become management significance kausch et al 2020 in the nile delta as an example of high population densities fig 1 the unlined wastewater disposal systems and dumpsites can be a source of groundwater pollution particularly at shallow depths through permeable soils datta et al 1997 elevated levels of toxic metals in the groundwater pose substantial risks to local resource users and to the natural environment chabukdhara et al 2017 therefore the groundwater shows a considerable variation in terms of quality and suitability arising from transport of surface contaminants from these disposal systems or via overuse of shallow groundwater under such conditions shallow groundwater aquifers that are heavily used for drinking purposes must be monitored continuously to determine their quality and to what extent they have degraded kelly and wilson 2002 numerous drains such as belbies el qalyubia and bahr el baqar drains dissect the southeastern part of nile delta area fig 1 such drains are designed to transmit contaminated water arising from irrigation return flow and industrial wastewater as well as sewage the untreated or partially treated wastewater of east cairo is discharged to gabal el asfar treatment plant in east cairo that is in turn move to the belbies drain 60 km length that join to the el qalyubia drain about 70 km long fig 1 zhu et al 1999 revealed that the water quality parameters measured along bahr el baqar drain exceeded the legal limits these drains contain high concentrations of ammonia heavy metals sodium chloride and coliform bacteria saad 1997 taha et al 2004 therefore the groundwater quality in el qalyubia sharkia and ismailia regions in the eastern nile delta is greatly influenced by domestic and agricultural activities and polluted by nitrates and phosphates by virtue of pervasive use of chemical fertilizers taha et al 2004 moreover in belbies and new cities which are located north and east cairo industrial activities are dominant beside some agricultural activities representing the main source of pollution stahl et al 2009 for sustainable management of shallow groundwater in such conditions understanding of pollution sources recharge process in vadose zone flow direction and monitoring of water quality is needed amya et al 2018 several approaches can be used for understanding the transport of wastewater and recharge process in vadose zone for instance the high resolution geophysics and hydrogeophysical techniques can be applied as a monitoring tool for qualitative understanding of the flow of contaminants and migration patterns in the subsurface from disposal systems e g soupios and karaoulis 2015 rani et al 2016 simyrdanis et al 2018 rani et al 2019 soldi et al 2019 commer et al 2020 routinely the hydrogeochemical characteristics multivariate statistics and graphical analysis can be used to evaluate the origin of dissolved salts and pollutants in groundwater mattern et al 2009 kolsi et al 2013 chen et al 2013 matiatos 2016 minet et al 2017 busico et al 2018 jia et al 2020 practically this kind of investigations has been employed successfully in homogenous soils to obtain direct quantitative information about the origin and degree of pollution however it is considered as one dimensional 1d and locally representative in the heterogeneous aquifers while the scope of the present research is to identify the preferential pathways for fluids and surface contaminants using an integrative approach several recent studies in other regions have addressed the importance of hydrogeochemical and geophysical based techniques to evaluate the degree of contamination and flow patterns in the near surface soils gemail et al 2011 leitÃ£o et al 2014 koda et al 2017 gemail et al 2017a boy roura et al 2018 valiente et al 2018 lamb et al 2019 song et al 2020 and others these approaches demonstrated that the combination of different techniques could help in finding the paths and sources of pollutants and understanding the wastewater and groundwater processes in different aquifer types however in some places as in the present case study it is difficult to use the electrical conductivity properties for identifying the chemical response of contaminants where the groundwater and wastewater exhibit close tds and ph trends in addition to heterogeneities of the soil material to develop the approach the statistical factor analysis of several hydrogeochemical parameters and fecal coliform analyses were employed with electrical resistivity tomography ert technique to determine the vulnerability conditions and to identify potential pathways and determine the impact of unlined disposal systems on shallow groundwater aquifer moreover the hierarchical clustering technique the average linkage between groups was applied to define the similar groups that could be spatially delineated and facilitate the use of other techniques such as ert to trace pollution pathways additionally the use of major ion s variation diagrams can help to characterize the possible ionic sources and detach those of anthropogenic impacts the south eastern boundary of the nile delta area was selected as a case study to apply the suggested approach along the belbies drain fig 1 accordingly water sampling was applied for the area nearby and around the belbies drain factor analysis and cluster analysis were used and combined with microbiological analysis fecal coliforms to validate and interpret the chemical results of the collected samples and to assess groundwater quality the electrical resistivity tomography ert as a geophysical imaging tool was employed in the highly vulnerable zones to map the preferential flow paths of wastewater in the vadose zone in the considered area 2 geological and hydrogeological site characterization the considered area is covered mainly by the holocene nile deposits consisting of nile silt sand and sandy clay deposits with thickness varying from place to place ranging from 0 to 20 m fig 2 it is underlain by the pleistocene sediments which are formed mainly of sand and gravels with intercalations of clay lenses these sediments have a variable thickness at the eastern parts of the nile delta ranging from zero in the south to nearly 600 m while at the northwestern parts they may reach 900 m khalil et al 1988 mansour 2020 the oligocene basalt appears on the surface as small exposure in the southern parts of the study area at abu zaabal region fig 2 the oligocene rocks are dominated by sands gravels and fractured basalt the thickness of these rocks varies from 30 to 100 m and act as a deep aquifer below the basaltic sheets capping basalt may about 30 m overlie the fluviatile sands and gravels the miocene sediments are present in some places of the study area and composed of alternating sandy limestone and sandy marls of shallow marine origin ismailia freshwater canal is located in the southeastern fringes of east nile delta and is characterized by higher water level than groundwater level representing the main source for groundwater recharge in east nile delta rigw and iwaco 1983 the open drains in the nile delta have a total length of 18 000 km bed widths varying from 1 to 30 m and depths from 2 5 to 6 m and generally have a water level maintained at 2 5 m dri 2004 the canal and drains pass through the holocene deposits in the area to the east of the damietta branch and shift to move through the pleistocene deposits in the far eastern parts fig 2 the surface drainage system receives raw liquid wastes and effluents from nearby villages and factories posing threats to the shallow aquifers whenever the sediments are dominated by sand and silty nature along and around the belbies drain many hand dug and irrigation wells were drilled at shallow depths 15 40 m and used for drinking irrigation and industrial purposes especially in unplanned population areas that contain many houses and small factories that are lacking safe water the chance for groundwater pollution is increased in the east nile delta due to extensive agriculture and industrial activities and use of return flow for irrigation abo el fadl 2013 the main groundwater bearing deposits in the study area are the quaternary aquifer that is represented by an upper holocene aquitard fig 2b and c and a lower pleistocene aquifer rigw 1989 taha et al 1997 yehia 2000 farid 1985 sherif et al 2012 nofal et al 2015 in the southern and middle parts of the delta the aquifer exhibits leaky conditions and near the western and eastern borders it represents unconfined conditions where the top holocene deposits are almost absent fig 2c the aquifer hydraulic conductivity in the area south of the ismailia canal which is close to most of the investigated area is 43 2 m day while the transmissivity is 2836 m2 day geriesh et al 2015 the groundwater levels in the eastern parts of the nile delta vary from 10 m a s l in the present study area to less than 1 m a s l in the northeastern parts close to el manzala rigw 1992 elewa et al 2013 eltarabily et al 2020 the storativity of the pleistocene aquifer ranges between 0 1 and 0 01 indicating unconfined to semi confined conditions of the aquifer the effective porosity over the whole area ranges between 12 and 19 and the total porosity varies between 25 and 40 farid 1985 dahab 1993 sherif 1999 the groundwater flow in the pleistocene aquifer is due north and northwest directions rigw 1989 the interaction between the surface and groundwater systems is seasonally variable sherif et al 2012 the contamination of shallow groundwater aquifer in the east nile delta region is a factor of the hydraulic connection between surface water system drains and irrigation canals and the aquifer accordingly the section of the belbies drain that incises in the holocene aquitard dominated by sand and sandy clay deposits promotes contaminant migration to the shallow aquifer than when it incises in clay deposits elewa 2010 abd elaty et al 2019 the recharge sources in the quaternary aquifer are irrigation canals and drainage networks in the eastern nile delta region while the discharge take place through groundwater withdrawals from the wide distributed water wells and upward leakage elewa 2010 el fakharany et al 2017 3 methodology the flowchart of methodology was described in fig 4 a campaign was conducted to areas around the belbies unlined drain in october 2018 for collecting water samples from the shallow aquifer along the drain twenty nine groundwater samples were collected in addition to one surface water sample from the belbies drain fig 3 the drain sample was selected as a reference polluted point from the central zone of the belbies drain nearby the zone where most of the collected groundwater was sampled at al monier el zawamel and abu zaabal locations fig 3 this zone is a path for all types of pollutants discharged to the drain from the start point at gabal el asfar treatment plant and return irrigation flow direct wastewater and industrial wastes fig 3 comparison of some anthropogenic parameters in the drain water with those in previous studies i e taha et al 2004 stahl et al 2009 saber et al 2015 showed that their values are comparable to the current sample confirming contamination and indicating the credibility of using the selected drain sample as a reference point for comparison with groundwater samples the samples were collected from shallow wells at different depths from 15 to 40 m from ground surface these wells mainly drilled illegally by farmers and local habitants in the vicinity of the belbies drain as in el zawamel al monier el khanka and belbies villages and cities for irrigation drinking and domestic purposes using standard calibrated field equipment the ph temperature t total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ the collected samples were put in acid washed airtight polyethylene bottles washed with water at the sampling site and then filled to the top water samples were collected in three bottles one for the major ions cations and anions and another for heavy metals where samples were filtered through 0 45 Î¼m membrane filter and acidified by ultra pure nitric acid to ph less than 2 while the last bottle was for microbiology coliform bacteria finally the collected samples were set in iceboxes and kept refrigerated before being transported to the laboratory the laboratory analysis includes major cations k na mg2 and ca2 and major anions cl so4 2 and hco3 and no3 additionally some trace elements were analyzed such as cu ni cd cr pb and zn using icp oes model icap 6200 duo of the company thermo scientific for bacteriological analysis fecal coliform fc and total coliform tc were determined using membrane filter technique by a filtration system completed with stainless steel autoclavable manifold and oil free millipore vacuum pressure pump the analysis time of total coliform and fecal coliform did not exceed 6 24 h results were recorded in cfu 100 ml most of shallow groundwater contamination studies aim to identify specific source of contamination based on physical and or chemical characterizations of groundwater and surface contaminants olmez et al 1994 in case of multiple source contamination or soil heterogeneity as in agricultural areas southern nile delta is a good example it is difficult if not impossible to use the chemical approaches for delineating the contamination sources therefore the statistical factor and cluster analyses are important for the determination of groundwater chemistry zonation and hydrogeochemical behavior of groundwater sarangi et al 2005 el alfy et al 2015 el alfy et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 masoud et al 2018 masoud et al 2019 cluster analysis was used by gÃ¼ler et al 2002 to determine the quality of surface water and groundwater ryberg 2006 applied hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis to determine the water quality of lake sakakawea central north dakota therefore the statistical treatment of data q mode cluster analysis and factor analysis was done using the statistical package for social sciences spss 17 0 chemical calculations were performed using phreeqci charlton et al 1997 maps were processed using erdas imagine leica geosystem 2000 and arcmap 10 3 software package based on the cluster and factor analysis results the geophysical measurements in the form of dc resistivity surveys 1d and 2d were applied in the vulnerable zones to visualize and detect the expected pathways of the wastewater in the topmost soil around the main drain the vertical electrical sounding ves technique was applied using schlumberger array due to its sensitivity for shallow variations above aquifer zone the apparent resistivity of the different soils can be determined based on the measured potential difference and the applied current and the distance between the electrodes the measured resistivity is inverted to true resistivity and thickness for each soil type and can apply for mapping the structural disturbances in vertical and horizontal directions such as fault or fracture systems and layer boundaries to study its impact on solute transport in the shallow zones over the aquifer system gemail 2015 the collected apparent resistivities at each site were inverted using ip2win software bobachev et al 2003 in this technique the forward modeling was created using the linear filtering algorithm which provides rapid and accurate models covering all the reasonable geologic circumstances additional geological and field observations were used to calibrate the obtained resistivity models and outline the lithologic boundaries in each site several recent field scale studies have been successfully employed the dc resistivity surveys 1d 2d in quantitatively estimating the hydraulic properties of groundwater aquifers and associated solute transport in the vadose zone e g gemail et al 2004 farzamian et al 2015 kazakis et al 2016 perdomo et al 2018 the main objective of these hydrogeophysical studies was to predict the hydraulic parameters of an aquifer from geophysical data using the empirical relationships of both aquifer resistivity and conventional pumping test data however in the present case study the heterogeneities in the aquifer system are practically challenging and the estimated hydraulic conductivity from resistivity data is considered as in situ or local scale bowling et al 2005 due to the broad spatial variations in lithostratigraphic facies along the main drain therefore the ves survey is a one dimensional 1d mapping technique and is thus prone to high uncertainty in short distance lateral variations as in case of pollution pathways or near surface permeable zones thus the combination of 1d resistivity sounding and ert technique 2d with hydrogeochemical data is the obvious choice for detecting the movement and percolation of the wastewater within soil zone to shallow aquifer groundwater el eraki et al 2010 gemail 2012 seferou et al 2013 papadopoulos et al 2014 gemail et al 2017a simyrdanis et al 2018 yang et al 2019 in environmental applications 2d ert surveys have applicability for mapping the lithologic variations around and beneath the surface pollutants sand rich zones where the presence of these permeable zones may act as a vulnerable zone and the waste water can percolate to the shallow aquifers sorensen et al 2005 gemail et al 2017b accordingly three vulnerable sites al monier gabal el asfar and el zawamel villages were selected for more detailed mapping using ert surveys fig 3 these sites are located close to the belbies main drain and characterized by known problematic conditions in the soils and groundwater in addition to the anomalous results of the prior water quality analysis and cluster classification the ert profiles were carried out using siber 48 48 channels multi electrode system to automate the data collection as much as possible the apparent resistivities were collected along 235 m profile with 5 m minimum electrode spacing and data level n 15 these parameters allow for imaging of the variations in the uppermost part of the aquifer to a depth of 30 m during the field measurements the resistivity meter obtained the apparent resistivity and estimated the standard deviation errors q from repeated cycles observations with a standard deviation error of more than 5 were repeated or discarded to obtain the true 2d distribution of soil resistivity the apparent resistivity data were inverted using the program res2dinv loke and barker 1996 in which a 2d resistivity model of the subsurface was calculated for the input apparent resistivity data the program uses an array of rectangular blocks to model the subsurface structures and calculates resistivity values that agree with the actual measurements using finite element fe algorithm there are two options for data inversion in the program robust inversion method claerbout and muir 1973 which is more suitable to situations involving abrupt change in resistivity between adjacent blocks due to fractures faults or rock discontinuities as in the present case in al monier site and smoothness constrained least squares technique degroot hedlin and constable 1990 loke and barker 1996 which is preferable when there is smooth variation in resistivity values as in the other two sites gabal el asfar and el zawamel sites where the sandy soil dominates in this region 4 results and discussion 4 1 major dissolved constituents understanding of the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater can help in assessment of the pollutant flow patterns the water rock interaction as well as the water quality here the samples have a ph range from 6 2 to 7 89 where most of the groundwater are near neutral with total dissolved salts tds from 212 to 1143 ppm while the ph of the drain water is 7 79 with tds value of 1158 ppm table 1 therefore it is often hard to express the source of groundwater contamination in such case based on the hydrogeochemical properties only as mentioned earlier in the literature of the present multidisciplinary approach the water samples in the area exhibit two major water types of na hco3 and nacl except for samples 7 8 and 9 that show ca hco3 water type the na hco3 type shows dominance of alkali metals over alkaline earths and weak acidic anions over strong acidic anions while the nacl type shows dominance of strong acidic anions over weak acidic anions the third type is characterized by higher concentrations of alkaline earth elements relative to alkali elements and weak acidic anions relative to strong acidic anions fig 5 the water from the belbies drain sample 30 shows nacl water type table 1 therefore the dominant water type nacl indicates the possibility of halite dissolution or may be possibly due to the impact of wastewater leakage where the majorities of these samples were collected from the residential areas along the belbies drain 4 2 groundwater chemistry the water chemistry is greatly influenced by reactions with rock minerals accordingly other processes that affect the ion concentrations could be deduced from variation diagrams fig 6 the results from the water analysis were presented on x y relations and the possible reactions were inferred most of the water samples plot below the 1 2 line in the hco3 ca2 variation diagram fig 6a indicating that neither calcite nor dolomite dissolution control the concentration of calcium and bicarbonate in the samples the excess bicarbonate could be attributed to biological processes or dissolution of atmospheric co2 according to the reaction 1 the plot of so4 versus ca2 indicate that the collected samples have calcium content over than expected above the 1 1 line from gypsum dissolution indicating that gypsum is not a source for calcium and sulfate in the water samples undersaturation with respect to gypsum as seen in figs 6b and 7 c the high sulfate contents 30 8 66 4 ppm in the samples 5 8 13 15 16 17 28 and 30 could be due to pollution sources and fertilizers 1 co 2 h 2 o h 2 co 3 h hco 3 some samples are undersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite indicating that the dissolution of these minerals cannot explain the groundwater mineralization in the study area fig 7a and b nonetheless the saturation indices increase gradually with increasing salinity till they reach near and slightly oversaturation in case of calcite and dolomite fig 7a and b the distribution of samples in bivariate plots of fig 6 c d and e indicates that na and k dominate over ca2 and mg2 that are contributing substantially to the groundwater chemistry this could be explained by silicate weathering or ion exchange and suggest that bicarbonate is not as effective to the calcium concentrations as sulfate the plot of sodium against chloride shows that the samples 8 17 18 19 22 and 30 are controlled by halite dissolution data plot along the 1 1 line fig 6f however the rest of the water samples show increase of sodium over than expected from halite dissolution indicating other possible processes such as silicate weathering reaction 2 or cation exchange reactions 3 and 4 as shown in fig 6 g and h all water samples are undersaturated with respect to halite where the saturation index increases gradually with increasing total dissolved salts tds fig 7d 2 2naalsi 3 o 8 2h 9 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 2 na 4 h 4 sio 4 3 2 na ex ca 2 2 na ca ex 4 2 na ex mg 2 2 na mg ex accordingly the major categorizations and hydrogeochemical properties of the shallow groundwater varied along the belbies drain indicating an anthropogenic influence from irrigation activities and or percolation of wastewater from the unlined drain bicarbonates are controlled by dissolution of atmospheric gas and biological processes chlorides and sulfates are possibly controlled by pollution and fertilizer applications silicate weathering or cation exchange is the possible processes for the high sodium and potassium contents whereas calcium and magnesium are controlled by cation exchange reactions nitrates are a common source of pollution having ranges from 5 to 122 ppm samples exceeding the world health organization guideline who 2017 50 ppm for nitrate are 3 12 and 30 while most of them exceed the environmental protection agency epa 2009 level 10 ppm except 10 11 19 24 28 and 29 tables 1 and 2 the high nitrate values reflect the impact of the heavily application of agricultural fertilizers and the seepage from the belbies drain to nearby shallow groundwater due to uncontrolled pumping 4 3 trace element concentration the concentrations of trace elements are presented in the clustered column chart fig 8 and table 1 all samples show cu concentrations below the guideline limits of who 2017 and epa 2009 table 2 and fig 8 the majority of the groundwater samples have ni concentrations below the guidelines set by who 2017 0 07 ppm groundwater samples of ni concentrations higher than the guideline value are 3 6 7 13 16 21 22 24 25 27 and 28 which indicates the influence of the contaminated drain water or the agricultural return flow on the shallow groundwater aquifer as a result of continuous pumping samples which have cd levels below the maximum permissible limit of 0 003 ppm set by who 2017 are 8 21 23 and 24 and those lacking cd contents are 9 10 12 and 16 fig 8 table 2 nonetheless the rest of samples have cd content higher than the permissible limit the saturation index of otavite cdco3 for most of the water samples is oversaturated fig 9a confirming an anthropogenic source for cd the maximum permissible limit of cr in drinking water is 0 05 ppm who 2017 thus all samples beside the drain sample show cr concentrations far exceed the guideline of who 2017 table 1 indicating the contamination by wastewater the exceedance ranges from 6 fold in sample 29 to 12 fold in sample 30 fig 8 the saturation index of mgcr2o4 of all water samples is oversaturated fig 9b increasing with increasing ph and explaining the high concentration of cr in these samples with respect to pb concentration the most of collected samples exhibit concentrations higher than the guideline recognized by who 2017 0 01 ppm as seen in fig 8 and table 1 these high pb concentrations indicating high level of contamination in shallow groundwater particularly in the adjacent regions to the belbies drain the drain water show a high value in pb by 99 fold than the who 2017 guideline the saturation index of cerussite pbco3 of most of the water samples is oversaturated fig 9c asserting an anthropogenic source for pb the saturation indices of otavite and cerussite show similar trends against ph fig 9 a and c indicating the effect of anthropogenic impact on the groundwater the results of zinc zn reveals that the obtained values for shallow groundwater in the area is far below the limit set by who 3 ppm and epa 5 ppm however the maximum value of 0 634 ppm was reported at gabal el asfar farm southwest of the area in groundwater sample 16 while the zn value in the drain water was 0 78 ppm fig 8 4 4 microbiology total coliform tc and fecal coliform fc were evaluated in the collected samples to confirm the presence of pathogens and possible fecal pollution the obtained results were matched to the who quality standards for drinking water table 1 considering the water sample no 30 as a reference from surface wastewater the distributions of tc and fc show the highest values in samples 3 8 11 12 13 and 15 which have also high values of sulfates and nitrates fig 10 table 1 most of these samples are located in the southwest parts of area where the drain runs over sand rich soils groundwater samples that only have total coliforms include 2 4 6 7 18 and 20 the drain water shows highest contamination by total and fecal coliforms the presence of tc and fc and anomalous concentration of nitrates in the shallow groundwater samples is a direct evidence for the seepage from the belbies drain water 4 5 statistical analysis 4 5 1 descriptive statistics the ranges means and standard deviations of the analyzed variables are shown in table 2 the results were compared with the guideline values set by the environmental protection agency epa 2009 the world health organization who 2017 and by the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme 1999 most of the analyzed variables have concentrations below the guidelines set for drinking except for cd cr and pb which far exceed the limits 4 5 2 multivariate statistical analyses 4 5 2 1 factor analysis factor analysis is a statistical approach that can be employed to study interrelationships among large number of variables this approach involves finding a way to condense the information in a variety of original variables into a smaller collection of uncorrelated key components factors with minimal information loss hair et al 1992 abu salem et al 2017 el alfy et al 2018 principal component analysis pca was applied to infer the processes governing the concentration of ions factors with eigen values greater than 1 were extracted kaiser 1960 and the factor loadings of each original variable were examined on the basis of eigen values and varimax rotation six factors were distinguished to explain most of the variability total variance was about 78 for the water samples table 3 the first factor f1 is statistically dominant and accounts for about 25 of the total variance this factor is characterized by strong positive loadings on ec tds na cl and hco3 ca is moderately positively loaded this factor could be termed the salinity factor and indicates the lithogenic effect on the groundwater the second factor f2 explains 15 of the total variance and shows strong positive loadings on fecal coliform total coliform and nitrate showing the effect of sewage contamination furthermore the third factor f3 describes 14 of the total variance and shows strong positive loadings on pb k cr and so4 indicating anthropogenic input for these elements the fourth factor f4 explains 9 of the total variance and shows a strong positive loading on mg temperature and cu the fifth factor f5 accounts for 8 of the total variance and shows a strong positive loading on ni and zn indicating anthropogenic impacts on the groundwater the final factor f6 accounts for 7 of the total variance and shows a moderate positive loading on cr and strong negative loading on cd table 3 and fig 11 4 5 2 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca is one of the ways used to find different classes and groups within the investigated data with the results being represented as a dendrogram davis 1986 on the basis of visual examination of the dendrogram of the studied groundwater samples two main clusters a and b were observed at the presented phenon line fig 12a using twenty variables temperature ph electrical conductivity tds k na mg2 ca2 cl so4 2 hco3 no3 cu ni cd cr pb zn total coliform and fecal coliform cluster a is the main cluster and includes 23 groundwater samples fig 12 which are qualified to have insignificant pollution where the most of these samples occupy the northern parts of the area fig 12b geologically this area is covered by inhomogeneous silt and clay cap 5 10 m thick that forms the agricultural soil and incompletely protect the quaternary aquifer towards the north and northeast of the nile delta the cluster a is further subdivided into two subgroups a1 and a2 the means of the applied chemical parameters of each subgroup produced by the hca analysis are presented in table 4 subgroup a1 shows the lowest mean of tds values 385 ppm the lowest mean concentrations of na ca cl and so4 while the presence of noticeable bacteria of total and fecal coliforms especially in samples 3 and 8 at al monier and el zawamel villages respectively fig 12b and is attributed to the local heterogeneities of the clay cap the second subgroup a2 comprises seven samples 6 26 27 22 23 16 and1 which are characterized by high tds values than subgroup a1 mean 668 ppm and high na ca cl hco3 and so4 this subgroup possibly shows the effect of freshwater recharge of the ismailia canal to the south of the area on the other hand cluster b is subdivided into subgroup b1 and b2 table 4 subgroup b1 shows higher mean of tds values 1026 ppm and higher na ca cl so4 hco3 and no3 in addition to the highest mean of tc and fc the water samples of this subgroup 13 14 12 5 and 15 have the signature of the belbies drain sample 30 table 1 of high salinity high nitrate and high bacterial counts samples 12 and 13 fig 12a indicating the effect of possible contaminations from this drain subgroup b2 has only one member 17 a sample that is distinguished by significantly higher tds 1114 ppm highest cl so4 and pb and lacking bacterial pollution table 4 where this sample is located nearby industrial wastewater discharge 4 6 geophysical measurements the obtained models from the inverted schlumberger soundings represent multi layered structures reflecting the degree of saturation and clay content in the subsoil above the aquifer layer fig 13 the interpreted resistivities Ïi and thicknesses hi of layers above the aquifer zone were employed to calculate the hydraulic resistance kirsh 2006 or the integrated electrical conductivity iec rottger et al 2005 gemail et al 2011 in which the hydraulic conductivity ki is replaced by electrical conductivity 1 Ïi where it is not practicable to be carried out by traditional pumping tests in shallow wells vogelgesang et al 2020 the unit of integrated electrical conductivity iec is ohm 1 or siemens s can be estimated at each ves point by eq 5 5 iec i 1 n h i 1 Ï i where Ï i 1 Ï i accordingly the lowest values of the estimated iec indicate high hydraulic conductivity as in sand rich soils with low thickness of the protection zone in contrast the high value zones will have low resistivities and great thickness of clay and fine materials cap giving the low vulnerability or high protection level as practical example if the protection zone is 8 m thick and consists of homogenous clay with resistivity value of 4 Ï m the estimated iec value in this case will be 2 ohm 1 and will be reduced when the clay cap is mixed with sand thin layer with higher resistivity than the clay background therefore the calculated iec values at sites of ves1 and ves2 al monier site are 0 175 and 0 15 ohm 1 respectively where both points are located in the high vulnerable zone to validate the cluster analysis of water samples cluster b fig 12b thus providing rapid flow paths of wastewater in contrast these values relatively increase in el zawamel site ves3 and gabal el asfar ves4 to reach 2 1 and 1 6 ohm 1 respectively where the protective layers are discontinuous and heterogeneous of clay and fine sand soils thus the analysis of the resistivity curves exhibits the variations in soil characterization in each site as follows 4 6 1 al monier site al monier site was selected as highly vulnerable zone based on the statistical chemical and microbiological analysis of the collected water samples along the main drain compared with water sample 30 as a reference sample from the drain water the collected groundwater samples 3 and 12 are characterized by anomalous increase in the total and fecal coliforms in addition to nitrate fig 10 with sharp boundaries between clusters a and b fig 12 indicating a direct connection between the surface drain and shallow groundwater aquifer from the geological point of view the site is characterized by complex geology where the highly fractured basalt of the oligocene is exposed far away 2 km in the northwestern border at abu zaabal area fig 2 in addition the main drain in al monier runs partly over the uplifted miocene sands and localized limestone thin beds as indicated from the removed rock boulders from the drain bottom fig 14a and b there is also circumstantial evidence from the drilled boreholes in the area that the depth of these boreholes is changed rapidly and does not exceed than 26 m due to the shallow basaltic rocks in this case the presence of well defined preferential flow paths in the vadose zone e g fractures porous media is highly relevant in assessing aquifer vulnerability to pass contaminated wastewater foster 1998 to understand the flow mechanisms of wastewater to saturated shallow aquifers three ert profiles were carried out crossing the sharp boundaries between zone a and b to image the preferential flow paths in the fractured porous media as mentioned above in the ert survey wenner beta wb was selected which has a better vertical resolution together with realistically good horizontal resolution loke 2020 and can be used to detect rapid changes in the vadose zone the geological interpretation of the measured schlumberger sounding points ves 1 and 2 fig 13 a and b indicates that the soil sequence in al monier site shows large variation in the vertical resistivity distribution according to the lithologic composition and depth of subsurface layers around the main drain as seen in the resistivity curves fig 13 the abrupt increase in resistivity values at shallow depths 2 3 m indicate a concrete structure where the miocene limestone thin bed is locally uplifted in the area this part is underlain by saturated silt and sands with low resistivity values about 10 Ï m by considering the depths of the drilled boreholes in the area the high resistivity values in the basal part of the aquifer layer 20 26 m depth is attributed to fractured oligocene basalt to address the preferential wastewater flow paths in the study site the elongated inverted wb profile p3 was compiled with its perpendicular lines p1 and p2 as presented in fig 15 additionally the collected water samples with anomalous total coliform and fecal coliform as well as the suggested boundaries between the vulnerable zones a and b were presented on the figure to illustrate the expected flow paths around the main drain fig 15 the inverted ert models are presented with a same color scale for direct comparison and easily detect the subsurface conditions results from the inverted ert profiles indicate that a resistive sandy limestone bed appeared as shallow as 5 m deep in the area with the exception of an area east of profile p3 where the main drain is cross cutting the uplifted bedrock in this area as indicated from the removed limestone blocks during the deepening of drain in 2003 fig 14 a and b this bedrock is covered by the surficial quaternary clay and silt which is appeared as well defined low resistivity cap along p1 and p2 the disjointed nature of the anomalous higher resistivity bedrock which is cross cut laterally in numerous zones by lower resistivity values suggests the presence of fractures and loose sands in the subsurface along the three profiles fig 15 these fractures and absence of the protection bedrock in the area can move wastewater from the drain very quickly in the direction of pumping wells as appeared in water samples 3 4 and 12 these conductive zones in the sandy limestone with thinning or absence of the quaternary clay cap define areas where the shallow aquifer is only slightly protected if at all from surface wastewater these zones are suggested as highly vulnerable regions this is verified by the high concentrations of pb cr and zn in the groundwater samples 1 2 3 4 and 12 in fig 8 as well as the anomalous increasing in the total coliform and fecal coliform and nitrate concentrations samples 2 3 and 12 in fig 10 a low resistivity underlying layer 10 30 Ï m is appeared along the three profiles corresponding to the miocene sandy aquifer which is recharged mainly from ismailia freshwater canal towards the southern end of p2 sample 2 in addition to the percolated wastewater from the main drain and irrigation canals samples 1 3 4 and 12 the deeper part of the inverted sections shows a resistive target 75 Ï m with sharp boundaries with upper sand aquifer which is attributed to the uplifted oligocene fractured basalt 4 6 2 gabal el asfar site the gabal el asfar site is located to the south west of the previous site and considered as highly vulnerable site based on the cluster analysis fig 12 and high concentrations of pb zn and cr water samples 13 16 and 17 in fig 3 according to abdel shafy and abdel sabour 2006 the first 2 m soil profile in that site contains more than 75 sand and gravels with clay particles vary from 0 5 in the uncultivated lands to more than 20 in the cultivated lands for many years the area has been irrigated with primary treated raw sewage effluent through a drainage system running in sandy soil gemail 2012 however the area is underlain by the sand and gravel aquifer of the pleistocene which is capped in parts by two thin clay beds as seen in the obtained model of ves 3 fig 13 c therefore the vulnerability conditions in the area are based mainly on the thicknesses and discontinuities of clays in the overburden to fully understand this situation pole dipole array pd was applied for imaging the layering structure that can easily detect clay discontinuities in the cap zone as mentioned before the rapid smoothness least squares technique was applied to invert the measured ert profile where the soil sequence in the area changes smoothly from surface silty sand to clay and sandy clay then saturated sand and gravels aquifer as seen in the inverted section of fig 16 the pd profile was spread along open sub drain to achieve sufficient coverage of the preferential wastewater flow paths in heterogeneous sands and clay soil this sub drain runs on graded sand soil with 4 m depth and transports the raw industrial wastewater towards the belbies main drain after gabal el asfar treatment plant fig 14 c and d fig 16 illustrates the final inverted section of the ert profile in which the upper resistive layer consists of graded sand with a thickness of 3 4 m within the surface layer a conductive spots or bands 8 Ï m are visible and can be attributed to permeable pathways which are the source of possible outflows of industrial wastewater from the closed sub drain this heterogeneous topsoil is followed by a conductive saturated zone at depth of 4 m downwards to 15 m in particular the conductive anomalies at that depth are attributed to the high salinity of perched untreated wastewater or clay distributions along the line on the other hand a gradual increase in the resistivity values can be seen towards the main drain due to the leakage of treated wastewater with low salinity about 720 ppm gemail 2012 compared with untreated industrial wastewater in the sub drain fig 14 c additionally the vertical and lateral percolation of wastewater along the line is affected by the gentle topography which acts to rise the vertical infiltration through the permeable pathways in the topsoil then runs towards the main drain the deeper part of the inverted section shows a relatively high resistivity zone which is decreased gradually towards the main drain reflecting the degree of saturation and lateral outflows the closest water sample 13 to the profile contains appreciable values of total and fecal coliforms with high nitrates fig 10 confirming the role of the topsoil permeable zone for wastewater infiltration additionally to the east of the profile maximum concentrations of zn and pb were recorded in samples 16 and 17 respectively fig 8 the high values of trace element in the area are attributed to the clay discontinuities in the eastern side of the area gemail 2012 4 6 3 el zawamel site the third site is el zawamel village east to the previous two sites which is represented by cluster a based on hca fig 12 this area is a part of the main quaternary aquifer of nile delta which is covered by clay silt cap of holocene deposits with a thickness varies between 5 m to 10 m as indicated from the dug wells in the area embaby et al 2014 in this case the clay silt topsoil acts as semi pervious aquitard and the wastewater in the open drainage system i e belbies drain can penetrate into through the vadose zone and reach the aquifer down to a depth of 15 20 m below the surface gemail et al 2017a therefore the presence of permeable materials such as sands silt lenses within the soil cap can increase the intrinsic permeability and facilitate the vertical penetration of wastewater around the main drain schlumberger vertical electrical sounding ves 4 was measured close to the main drain to determine the vertical layer distribution above the aquifer zone as seen in fig 13 d accordingly the topsoil above the aquifer in the area consists of clay silt deposits 8 Ï m and extends to 8 m depth at that point five groundwater samples were collected in this site for chemical and bacterial analyses the samples 8 9 10 and 11 for location see fig 3 are closer to the drain while the sample 29 is located close to the ismailia freshwater canal and far away from the drain with 650 m as seen in fig 8 these samples are characterized by relatively low contents of heavy metals such as pb cr zn compared with the samples in the previous two sites on the other hand the anomalous value of the total coliform and fecal coliform is recorded only at sample 8 at the western side of the main drain the sample 29 was considered as reference sample where the aquifer at that point is recharged mainly from ismailia canal as indicated from its minimum values of pb with no values of fecal coliform in this site these anomalous values of the heavy metals and fecal coliform are related to the spatial distribution of the collected samples reflecting the amount of percolated wastewater based on the heterogeneities in the topsoil to image the lateral and vertical heterogeneities in the clay silt cap a wb profile was acquired 240 m length inside the main drain between samples 8 and 9 where the contents of fecal coliform are totally different in this short distance fig 17 shows wb inverted profile demonstrating the resistivity distributions in the layers above the groundwater aquifer along this profile the surface area is affected by clay and silt cover where the resistivity in the topmost soil is less than 8 Ï m with anomalous high resistivity spots at shallow depths these discontinuities in resistivity distribution within the protection clay cap are considered as being attributed to local sand bodies with relatively higher hydraulic conductivity compared to the clay background in the western side of the profile the appearance of the sand lenses close to and beneath the open drain explains the faecally contaminated discharge and high pollution load in water sample 8 due to the sand rich soils that act as permeable pathways for leakage of wastewater to the upper zone of aquifer at 9 m depth as seen in fig 17 the other side of the profile around sample 9 shows a thick about 15 m quite low resistivity surface layer probably clay rich in nature below which the resistivity rises with well defined boundary to 80 Ï m or more at a depth of around 25 m in such case the abrupt changes from relatively low resistivity values in the topmost soil to high values in the aquifer zone indicate the variation in the clay content and the groundwater quality where the upper parts is recharged from the perched wastewater while lower parts is recharged from the freshwater of ismailia canal to the east in the middle parts at 120 m distance it appears likely more localized low resistivity anomaly below sand windows high resistivity and extends to more than 35 m depth fig 17 which could be interpreted as high vulnerability conditions due to the heterogeneities in the clay cap in such places any discharge of pollutants or application of harmful chemicals and fertilizers in agricultural activities may reach directly to the groundwater or may percolate to the vadose zone and reach to the upper parts of the aquifer as in here the identification of such areas and their protection from fecal pollution will be of paramount importance to reduce the pollution risk by considering the safe depths of water wells the pumping rate and effective design of disposal networks in these areas the results obtained across the field sites in this study are comparable to those reported in previous studies including the determination of the hydraulic properties and the spatial patterns of wastewater flow within the southern boundaries of the nile delta aquifer as indicated in the southern vulnerable zone al monier and gabal el asfar sites sherif and al rashed 2001 simulated the groundwater contamination in the nile delta aquifer through the unsaturated zone using the sutra model and concluded that the over pumping from shallow wells was the main source of groundwater pollution and the future pumping should be reduced in the western and eastern boundaries of the nile delta in addition gemail 2012 employed the dc resistivity measurements to calculate the aquifer vulnerability index avi in the gabal el asfar farm and differentiated the area into vulnerable and highly vulnerable zones based on the clay discontinuities in the unsaturated zone confirming the results of hierarchical cluster analysis hca and ert in the present research to the north of the present study area abd elaty et al 2019 simulated the impact of bahr el baqar polluted drain and ismailia freshwater canal using numerical modeling of modflow and mt3mds to identify the contamination process of the shallow groundwater and they recommended using geo membrane lining materials and installing cut off walls in the drain sides for minimizing the solute transport into the unconfined aquifers as in the present case study thus the comparison of these results shows that the proposed multidisciplinary approach can be a helpful cost effective complement for monitoring contaminant transport to shallow heterogeneous groundwater aquifers in which the groundwater chemistry with geostatistical and fecal analyses can be powerful in identifying the aquifer vulnerability to surface contamination on a regional scale while the ert dense dataset of local scale can be used to delineate the lateral heterogeneity of the aquifer media and detect the permeable windows for leaching contaminants the traditional ves measurement determines the aquifer characterization at a single point scale 5 conclusion and recommendations the applied multidisciplinary approach in this work using hydrogeochemical geostatistical geophysical and microbiological data could be considered as a good qualitative practice revealing the enrolment and mobilization of surface contaminants and their flow paths in the vadose zone this integrative approach can be employed in similar circumstances elsewhere with results potentially allowing for targeted wastewater management strategies and to determine the competence of disposal systems in urban regions it is possible to apply the approach to determine the permeable zones in the heterogeneous soil sequence where the wastewater preferentially flows around and underneath point source pollution hydrogeochemical investigation of the collected shallow groundwater samples distinguished three water types namely na hco3 na cl and ca hco3 additionally high concentrations of total and fecal coliform and nitrates in many water samples were observed indicating the effect of seepage from the belbies unlined drain due to intensive abstraction rates this finding is also confirmed by the high concentrations of trace elements i e pb cr and cd the constructed variation diagrams indicated that the groundwater in the southeastern boundaries of the nile delta region is affected by wastewater pollution sources fertilizers and ion exchange processes the results of hierarchical cluster analysis have been demonstrated spatially to show the aerial distribution of different chemical groups revealing two main clusters with different vulnerability conditions six factors have been extracted from dimensional reduction of data representing 78 of the total variance these factors and clusters indicated the impact of polluted unlined belbies drain on the nearby shallow groundwater aquifer therefore the pollution pathways were determined by carrying out field 2d resistivity measurements in the distinguished cluster zones accordingly there is strong evidence from 2d resistivity signatures heavy metal loads and fecal coliform to suggest that the belbies drain at al monier and gabal el asfar sites represents a high contamination potential the identification of geological and hydrogeochemical characteristics of such locations using ert profiling and statistical analysis could be helpful to assess and manage the impact of fecal pollution around this kind of disposal system the complementary results of the obtained 2d resistivity sections show the importance of ert technique as a non invasive low cost and less time consuming method for subsurface mapping ert can be employed in combination with traditional hydrogeochemical methods to provide very extensive and detailed information about near surface geology and contaminant flow paths and guide a more effective placement of safe water wells overall this research demonstrates the improved interpretability of ert method in the context of aqueous contaminated sites with novel contributions of geostatistical and microbiological indications for mapping realistic flow paths of the shallow aquifers as a whole this work reveals that ert exhibits significant potential as a non invasive monitoring tool in different aquifer types additionally the use of multivariate statistical analyses factor and hierarchical cluster analysis hca and fecal coliform assessment as additional sources of validation is a great prospective of this work the obtained results are greatly helpful in the design of an effective monitoring system for assessing the pollution risk in the area continuous monitoring of groundwater quality and determination of pollution sources is very important to groundwater management and development attention should be focused upon the impact on human health and to address groundwater quality issues therefore the result of this research will be shared with the local government and decision makers to avoid the human health risk and infections caused by drinking polluted groundwater and determine if more precautions should be taken to remediate the current situation and sustainable management of groundwater as important resource in the arid regions additionally a recommended protocol needs to specify that human activities related to overuse and misuse of groundwater and usage of wastewater for irrigation which may have a negative impact on the groundwater environment shall be banned or restricted in the vulnerable zone of the southern part of the studied area in future and based on the current results the threats of pollution and the level of protection should be more carefully determined in the area where the wastes show rapid downward flow into the shallow sand aquifer due intensive pumping it is expected that the groundwater quality in the inferred vulnerable areas changes laterally and vertically in the vadose zone thus the future works should focus on the numerical flow and transport modeling in the southern parts of the area to simulate the groundwater lateral flow far away the main drain a qualitative correlation between hydrological flow model and ert results will provide a full understanding of the mechanism and scenario of solute transport in the risk zone in addition the hydraulic conductivity determination should be carried out through driller samples and pumping tests around the disposal system in the area ert profiles in the risk zone can use in combination with the measured hydraulic conductivity to improve the quality of the obtained groundwater flow models especially in sites with local scale heterogeneity in the vulnerable regions credit author statement khaled gemail
