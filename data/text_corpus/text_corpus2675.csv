13375,in this work we report a straightforward synthesis of magnetic graphene oxide go fe3o4 in very mild conditions this methodology proved to be effective in obtain graphene oxide go decorated with different amounts of incorporated magnetite the characterizations reveal the presence of magnetic nanoparticles mnps in analyzed nanomaterial despite several methods shown in the literature this protocol enables the amount control of incorporated magnetite on the surface of go experimental data shows that go fe3o4 1 10 mass mass demonstrates the highest adsorption capacity on the hydrochlorothiazide with a 67 86 removal of the contaminant and ph 7 0 as the favorable condition the removal rate and adsorption capacity are dependent on the initial concentration of the hctz amount and type of the adsorbent temperature ionic strength and solution ph in the adsorption were also studied the pseudo second order and freundlich models showed better adjustment of the experiment thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption process is exothermic and occurred spontaneously magnetic nanoadsorbent proves to be an efficient alternative nanomaterial for removing hydrochlorothiazide from aqueous solutions avoiding filtration and centrifugation steps graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water recovery drug removal graphene oxide magnetic nanomaterials 1 introduction many of the daily ingested drugs are partially metabolized by the body and large fractions excreted in the active form most of these substances are not removed by conventional water treatment systems due to structural complexity solubility ph sensitivity among others nevertheless the inadequate disposal associated with methods that have low efficiency of decontamination in wastewater not only puts human health at risk as well as causing an imbalance of the ecological microbiota 1 among the emerging micropollutants hydrochlorothiazide hctz worldwide used for the hypertension treatment stands out for its high excretion rate around 72 of the ingested dose is eliminated through the kidneys in the unmetabolized form 2 studies have reported the presence of hctz in affluents effluents and coastal waters as well as in marine animals 3 a recent study developed evaluated the toxic effect of hctz degradation using chlorination and uv irradiation the results demonstrated that the by products significantly increased the toxicity of hctz as the processing time increased in addition to chlorination ozonation can also convert main compounds into potentially toxic secondary products thus requiring a series of studies to determine the impact of these substances 4 among the countless possibilities liquid phase adsorption has exceptional advantages such as high removal efficiency low energy requirement relatively low cost in addition to not generating by products however the effectiveness of the process depends on some factors among them the intrinsic characteristics of the adsorbent porosity and surface area 5 6 in particular the use of graphene oxide go has been widely investigating due to unique properties such as specific area hydrophilicity thermal and chemical stability as well as for presenting high affinity by organic pollutants although the efficiency of the nanoadsorbent is remarkable there are still limitations with the use of the conventional materials such as separation from aqueous medium and reuse 7 8 recently magnetic nanoparticles mnps have been studied in adsorption processes due to the simplicity of operation without the requirement for filtration centrifugation steps and the possibility of recycling the material 9 however due to the critical diameter and attractive forces dipole dipole magnetic nanoparticles are unstable and consequently shown a tendency to agglomerate 10 thus the synthesis of nanocomposites is an alternative for avoiding the chemical instability of mnps and reduced the limitations of conventional adsorbents moreover the development of materials composites can increase the relationship between area volume reactivity aqueous solubility and result in higher adsorptive capacity 11 therefore considering the excellent properties of nanomaterials and potential harms to the environment and human health studies aiming for hctz removal from aqueous media are essential 6 furthermore few methods reporting the removal degradation of this pollutant are available in this work we report a synthesis protocol of the magnetic graphene oxide go fe3o4 with control of the amount of incorporated magnetite and its influence on the specific area of the go the hctz adsorption in the magnetic nanocomposites was investigated using several experimental parameters initial adsorbate concentration adsorbent dosage solution ph ionic strength recycling and temperature furthermore mechanistic hypotheses of the adsorption also were studied as well as the influence of the type of the nanoadsorbent nanocomposite containing different amounts in proportion mass mass of the dispersed phase fe3o4 in the adsorption capacity 2 material and methods 2 1 synthesis of graphene oxide go

spectrophotometer shimadzu at λ 323 nm prior to the analyses the nonmagnetic go was filtered from the solution with a membrane filter 0 22 μm millex gp and sequentially carried out to centrifugation for 10 min at 10000 rpm for the go samples containing fe3o4 no filtration was necessary just by applying a simple magnet at the flask surface the adsorbent adsorbate complex was removed from the solution the kinetics isotherms and adsorption capacity were evaluated using graphene oxide go and magnetic graphene oxide go fe3o4 with different proportions of incorporated magnetite under the experimental conditions hctz solution 50 mg l 1 the mass of the adsorbent 0 5 g l 1 solution volume 100 ml the temperature of 293 1 00 k and working ph 4 0 7 0 and 10 0 descriptions and equations about kinetic and isotherm models see in the supporting information 12 13 2 5 1 effect of solution ph and ionic strength on the adsorption of the hydrochlorothiazide the effect of solution ph and ionic strength on hctz adsorption was investigated according to the following experimental procedure an amount of 0 5 g l 1 of the magnetic graphene oxide go 1 10 was added in a beaker containing hctz

effect of go fe3o4 1 10 dosage on the adsorption of the hydrochlorothiazide was performed maintaining all other parameters constant the adsorption experiments were carried out in batch varying the concentration of adsorbent from 0 125 1 0 g l 1 temperature 293 1 00 k initial concentration of hctz 50 mg l 1 ph 7 0 contact time 180 min 2 5 3 adsorption capacity of go fe3o4 1 10 and thermodynamic study the adsorption capacity using go fe3o4 1 10 and the thermodynamic study were carried out using hctz solutions containing 0 5 g l 1 of adsorbent at working ph 7 0 with concentrations ranging

desorbing agent the mixture was stirred at 90 rpm for 60 min at 303 1 00 k consecutively solution was poured with the assistance of the magnetic field and the adsorbent was washed with acetone 3 results and discussion 3 1 straightforward synthesis of magnetic graphene oxide with different proportions of incorporated magnetite go fe3o4 in this work we applied a synthesis protocol without the use of hydrothermal techniques with the management of the amount of incorporated fe3o4 analyzes confirmed the control of the different amounts of incorporated magnetite with the maintenance of the magnetic activity of the material thus allowing the application in the removal of contaminants through adsorption assays the different reactions for the incorporation of magnetite on the go surface are shown in the table 1 the go reaction with fecl2 in a 1 1 ratio r1 152 mg of the magnetic material was obtained by using 1 5 go fecl2 ratio r2 303 mg of the magnetic compound were obtained revealing an increased amount of magnetite incorporated by r3 employing 1 g of fecl2 1 10 ratio the reaction furnished 509 mg of the magnetic material corresponding to 79 53 yield finally the adsorption applying nanocomposites with a higher go fecl2 ratio i e 1 20 r4 reveals only partial incorporation of the magnetite yielding 44 74 thus suggest a saturation of fe3o4 under the surface of graphene oxide it is possible to find in the literature diverse protocols to obtain magnetic graphene oxide they differ from each other essentially in the method for the precipitation of the fe2 fe3 salts most of them only applying a specific amount of the iron moiety for the desired nanocomposite table 2 table 2 illustrates different methods for the iron oxide nanoparticles incorporation on the surface of go comparing their experimental conditions and structural characteristics of the nanocomposites cheng et al 8 reported a study applying ammonia as a precipitating agent in the mixture of fe2 fe3 for the fe3o4 incorporation on the go surface under mild conditions they obtain a magnetic go with a lower id ig ratio i e preserving the integrity of the carbonaceous structure and the functional groups and showing magnetic behavior similarly for the arsenic removal of the aqueous solution sherlala et al 15 employs a co precipitation protocol for the synthesis of magnetic graphene oxide by using a fecl2 fecl3 ratio 2 45 1 at a temperature of 85 c and a large amount of iron moieties the nanocomposite showed high values of magnetization saturation similar to magnetite 69 9 emu g 1 applying a microwave assisted hydrothermal strategy lellala 16 prepared a magnetic nanocomposite from fecl3 with naoh as precipitating agent and autoclave at 150 c for 24 h the xrd analysis of the reaction reveals a partial reduction of the go and fe3o4 incorporation on the surface of the hybrid product the absence removal of the oxygenated functional groups decreases the structural integrity combining both co precipitation and emulsion protocols albert et al 17 synthesized magnetic graphene oxide applying nh4oh for precipitation of the iron salts and organic chloroform for the emulsification step although not simpler the two step fe2 fe3 reaction provided a nanocomposite with a low id ig ratio without mainly structural damage and maintaining the magnetic properties zeng et al 18 reported a hydrothermal preparation of mnps using urea as precipitating agent sodium citrate and polyacrylamide employing only fecl3 as an iron source microwave assisted autoclave and heating in the oven for 8 h at 180 c this protocol furnished the nanocomposite with uniformly morphological distribution and high magnetization values in this work applying co precipitation protocol using nh4oh mild conditions and using fecl2 as an iron source we were able to synthesize go fe3o4 with structural integrity maintenance magnetization saturation and control of magnetite incorporated on the surface of the graphene oxide 3 2 characterizations of nanoadsorbents 3 2 1 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir in fig 1 the ftir spectroscopic data spectro one perkin elmer kbr disc of graphene oxide and magnetic graphene oxides with different proportions of incorporated ferrite are presented fig 1 shows the ftirs of the graphene oxides synthesized in this work the go spectrums show an expressive band around 3480 cm 1 that refers to the axial deformation of the hydroxyl group showing the presence of oh groups on the surfaces of the nanomaterials the stretching frequency of the carbon oxygen double bond r2c o appears as a peak at 1617 cm 1 indicating the presence of carbonyl moieties the remaining bands appearing between 1497 and 1452 cm 1 are related to the stretching or axial deformation of the cc bonds 7 in addition to the constant peaks it can be observed the appearance of a previously non existent band around 615 cm 1 in the ftir of magnetic graphene oxides originated from the stretching vibrations of feo see fig s1 in the supporting information which indicates the presence of fe3o4 incorporated into the surface of the gos 9 19 it is also possible to observe a smooth intensification of the band 600 cm 1 range as the amount of fe3o4 incorporated into the gos increases 3 2 2 x ray diffraction xrd the x ray diffractogram of graphene oxides see fig s2 in the supporting information shows complete oxidation of graphite starting material due to the absence of the peak at 2θ 26 and by the appearance of the peak at 2θ 11 4 001 characteristic of go 7 8 for the nanocomposites it is possible to observe the presence of peaks at 2θ 30 2 35 3 43 5 57 01 and 63 3 corresponding to the indices 220 311 400 511 and 440 in the graphs the position and relative intensity of all peaks are compatible with magnetite jcpds card no 19 0629 see fig s1 in the supporting information the results of the xrd agree well with the sem and tem analyses a weaker characteristic peak similar to go can be observed in go fe3o4 1 1 considering the small amount of fe3o4 in nanomaterial surfaces meanwhile in go fe3o4 1 5 and go fe3o4 1 10 the peak of go disappears due to the large amount of fe3o4 indicating that the interlayer spacing of these materials decreases after the magnetic process which is due to the fe3o4 agglomerate 17 3 2 2 1 average crystallite size determination according to the average crystallite size determined by the scherrer equation see table s1 in the supporting information it can be inferred that the particle size of the go decreases with the addition of magnetic nanoparticles highly oxidizing media containing transition metals such as fe2 in the presence of a base increase the rate of hydrolysis of materials and consequently decrease the particle size 9 nevertheless the ultrasonic irradiation used in the magnetization process contributed to the decrease in particle size corroborating with the results obtained by le et al 20 3 2 3 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds fig s3a d supporting information shows data from the elemental analysis of graphene oxide and magnetic nanocomposites go containing different amounts of fe3o4 using the eds technique as shown in fig s3a it is possible to verify carbon atoms and heteroatoms o and s presence meantime in fig s3b d see in the supporting information can be seen observing the appearance of iron ions in samples of magnetic graphene oxides for instance the magnetic nanocomposite containing the same proportion of go fecl2 1 1 presents a lower rate of fe ions 2 33 meanwhile for go fe3o4 1 5 and go fe3o4 1 10 increased to 6 29 and 9 66 respectively see table s2 in the supporting information furthermore these results indicate the relationship between the amount of fecl2 employed with magnetite incorporated on the surface of go as previously shown in the ftir xrd and sem analyses 21 3 2 4 raman spectroscopy coprecipitation is the most common method for obtaining magnetic nanoparticles due to the mild conditions employed low temperature and without the use of organic solvents with a high boiling point for precipitation of iron salts however strong oxidizing substances and ultrasonic treatment usually used in the synthesis of go nanocomposites possibly affect the structure of go and removes functional groups fig s4a c supporting information shows the raman spectra of magnetic graphene oxides synthesized in this study all samples showed the characteristic d and g bands of go at 1353 cm 1 and 1593 cm 1 respectively 8 the difference in intensity between the d and g bands allows measuring the quality of the go produced by calculating the id ig ratio interestingly in this study with the increase of doped iron ions in go there is a proportional increase in the value of the id ig ratio however the low values of the calculated id ig ratio indicated that the structure and oxygenated groups of go were not significantly affected by the experimental conditions for example the value id ig of the go changed from 0 910 to 1 105 for go fe3o4 1 1 and only changed by 0 255 between magnetic nanocomposites go fe3o4 1 1 to go fe3o4 1 10 the high presence of metal ions on the gos surface generates a greater interaction between carbon and iron atoms result in a greater number of defects the presence of doped iron ions in the go can be seen in fig s4c see supporting information where it is possible to observe the characteristic peak a1g 615 710 cm 1 of magnetite in the samples go fe3o4 1 5 and go fe3o4 1 10 22 in the case of go fe3o4 1 1 sample it was not possible to observe peaks referring to iron oxides because the sample does not have a considerable amount of iron ions in its composition in the context of go quality two 2d bands d g that appear in 2700 and 2900 cm 1 can help in this analysis as the 2d is known as the band that indicates the number of graphene layers for go this band indicates the number of layers and defects present in the nanomaterial 8 the greater the intensity of the 2d band in relation to g the higher is the number of defects present in the go the other band at d g indicates the number of oxygen present on the gos surface the difference between d g and 2d intensity is proportional to the defects present i e the lower the intensity of the d g band about 2d the smaller is the number of defects in the structures of the gos this analysis indicates that the go produced in this study has a reduced number of defects thus reinforcing the high quality go and go nanocomposite synthesized in this work 3 2 5 scanning electron microscopy sem the surface morphology of go a and the magnetic graphene oxides produced with different proportions 1 1 go fecl2 b 1 5 go fecl2 c 1 10 go fecl2 d were characterized by scanning electron microscopy zeeis sigma 300 vp shown in fig 2 fig 2a shows the sem image of the isolated go it is possible to observe the smooth surface of the nanomaterial and overlapped layers in fig 2b lowest proportion of fe3o4 incorporated even with the nanoparticles nps deposited at the surface it is still possible to observe the characteristic morphology of the go however as the proportion of the ion precursor increases more fe3o4 nps are anchored to the go surface and the particle size increases respectively go 1 5 c and go 1 10 d the increase in density and particle size indicates that the higher fecl2 dosage on the magnetization reactions can directly influence the grown in the size of the magnetic nps 16 3 2 6 transmission electron microscopy tem the size and morphology of the nanocomposite go fe3o4 were investigated by transmission electron microscopy tem fig 3 a b shows the tem images from go fe3o4 1 1 and go fe3o4 1 10 was synthesized in this work according to the images it is possible to verify that graphene oxide has a wrinkled surface which is characteristic of few layer go nanosheets it can also be observed that the fe3o4 nanoparticles have a particle diameter of 10 nm corroborating with the results reported by rofouei et al 23 moreover were well distributed on the surface of graphene oxide however in fig 3 it is observed that some particles formed aggregates on the surface of the graphene oxide due mainly to the close degree of saturation 3 2 7 thermal and chemical stability of magnetic graphene oxide considering its application in different areas processes and environments different chemical and physical stability tests of magnetic graphene oxide were carried out varying the ph and temperature 3 2 7 1 thermal stability of magnetic graphene oxide table 3 shows the temperature resistance of the synthesized graphene oxide nanocomposites in t1 and t2 the material maintains the magnetic behavior at high temperatures up to 400 c considering your application in the synthesis of organic derivatives and a possible application in materials in the t3 test curiously the sample was not magnetic while still heated and recovers its magnetic characteristics at room temperature when subjected to a temperature of 585 c t4 lost its ability to be attracted by the magnetic field according to amini et al 24 temperatures above the curie point cause the electrons to disarrangement resulting in loss of conductive or dielectric capacity 3 2 7 2 chemical stability of magnetic graphene oxide in relation to ph the ph influence regarding the integrity and maintenance of the magnetic characteristics of the synthesized material was also investigated considering the possibility of future applications it is very important to know about the tolerance of the material in different acid basic conditions the ph measurements were performed using a potentiometer digimed in a ph range 10 for 14 adjusted with a 6 0 mol l 1 sodium hydroxide vetec solution in this condition was the maintaining of the magnetization of the nanomaterial to adjust the acidic ph hydrochloric acid synth and sulfuric acid synth both 0 1 mol l 1 were used when diluted in water go fe3o4 maintained its magnetic characteristics until ph 0 83 only losing its magnetic behavior when the nanomaterial was submitted to concentrated acids similar results are reported by sarkar et al 25 when evaluating the chemical stability of a magnetic nanocomposite containing graphene oxide according to the study the nanomaterial proved to be stable over a wide ph range thus allowing its application as a nanoadsorbent also in physiological conditions for drug carriers to the instance 3 2 8 vibrating sample magnetization vsm the hysteresis loop of the obtained nanomaterials was measured in magnetic fields from 60 ko at 300 k are shown in fig s5 see in the supporting information the variation of the magnetic property after the formation of the nanocomposite is also characterized and their hysteresis loops the influence of the proportion from incorporated magnetite was observed on the coercivity hc the saturated magnetization intensifies as the amount of iron incorporated into the go structure increases demonstrating a linear magnetic behavior the magnetic nanocomposite go fe3o4 showed results in the order of 75 47 and 26 emu g 1 for go fe3o4 1 10 go fe3o4 1 5 and go fe3o4 1 1 respectively these data are in agreement with the work by albert et al 17 who found magnetization values for magnetic graphene oxides with 40 7 46 3 and 50 emu g 1 3 2 9 thermogravimetric analysis tga and differential scanning calorimetry dsc for go fe3o4 1 1 fig 4a it is possible to observe three signals present two endotherms and one exotherm in the regions of 171 49 c endo 428 c endo and 759 65 c endo the first endothermic peak is accompanied by a loss of mass 4 8 in the region between 122 and 205 c related to the evaporation of residual water in the go the exothermic peak is very intense and presents a loss of mass 42 7 in the region 205 572 c thus indicating the decomposition of go nanosheets and functional groups cooh oh and coo present in the nanostructure 17 the second endothermic peak showed a mass loss of 5 85 in the region of 575 861 c most probably related to the burning of the residual carbonaceous structures of the system the go fe3o4 1 1 sample showed a total loss of weight from 52 72 when the temperature reaches 800 c no longer loss of mass therefore the remaining mass represents the amount of fe3o4 in the system 26 by this proceeding it was estimated that the amount of fe3o4 in the compound was about 47 58 in weight the go fe3o4 1 10 sample fig 4b shows an endothermic signal 149 c and three exothermic peaks 200 398 and 512 c the four thermal events are observed in the ranges of 140 153 c 170 252 c 328 420 c and 430 570 c each of these events is followed by a 2 25 weight loss 2 97 13 7 and 7 9 respectively comprehending a total weight loss of 26 82 for these samples two new exothermic peaks are observed the first peak referring to the thermal decomposition of functional groups containing oxygen such as carboxyls and hydroxyls the second peak 512 c occurs due to the strong presence of structural defects in the analyzed go 27 finally just as for go fe3o4 1 10 when the temperature reaches 750 c there is almost no loss of mass therefore the amount of fe3o4 in this sample was estimated to be about 73 18 in weight it suggests that the increase of iron ions in the synthesis directly influences the material behavior regarding the structural defects as mentioned in the raman analysis 3 2 9 1 determination of point zero charge phpzc the phpzc of magnetic graphene oxide in this study showed values close to 5 0 see fig s6 in the supporting information corroborating with the previously reported 15 when the ph of the solution is lower than the phpzc of the material the surface of the adsorbent will be positively charged whereas if the ph value of the solution is higher than the phpzc the surface of the material will be negatively charged this parameter is important to determine the surface load of the adsorbent as a function of ph and thus to establish the best experimental condition allowing the adsorption process to occur efficiently 3 3 hydrochlorothiazide adsorption 3 3 1 adsorption capacity and removal percentage table 4 shows the hctz removal rates as a function of the adsorbent used and the working ph as observed the variation of the ph and the adsorbent employed slightly altered the adsorption capacity and percentage of hydrochlorothiazide removed establishing ph 7 0 range the most favorable to the adsorption process by studying the ph variation the best condition for removing hctz was using neutral ph fig 5 where the equilibrium adsorption capacity varied between 45 21 and 49 55 mg g 1 52 94 67 86 this is because the ph of the solution is higher than the phpzc thus the adsorbent acquires an anionic character being able to easily interact with hctz through electrostatic interactions the adsorption of the hctz onto pristine fe3o4 also was carried out to comparative study with the nanocomposite synthesized as can be observed in fig 5 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of fe3o4 was significantly lower when compared to other nanoadsorbents 28 49 mg g 1 indicating a synergic effect between nanoparticles go fe3o4 higher adsorptive capacity the results found in this study are congruent with those reported by rai et al 6 by using pristine multi walled nanotubes mwcnts to remove hctz even it is possible to verify that the adsorption quickly reached equilibrium which can be explained by the specific area of the go fe3o4 available for adsorption in ph 4 0 the values of the equilibrium adsorption capacity see fig s7 in the supporting information varied between 45 21 and 49 55 mg g 1 44 72 48 65 being the highest values referring to go with the highest proportion of fe3o4 these results are expected since in acid ph occurs competition of h ions for adsorption sites 14 28 on the other hand at ph 10 0 it was observed that the removal rate and the adsorption capacity see fig s8 in the supporting information decreased significantly because the hydrochlorothiazide is unstable in alkaline solutions 29 3 3 2 effect of amount of the fe3o4 incorporates on the surface area of the go and adsorption capacity of the hctz materials in nanoscale present distinct behavior when compared to the micrometric scale the relationship between volume surface area increases with the particle size reduction thus nanoparticles have new properties such as a high surface area adsorption capacity reactivity and furnish excellent nanoadsorbents fig s9 see in the supporting information demonstrates the correlation of the surface area values obtained for the sbet of the graphene oxides with adsorption capacity as can be observed in fig s9 the surface area of the go increases initially with the amount of the fe3o4 incorporated the graphene oxide sample had a surface area of 5 559 m2 g while the go fe3o4 1 1 has a value of 69 271 m2 g indicating that mnps contribute to the increase in the specific area 8 however the gradual increase of the magnetite incorporated on the nanomaterial surface resulted in a decrease of the surface area go fe3o4 1 5 and 1 10 showed sbet of the 55 276 m2 g and 42 62 m2 g respectively for these nanocomposites it is possible to observe a considerable reduction in the value of their surface energies the influence of forces such as van der waals is predominant in the interactions between the surfaces of particles at the nanoscale therefore with an increase in fe3o4 nanoparticles on the surface of gos the nanoparticles tend to agglomerate easily reducing the surface area of the composites 30 according to the results the adsorption capacity does not correlate with the specific surface area of nanoadsorbents only is influenced by the amount of magnetite incorporated on the surface of the graphene oxide 31 for example go fe3o4 1 1 showed a surface area of 69 271 m2 g and maximum adsorption capacity qmax of 15 26 mg g 1 while the pristine graphene oxide go fe3o4 1 5 and go fe3o4 1 10 present adsorption capacities of 20 87 mg g 1 19 87 mg g 1 and 39 80 mg g 1 respectively 3 4 effect of adsorbent dosage another parameter that influences on adsorption phenomenon is the adsorbent dosage the results of the study of the ideal amount of go fe3o4 1 10 is shown in fig 6 the dosage of adsorbent is a parameter important for evaluating the effectiveness of the material in the adsorption process to investigate the ideal concentration of nanoadsorbent different amounts of go fe3o4 1 10 were employed maintaining constant the other experimental conditions the removal percentage increased from 26 82 39 19 67 87 using 12 5 mg 25 mg 50 mg of adsorbent respectively according to the results it is possible to verify which the increase in the adsorbent dosage the number of adsorption sites increases significantly however increasing the dosage of go 1 10 from 50 mg to 75 and 100 mg decreased the removal percentage to 48 73 and 47 12 respectively in this circumstance as the adsorbent dosage increases a decrease in rate removal can be observed this may occur due to the high interaction between the go fe3o4 molecules less available adsorbate or the tendency of the particles adsorbent agglomerate 32 3 5 effect of solution ph and ionic strength on the adsorption of the hctz solution ph is an experimental parameter with relation to the degree speciation of the chemical compounds and surface properties of adsorbent furthermore ph influences the adsorption capacity and removal percentage due to the competition of ions with adsorbate for adsorption sites 14 according to the data presented in fig 7 it is possible to verify that the adsorption behavior varies with the change of the ph solution initially an increase in the removal rate is observed between the range of 2 7 e g the rate removal of the hctz at ph 2 0 from ph 7 0 increased from 38 71 to 67 87 however the increase in ph suppresses the competition of h ions for binding sites where the maximum removal percentage was achieved at neutral ph 28 nevertheless under alkaline conditions the percentage removal decreased significantly i e diminishing from 42 19 at ph 10 0 the reduction occurs probably due to the repulsive forces between the adsorbent and the adsorbate molecules which difficult to transfer mass from the liquid phase hctz to the solid phase go fe3o4 1 10 the presence of a variety of salts in wastewater treatment plants is recurrent and can affect the removal efficiency of several pollutants 33 in order to investigate the influence of ionic strength on hctz adsorption different concentrations of sodium chloride 0 05 5 mol l 1 were used the adsorption capacity of hctz as a function of ionic strength is shown in fig 8 increasing nacl concentration negatively affects the adsorption capacity of hctz without the addition of nacl the qmax was 39 81 mg g 1 while for the highest nacl concentration 5 mol l 1 the qmax was 1 91 mg g 1 the effect of decreasing the adsorption capacity can be related to the weak electrostatic interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent na ions competition for adsorption sites or aggregation of adsorbent molecules for the high concentration of the available 34 3 6 hypotheses of the hydrochlorothiazide adsorption mechanism different adsorption mechanisms have been reported in the literature such as hydrogen bonds and stacking π π bonds between adsorbent adsorbate 35 as well as lewis acid base interaction at the oxygenated functional groups and go layers presented in the adsorbent 33 however some studies have shown that adsorption using magnetic adsorbents can occur through cation π interaction cation π interactions are characterized by the non covalent bond between a monopole cation and a quadrupole electron rich system π 35 although lewis acid base hydrogen interactions and π π bonds between go and hctz may occur the increase in the adsorption rate as the iron increases on the go surface suggests the existence of π cation bonds 36 fig 9 shows the hypotheses of the hydrochlorothiazide adsorption mechanisms using nanoadsorbents after determining the best adsorbent a study was developed to evaluate the influence of the initial concentration of hctz and temperature variation in the adsorption process these results are shown in table s3 see in the supporting information it is possible to observe that the hctz removal rate decreased from 71 51 to 10 04 when the initial concentration increased from 25 to 1000 mg l 1 at 293 15 k best experimental condition however as the concentration of adsorbate increased the adsorption capacity becomes higher furthermore a large amount of fe3o4 could favor the formation of coordination compounds nevertheless when the temperature was increased the adsorption process was disadvantaged see figs s10 to s14 in the supporting information considering the general adsorption theory which establishes that the adsorption is inversely proportional to the temperature 3 7 adsorption kinetics and isotherms 3 7 1 adsorption isotherms the hydrochlorothiazide adsorption isotherms of different adsorbents at ph 7 0 were described by langmuir and freundlich models and were illustrated in figs 10 and 11 the parameters for adjusting the experimental data in phs 4 0 7 0 and 10 0 are shown in table 5 tables s4 and s5 in the supporting information the adsorption using go 1 10 at different temperatures is expressed in tables s6 to s8 see in the supporting information according to the results the freundlich model demonstrated the best adjustment of the experimental data presenting a higher correlation coefficient thus admitting an adsorption heterogeneous and energetically non uniform surfaces 6 the empirical parameter 1 n indicates the adsorbate adsorption intensity hctz in the adsorbent or the surface heterogeneity according to the values obtained it is possible to determine whether adsorption is favorable unfavorable or irreversible 12 through the results it was found that the adsorption of hctz 50 mg l 1 using different adsorbents go go fe3o4 1 1 go fe3o4 1 5 and go fe3o4 1 10 in different ranges of ph demonstrating a favorable adsorption process as they presented a value of 1 n between 0 and 1 0 12 3 7 2 adsorption kinetics from the kinetic models it was possible to achieve the best adjustment for the experimental data the kinetic parameters of pseudo first order and pseudo second order are shown in tables s9 to s11 see in the supporting information the pseudo second order model represents the best adjustment for the experimental data in different working phs once higher values for the correlation coefficient were presented based on this it is possible to conclude that as long as go and go 1 1 are characterized by accurate adsorption kinetics higher k2 values go fe3o4 1 5 and 1 10 samples resulted in slower kinetics however as the amount of magnetite incorporated into the go increased linear growth in the adsorption capacity could be observed in addition using the pseudo second order model it was possible to assume that the hctz adsorption process occurs by predominantly chemical mechanisms 6 13 the kinetic profiles of pseudo first and pseudo second order for the tests performed at different phs are showed fig 12 a b see figs s15 to s18 in the supporting information in fig 12 it is possible to observe that adsorption capacity increases linearly with the amount of magnetite incorporated into the graphene oxide surface moreover it was found that the ph variation directly influenced the drug removal since this parameter is associated with the adsorbent adsorbate electrostatic interactions 35 regarding the adsorption over time it was evidenced a higher velocity in the initial stages of the process followed by a speed reduction closed to the equilibrium considering the number of available sites being filled along the time 14 28 adjust parameters of the kinetic models to the experimental data of hydrochlorothiazide adsorption onto go fe3o4 1 10 to 293 15 303 15 and 333 15 k are shown in tables s12 to s14 see in the supporting information as shown table s9 support information the pseudo second order model also resulted in a better adjustment of the experimental data suggesting a chemosorption process based on the values of k2 the temperature directly influenced the reaction speed however the adsorption capacity increased rapidly at the beginning of the process and tended to balance along the adsorption time 37 kinetic profiles are present by fig 13 a b see figs s19 s22 in the supporting information adsorption capacity increases proportionally with temperature and adsorbate concentration in the meantime the efficiency from de removal decreases inversely with the concentration and temperature i e undermining the van der waals forces 6 3 8 thermodynamic study table s15 see in the supporting information shows the thermodynamic coefficients related to the hctz adsorption process in go 1 10 to obtain the values of δh and δs the van t hoff s equation s6 was used where δh and δs can be obtained by tilting and intercepting the curve of ln kc versus 1 t k 1 see figs s23 to s27 in the supporting information according to table s15 g values for the three temperatures assays showed negative values suggesting that the adsorption process is spontaneous notwithstanding increasing the values of g along the temperature indicates a tendency to reduce the viability of the adsorptive process 37 while the negative h values demonstrated that the adsorption was exothermic the positive s values indicate that the solid solution interface increased randomly during the adsorption of hctz applying go 1 10 38 3 9 desorption and regeneration of go 1 10 adsorption and regeneration cycles of magnetic adsorbents are essential steps to evaluate adsorbent performance the viability of the adsorption process and in this work the maintenance of magnetic properties after establishing the ideal experimental condition five cycles of the adsorption desorption were repeated to study the regenerate capacity and efficiency of the adsorbent using naoh or hcl solution the best desorption condition of the hctz is shown in fig 14 due to ionization forms of the hctz in alkaline media these results can be explained by the fact that freely solubility of the drug in naoh solutions and binding with the ions na formation of hctz salt which facilitates the desorption process 39 40 even after several adsorption desorption cycles the adsorbent go fe3o4 1 10 maintained efficiency in the first cycle the adsorption capacity was 39 81 mg g 1 which corresponds to 67 86 of the removed hydrochlorothiazide between the second and the fifth cycle the removal rates remained relatively stable with percentages around 60 50 the decrease of the percentage removal of the hctz can be associate with incomplete desorption which results in the occupation of adsorption sites with lower energy justifying the reduction of the rate removal moreover after consecutive cycles of the adsorption regeneration minor operational losses of the adsorbent mass may occur and consequently sites available for adsorption contributing to a decrease in removal 15 4 conclusion the magnetic nanocomposite was synthesized employing fecl2 under low energy requirements and reduced process time with good yields the analysis demonstrates the control of the amount of incorporated iron nanoparticles into the surface of the go the sbet technique showed that the incorporation of fe3o4 increased the surface area of the nanocomposite but this property does not correlate with the maximum adsorption capacity of the nanoadsorbent the removal rate and adsorption capacity are dependent on the initial concentration of the hctz amount and type of the adsorbent temperature ionic strength and solution ph the freundlich and pso models represent the best adjustment of experimental data assuming a process in heterogeneous surfaces and chemical adsorption respectively the thermodynamic study demonstrates that the process was spontaneous exothermic and random at the solid solution interface during adsorption the nanocomposite go fe3o4 1 10 proved to be efficient after five adsorption desorption cycles finally it is possible to conclude that synergy between go and fe3o4 demonstrates efficient and easy operational eliminating centrifugation and filtration steps making it a potential

13375,in this work we report a straightforward synthesis of magnetic graphene oxide go fe3o4 in very mild conditions this methodology proved to be effective in obtain graphene oxide go decorated with different amounts of incorporated magnetite the characterizations reveal the presence of magnetic nanoparticles mnps in analyzed nanomaterial despite several methods shown in the literature this protocol enables the amount control of incorporated magnetite on the surface of go experimental data shows that go fe3o4 1 10 mass mass demonstrates the highest adsorption capacity on the hydrochlorothiazide with a 67 86 removal of the contaminant and ph 7 0 as the favorable condition the removal rate and adsorption capacity are dependent on the initial concentration of the hctz amount and type of the adsorbent temperature ionic strength and solution ph in the adsorption were also studied the pseudo second order and freundlich models showed better adjustment of the experiment thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption process is exothermic and occurred spontaneously magnetic nanoadsorbent proves to be an efficient alternative nanomaterial for removing hydrochlorothiazide from aqueous solutions avoiding filtration and centrifugation steps graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water recovery drug removal graphene oxide magnetic nanomaterials 1 introduction many of the daily ingested drugs are partially metabolized by the body and large fractions excreted in the active form most of these substances are not removed by conventional water treatment systems due to structural complexity solubility ph sensitivity among others nevertheless the inadequate disposal associated with methods that have low efficiency of decontamination in wastewater not only puts human health at risk as well as causing an imbalance of the ecological microbiota 1 among the emerging micropollutants hydrochlorothiazide hctz worldwide used for the hypertension treatment stands out for its high excretion rate around 72 of the ingested dose is eliminated through the kidneys in the unmetabolized form 2 studies have reported the presence of hctz in affluents effluents and coastal waters as well as in marine animals 3 a recent study developed evaluated the toxic effect of hctz degradation using chlorination and uv irradiation the results demonstrated that the by products significantly increased the toxicity of hctz as the processing time increased in addition to chlorination ozonation can also convert main compounds into potentially toxic secondary products thus requiring a series of studies to determine the impact of these substances 4 among the countless possibilities liquid phase adsorption has exceptional advantages such as high removal efficiency low energy requirement relatively low cost in addition to not generating by products however the effectiveness of the process depends on some factors among them the intrinsic characteristics of the adsorbent porosity and surface area 5 6 in particular the use of graphene oxide go has been widely investigating due to unique properties such as specific area hydrophilicity thermal and chemical stability as well as for presenting high affinity by organic pollutants although the efficiency of the nanoadsorbent is remarkable there are still limitations with the use of the conventional materials such as separation from aqueous medium and reuse 7 8 recently magnetic nanoparticles mnps have been studied in adsorption processes due to the simplicity of operation without the requirement for filtration centrifugation steps and the possibility of recycling the material 9 however due to the critical diameter and attractive forces dipole dipole magnetic nanoparticles are unstable and consequently shown a tendency to agglomerate 10 thus the synthesis of nanocomposites is an alternative for avoiding the chemical instability of mnps and reduced the limitations of conventional adsorbents moreover the development of materials composites can increase the relationship between area volume reactivity aqueous solubility and result in higher adsorptive capacity 11 therefore considering the excellent properties of nanomaterials and potential harms to the environment and human health studies aiming for hctz removal from aqueous media are essential 6 furthermore few methods reporting the removal degradation of this pollutant are available in this work we report a synthesis protocol of the magnetic graphene oxide go fe3o4 with control of the amount of incorporated magnetite and its influence on the specific area of the go the hctz adsorption in the magnetic nanocomposites was investigated using several experimental parameters initial adsorbate concentration adsorbent dosage solution ph ionic strength recycling and temperature furthermore mechanistic hypotheses of the adsorption also were studied as well as the influence of the type of the

spectrophotometer shimadzu at λ 323 nm prior to the analyses the nonmagnetic go was filtered from the solution with a membrane filter 0 22 μm millex gp and sequentially carried out to centrifugation for 10 min at 10000 rpm for the go samples containing fe3o4 no filtration was necessary just by applying a simple magnet at the flask surface the adsorbent adsorbate complex was removed from the solution the kinetics isotherms and adsorption capacity were evaluated using graphene oxide go and magnetic graphene oxide go fe3o4 with different proportions of incorporated magnetite under the

desorbing agent the mixture was stirred at 90 rpm for 60 min at 303 1 00 k consecutively solution was poured with the assistance of the magnetic field and the adsorbent was washed with acetone 3 results and discussion 3 1 straightforward synthesis of magnetic graphene oxide with different proportions of incorporated magnetite go fe3o4 in this work we applied a synthesis protocol without the use of hydrothermal techniques with the management of the amount of incorporated fe3o4 analyzes confirmed the control of the different amounts of incorporated magnetite with the maintenance of the magnetic activity of the material thus allowing the application in the removal of contaminants through adsorption assays the different reactions for the incorporation of magnetite on the go surface are shown in the table 1 the go reaction with fecl2 in a 1 1 ratio r1 152 mg of the magnetic material was obtained by using 1 5 go fecl2 ratio r2 303 mg of the magnetic compound were obtained revealing an increased amount of magnetite incorporated by r3 employing 1 g of fecl2 1 10 ratio the reaction furnished 509 mg of the magnetic material corresponding to 79 53 yield finally the adsorption applying nanocomposites with a higher go fecl2 ratio i e 1 20 r4 reveals only partial incorporation of the magnetite yielding 44 74 thus suggest a saturation of fe3o4 under the surface of graphene oxide it is possible to find in the literature diverse protocols to obtain magnetic graphene oxide they differ from each other essentially in the method for the precipitation of the fe2 fe3 salts most of them only applying a specific amount of the iron moiety for the desired nanocomposite table 2 table 2 illustrates different methods for the iron oxide nanoparticles incorporation on the surface of go comparing their experimental conditions and structural characteristics of the nanocomposites cheng et al 8 reported a study applying ammonia as a precipitating agent in the mixture of fe2 fe3 for the fe3o4 incorporation on the go surface under mild conditions they obtain a magnetic go with a lower id ig ratio i e preserving the integrity of the carbonaceous structure and the functional groups and showing magnetic behavior similarly for the arsenic removal of the aqueous solution sherlala et al 15 employs a co precipitation protocol for the synthesis of magnetic graphene oxide by using a fecl2 fecl3 ratio 2 45 1 at a temperature of 85 c and a large amount of iron moieties the nanocomposite showed high values of magnetization saturation similar to magnetite 69 9 emu g 1 applying a microwave assisted hydrothermal strategy lellala 16 prepared a magnetic nanocomposite from fecl3 with naoh as precipitating agent and autoclave at 150 c for 24 h the xrd analysis of the reaction reveals a partial reduction of the go and fe3o4 incorporation on the surface of the hybrid product the absence removal of the oxygenated functional groups decreases the structural integrity combining both co precipitation and emulsion protocols albert et al 17 synthesized magnetic graphene oxide applying nh4oh for precipitation of the iron salts and organic chloroform for the emulsification step although not simpler the two step fe2 fe3 reaction provided a nanocomposite with a low id ig ratio without mainly structural damage and maintaining the magnetic properties zeng et al 18 reported a hydrothermal preparation of mnps using urea as precipitating agent sodium citrate and polyacrylamide employing only fecl3 as an iron source microwave assisted autoclave and heating in the oven for 8 h at 180 c this protocol furnished the nanocomposite with uniformly morphological distribution and high magnetization values in this work applying co precipitation protocol using nh4oh mild conditions and using fecl2 as an iron source we were able to synthesize go fe3o4 with structural integrity maintenance magnetization saturation and control of magnetite incorporated on the surface of the graphene oxide 3 2 characterizations of nanoadsorbents 3 2 1 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir in fig 1 the ftir spectroscopic data spectro one perkin elmer kbr disc of graphene oxide and magnetic graphene oxides with different proportions of incorporated ferrite are presented fig 1 shows the ftirs of the graphene oxides synthesized in this work the go spectrums show an expressive band around 3480 cm 1 that refers to the axial deformation of the hydroxyl group showing the presence of oh groups on the surfaces of the nanomaterials the stretching frequency of the carbon oxygen double bond r2c o appears as a peak at 1617 cm 1 indicating the presence of carbonyl moieties the remaining bands appearing between 1497 and 1452 cm 1 are related to the stretching or axial deformation of the cc bonds 7 in addition to the constant peaks it can be observed the appearance of a previously non existent band around 615 cm 1 in the ftir of magnetic graphene oxides originated from the stretching vibrations of feo see fig s1 in the supporting information which indicates the presence of fe3o4 incorporated into the surface of the gos 9 19 it is also possible to observe a smooth intensification of the band 600 cm 1 range as the amount of fe3o4 incorporated into the gos increases 3 2 2 x ray diffraction xrd the x ray diffractogram of graphene oxides see fig s2 in the supporting information shows complete oxidation of graphite starting material due to the absence of the peak at 2θ 26 and by the appearance of the peak at 2θ 11 4 001 characteristic of go 7 8 for the nanocomposites it is possible to observe the presence of peaks at 2θ 30 2 35 3 43 5 57 01 and 63 3 corresponding to the indices 220 311 400 511 and 440 in the graphs the position and relative intensity of all peaks are compatible with magnetite jcpds card no 19 0629 see fig s1 in the supporting information the results of the xrd agree well with the sem and tem analyses a weaker characteristic peak similar to go can be observed in go fe3o4 1 1 considering the small amount of fe3o4 in nanomaterial surfaces meanwhile in go fe3o4 1 5 and go fe3o4 1 10 the peak of go disappears due to the large amount of fe3o4 indicating that the interlayer spacing of these materials decreases after the magnetic process which is due to the fe3o4 agglomerate 17 3 2 2 1 average crystallite size determination according to the average crystallite size determined by the scherrer equation see table s1 in the supporting information it can be inferred that the particle size of the go decreases with the addition of magnetic nanoparticles highly oxidizing media containing transition metals such as fe2 in the presence of a base increase the rate of hydrolysis of materials and consequently decrease the particle size 9 nevertheless the ultrasonic irradiation used in the magnetization process contributed to the decrease in particle size corroborating with the results obtained by le et al 20 3 2 3 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds fig s3a d supporting information shows data from the elemental analysis of graphene oxide and magnetic nanocomposites go containing different amounts of fe3o4 using the eds technique as shown in fig s3a it is possible to verify carbon atoms and heteroatoms o and s presence meantime in fig s3b d see in the supporting information can be seen observing the appearance of iron ions in samples of magnetic graphene oxides for instance the magnetic nanocomposite containing the same proportion of go fecl2 1 1 presents a lower rate of fe ions 2 33 meanwhile for go fe3o4 1 5 and go fe3o4 1 10 increased to 6 29 and 9 66 respectively see table s2 in the supporting information furthermore these results indicate the relationship between the amount of fecl2 employed with magnetite incorporated on the surface of go as previously shown in the ftir xrd and sem analyses 21 3 2 4 raman spectroscopy coprecipitation is the most common method for obtaining magnetic nanoparticles due to the mild conditions employed low temperature and without the use of organic solvents with a high boiling point for precipitation of iron salts however strong oxidizing substances and ultrasonic treatment usually used in the synthesis of go nanocomposites possibly affect the structure of go and removes functional groups fig s4a c supporting information shows the raman spectra of magnetic graphene oxides synthesized in this study all samples showed the characteristic d and g bands of go at 1353 cm 1 and 1593 cm 1 respectively 8 the difference in intensity between the d and g bands allows measuring the quality of the go produced by calculating the id ig ratio interestingly in this study with the increase of doped iron ions in go there is a proportional increase in the value of the id ig ratio however the low values of the calculated id ig ratio indicated that the structure and oxygenated groups of go were not significantly affected by the experimental conditions for example the value id ig of the go changed from 0 910 to 1 105 for go fe3o4 1 1 and only changed by 0 255 between magnetic nanocomposites go fe3o4 1 1 to go fe3o4 1 10 the high presence of metal ions on the gos surface generates a greater interaction between carbon and iron atoms result in a greater number of defects the presence of doped iron ions in the go can be seen in fig s4c see supporting information where it is possible to observe the characteristic peak a1g 615 710 cm 1 of magnetite in the samples go fe3o4 1 5 and go fe3o4 1 10 22 in the case of go fe3o4 1 1 sample it was not possible to observe peaks referring to iron oxides because the sample does not have a considerable amount of iron ions in its composition in the context of go quality two 2d bands d g that appear in 2700 and 2900 cm 1 can help in this analysis as the 2d is known as the band that indicates the number of graphene layers for go this band indicates the number of layers and defects present in the nanomaterial 8 the greater the intensity of the 2d band in relation to g the higher is the number of defects present in the go the other band at d g indicates the number of oxygen present on the gos surface the difference between d g and 2d intensity is proportional to the defects present i e the lower the intensity of the d g band about 2d the smaller is the number of defects in the structures of the gos this analysis indicates that the go produced in this study has a reduced number of defects thus reinforcing the high quality go and go nanocomposite synthesized in this work 3 2 5 scanning electron microscopy sem the surface morphology of go a and the magnetic graphene oxides produced with different proportions 1 1 go fecl2 b 1 5 go fecl2 c 1 10 go fecl2 d were characterized by scanning electron microscopy zeeis sigma 300 vp shown in fig 2 fig 2a shows the sem image of the isolated go it is possible to observe the smooth surface of the nanomaterial and overlapped layers in fig 2b lowest proportion of fe3o4 incorporated even with the nanoparticles nps deposited at the surface it is still possible to observe the characteristic morphology of the go however as the proportion of the ion precursor increases more fe3o4 nps are anchored to the go surface and the particle size increases respectively go 1 5 c and go 1 10 d the increase in density and particle size indicates that the higher fecl2 dosage on the magnetization reactions can directly influence the grown in the size of the magnetic nps 16 3 2 6 transmission electron microscopy tem the size and morphology of the nanocomposite go fe3o4 were investigated by transmission electron microscopy tem fig 3 a b shows the tem images from go fe3o4 1 1 and go fe3o4 1 10 was synthesized in this work according to the images it is possible to verify that graphene oxide has a wrinkled surface which is characteristic of few layer go nanosheets it can also be observed that the fe3o4 nanoparticles have a particle diameter of 10 nm corroborating with the results reported by rofouei et al 23 moreover were well distributed on the surface of graphene oxide however in fig 3 it is observed that some particles formed aggregates on the surface of the graphene oxide due mainly to the close degree of saturation 3 2 7 thermal and chemical stability of magnetic graphene oxide considering its application in different areas processes and environments different chemical and physical stability tests of magnetic graphene oxide were carried out varying the ph and temperature 3 2 7 1 thermal stability of magnetic graphene oxide table 3 shows the temperature resistance of the synthesized graphene oxide nanocomposites in t1 and t2 the material maintains the magnetic behavior at high temperatures up to 400 c considering your application in the synthesis of organic derivatives and a possible application in materials in the t3 test curiously the sample was not magnetic while still heated and recovers its magnetic characteristics at room temperature when subjected to a temperature of 585 c t4 lost its ability to be attracted by the magnetic field according to amini et al 24 temperatures above the curie point cause the electrons to disarrangement resulting in loss of conductive or dielectric capacity 3 2 7 2 chemical stability of magnetic graphene oxide in relation to ph the ph influence regarding the integrity and maintenance of the magnetic characteristics of the synthesized material was also investigated considering the possibility of future applications it is very important to know about the tolerance of the material in different acid basic conditions the ph measurements were performed using a potentiometer digimed in a ph range 10 for 14 adjusted with a 6 0 mol l 1 sodium hydroxide vetec solution in this condition was the maintaining of the magnetization of the nanomaterial to adjust the acidic ph hydrochloric acid synth and sulfuric acid synth both 0 1 mol l 1 were used when diluted in water go fe3o4 maintained its magnetic characteristics until ph 0 83 only losing its magnetic behavior when the nanomaterial was submitted to concentrated acids similar results are reported by sarkar et al 25 when evaluating the chemical stability of a magnetic nanocomposite containing graphene oxide according to the study the nanomaterial proved to be stable over a wide ph range thus allowing its application as a nanoadsorbent also in physiological conditions for drug carriers to the instance 3 2 8 vibrating sample magnetization vsm the hysteresis loop of the obtained nanomaterials was measured in magnetic fields from 60 ko at 300 k are shown in fig s5 see in the supporting information the variation of the magnetic property after the formation of the nanocomposite is also characterized and their hysteresis loops the influence of the proportion from incorporated magnetite was observed on the coercivity hc the saturated magnetization intensifies as the amount of iron incorporated into the go structure increases demonstrating a linear magnetic behavior the magnetic nanocomposite go fe3o4 showed results in the order of 75 47 and 26 emu g 1 for go fe3o4 1 10 go fe3o4 1 5 and go fe3o4 1 1 respectively these data are in agreement with the work by albert et al 17 who found magnetization values for magnetic graphene oxides with 40 7 46 3 and 50 emu g 1 3 2 9 thermogravimetric analysis tga and differential scanning calorimetry dsc for go fe3o4 1 1 fig 4a it is possible to observe three signals present two endotherms and one exotherm in the regions of 171 49 c endo 428 c endo and 759 65 c endo the first endothermic peak is accompanied by a loss of mass 4 8 in the region between 122 and 205 c related to the evaporation of residual water in the go the exothermic peak is very intense and presents a loss of mass 42 7 in the region 205 572 c thus indicating the decomposition of go nanosheets and functional groups cooh oh and coo present in the nanostructure 17 the second endothermic peak showed a mass loss of 5 85 in the region of 575 861 c most probably related to the burning of the residual carbonaceous structures of the system the go fe3o4 1 1 sample showed a total loss of weight from 52 72 when the temperature reaches 800 c no longer loss of mass therefore the remaining mass represents the amount of fe3o4 in the system 26 by this proceeding it was estimated that the amount of fe3o4 in the compound was about 47 58 in weight the go fe3o4 1 10 sample fig 4b shows an endothermic signal 149 c and three exothermic peaks 200 398 and 512 c the four thermal events are observed in the ranges of 140 153 c 170 252 c 328 420 c and 430 570 c each of these events is followed by a 2 25 weight loss 2 97 13 7 and 7 9 respectively comprehending a total weight loss of 26 82 for these samples two new exothermic peaks are observed the first peak referring to the thermal decomposition of functional groups containing oxygen such as carboxyls and hydroxyls the second peak 512 c occurs due to the strong presence of structural defects in the analyzed go 27 finally just as for go fe3o4 1 10 when the temperature reaches 750 c there is almost no loss of mass therefore the amount of fe3o4 in this sample was estimated to be about 73 18 in weight it suggests that the increase of iron ions in the synthesis directly influences the material behavior regarding the structural defects as mentioned in the raman analysis 3 2 9 1 determination of point zero charge phpzc the phpzc of magnetic graphene oxide in this study showed values close to 5 0 see fig s6 in the supporting information corroborating with the previously reported 15 when the ph of the solution is lower than the phpzc of the material the surface of the adsorbent will be positively charged whereas if the ph value of the solution is higher than the phpzc the surface of the material will be negatively charged this parameter is important to determine the surface load of the adsorbent as a function of ph and thus to establish the best experimental condition allowing the adsorption process to occur efficiently 3 3 hydrochlorothiazide adsorption 3 3 1 adsorption capacity and removal percentage table 4 shows the hctz removal rates as a function of the adsorbent used and the working ph as observed the variation of the ph and the adsorbent employed slightly altered the adsorption capacity and percentage of hydrochlorothiazide removed establishing ph 7 0 range the most favorable to the adsorption process by studying the ph variation the best condition for removing hctz was using neutral ph fig 5 where the equilibrium adsorption capacity varied between 45 21 and 49 55 mg g 1 52 94 67 86 this is because the ph of the solution is higher than the phpzc thus the adsorbent acquires an anionic character being able to easily interact with hctz through electrostatic interactions the adsorption of the hctz onto pristine fe3o4 also was carried out to comparative study with the nanocomposite synthesized as can be observed in fig 5 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of fe3o4 was significantly lower when compared to other nanoadsorbents 28 49 mg g 1 indicating a synergic effect between nanoparticles go fe3o4 higher adsorptive capacity the results found in this study are congruent with those reported by rai et al 6 by using pristine multi walled nanotubes mwcnts to remove hctz even it is possible to verify that the adsorption quickly reached equilibrium which can be explained by the specific area of the go fe3o4 available for adsorption in ph 4 0 the values of the equilibrium adsorption capacity see fig s7 in the supporting information varied between 45 21 and 49 55 mg g 1 44 72 48 65 being the highest values referring to go with the highest proportion of fe3o4 these results are expected since in acid ph occurs competition of h ions for adsorption sites 14 28 on the other hand at ph 10 0 it was observed that the removal rate and the adsorption capacity see fig s8 in the supporting information decreased significantly because the hydrochlorothiazide is unstable in alkaline solutions 29 3 3 2 effect of amount of the fe3o4 incorporates on the surface area of the go and adsorption capacity of the hctz materials in nanoscale present distinct behavior when compared to the micrometric scale the relationship between volume surface area increases with the particle size reduction thus nanoparticles have new properties such as a high surface area adsorption capacity reactivity and furnish excellent nanoadsorbents fig s9 see in the supporting information demonstrates the correlation of the surface area values obtained for the sbet of the graphene oxides with adsorption capacity as can be observed in fig s9 the surface area of the go increases initially with the amount of the fe3o4 incorporated the graphene oxide sample had a surface area of 5 559 m2 g while the go fe3o4 1 1 has a value of 69 271 m2 g indicating that mnps contribute to the increase in the specific area 8 however the gradual increase of the magnetite incorporated on the nanomaterial surface resulted in a decrease of the surface area go fe3o4 1 5 and 1 10 showed sbet of the 55 276 m2 g and 42 62 m2 g respectively for these nanocomposites it is possible to observe a considerable reduction in the value of their surface energies the influence of forces such as van der waals is predominant in the interactions between the surfaces of particles at the nanoscale therefore with an increase in fe3o4 nanoparticles on the surface of gos the nanoparticles tend to agglomerate easily reducing the surface area of the composites 30 according to the results the adsorption capacity does not correlate with the specific surface area of nanoadsorbents only is influenced by the amount of magnetite incorporated on the surface of the graphene oxide 31 for example go fe3o4 1 1 showed a surface area of 69 271 m2 g and maximum adsorption capacity qmax of 15 26 mg g 1 while the pristine graphene oxide go fe3o4 1 5 and go fe3o4 1 10 present adsorption capacities of 20 87 mg g 1 19 87 mg g 1 and 39 80 mg g 1 respectively 3 4 effect of adsorbent dosage another parameter that influences on adsorption phenomenon is the adsorbent dosage the results of the study of the ideal amount of go fe3o4 1 10 is shown in fig 6 the dosage of adsorbent is a parameter important for evaluating the effectiveness of the material in the adsorption process to investigate the ideal concentration of nanoadsorbent different amounts of go fe3o4 1 10 were employed maintaining constant the other experimental conditions the removal percentage increased from 26 82 39 19 67 87 using 12 5 mg 25 mg 50 mg of adsorbent respectively according to the results it is possible to verify which the increase in the adsorbent dosage the number of adsorption sites increases significantly however increasing the dosage of go 1 10 from 50 mg to 75 and 100 mg decreased the removal percentage to 48 73 and 47 12 respectively in this circumstance as the adsorbent dosage increases a decrease in rate removal can be observed this may occur due to the high interaction between the go fe3o4 molecules less available adsorbate or the tendency of the particles adsorbent agglomerate 32 3 5 effect of solution ph and ionic strength on the adsorption of the hctz solution ph is an experimental parameter with relation to the degree speciation of the chemical compounds and surface properties of adsorbent furthermore ph influences the adsorption capacity and removal percentage due to the competition of ions with adsorbate for adsorption sites 14 according to the data presented in fig 7 it is possible to verify that the adsorption behavior varies with the change of the ph solution initially an increase in the removal rate is observed between the range of 2 7 e g the rate removal of the hctz at ph 2 0 from ph 7 0 increased from 38 71 to 67 87 however the increase in ph suppresses the competition of h ions for binding sites where the maximum removal percentage was achieved at neutral ph 28 nevertheless under alkaline conditions the percentage removal decreased significantly i e diminishing from 42 19 at ph 10 0 the reduction occurs probably due to the repulsive forces between the adsorbent and the adsorbate molecules which difficult to transfer mass from the liquid phase hctz to the solid phase go fe3o4 1 10 the presence of a variety of salts in wastewater treatment plants is recurrent and can affect the removal efficiency of several pollutants 33 in order to investigate the influence of ionic strength on hctz adsorption different concentrations of sodium chloride 0 05 5 mol l 1 were used the adsorption capacity of hctz as a function of ionic strength is shown in fig 8 increasing nacl concentration negatively affects the adsorption capacity of hctz without the addition of nacl the qmax was 39 81 mg g 1 while for the highest nacl concentration 5 mol l 1 the qmax was 1 91 mg g 1 the effect of decreasing the adsorption capacity can be related to the weak electrostatic interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent na ions competition for adsorption sites or aggregation of adsorbent molecules for the high concentration of the available 34 3 6 hypotheses of the hydrochlorothiazide adsorption mechanism different adsorption mechanisms have been reported in the literature such as hydrogen bonds and stacking π π bonds between adsorbent adsorbate 35 as well as lewis acid base interaction at the oxygenated functional groups and go layers presented in the adsorbent 33 however some studies have shown that adsorption using magnetic adsorbents can occur through cation π interaction cation π interactions are characterized by the non covalent bond between a monopole cation and a quadrupole electron rich system π 35 although lewis acid base hydrogen interactions and π π bonds between go and hctz may occur the increase in the adsorption rate as the iron increases on the go surface suggests the existence of π cation bonds 36 fig 9 shows the hypotheses of the hydrochlorothiazide adsorption mechanisms using nanoadsorbents after determining the best adsorbent a study was developed to evaluate the influence of the initial concentration of hctz and temperature variation in the adsorption process these results are shown in table s3 see in the supporting information it is possible to observe that the hctz removal rate decreased from 71 51 to 10 04 when the initial concentration increased from 25 to 1000 mg l 1 at 293 15 k best experimental condition however as the concentration of adsorbate increased the adsorption capacity becomes higher furthermore a large amount of fe3o4 could favor the formation of coordination compounds nevertheless when the temperature was increased the adsorption process was disadvantaged see figs s10 to s14 in the supporting information considering the general adsorption theory which establishes that the adsorption is inversely proportional to the temperature 3 7 adsorption kinetics and isotherms 3 7 1 adsorption isotherms the hydrochlorothiazide adsorption isotherms of different adsorbents at ph 7 0 were described by langmuir and freundlich models and were illustrated in figs 10 and 11 the parameters for adjusting the experimental data in phs 4 0 7 0 and 10 0 are shown in table 5 tables s4 and s5 in the supporting information the adsorption using go 1 10 at different temperatures is expressed in tables s6 to s8 see in the supporting information according to the results the freundlich model demonstrated the best adjustment of the experimental data presenting a higher correlation coefficient thus admitting an adsorption heterogeneous and energetically non uniform surfaces 6 the empirical parameter 1 n indicates the adsorbate adsorption intensity hctz in the adsorbent or the surface heterogeneity according to the values obtained it is possible to determine whether adsorption is favorable unfavorable or irreversible 12 through the results it was found that the adsorption of hctz 50 mg l 1 using different adsorbents go go fe3o4 1 1 go fe3o4 1 5 and go fe3o4 1 10 in different ranges of ph demonstrating a favorable adsorption process as they presented a value of 1 n between 0 and 1 0 12 3 7 2 adsorption kinetics from the kinetic models it was possible to achieve the best adjustment for the experimental data the kinetic parameters of pseudo first order and pseudo second order are shown in tables s9 to s11 see in the supporting information the pseudo second order model represents the best adjustment for the experimental data in different working phs once higher values for the correlation coefficient were presented based on this it is possible to conclude that as long as go and go 1 1 are characterized by accurate adsorption kinetics higher k2 values go fe3o4 1 5 and 1 10 samples resulted in slower kinetics however as the amount of magnetite incorporated into the go increased linear growth in the adsorption capacity could be observed in addition using the pseudo second order model it was possible to assume that the hctz adsorption process occurs by predominantly chemical mechanisms 6 13 the kinetic profiles of pseudo first and pseudo second order for the tests performed at different phs are showed fig 12 a b see figs s15 to s18 in the supporting information in fig 12 it is possible to observe that adsorption capacity increases linearly with the amount of magnetite incorporated into the graphene oxide surface moreover it was found that the ph variation directly influenced the drug removal since this parameter is associated with the adsorbent adsorbate electrostatic interactions 35 regarding the adsorption over time it was evidenced a higher velocity in the initial stages of the process followed by a speed reduction closed to the equilibrium considering the number of available sites being filled along the time 14 28 adjust parameters of the kinetic models to the experimental data of hydrochlorothiazide adsorption onto go fe3o4 1 10 to 293 15 303 15 and 333 15 k are shown in tables s12 to s14 see in the supporting information as shown table s9 support information the pseudo second order model also resulted in a better adjustment of the experimental data suggesting a chemosorption process based on the values of k2 the temperature directly influenced the reaction speed however the adsorption capacity increased rapidly at the beginning of the process and tended to balance along the adsorption time 37 kinetic profiles are present by fig 13 a b see figs s19 s22 in the supporting information adsorption capacity increases proportionally with temperature and adsorbate concentration in the meantime the efficiency from de removal decreases inversely with the concentration and temperature i e undermining the van der waals forces 6 3 8 thermodynamic study table s15 see in the supporting information shows the thermodynamic coefficients related to the hctz adsorption process in go 1 10 to obtain the values of δh and δs the van t hoff s equation s6 was used where δh and δs can be obtained by tilting and intercepting the curve of ln kc versus 1 t k 1 see figs s23 to s27 in the supporting information according to table s15 g values for the three temperatures assays showed negative values suggesting that the adsorption process is spontaneous notwithstanding increasing the values of g along the temperature indicates a tendency to reduce the viability of the adsorptive process 37 while the negative h values demonstrated that the adsorption was exothermic the positive s values indicate that the solid solution interface increased randomly during the adsorption of hctz applying go 1 10 38 3 9 desorption and regeneration of go 1 10 adsorption and regeneration cycles of magnetic adsorbents are essential steps to evaluate adsorbent performance the viability of the adsorption process and in this work the maintenance of magnetic properties after establishing the ideal experimental condition five cycles of the adsorption desorption were repeated to study the regenerate capacity and efficiency of the adsorbent using naoh or hcl solution the best desorption condition of the hctz is shown in fig 14 due to ionization forms of the hctz in alkaline media these results can be explained by the fact that freely solubility of the drug in naoh solutions and binding with the ions na formation of hctz salt which facilitates the desorption process 39 40 even after several adsorption desorption cycles the adsorbent go fe3o4 1 10 maintained efficiency in the first cycle the adsorption capacity was 39 81 mg g 1 which corresponds to 67 86 of the removed hydrochlorothiazide between the second and the fifth cycle the removal rates remained relatively stable with percentages around 60 50 the decrease of the percentage removal of the hctz can be associate with incomplete desorption which results in the occupation of adsorption sites with lower energy justifying the reduction of the rate removal moreover after consecutive cycles of the adsorption regeneration minor operational losses of the adsorbent mass may occur and consequently sites available for adsorption contributing to a decrease in removal 15 4 conclusion the magnetic nanocomposite was synthesized employing fecl2 under low energy requirements and reduced process time with good yields the analysis demonstrates the control of the amount of incorporated iron nanoparticles into the surface of the go the sbet technique showed that the incorporation of fe3o4 increased the surface area of the nanocomposite but this property does not correlate with the maximum adsorption capacity of the nanoadsorbent the removal rate and adsorption capacity are dependent on the initial concentration of the hctz amount and type of the adsorbent temperature ionic strength and solution ph the freundlich and pso models represent the best adjustment of experimental data assuming a process in heterogeneous surfaces and chemical adsorption respectively the thermodynamic study demonstrates that the process was spontaneous exothermic and random at the solid solution interface during adsorption the nanocomposite go fe3o4 1 10 proved to be efficient after five adsorption desorption cycles finally it is possible to conclude that synergy between go and fe3o4 demonstrates efficient and easy operational eliminating centrifugation and filtration steps making it a potential

13376,an environment friendly electrochemical pretreatment process was used to purify the circulating cooling water including salts extraction and organics removal and the effect of electrochemical pretreatment on scale inhibition and reverse osmosis ro was explored results showed that the electrochemical pretreatment exhibits a good softening ability for different types of water with hardness from 100 to 500 mg l calculated by caco3 considering the treatment efficiency and energy consumption 5 v and 7 v were suitable for softening treatment of low hardness water and high hardness water respectively with 300 mg l hardness as the limit after electrochemical pretreatment caco3 scale on heater surface can be effectively inhibited and the maximum scale inhibition rate can reach 73 9 at 7 v meanwhile the caco3 scale is loose after electrochemical pretreatment accompanied by the transformation of crystalline phase from calcite to aragonite the long term ro membrane flux experiment shows that the pure inorganic salt solution has the least contribution to ro membrane fouling followed by the pure organic solution notably when inorganic salt ions coexist with organic matters in water a complex structure of gel network can be formed which causes serious pollution to ro membrane and sharp decrease of the specific flux j j 0 interestingly ro membrane fouling can be effectively controlled after electrochemical pretreatment even for actual circulating water this work provides a simple strategy for the development and application of electrochemical technology in softening and ro membrane fouling control graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords circulating cooling water electrochemical pretreatment water softening scale inhibition ro membrane fouling 1 introduction circulating cooling water system is an important part in electric petrochemical mineral industries 1 for in china circulating water accounts for 70 80 of the industrial water consumption 2 4 due to evaporation the concentration of salts and organics in water are condensed which leads to more severe scaling and fouling on the surface of heat exchanger 5 6 the adhesion of scale fouling reduces the efficiency of heat exchangers affects the efficiency of production and thus leads to unstable system operation and even accidents during production 7 though adding chemicals would alleviate these phenomena consuming a large amount of reagent is not in line with the national policy in china while this would result in severe water pollution 8 9 besides the scale ion such as ca2 mg2 etc still exist in the water after adding chemicals scale inhibitor or acid resulting in higher hardness and salt content of the wastewater produced by the follow up process as an environmental friendly process reducing scaling fouling potential of circulating cooling water electrochemical water treatment technology has got increasing attention on the market 10 12 xu et al systematically studied the performances of electrochemical process treating circulating water and pointed out that the process can effectively extract scaling ions and reduce organic pollutants 13 14 this could alleviate the scaling fouling on heat exchanger with reduced dosage of chemicals the basic principle of electrochemical method is to produce high concentration of hydroxyl radicals oh and hydroxide ions oh near the anode and cathode respectively so as to realize the decomposition of organics and the removal of scaling ions eqs 1 6 anodic reaction 1 m o x h 2 o m o x oh h e 2 r m o x oh c o 2 h e m o x 3 m o x oh

stream process controlling water quality of the circulating cooling water 15 17 shown on fig 1 ro filtration removes salts and organics from the cooling water and keeps the water quality stable 18 19 nevertheless ro membrane can also be fouled by scaling and fouling similar to that on heat exchangers and result lower water production more frequent chemical cleaning and thus shortened membrane life 20 the main reasons are also due to the formation of scaling caused by condensed ca2 mg2 etc ions fouling by organic matter such as solvable microbiological products smp and natural organic matters noms etc and even biofouling on the membrane surface 21 23 as electrochemical process can alleviate the scaling fouling on the heat exchanger it is interesting to investigate the efficiency of this process on that during ro filtration and understand the mechanism behind at present such test has rarely been presented especially considering the effect of electrochemical technology on both heat exchanger and ro membrane in this work we have studied the effect of electrochemical pretreatment on scale inhibition of heat exchanger and ro membrane fouling simultaneously fig 1 calcium salt and humus are chosen as the representative of inorganic scaling ions and organic matter respectively the performance of electrochemical pretreatment on the removal of salts and organics was evaluated meanwhile the influence of electrochemical pretreatment on ro membrane fouling has also been explored in addition a series of characterizations and analysis were carried out to reveal the fouling mechanism of ro membrane the purpose of this work is to provide an efficient and eco friendly treatment process to purify water quality alleviating fouling of heat exchanger and ro membrane in industrial circulating cooling water system 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent xi an co ltd deionized water 18 mω cm was prepared from an upd ii 10t water purification laboratory system dobetter technology co ltd beijing china cathodes titanium plates were obtained from baoti co ltd anodes ti ti sn ruo2 was prepared according to the method in the literature 24 ro membrane lc le 4040 was provided by dow thin film technology company of the united states 2 2 preparation of simulated cooling water there are two types of simulated water in this study namely solution a and b solution a contains ca no3 2 and nahco3 dissolved in pure water while b is prepared by dissolve sodium humate in pure water and c is a mixture of a and b the molar ratio of ca no3 2 to nahco3 is 1 2 in both solutions a and c during the experiments the hardness of 100 200 300 and 500 mg l calculated by caco3 of simulated cooling water were prepared and named as type i type ii type iii and type iv respectively it should be noted that the simulated water used for ro membrane fouling test are solution a hardness 500 mg l b toc 5 mg l and c 500 mg l hardness 5 mg l toc 2 3 experimental set up and procedure the schematic diagram of electrochemical descaling device is shown in fig 2 the device contains a water tank 2500 ml and an electrolytic cell 500 ml ti ti sn ruo2 and ti mesh act as anode and cathode respectively two anodes with a dimension of 10 5 cm and three cathodes in the same size were arranged in parallel in the electrolytic cell the spacing between each adjacent cathode and anode was kept at 1 0 cm simulated water flows through the electrolytic cell in the way of bottom in and up out a water tank was used to store 2500 ml of circulation solution and the temperature is kept at preseted values by using a temperature controlled electric heater the applied voltage of the system is controlled at 3 5 7 and 10 v respectively and the feed flow rate was controlled in the range of 10 to 50 l h water samples were taken from the water tank in different treatment time intervals for detailed analysis the electric heater is rinsed pure water dried 50 c for 10 min and weighed at room temperature before and after use during certain intervals the mass of the deposited scale layer is thus obtained by calculating the weight difference and the scale inhibition rate η is then calculated by the following formula 7 η m t m 0 m 0 100 where mt and m0 are the weight gain of electric heater after drying before and after scale inhibition test respectively the current efficiency ce and energy consumption ep were calculated as follows 8 ce th 0 th t 10 5 it fv 100 9 ep uit th 0 th t

electrolyte l 2 4 fouling tests the schematic diagram of a laboratory ro device convergence inspector colossus netherlands is shown in fig 3 after electrochemical pretreatment the water sample enters the membrane module from the feed box through the peristaltic pump and then the purified water enters the reservoir after ro membrane filtration while the generated concentrated water returns to the feed box through the peristaltic pump so called cross flow filtration however in order to complete the ro membrane fouling test in a small amount of water the total amount of water is 3 l the purified water in the reservoir also flows back to the feed box the electrochemical pretreatment process of raw water is similar to that of section 2 3 but the whole treatment time keep 2 h and water temperature is controlled at 25 c in the figure below p1 p2 and p3 represent the pressure gauge and f1 f2 and f3 represent the flowmeter the membrane module consisted of two identical structured

co ltd china conductometer hq30d hach us and titration method respectively in order to further evaluate the purification effect of electrochemical pretreatment on actual wastewater the fouling control test of ro membrane was carried out on the circulating water collected from a converter station of china southern power grid china through analysis of the actual circulating water quality the basic water quality information are as follows in table 1 for the actual circulating water above mentioned liquid chromatrography with online organic carbon detector lc ocd system doc labor dr huber germany and quartz crystal microbalance qcm d e1 instrument qsense sweden were used to analyze the change of molecular weight distribution and adsorption behavior of pollutants on polyamide membrane surface for more in depth analysis note in this experiment the operation procedure of lc ocd and qcm d system was consistent with the previous reports of literature 25 the surface of gold plated crystal was coated with linear aromatic polyamide using q sense qsx999 q sense method to simulate the surface of ro membrane film 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical pretreatment of simulated water with different hardness fig 4 shows the performance of electrochemical pretreatment for the removal of th ta and tds from solution a at different voltages 25 c with the increment of applied voltage the removal of th ta and tds all increased quickly the increase is not lineal along with the rise of voltage meaning less significant from 7 to 10 v compared to from 3 to 5 v it is interesting to note that for type ii water th 200 mg l the hardness removal did not increase but decrease with the increase of voltage from 7 to 10 v it is suggested that too high voltage might aggravate the hydrogen evolution reaction on the cathode the floating up of a large amount of gas would result in severe up down convection in the water near the cathode area which subsequently interfere the migration and enrichment of scaling ions to the cathode high alkali region excess oh ions generated are wasted and do not participate in the scaling process it is clear that the excessive voltage does not add scale inhibition capacity but result in waste of electric energy and even cause the corrosion of the equipment 26 27 for type i th 100 mg l and type ii th 200 mg l water with the increase of hardness from 100 to 200 mg l the removal of th ta and tds all increased at the applied voltages when the hardness of water continues to increase to 300 mg l type iii and 500 mg l type iv the removal efficiency of salts decreased however it does not mean that the desalting amount per unit time decreases for high hardness water in addition the results show that the growth rate of electrochemical salt extraction efficiency for low hardness water type i and type ii is significantly weakened when the applied voltage exceeds 5 v however for the high hardness water of type iii and type iv the salt extraction efficiency is still significantly improved when the applied voltage increases from 5 to 7 v indicating that the electrochemical salt extraction efficiency is affected by both the applied voltage and the concentration of scaling ions as can be seen from table 2 with the increase of applied voltage the energy consumption ep also increases along with the decrease of current efficiency ce in comparison the ce of high hardness water is higher than that of treating low hardness water therefore the optimal voltage is not constant for the softening treatment of water with different hardness and also needs to be adjusted flexibly according to the actual situation considering both ep and softening efficiency 7 v can be selected for electrochemical salt extraction of water with a higher hardness than 300 mg l while the hardness is below 300 mg l 5 v would be a more suitable choice 3 2 scale inhibition effect of electrochemical pretreatment fig 5 shows the scale inhibition effect of electrochemical pretreatment on the surface of the heating rod after 6 h circulation under different operating conditions th 500 mg l when the circulating flow rate increases from 10 l h to 50 l h the scale inhibition of electrochemical on the heater experienced initial increase and then decrease in the range of 10 30 l h the scale inhibition effect is continuously increasing it might be due to the thus accelerated mass transfer of the solute to the cathode which promotes the chance of scale ion contacting with the cathode when the flow rate rises to 50 l h high water flow induces more severe turbulance which could take the crystal nucleus away from the cathode surface 28 water temperature affects the scaling process as well when the water temperature is set at 55 c the device exhibits the highest scaling prohibitaiton effect higher or lower temperature result in decreased effect generally increasing the temperature can reduce the viscosity of the solution reduce the friction force of ions moving through the solvent so as to improve the conductivity of the solution and promote the migration and enrichment of scaling ions in water to the cathode 29 meanwhile increasing temperature will reduce the solubility product constant of caco3 and accelerate the deposition rate of scale near the cathode however when the water temperature is too high the deposition rate of caco3 on the surface of the heat exchanger will also increase sharply in contrast the electrochemical scale inhibition efficiency will be insufficient according to the previous experiment 5 7 v is a suitable voltage range for scaling prohibitation usually the higher the electrolysis voltage the greater the deposition of caco3 on cathode which leads to the lower hardness of treated water as shown in fig 5 considering that under the same conditions the electrochemical scale inhibition rate at 7 v 74 is higher than that at 5 v 57 7 v voltage was selected for the following experimental studies fig 6 shows the characterization of micro morphology of scale on the heater surface with or without electrochemical pretreatment it can be seen that the scale on the heater surface of the blank group presents regular polyhedral cube shape and the surface of the scale particles is smooth and angular by element scanning analysis the sample mainly includes ca c and o elements which is supposed to be caco3 after analysis of the scale morphology it is speculated that the caco3 scale should be mainly calcite type crystal 30 after electrochemical pretreatment the scale is mainly in the form of needle like aggregation and a small amount of cubic particles can be found which is completely different from the morphology of the blank one although element scanning analysis indicate the presents of ca c and o forming caco3 the scale changes its morphology and should be mainly aragonite or aragonite with a small amount of calcite crystal fig 7 shows the crystalline structure of scale samples with and without electrochemical pretreatment for the blank group the diffraction peaks at 2θ of 23 0 29 4 35 9 39 4 43 1 47 5 48 5 56 5 57 5 respectively belong to the 102 104 110 113 202 016 116 121 122 crystal planes and no characteristic diffraction peaks of aragonite crystal are found for the scale samples treated by electrochemical pretreatment the diffraction peaks at 2θ of 26 2 27 3 33 1 36 2 37 2 37 9 42 8 and 45 8 are aragonite type caco3 characteristic diffraction peaks which belong to 111 021 012 200 031 112 122 and 221 crystal planes respectively the diffraction peak at 29 4 at 2 θ is the characteristic diffraction peak of calcite type caco3 which belongs to 104 crystal plane indicating that the sample is a mixture of aragonite type and calcite type the above xrd analysis results are in good agreement with the sem picture shown in fig 6 3 3 fouling behavior and mechanism of ro membrane according to fig 8 the order of ro membrane fouling severity treating different water is solution c inorganic salt organic matter solution b pure organic matter solution a pure inorganic salt results showed that the membrane specific flux j j 0 of ro decreased by 60 in filtering solution a and b for nearly 90 h and 15 h respectively for the mixed solution c the ro membrane fouling decreased by 60 after 9 h of operation it is clear that there is a synergistic effect between inorganic ions such as ca2 and organics 31 33 such interaction would lead to the formation of a gel layer which is easy to adhere to the ro membrane surface and decrease the flux sharply with electrochemical pretreatment the specific flux of ro membrane was only reduced by 40 after nearly 100 h operation which proved that electrochemical pretreatment can effectively alleviate ro membrane fouling water quality analysis shows that after electrochemical pretreatment 52 of th and 68 of doc were removed through polynomial fitting the fitting formulas of ro membrane specific flux under four test conditions were y 0 01x 3 92 10 5x2 0 95 y 0 02x 2 06 10 4x2 0 69 y 0 06x 8 72 10 4x2 0 95 y 0 01x 6 11 10 5x2 0 94 respectively for the above four fitting formulas the larger absolute value of the coefficient of x is the more serious the attenuation of membrane specific flux is according to the coefficient of parameter x in the fitting formula the decline rate of j j 0 value of ro membrane under these four test conditions can also be evaluated fig 9 shows the surface morphology of ro membrane under different fouling test conditions it can be seen that the surface of a fresh ro membrane was smooth and clean without any obvious contaminants fig 9a under 10 000 amplification many micro pores on the surface of ro film can be observed fig s1 after treating solution a pure inorganic a large number of regular polyhedral cube shape particles with the same morphology as those in fig 6 appeared on the membrane surface fig 9b they are mainly identified as caco3 scale with calcite crystal fig s2 it is clear that higher concentration of ions on the membrane surface leads to precipitation crystalization of the salts 34 35 nevertheless for filtering solution b containing pure organics sodium humate fig 9c ro membrane surface is completely covered by a thick layer of organic material as shown in fig 9d when the organic matter and inorganic salts coexist in the water solution c a fouling layer seems of a more compact character formed and led to significant flux reduction fortunately adding electrochemical pretreatment into the system the fouling layer thus formed is much looser and thinner than otherwise and leads to obvious fouling alleviation effect 3 4 fouling control of ro membrane by electrochemical pretreatment in actual circulating water fig 10 shows the inhibition effect of electrochemical pretreatment on ro membrane pollution in actual circulating water detailed water quality parameters can be found in table 1 for the raw water after 200 h of test the specific flux j j 0 value of ro membrane decreased from 1 00 to 0 72 and the attenuation rate of ro membrane flux reached 38 after electrochemical pretreatment the specific flux j j 0 value of ro membrane decreased from 1 00 to 0 83 within the same test period and the flux attenuation rate was only 17 which was far lower than that of handling the raw water the above results show that the electrochemical pretreatment can still achieve good control effect on ro membrane fouling for the actual circulating water a more detailed water quality analysis is shown on fig 11 and in table 3 results show that electrochemical oxidation can effectively decompose macromolecular organics into small molecular acids as biopolymers molecular weight 20 kda 36 decreased from 0 85 to 0 03 mg l reaching 96 5 of removal meanwhile higher concentration of small molecule acids molecular weight 350 da appeared in the water with a concentration increased from 0 22 to 0 75 mg l in addition humic substances building blocks and small molecule neutrals were all well removed leading to a doc reduction from 5 05 to 2 64 mg l table 3 simultaneously th and ta of circulating water decreased from 136 to 72 mg l and 84 to 37 mg l respectively due to the presence of electrochemical pretreatment the reduction of doc and thus alleviated fouling effect can also be reflected by testing the mass adsorbed on the membrane surface fig 12 shows the representative frequency δf shift curves of circulating water before and after electrochemical pretreatment using qcm d the δf shift curves indicate the adsorption and desorption behaviors of contaminants inorganics and organics on the polyamide membrane surface for raw water the frequency of wafers decreased significantly from 0 to 42 1 hz indicating that more pollutants were adsorbed on the membrane surface after cleaning and desorbing the membrane surface with pure water the oscillation frequency of the wafer was increased slightly from 32 to 26 hz nevertheless the frequency began to decrease rapidly during the second adsorption process which means that contaminants in water are adsorbed on the membrane surface again and the wafer frequency drops to 42 hz after electrochemical pretreatment the variation trend of δf was similar to that of the raw water but the adsorption capacity of contaminants on the membrane was significantly inhibited after 4500 s test the δf of the wafer only decreased to 18 hz which was far higher than that of raw water the above results show that the effluent after electrochemical pretreatment exhibited a weaker adsorption capacity on the membrane surface due to the removal of scaling ions and organic matters which also implied that the electrochemical pretreatment can alleviate the membrane fouling 4 conclusions in this work electrochemical pretreatment was used to soften water and remove organics for circulating cooling water meanwhile the effect of electrochemical pretreatment on scale inhibition and ro membrane fouling was investigated specific conclusions are as follows 1 the electrochemical strategy can effectively realize the softening treatment of different types of water considering the treatment effect and energy consumption 5 v and 7 v can be used as the appropriate applied voltage for low hardness th 300 mg l water and high hardness th 300 mg l water respectively in this study 2 after electrochemical pretreatment caco3 scale on heater surface can be effectively inhibited moreover the crystal phase of scale changes from calcite to aragonite which is more conducive to the formation of soft and loose scale layer 3 when inorganic salt ions ca2 coexist with organic matter humics in water a complex structure of gel network can be formed which causes serious pollution to ro membrane and sharp decrease of the specific flux j j 0 after electrochemical pretreatment ro membrane fouling can be effectively controlled 4 during electrochemical pretreatment of actual circulating water macromolecular substances especially biopolymers and hardness are effectively removed meanwhile the gel on the membrane surface disappeared with significantly

13376,an environment friendly electrochemical pretreatment process was used to purify the circulating cooling water including salts extraction and organics removal and the effect of electrochemical pretreatment on scale inhibition and reverse osmosis ro was explored results showed that the electrochemical pretreatment exhibits a good softening ability for different types of water with hardness from 100 to 500 mg l calculated by caco3 considering the treatment efficiency and energy consumption 5 v and 7 v were suitable for softening treatment of low hardness water and high hardness water respectively with 300 mg l hardness as the limit after electrochemical pretreatment caco3 scale on heater surface can be effectively inhibited and the maximum scale inhibition rate can reach 73 9 at 7 v meanwhile the caco3 scale is loose after electrochemical pretreatment accompanied by the transformation of crystalline phase from calcite to aragonite the long term ro membrane flux experiment shows that the pure inorganic salt solution has the least contribution to ro membrane fouling followed by the pure organic solution notably when inorganic salt ions coexist with organic matters in water a complex structure of gel network can be formed which causes serious pollution to ro membrane and sharp decrease of the specific flux j j 0 interestingly ro membrane fouling can be effectively controlled after electrochemical pretreatment even for actual circulating water this work provides a simple strategy for the development and application of electrochemical technology in softening and ro membrane fouling control graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords circulating cooling water electrochemical pretreatment water softening scale inhibition ro membrane fouling 1 introduction circulating cooling water system is an important part in electric petrochemical mineral industries 1 for in china circulating water accounts for 70 80 of the industrial water consumption 2 4 due to evaporation the concentration of salts and organics in water are condensed which leads to more severe scaling and fouling on the surface of heat exchanger 5 6 the adhesion of scale fouling reduces the efficiency of heat exchangers affects the efficiency of production and thus leads to unstable system operation and even accidents during production 7 though adding chemicals would alleviate these phenomena consuming a large amount of reagent is not in line with the national policy in china while this would result in severe water pollution 8 9 besides the scale ion such as ca2 mg2 etc still exist in the water after adding chemicals scale inhibitor or acid resulting in higher hardness and salt content of the wastewater produced by the follow up process as an environmental friendly process reducing scaling fouling potential of circulating cooling water electrochemical water treatment technology has got increasing attention on the market 10 12 xu et al systematically studied the performances of electrochemical process treating circulating water and pointed out that the process can effectively extract scaling ions and reduce organic pollutants 13 14 this could alleviate the scaling fouling on heat exchanger with reduced dosage of chemicals the basic principle of electrochemical method is to produce high concentration of hydroxyl radicals oh and hydroxide ions oh near the anode and cathode respectively so as to realize the decomposition of organics and the removal of scaling ions eqs 1 6 anodic reaction 1 m o x h 2 o m o x oh h e 2 r m o x oh c o 2 h e m o x 3 m o x oh

stream process controlling water quality of the circulating cooling water 15 17 shown on fig 1 ro filtration removes salts and organics from the cooling water and keeps the water quality stable 18 19 nevertheless ro membrane can also be fouled by scaling and fouling similar to that on heat exchangers and result lower water production more frequent chemical cleaning and thus shortened membrane life 20 the main reasons are also due to the formation of scaling caused by condensed ca2 mg2 etc ions fouling by organic matter such as solvable microbiological products smp and natural organic matters noms etc and even biofouling on the membrane surface 21 23 as electrochemical process can alleviate the scaling fouling on the heat exchanger it is interesting to investigate the efficiency of this process on that during ro filtration and understand the mechanism behind at present such test has rarely been presented especially considering the effect of electrochemical technology on both heat exchanger and ro membrane in this work we have studied the effect of electrochemical pretreatment on scale inhibition of heat exchanger and ro membrane fouling simultaneously fig 1 calcium salt and humus are chosen as the representative of inorganic scaling ions and organic matter respectively the performance of electrochemical pretreatment on the removal of salts and organics was evaluated meanwhile the influence of electrochemical pretreatment on ro membrane fouling has also been explored in addition a series of characterizations and analysis were carried out to reveal the fouling mechanism of ro membrane the purpose of this work is to provide an efficient and eco friendly treatment process to purify water quality alleviating fouling of heat exchanger and ro membrane in industrial circulating cooling water system 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent xi an co ltd deionized water 18 mω cm was prepared from an upd ii 10t water purification laboratory system dobetter technology co ltd beijing china cathodes titanium plates were obtained from baoti co ltd anodes ti ti sn ruo2 was prepared according to the method in the literature 24 ro membrane lc le 4040 was provided by dow thin film technology company of the united states 2 2 preparation of simulated cooling water there are two types of simulated water in this study namely solution a and b solution a contains ca no3 2 and nahco3 dissolved in pure water while b is prepared by dissolve sodium humate in pure water and c is a mixture of a and b the molar ratio of ca no3 2 to nahco3 is 1 2 in both solutions a and c during the experiments the hardness of 100 200 300 and 500 mg l calculated by caco3 of simulated cooling water were prepared and named as type i type ii type iii and type iv respectively it should be noted that the simulated water used for ro membrane fouling test are solution a hardness 500 mg l b toc 5 mg l and c 500 mg l hardness 5 mg l toc 2 3 experimental set up and procedure the schematic diagram of electrochemical descaling device is shown in fig 2 the device contains a water tank 2500 ml and an electrolytic cell 500 ml ti ti sn ruo2 and ti mesh act as anode and cathode respectively two anodes with a dimension of 10 5 cm and three cathodes in the same size were arranged in parallel in the electrolytic cell the spacing between each adjacent cathode and anode was kept at 1 0 cm simulated water flows through the electrolytic cell in the way of bottom in and up out a water tank was used to store 2500 ml of circulation solution and the temperature is kept at preseted values by using a temperature controlled electric heater the applied voltage of the system is controlled at 3 5 7 and 10 v respectively and the feed flow rate was controlled in the range of 10 to 50 l h water samples were taken from the water tank in different treatment time intervals for detailed analysis the electric heater is rinsed pure water dried 50 c for 10 min and weighed at room temperature before and after use during certain intervals the mass of the deposited scale layer is thus obtained by calculating the weight difference and the scale inhibition rate η is then calculated by the following formula 7 η m t m 0 m 0 100 where mt and m0 are the weight gain of electric heater after drying before and after scale inhibition test respectively the current efficiency ce and energy consumption ep were calculated as follows 8 ce th 0 th t 10 5 it fv 100 9 ep uit th 0 th t

electrolyte l 2 4 fouling tests the schematic diagram of a laboratory ro device convergence inspector colossus netherlands is shown in fig 3 after electrochemical pretreatment the water sample enters the membrane module from the feed box through the peristaltic pump and then the purified water enters the reservoir after ro membrane filtration while the generated concentrated water returns to the feed box through the peristaltic pump so called cross flow filtration however in order to complete the ro membrane fouling test in a small amount of water the total amount of water is 3 l the purified water in the reservoir also flows back to the feed box the electrochemical pretreatment process of raw water is similar to that of section 2 3 but the whole treatment time keep 2 h and water temperature is controlled at 25 c in the figure below p1 p2 and p3 represent the pressure gauge and f1 f2 and f3 represent the flowmeter the membrane module consisted of two identical structured channels with a dimension of 6 cm long 5 cm wide and 2 mm deep the effective membrane surface area was 30 cm2 the model of the ro membrane element used in the experiment is ulp31 4040 and its stable desalination is 99 4 the ro membrane needs to be immersed in deionized water for 24 h 25 c 1 and compacted by 10 mm nacl solution before test to remove impurities and storage agent on the membrane surface in all experiments the transmembrane pressure and flow rate were 15 bar and 20 l m 2 h 1 respectively flux j and normalized flux j n were calculated by eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 j v a δt

5 characterization of scale and fouling scanning electron microscopy sem sne 3200 mb sec co ltd korea equipped with an energy dispersive x ray analyzer edx were used to observe the morphology and elemental analysis of the scale and fouling on the surface of heat exchange or ro membrane x ray diffraction xrd pan alytical holland using cu kα source λ 0 15416 nm was adopted to analyze their crystal structure the scanning angle 2θ ranges from 10 to 90 2 6 analysis the conventional water quality parameters including total organic carbon toc ph electrical conductivity ec total hardness th and total alkalinity ta were determined using a toc auto analyzer trace elemental instruments xpert netherlands potassium dichromate method ph probe starter 2100 shanghai precision science instrument co ltd china conductometer hq30d hach us and titration method respectively in order to further evaluate the purification effect of electrochemical pretreatment on actual wastewater the fouling control test of ro membrane was carried out on the circulating water collected from a converter station of china southern power grid china through analysis of the actual circulating water quality the basic water quality information are as follows in table 1 for the actual circulating water above mentioned liquid chromatrography with online organic carbon detector lc ocd system doc labor dr huber germany and quartz crystal microbalance qcm d e1 instrument qsense sweden were used to analyze the change of molecular weight distribution and adsorption behavior of pollutants on polyamide membrane surface for more in depth analysis note in this experiment the operation procedure of lc ocd and qcm d system was consistent with the previous reports of literature 25 the surface of gold plated crystal was coated with linear aromatic polyamide using q sense qsx999 q sense method to simulate the surface of ro membrane film 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical pretreatment of simulated water with different hardness fig 4 shows the performance of electrochemical pretreatment for the removal of th ta and tds from solution a at different voltages 25 c with the increment of applied voltage the removal of th ta and tds all increased quickly the increase is not lineal along with the rise of voltage meaning less significant from 7 to 10 v compared to from 3 to 5 v it is interesting to note that for type ii water th 200 mg l the hardness removal did not increase but decrease with the increase of voltage from 7 to 10 v it is suggested that too high voltage might aggravate the hydrogen evolution reaction on the cathode the floating up of a large amount of gas would result in severe up down convection in the water near the cathode area which subsequently interfere the migration and enrichment of scaling ions to the cathode high alkali region excess oh ions generated are wasted and do not participate in the scaling process it is clear that the excessive voltage does not add scale inhibition capacity but result in waste of electric energy and even cause the corrosion of the equipment 26 27 for type i th 100 mg l and type ii th 200 mg l water with the increase of hardness from 100 to 200 mg l the removal of th ta and tds all increased at the applied voltages when the hardness of water continues to increase to 300 mg l type iii and 500 mg l type iv the removal efficiency of salts decreased however it does not mean that the desalting amount per unit time decreases for high hardness water in addition the results show that the growth rate of electrochemical salt extraction efficiency for low hardness water type i and type ii is significantly weakened when the applied voltage exceeds 5 v however for the high hardness water of type iii and type iv the salt extraction efficiency is still significantly improved when the applied voltage increases from 5 to 7 v indicating that the electrochemical salt extraction efficiency is affected by both the applied voltage and the concentration of scaling ions as can be seen from table 2 with the increase of applied voltage the energy consumption ep also increases along with the decrease of current efficiency ce in comparison the ce of high hardness water is higher than that of treating low hardness water therefore the optimal voltage is not constant for the softening treatment of water with different hardness and also needs to be adjusted flexibly according to the actual situation considering both ep and softening efficiency 7 v can be selected for electrochemical salt extraction of water with a higher hardness than 300 mg l while the hardness is below 300 mg l 5 v would be a more suitable choice 3 2 scale inhibition effect of electrochemical pretreatment fig 5 shows the scale inhibition effect of electrochemical pretreatment on the surface of the heating rod after 6 h circulation under different operating conditions th 500 mg l when the circulating flow rate increases from 10 l h to 50 l h the scale inhibition of electrochemical on the heater experienced initial increase and then decrease in the range of 10 30 l h the scale inhibition effect is continuously increasing it might be due to the thus accelerated mass transfer of the solute to the cathode which promotes the chance of scale ion contacting with the cathode when the flow rate rises to 50 l h high water flow induces more severe turbulance which could take the crystal nucleus away from the cathode surface 28 water temperature affects the scaling process as well when the water temperature is set at 55 c the device exhibits the highest scaling prohibitaiton effect higher or lower temperature result in decreased effect generally increasing the temperature can reduce the viscosity of the solution reduce the friction force of ions moving through the solvent so as to improve the conductivity of the solution and promote the migration and enrichment of scaling ions in water to the cathode 29 meanwhile increasing temperature will reduce the solubility product constant of caco3 and accelerate the deposition rate of scale near the cathode however when the water temperature is too high the deposition rate of caco3 on the surface of the heat exchanger will also increase sharply in contrast the electrochemical scale inhibition efficiency will be insufficient according to the previous experiment 5 7 v is a suitable voltage range for scaling prohibitation usually the higher the electrolysis voltage the greater the deposition of caco3 on cathode which leads to the lower hardness of treated water as shown in fig 5 considering that under the same conditions the electrochemical scale inhibition rate at 7 v 74 is higher than that at 5 v 57 7 v voltage was selected for the following experimental studies fig 6 shows the characterization of micro morphology of scale on the heater surface with or without electrochemical pretreatment it can be seen that the scale on the heater surface of the blank group presents regular polyhedral cube shape and the surface of the scale particles is smooth and angular by element scanning analysis the sample mainly includes ca c and o elements which is supposed to be caco3 after analysis of the scale morphology it is speculated that the caco3 scale should be mainly calcite type crystal 30 after electrochemical pretreatment the scale is mainly in the form of needle like aggregation and a small amount of cubic particles can be found which is completely different from the morphology of the blank one although element scanning analysis indicate the presents of ca c and o forming caco3 the scale changes its morphology and should be mainly aragonite or aragonite with a small amount of calcite crystal fig 7 shows the crystalline structure of scale samples with and without electrochemical pretreatment for the blank group the diffraction peaks at 2θ of 23 0 29 4 35 9 39 4 43 1 47 5 48 5 56 5 57 5 respectively belong to the 102 104 110 113 202 016 116 121 122 crystal planes and no characteristic diffraction peaks of aragonite crystal are found for the scale samples treated by electrochemical pretreatment the diffraction peaks at 2θ of 26 2 27 3 33 1 36 2 37 2 37 9 42 8 and 45 8 are aragonite type caco3 characteristic diffraction peaks which belong to 111 021 012 200 031 112 122 and 221 crystal planes respectively the diffraction peak at 29 4 at 2 θ is the characteristic diffraction peak of calcite type caco3 which belongs to 104 crystal plane indicating that the sample is a mixture of aragonite type and calcite type the above xrd analysis results are in good agreement with the sem picture shown in fig 6 3 3 fouling behavior and mechanism of ro membrane according to fig 8 the order of ro membrane fouling severity treating different water is solution c inorganic salt organic matter solution b pure organic matter solution a pure inorganic salt results showed that the membrane specific flux j j 0 of ro decreased by 60 in filtering solution a and b for nearly 90 h and 15 h respectively for the mixed solution c the ro membrane fouling decreased by 60 after 9 h of operation it is clear that there is a synergistic effect between inorganic ions such as ca2 and organics 31 33 such interaction would lead to the formation of a gel layer which is easy to adhere to the ro membrane surface and decrease the flux sharply with electrochemical pretreatment the specific flux of ro membrane was only reduced by 40 after nearly 100 h operation which proved that electrochemical pretreatment can effectively alleviate ro membrane fouling water quality analysis shows that after electrochemical pretreatment 52 of th and 68 of doc were removed through polynomial fitting the fitting formulas of ro membrane specific flux under four test

coefficient of x is the more serious the attenuation of membrane specific flux is according to the coefficient of parameter x in the fitting formula the decline rate of j j 0 value of ro membrane under these four test conditions can also be evaluated fig 9 shows the surface morphology of ro membrane under different fouling test conditions it can be seen that the surface of a fresh ro membrane was smooth and clean without any obvious contaminants fig 9a under 10 000 amplification many micro pores on the surface of ro film can be observed fig s1 after treating solution a pure inorganic a large number of regular polyhedral cube shape particles with the same morphology as those in fig 6 appeared on the membrane surface fig 9b they are mainly identified as caco3 scale with calcite

organics sodium humate fig 9c ro membrane surface is completely covered by a thick layer of organic material as shown in fig 9d when the organic matter and inorganic salts coexist in the water solution c a fouling layer seems of a more compact character formed and led to significant flux reduction fortunately adding electrochemical pretreatment into the system the fouling layer thus formed is much looser and thinner than otherwise and leads to obvious fouling alleviation effect 3 4 fouling control of ro membrane by electrochemical pretreatment in actual circulating water fig 10 shows

irradiation time the optimum removal efficiency of toc and cod removal in the immobilized system was determined as 51 98 and 57 25 respectively at the input factor setting methanol tio2 ratio 15 1 nitric acid tio2 ratio 6 1 and solar irradiation time 120 min the optimum organic degradation in suspension system was found to be toc removal 73 47 and cod removal 65 48 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords membrane fouling nanophotocatalysis seawater pretreatment tio2 immobilization 1 introduction pretreatment of seawater is crucial in desalination plants to avoid membrane fouling and concomitant operational overheads 1 biofouling occurring due to microorganisms is a complex process where the live foulants stick to the membrane surface and multiply many folds to produce polymeric materials 2 biofouling in reverse osmosis ro membranes results in increased osmotic pressure and low permeate flux 3 removal of organic contaminants from feedwater enables to enhance the performance of desalination operation in terms of energy saving and improved water quality parameters heterogeneous photocatalysis using semiconductors like tio2 can degrade the recalcitrant organics into smaller molecules 4 the hydroxyl radicals oh generated during the photocatalytic process are capable of mineralizing and oxidizing almost any type of organic molecule nano tio2 photocatalyst in slurry form is potentially suitable to degrade trace organic pollutants in contaminated water the slurry or suspension form of the reactor system excels in other photocatalytic systems in terms of effective mass transfer rate enhanced contact between catalyst and pollutants and uniform distribution of light as per the design the high surface to volume ratio of nanophotocatalysts like degussa p25 tio2 20 nm particle size in suspension mode facilitates more active sites for reaction and enable improved photocatalytic degradation 5 one of the drawbacks often highlighted with the slurry system is the difficulties associated with the post separation of suspended tio2 nanoparticles from treated water techniques such as coagulation changing ph to the point of zero charge phpzc for neutralizing surface charges and microfiltration facilitates complete recovery of nanoparticles but involve additional operational cost 6 the difficulties associated with post separation of photocatalysts can be eliminated by incorporating an immobilized system where the photocatalyst is coated over a substrate as a thin film 7 the immobilized photoreactor systems enable the reusability and recycling of the photocatalysts and avoid the energy intensive post separation issues due to these visible benefits there are numerous research studies conducted to immobilize tio2 on different substrates to produce mechanically robust coatings 8 9 many coating techniques and methodologies including atomic layer deposition sputtering vacuum arc plasma evaporation anodization electrochemical technique sol gel method have been implemented for the efficient immobilization of photocatalysts on various substrates 10 materials such as ceramic beads activated carbon and zeolites are less efficient compared to borosilicate glass as substrates due to limitations in uv visible light transmission capability which is crucial for photocatalytic degradation hence in this research work the immobilized photocatalytic reactor system is designed for incorporating borosilicate glass tubes that were internally coated with tio2 nanoparticles the utilization of tio2 immobilized system can reduce the overall cost incurred and significantly simplify the photocatalytic process 11 previous seawater disinfection studies 12 reported the performance of immobilized tio2 uv for mineralizing the organic pollutants where the advanced oxidation process aop treatment had faster disinfection kinetics tio2 photocatalytic process under solar uv irradiation is a promising aop for the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants from the contaminated water 13 solar immobilized tio2 photocatalytic reactors are extensively used for the degradation of organic pollutants from industrial effluents 14 however the solar tio2 process has barely been documented as a pretreatment method for seawater treatment or predominantly as a promising membrane fouling control tool in the different treatment environment as per the understanding of the present research team no optimization study specifically on immobilized tio2 solar for removal of organics from seawater has been conducted so far in the current study two different photocatalytic degradation methods namely tio2 immobilized and tio2 in suspension are implemented to model and optimize the removal of organics from seawater figs 1 a b show a schematic

input parameters and interaction between them in the final step rsm is employed to determine the optimal condition that maximizes seawater organics degradation efficiency of the solar tio2 immobilized photocatalytic process this work has reported for the first time immobilization of tio2 catalyst thin film on concentric borosilicate glass tubes using an in house built nanocoating machine for photocatalytic ro pretreatment of seawater under natural solar irradiation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and seawater characterization titanium dioxide aeroxide p25 with a specific surface area of 60 m2 g bet was obtained from evonik industries germany the seawater sample used in this study was collected from muscat gulf of oman approximately 2 km away from the shore a nearby ro desalination plant uses the seawater from the same area and the toc content fluctuates from 2 mg l to 4 mg l and sometimes goes higher up to 7 6 mg l during algal bloom or pollution or other events the seawater samples were characterized as per standard protocols followed for estimating parameters of highly saline samples 16 17 cod test was conducted by using cod kit k 7371s hr mercury free 0 15

preparation analytical grade of methanol and nitric acid were obtained from merck company usa 2 2 tio2 suspension system using a recirculation batch reactor the experimental setup fig 2 which consists of two concentric annular flow borosilicate glass tubes was used for both suspension and immobilized photocatalytic organic degradation of ro feed seawater in both tio2 suspension and tio2 immobilized system an aeration pump was incorporated to supply the sufficient amount of oxygen required for photocatalytic degradation of seawater organics for tio2 suspension system in bbd rsm modelling ph of seawater reaction time tio2 dosage initial toc of seawater and airflow rate were selected as input factors and the coded low 1 and high 1 levels were fixed at 4 and 8 90 and 180 min 0 3 and 0 7 g l 2 and 7 mg l and 3 and 5 l min respectively forty six experimental trials were conducted by considering total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod as response variables seawater was circulated upward into the photocatalytic reactor through the inner tube first and then flows downward through the annular space between the concentric glass tubes as shown in fig 2 the suction valve of the peristaltic pump was connected at the bottom surface of the annular space and the discharge was connected to the inner tube hence a continuous recirculation flow was maintained which is essential in a photocatalytic suspension system in order to prevent the settling of tio2 nanoparticles irradiation of tio2 surface with solar uv radiation of intensity equal to or greater than the bandgap energy leads to the generation of electron hole pairs the electron photo excited to the conduction band is a potent reducing agent while the hole that exists in the valence band performs as a strong oxidizing agent the holes undergo an oxidation reaction with h2o or oh and thus generate hydroxyl radicals oh these hydroxyl radicals are majorly responsible for the degradation of organic compounds the major reaction mechanism of solar tio2 photocatalytic process 18 is shown in eqs 1 7 1 ti o 2 hυ ti o 2 e cb h vb 2 ti o 2 h vb h 2 o ti o 2 h oh 3 ti o 2 h vb oh ti o 2 oh 4 ti o 2 e cb

and design of experiments doe for tio2 immobilization system in the immobilized system fig 2 the borosilicate glass tubes were replaced with tio2 thin film coated glass tubes outer tube internally coated and the inner smaller tube is coated in internal and external annular surfaces the inner tube is primarily used to maintain the recirculation flow so that very effective contact between solar radiation pollutant catalyst is achieved which is essential for optimum contaminant degradation initially the reactor is filled with seawater up to little below the tip of the inner tube when the peristaltic pump is started the seawater is drawn from the bottom annular space of the reactor and flows upward through the inner tube and comes out at the top the inner and outer surface of the inner tube is coated to enable supplementary photocatalytic reaction due to penetrated light the efficiency of tio2 thin film coated on borosilicate glass tubes were assessed in terms of percentage degradation of toc and cod from seawater under solar irradiation since the coating of tio2 thin film on glass tubes involves numerous steps and many factors influence the final performance the design of experiments doe method was implemented to assess the optimal conditions placket burman experimental design was used to screen vital few factors from trivial many this type of design is advantageous when there is inadequate information available about the process variables and behaviour 19 plackett burman designs are a class of screening designs that are orthogonal for main effects only the input factors that might influence the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 thin film and the parametric ranges are shown in table 1 the slurry preparation and tio2 nanocoating process on borosilicate glass tubes was conducted as per the settings of each input factors based on the placket burman experimental design matrix in the initial screening study as per placket burman input settings eight experimental runs were conducted to assess the tio2 thin film efficiency in terms of percentage degradation of toc and cod from ro feed seawater 2 4 experimental setup and tio2 immobilization procedure the nanocoating process of glass tubes for the solar photocatalytic reactor was performed according to the methods followed by previous researchers 20 the slurry required for thin film coating purpose was prepared by mixing 3 g of tio2 with 45 ml or 75 ml of methanol as per the ratios 15 1 or 25 1 defined in table 1 the mixture was sonicated for 10 or 20 min as per placket burman input settings to attain a uniform dispersion of tio2 particles in the suspension in order to change the ph to an acidic range and to enhance the adhesion between the substrate and tio2 dilute nitric acid 0 1 n was added to the suspension the ratio of nitric acid tio2 ratio was varied from 3 1 to 6 1 in order to study the effect of ph on coating efficiency it was anticipated that increased electrostatic attraction between the surfaces results in enhancing the adhesion 21 the slurry was stirred vigorously to prevent tio2 particle agglomeration and ensure its complete dispersion the stirring process was continued until the completion of the coating step to avoid any possible aggregation and sedimentation an automated nanocoating machine fig 3 was built in house for the immobilization of tio2 films on the annular surfaces of borosilicate glass tubes the wall coating of glass tubes was performed using the automated coating machine the tubes uniformly fed with the desired amount of slurry were made to rotate using dongchuan make 90 w single phase asynchronous variable speed electric motor an electric hot air portable heat gun 2000 w konsun make was used for keeping the nanocoating chamber warm and moisture free the angular speed of the glass tubes was varied gradually until uniform coating was achieved the coated tubes were then dried either at room temperature or by using the oven and calcined as per the temperature levels specified in the experimental design the coating process was repeated 2 or 4 times as per the low and high settings as given in table 1 the selected diameter of the borosilicate glass tubes which will be used in the tio2 immobilized reactor matched with a previous study 4 where the suggested ideal diameter of photoreactor for tio2 solar treatment was in the range of 25 60 mm the final photoreactor was designed with two concentric glass tubes 25 mm inner diameter 400 mm length and 1 2 mm wall thickness for inner tube 60 mm inner diameter 500 mm length and 1 5 mm wall thickness for outer tube as shown in fig 2 for seawater recirculation a peristaltic pump percom nm ii peristaltic pump 0 350 rpm 0 2100 ml min 48 w was used in both tio2 suspension and tio2 immobilization studies an aeration pump was used to supply a sufficient source of oxygen for the tio2 immobilization system in both placket burman and full factorial experiments the airflow using an air pump and the seawater recirculation using a peristaltic pump was maintained at 4 0 l min and 0 85 l min respectively air bubbling acted as a source of oxygen enhancing the overall organic degradation rate 22 moreover the presence of oxygen o2 in the photocatalytic system significantly acted as an oxidizing agent for the organics present in the aquatic environment 23 2 5 experimentation to remove toc and cod from seawater using tio2 thin film solar photocatalytic reactor in the preliminary study the efficiency of tio2 thin film was quantified in terms of percentage removal of toc and cod in seawater samples under solar irradiation plackett burman statistical design with the following linear regression model was adopted for screening the factors that affect tio2 thin film efficiency eq 8 8 y a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a 3 x 3 a 4 x 4 a 5 x 5 a 6 x 6 a 7 x 7 where y is the response toc and cod percentage removals a 0 is the mean response and a i i 1 to 7 is the main effect of input factors toc and cod percentage removals were calculated using eq 9 and eq 10 respectively 9 toc percentage removal toc initial toc after time t toc initial 100 where toc initial is the initial toc of seawater before photocatalytic treatment and toc after time t represents the total organic carbon content after t minute of solar irradiation 10 cod percentage removal cod initial cod after time t cod initial 100 where cod initial is the initial cod of seawater before photocatalytic treatment and cod after time t represents the chemical oxygen demand after t minute of solar irradiation for initial screening of vital input factors as per the placket burman design matrix eight experimental runs were conducted and assessed the tio2 thin film efficiency in terms of percentage removal of toc and cod from seawater the seawater was circulated through tubular reactors by using a peristaltic pump in all the experimental runs the flow rate of seawater was maintained at 0 85 l min the flow rate was set to a minimum to prevent any shear load on the film and thereby mitigate the chances of delamination each of the runs was conducted for a solar irradiation time of 150 min as recommended in a previous research study 21 2 6 full factorial design with significant factors while plackett burman design is used for filtering vital few factors from trivial many a full factorial design provides more insight into the process variations in the full factorial design with 11 experimental runs tio2 film efficiency was assessed in terms of methanol tio2 ratio nitric acid tio2 ratio and solar irradiation time the coded low level 1 and high level 1 for solar irradiation time were set as 120 min and 180 min respectively while the other two factors assigned with the same ranges as used in the plackett burman design 2 7 sem study of tio2 nanocoating the surface characteristics of the internal coating were determined through scanning electron microscopy sem using a field emission scanning electron microscope sem jeol jsm 7600f the morphology of the tio2 films prepared under different calcination temperature and varied number of coatings were analyzed investigation about the microstructure of the thin film was conducted before and after photocatalytic treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of seawater

collected from the same location 3 2 treatment of seawater in tio2 suspension system rsm modelling a five factor a ph of seawater b reaction time c tio2 dosage d initial toc of seawater and e airflow

shows the box behnken design bbd of experimental data and rsm and ann predicted values for toc and cod removal responses fig 4 a and b demonstrates the 3 d response surface plot for both toc and cod models obtained from bbd rsm captured at the optimum settings of other input factors the quadratic variation of toc removal in fig 4a indicates the interactive relation between the input factors ph and reaction time the colour coded red region of the peak indicates that optimum toc removal 70 85 was achieved at the settings ph 6 12 and reaction time rt of 147 54 min the dome shaped surface for cod removal in fig 4b demonstrates the strong synergistic interaction effect between airflow and reaction time on overall organic degradation similar interactive results obtained in a previous study 23 where the toc and cod in petroleum refinery wastewater were photo degraded using tio2 zno photocatalysis the optimum organic degradation efficiency along with optimum settings of input factors from the bbd rsm modelling optimization study is given in table 4 3 3 ann ga modelling and optimization of tio2 suspension system the performance of the tio2 suspension system for photocatalytic organic degradation of seawater is analyzed using ann ga modelling and optimization paradigm the experimental results obtained from bbd is used to create artificial neural network ann models for both toc and cod responses ann is a machine learning algorithm based on the simulation of a human neuron network that can map the input to output relationship in a complex multivariate design space the topology of the ann model with five input neurons and output neurons toc cod along with the optimum number of hidden layer neurons is demonstrated in fig 5 fig 6 a illustrates the mean square error mse versus iteration plot of ann for training and validation performance of cod removal modelling the close matching between true values and predicted values for toc removal as shown in fig 6b represents that ann effectively approximates the mapping between the response and five input factors both ann models developed for toc and cod removal were employed in an optimization procedure using genetic algorithm ga program codes using matlab version 2017b software a multi objective genetic algorithm moga is an evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm that mimics the natural evolutionary process in nature 24 through successive iterations generations moga generates a set of solutions known as pareto optimal front ga starts with an initial set of solutions known as a population which consists of chromosomes and genes or input variables the toc and cod models developed through ann modelling are used as fitness functions to maximize the response values fig 7 demonstrates the pareto optimal front which gives a set of non dominated feasible solutions that dominates other individuals in the population among this one solution toc removal 75 18 cod removal 67 23 at optimum settings ph 6 reaction time 159 36 min tio2 dosage 0 51 g l initial toc 2 58 mg l airflow rate 4 69 l min is selected for validation the validation results toc removal 73 47 cod removal 65 48 are found to be in good agreement with the predicted results 3 4 sem study of tio2 nanocoating the morphology and surface texture of the internal coating of the outer tube was determined through scanning electron microscopy fig 8 a d the sem images of tio2 thin film prepared at different settings indicate that uniform coating over the substrate is achieved and coating remains stable after 180 min of solar photocatalytic treatment the morphology of the double coated film fig 8a shows micro cracks due to insufficient coating it can be observed that when the coating is made four times fig 8b c the tio2 thin film surface has become smoother due to particle agglomeration resulting in the small porous structure these microstructures are similar to the result reported in the literature 25 where agglomeration was caused due to uniform coating methodology and the spherical dimension of tio2 particles fig 8d shows the morphology of the thin film after photocatalytic treatment for 180 min which was prepared at a calcination temperature of 350 c and was coated four times it was noticed that the film was stable and adhered to the surface without any detachment and mass reduction in the literature 20 a tio2 thin film prepared under similar conditions and immobilized to glass surface was reported as stable with good adhesiveness despite its reuse even after 12 photocatalytic reaction cycles also a band gap of 2 96 ev that leads to efficient solar photocatalysis was reported in a previous study 8 with similar coating strategy 3 5 results of placket burman screening design the orthogonal experimental matrix of the eight runs as per the placket burman experimental design matrix along with toc and cod removals are shown in table 5 the final equations obtained in terms of coded factors for toc and cod removals are shown in eq 11 and eq 12 respectively 11 toc removal 32 44 8 66 x 1 7 97 x 2 6 34 x 3 0 835 x 4 0 717 x 5 0 84 x 6 4 56 x 7 12 cod removal 35 63 10 33 x 1 8 13 x 2 6 10 x 3 1 98 x 4 1 49 x 5 1 21 x 6 4 6 x 7 the coded equations are used for detecting the relative effect of input factors by comparing their coefficients from eq 11 and eq 12 the coefficients of factors x 1 methanol tio2 ratio and x 2 nitric acid tio2 ratio are found to be high compared to other factors hence these two factors significantly affect the efficiency of tio2 thin film and have been selected as input factors for full factorial study the negative coefficient of factor x 3 calcination temperature in eq 11 and eq 12 indicates its negative influence on toc and cod removal efficiencies similar results 26 were obtained in a study that demonstrated the efficiency of immobilized tio2 film for degradation of green and low cost tetracycline the high positive coefficient of factor x 7 calcination time indicates that for maximum toc and cod removal the time required for calcination required to be set at a higher value 120 min hence in the present research work for the second stage full factorial design the calcination temperature was set at its lower limit 350 c and the time required for calcination was set at its higher value since the coefficient of factor x 4 is positive in both cod and toc removal equations four numbers of coatings were made for all borosilicate glass tubes moreover the xrd analysis of tio2 coating in a previous study 20 revealed enhanced crystallinity of the thin film with increasing coating thickness also it was reported that the crystalline structure was preserved despite several multilayer calcination procedures other factors in this study were ignored and could be set at any level due to lower values of coefficients and hence negligible influence on tio2 thin film efficiency 3 6 two level full factorial design the experimental values and predicted values of toc and cod responses obtained from the full factorial design are shown in table 6 in full factorial input settings the average of low and high levels coded middle level 0 are also included with repetition to assess random process variation pure error and to have more insight into the process behaviour doe full factorial design enables determining the main effects and two factor interactions between the input parameters 27 in the present study the experimental runs consist of eight factorial points and three centre points coded as zero at the centre of the experimental design space centre points are useful to determine the curvature effect and pure error occurring due to replication if the curvature effects are significant the design should be augmented with axial runs to quantify the quadratic effect of the variables analysis of variance anova results suggest that the curvature effect is insignificant and the full factorial empirical model is sufficient to describe the process variations the anova results obtained for toc and cod models are shown in table 7 and table 8 respectively the toc model f value of 35 67 indicates that the model is statistically significant the p value of 0 0006 indicates that only a 0 06 chance that an f value of this large could occur due to noise the p values less than 0 05 shows that model terms b c ab and bc are significant the p value more than 0 10 indicate that model terms are insignificant in this case factor a has p value higher than 0 10 but is included in the model to support ab interaction hierarchy lack of fit f value of 5 98 signifies that lack of fit of the model is not significant compared to the pure error an insignificant lack of fit indicates that the model is well fit to the experimental data points similarly from the anova results obtained for the cod model table 8 all the three main factors a b and c and interaction effects of ab and bc are found to be statistically significant 3 7 interaction and 3 d surface plot to examine the effect of input factors on toc and cod removal the final equations for toc and cod removal in terms of coded factors a methanol tio 2 ratio b nitric acid tio 2 ratio and c solar irradiation time are given in eq 13 and eq 14 respectively 13 toc removal 31 91 1 69 a 7 31 b 5 06 c 3 56 a b 5 81 b c 14 cod removal 36 67 2 41 a 7 88 b 6 26 c 3 70 a b 5 15 b c the relative weight of coefficients in eq 13 and eq 14 indicate that the main effects of factor a methanol tio2 ratio and factor b nitric acid tio2 ratio are positive whereas the main effect of factor c solar irradiation time is negative in the present study factor b has a more prominent effect than factors a and c the results are in agreement with a similar study 28 conducted using immobilized tio2 film for acid dye degradation when main effects are considered it is optimal to keep a and b at their high 1 levels and keep c at its low 1 level to maximize toc and cod removal efficiencies in photocatalytic processes like seawater organics degradation it is important to analyze any possible interaction that is statistically significant very often interaction terms are more significant than the main effects interaction happens when the output response behaves differently depending on the settings of two factors 29 two non parallel lines in the interaction graph indicate that the effect of one factor is depended on the level of the other fig 9 a and fig 9b show the graphical presentation of the statistical evaluation of two factor interaction on toc and cod removal efficiencies respectively in fig 9a the effect of nitric acid tio2 ratio on toc removal efficiency depends on the solar irradiation time setting similarly for the interaction graph for cod removal in fig 9b the effect of solar irradiation time depends on whether the nitric acid tio2 ratio is at a higher setting line with triangle endpoints or the lower setting bold line with square endpoints among two factor interaction effects bc interaction is more significant than other terms in the model this finding validates the fact that in the slurry preparation process acidification using nitric acid enables uniform dispersion that is directly affecting the final tio2 film performance 20 however the interaction between nitric acid tio2 ratio and solar irradiation time found to be negatively influencing both the responses the 3d model graph of toc removal as shown in fig 10 a indicates that maximum toc removal is achieved at the minimum setting of methanol tio2 ratio 15 1 and at the maximum setting of nitric acid tio2 ratio 6 1 this result validates the fact that the ph of the slurry prepared for nano coating has a significant influence on the adhesive strength between tio2 and borosilicate glass substrate 30 as the nitric acid tio2 ratio increases the slurry becomes more acidic and the ph of the suspension goes below the point of zero charge ph pzc of tio2 particles 6 the zero point charge of tio2 is in the range of 4 5 ph pzc 7 in basic solution the photocatalyst surface is negatively charged and when the ph is less than the lower limit of ph pzc it is charged positively the positive surface charge of tio2 under acidic ph enhances the electrostatic attraction between the two surfaces and result in strongly adhered and uniform nanocoating this in turn enhances the photocatalytic removal efficiency of toc and cod the peak region in cod removal in 3d plot as shown in fig 10b indicates that maximum organic degradation is achieved at 120 min which is at the minimum setting of solar irradiation time this finding validates the fact that treatment time depends on the initial concentration of organics and the solar irradiance in the region 4 the minimum photocatalytic treatment time is due to high solar insolation in the region which is in the order of 30 mj m2 day the lower irradiation time also accounts for the negative interaction effect among factor b nitric acid tio2 ratio and factor c solar irradiation time as presented in eq 13 and eq 14 respectively the photocatalytic reaction rate and hence the value of irradiation time for maximum degradation also depends on the seawater flow rate through the photo reactor for efficient photocatalysis to occur the pollutant the photocatalyst the irradiation oxidant highly active super oxide generated by the photo excited chargers and hydroxyl radicals must be in close proximity in a semiconductor photocatalytic reaction for water treatment the photo mineralization will not occur unless oxygen o2 is present in the system hence keeping sufficient oxygen concentration is vital 4 6 in the current study the supply of oxygen is ensured through the aeration process using an air pump air bubbling through a diffuser acts as a source of oxygen enhancing the overall degradation rate 22 moreover the presence of oxygen o2 in the photocatalytic system significantly acts as an oxidizing agent for the organics present in the aquatic environment 23 3 8 rsm optimization results of toc and cod removal the numerical optimization tool of design expert software v 11 has been used to determine the ideal factor settings for optimum toc and cod removal optimum conditions for maximum toc and cod removal efficiencies have been found as follows methanol tio 2 ratio 15 1 nitric acid tio 2 ratio 6 1 and solar irradiation time 120 min at this experimental setting optimum toc and cod removal have been predicted as 53 68 and 59 15 respectively additional experiments were performed to validate the predicted response values of toc and cod removal computed through numerical optimization the predicted results at the optimum setting correspond well with the experimental results toc removal 51 98 cod removal 57 25 the optimal results obtained from this study have been compared with the results of other research works 12 that used immobilized tio2 uv photocatalysis for seawater disinfection technology the tio2 thin films immobilized on substrates were reported 20 31 32 to be mechanically stable and repeatable in the organic pollutant degradation rubio et al 12 reported that even in the presence of a high amount of inorganic ions in seawater degradation with immobilized tio2 significantly improved uv254 treatment for a specified amount of reaction time verma et al 33 investigated the durability of immobilized tio2 catalyst for the degradation of herbicides and was observed as 92 cod removal by proving the permanence of the catalyst even after 30th reuse however long term treatment using thin film tio2 as catalyst undergoes a considerable diminishing in photocatalytic activity for contaminant degradation 12 the predicted toc and cod removal efficiencies and the results from validation experiments of the current study indicate that seawater organics can be effectively removed by adopting immobilized tio2 solar process for seawater reverse osmosis swro pretreatment process as a result the fouling can be effectively controlled to attain an enhanced membrane lifespan moreover solar photocatalytic organic degradation minimizes the pressure drop in ro modules increases permeate flux and mitigate irreversible damages to the ro membrane the scanning electron microscopy sem images indicate that the coating is uniform and stable after 180 min of solar irradiation the coating strategy implemented in the current study by immobilizing tio2 on the inner surface of the outer tube is efficient since falling light enhances the photocatalytic activity when it passes through the glass substrate instead of seawater this strategy improves photodegradation since it prevents scattering and attenuation of radiation by minute particles present in the water 34 however the rate of diminishing of photocatalytic efficiency still needs to be explored the organic degradation performance of immobilized tio2 photocatalytic reaction under renewable solar energy makes this method promising and worthy of being upscaled for commercialization 4 conclusion in the current study the performance of solar photocatalytic tubular reactors coated with tio2 thin film and tio2 suspension systems to pretreat ro feed seawater were investigated immobilization of tio2 catalyst on borosilicate glass tubes was performed using an in house built nanocoating machine in tio2 immobilized system design of experiments doe methodology was employed to screen the most significant factors that affect the final tio2 film performance the optimum degradation efficiency of toc and cod removal using an immobilized system were found to be 51 98 and 57 25 respectively at the following input settings methanol tio2 ratio 15 1 nitric acid tio2 ratio 6 1 and solar irradiation time 120 min in tio2 suspension system ann ga optimization produced maximum toc and cod removal 73 47 and 65 48 respectively at the operating conditions ph 6 reaction time 159 36 min tio2 dosage 0 51 g l initial toc 2 58 mg l and airflow rate 4 69 l min the statistical and machine learning metaheuristic optimization findings from this study demonstrate that membrane fouling organics can be effectively removed by adopting tio2 solar process for seawater reverse osmosis swro pretreatment the pretreatment process enhances the membrane life minimizes the pressure drop in ro modules increases permeate flux and mitigates irreversible damages to the ro membrane renewable solar energy combined with nano photocatalytic reactors running at optimized settings enables this method to be a promising pretreatment option for commercial scale ro pretreatment in desalination plants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

nitric acid tio2 ratio 6 1 and solar irradiation time 120 min the optimum organic degradation in suspension system was found to be toc removal 73 47 and cod removal 65 48 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords membrane fouling nanophotocatalysis seawater pretreatment tio2 immobilization 1 introduction pretreatment of seawater is crucial in desalination plants to avoid membrane fouling and concomitant operational overheads 1 biofouling occurring due to microorganisms is a complex process where the live foulants stick to the membrane surface and multiply many folds to produce polymeric materials 2 biofouling in reverse osmosis ro membranes results in increased osmotic pressure and low permeate flux 3 removal of organic contaminants from feedwater enables to enhance the performance of desalination operation in terms of energy saving and improved water quality parameters heterogeneous photocatalysis using semiconductors like tio2 can degrade the recalcitrant organics into smaller molecules 4 the hydroxyl radicals oh generated during the photocatalytic process are capable of mineralizing and oxidizing almost any type of organic molecule nano tio2 photocatalyst in slurry form is potentially suitable to degrade trace organic pollutants in contaminated water the slurry or suspension form of the reactor system excels in other photocatalytic systems in terms of effective mass transfer rate enhanced contact between catalyst and pollutants and uniform distribution of light as per the design the high surface to volume ratio of nanophotocatalysts like degussa p25 tio2 20 nm particle size in suspension mode facilitates more active sites for reaction and enable improved photocatalytic degradation 5 one of the drawbacks often highlighted with the slurry system is the difficulties associated with the post separation of suspended tio2 nanoparticles from treated water techniques such as coagulation changing ph to the point of zero charge phpzc for neutralizing surface charges and microfiltration facilitates complete recovery of nanoparticles but involve additional operational cost 6 the difficulties associated with post separation of photocatalysts can be eliminated by incorporating an immobilized system where the photocatalyst is coated over a substrate as a thin film 7 the immobilized photoreactor systems enable the reusability and recycling of the photocatalysts and avoid the energy intensive post separation issues due to these visible benefits there are numerous research studies conducted to immobilize tio2 on different substrates to produce mechanically robust coatings 8 9 many coating techniques and methodologies including atomic layer deposition sputtering vacuum arc plasma evaporation anodization electrochemical technique sol gel method have been implemented for the efficient immobilization of photocatalysts on various substrates 10 materials such as ceramic beads activated carbon and zeolites are less efficient compared to borosilicate glass as substrates due to limitations in uv visible light transmission capability which is crucial for photocatalytic degradation hence in this research work the immobilized photocatalytic reactor system is designed for incorporating borosilicate glass tubes that were internally coated with tio2 nanoparticles the utilization of tio2 immobilized system can reduce the overall cost incurred and significantly simplify the photocatalytic process 11 previous seawater disinfection studies 12 reported the performance of immobilized tio2 uv for mineralizing the organic pollutants where the advanced oxidation process aop treatment had faster disinfection kinetics tio2 photocatalytic process under solar uv irradiation is a promising aop for the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants from the contaminated water 13 solar immobilized tio2 photocatalytic reactors are extensively used for the degradation of organic pollutants from industrial effluents 14 however the solar tio2 process has barely been documented as a pretreatment method for seawater treatment or predominantly as a promising membrane fouling control tool in the different treatment environment as per the understanding of the present research team no optimization study specifically on immobilized tio2 solar for removal of organics from seawater has been conducted so far in the current study two different photocatalytic degradation methods namely tio2 immobilized and tio2 in suspension are implemented to model and optimize the removal of organics from seawater figs 1 a b show a schematic

photocatalytic process this work has reported for the first time immobilization of tio2 catalyst thin film on concentric borosilicate glass tubes using an in house built nanocoating machine for photocatalytic ro pretreatment of seawater under natural solar irradiation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and seawater characterization titanium dioxide aeroxide p25 with a specific surface area of 60 m2 g bet was obtained from evonik industries germany the seawater sample used in this study was collected from muscat gulf of oman approximately 2 km away from the shore a nearby ro desalination plant uses the seawater from the same area and the toc content fluctuates from 2 mg l to 4 mg l and sometimes goes higher up to 7 6 mg l during algal bloom or pollution or other events the seawater samples were characterized as per standard protocols followed for estimating parameters of highly saline samples 16 17 cod test was conducted by using cod kit k 7371s hr mercury free 0 15

preparation analytical grade of methanol and nitric acid were obtained from merck company usa 2 2 tio2 suspension system using a recirculation batch reactor the experimental setup fig 2 which consists of two concentric annular flow borosilicate glass tubes was used for both suspension and immobilized photocatalytic organic degradation of ro feed seawater in both tio2 suspension and tio2 immobilized system an aeration pump was incorporated to supply the sufficient amount of oxygen required for photocatalytic degradation of seawater organics for tio2 suspension system in bbd rsm modelling ph of seawater reaction time tio2 dosage initial toc of seawater and airflow rate were selected as input factors and the coded low 1 and high 1 levels were fixed at 4 and 8 90 and 180 min 0 3 and 0 7 g l 2 and 7 mg l and 3 and 5 l min respectively forty six experimental trials were conducted by considering total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod as response variables seawater was circulated upward into the photocatalytic reactor through the inner tube first and then flows downward through the annular space between the concentric glass tubes as shown in fig 2 the suction valve of the peristaltic pump was connected at the bottom surface of the annular space and the discharge was connected to the inner tube hence a continuous recirculation flow was maintained which is essential in a photocatalytic suspension system in order to prevent the settling of tio2 nanoparticles irradiation of tio2 surface with solar uv radiation of intensity equal to or greater than the bandgap energy leads to the generation of electron hole pairs the electron photo excited to the conduction band is a potent reducing agent while the hole that exists in the valence band performs as a strong oxidizing agent the holes undergo an oxidation reaction with h2o or oh and thus generate hydroxyl radicals oh these hydroxyl radicals are majorly responsible for the degradation of organic compounds the major reaction mechanism of solar tio2 photocatalytic process 18 is shown in eqs 1 7 1 ti o 2 hυ ti o 2 e cb h vb 2 ti o 2 h vb h 2 o ti o 2 h oh 3 ti o 2 h vb oh ti o 2 oh 4 ti o 2 e cb

and design of experiments doe for tio2 immobilization system in the immobilized system fig 2 the borosilicate glass tubes were replaced with tio2 thin film coated glass tubes outer tube internally coated and the inner smaller tube is coated in internal and external annular surfaces the inner tube is primarily used to maintain the recirculation flow so that very effective contact between solar radiation pollutant catalyst is achieved which is essential for optimum contaminant degradation initially the reactor is filled with seawater up to little below the tip of the inner tube when the peristaltic pump is started the seawater is drawn from the bottom annular space of the reactor and flows upward through the inner tube and comes out at the top the inner and outer surface of the inner tube is coated to enable supplementary photocatalytic reaction due to penetrated light the efficiency of tio2 thin film coated on borosilicate glass tubes were assessed in terms of percentage degradation of toc and cod from seawater under solar irradiation since the coating of tio2 thin film on glass tubes involves numerous steps and many factors influence the final performance the design of experiments doe method was implemented to assess the optimal conditions placket burman experimental design was used to screen vital few factors from trivial many this type of design is advantageous when there is inadequate information available about the process variables and behaviour 19 plackett burman designs are a class of screening designs that are orthogonal for main effects only the input factors that might influence the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 thin film and the parametric ranges are shown in table 1 the slurry preparation and tio2 nanocoating process on borosilicate glass tubes was conducted as per the settings of each input factors based on the placket burman experimental design matrix in the initial screening study as per placket burman input settings eight experimental runs were conducted to assess the tio2 thin film efficiency in terms of percentage degradation of toc and cod from ro feed seawater 2 4 experimental setup and tio2 immobilization procedure the nanocoating process of glass tubes for the solar photocatalytic reactor was performed according to the methods followed by previous researchers 20 the slurry required for thin film coating purpose was prepared by mixing 3 g of tio2 with 45 ml or 75 ml of methanol as per the ratios 15 1 or 25 1 defined in table 1 the mixture was sonicated for 10 or 20 min as per placket burman input settings to attain a uniform dispersion of tio2 particles in the suspension in order to change the ph to an acidic range and to enhance the adhesion between the substrate and tio2 dilute nitric acid 0 1 n was added to the suspension the ratio of nitric acid tio2 ratio was varied from 3 1 to 6 1 in order to study the effect of ph on coating efficiency it was anticipated that increased electrostatic attraction between the surfaces results in enhancing the adhesion 21 the slurry was stirred vigorously to prevent tio2 particle agglomeration and ensure its complete dispersion the stirring process was continued until the completion of the coating step to avoid any possible aggregation and sedimentation an automated nanocoating machine fig 3 was built in house for the immobilization of tio2 films on the annular surfaces of borosilicate glass tubes the wall coating of glass tubes was performed using the automated coating machine the tubes uniformly fed with the desired amount of slurry were made to rotate using dongchuan make 90 w single phase asynchronous variable speed electric motor an electric hot air portable heat gun 2000 w konsun make was used for keeping the nanocoating chamber warm and moisture free the angular speed of the glass tubes was varied gradually until uniform coating was achieved the coated tubes were then dried either at room temperature or by using the oven and calcined as per the temperature levels specified in the experimental design the coating process was repeated 2 or 4 times as per the low and high settings as given in table 1 the selected diameter of the borosilicate glass tubes which will be used in the tio2 immobilized reactor matched with a previous study 4 where the suggested ideal diameter of photoreactor for tio2 solar treatment was in the range of 25 60 mm the final photoreactor was designed with two concentric glass tubes 25 mm inner diameter 400 mm length and 1 2 mm wall thickness for inner tube 60 mm inner diameter 500 mm length and 1 5 mm wall thickness for outer tube as shown in fig 2 for seawater recirculation a peristaltic pump percom nm ii peristaltic pump 0 350 rpm 0 2100 ml min 48 w was used in both tio2 suspension and tio2 immobilization studies an aeration pump was used to supply a sufficient source of oxygen for the tio2 immobilization system in both placket burman and full factorial experiments the airflow using an air pump and the seawater recirculation using a peristaltic pump was maintained at 4 0 l min and 0 85 l min respectively air bubbling acted as a source of oxygen enhancing the overall organic degradation rate 22 moreover the presence of oxygen o2 in the photocatalytic system significantly acted as an oxidizing agent for the organics present in the aquatic environment 23 2 5 experimentation to remove toc and cod from seawater using tio2 thin film solar photocatalytic reactor in the preliminary study the efficiency of tio2 thin film was quantified in terms of percentage removal of toc and cod in seawater samples under solar irradiation plackett burman statistical design with the following linear regression model was adopted for screening the factors that affect tio2 thin film efficiency eq 8 8 y a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a 3 x 3 a 4 x 4 a 5 x 5 a 6 x 6 a 7 x 7 where y is the response toc and cod percentage removals a 0 is the mean response and a i i 1 to 7 is the main effect of input factors toc and cod percentage removals were calculated using eq 9 and eq 10 respectively 9 toc percentage removal toc initial toc after time t toc initial 100 where toc initial is the initial toc of seawater before photocatalytic treatment and toc after time t represents the total organic carbon content after t minute of solar irradiation 10 cod percentage removal cod initial cod after time t cod initial 100 where cod initial is the initial cod of seawater before photocatalytic treatment and cod after time t represents the chemical oxygen demand after t minute of solar irradiation for initial screening of vital input factors as per the placket burman design matrix eight experimental runs were conducted and assessed the tio2 thin film efficiency in terms of percentage removal of toc and cod from seawater the seawater was circulated through tubular reactors by using a peristaltic pump in all the experimental runs the flow rate of seawater was maintained at 0 85 l min the flow rate was set to a minimum to prevent any shear load on the film and thereby mitigate the chances of delamination each of the runs was conducted for a solar irradiation time of 150 min as recommended in a previous research study 21 2 6 full factorial design with significant factors while plackett burman design is used for filtering vital few factors from trivial many a full factorial design provides more insight into the process variations in the full factorial design with 11 experimental runs tio2 film efficiency was assessed in terms of methanol tio2 ratio nitric acid tio2 ratio and solar irradiation time the coded low level 1 and high level 1 for solar irradiation time were set as 120 min and 180 min respectively while the other two factors assigned with the same ranges as used in the plackett burman design 2 7 sem study of tio2 nanocoating the surface characteristics of the internal coating were determined through scanning electron microscopy sem using a field emission scanning electron microscope sem jeol jsm 7600f the morphology of the tio2 films prepared under different calcination temperature and varied number of coatings were analyzed investigation about the microstructure of the thin film was conducted before and after photocatalytic treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of seawater

models obtained from bbd rsm captured at the optimum settings of other input factors the quadratic variation of toc removal in fig 4a indicates the interactive relation between the input factors ph and reaction time the colour coded red region of the peak indicates that optimum toc removal 70 85 was achieved at the settings ph 6 12 and reaction time rt of 147 54 min the dome shaped surface for cod removal in fig 4b demonstrates the strong synergistic interaction effect between airflow and reaction time on overall organic degradation similar interactive results obtained in a previous study 23 where the toc and cod in petroleum refinery wastewater were photo degraded using tio2 zno photocatalysis the optimum organic degradation efficiency along with optimum settings of input factors from the bbd rsm modelling optimization study is given in table 4 3 3 ann ga modelling and optimization of tio2 suspension system the performance of the tio2 suspension system for photocatalytic organic degradation of seawater is analyzed using ann ga modelling and optimization paradigm the experimental results obtained from bbd is used to create artificial neural network ann models for both toc and cod responses ann is a machine learning algorithm based on the simulation of a human neuron network that can map the input to output relationship in a complex multivariate design space the topology of the ann model with five input neurons and output neurons toc cod along with the optimum number of hidden layer neurons is demonstrated in fig 5 fig 6 a illustrates the mean square error mse versus iteration plot of ann for training and validation performance of cod removal modelling the close matching between true values and predicted values for toc removal as shown in fig 6b represents that ann effectively approximates the mapping between the response and five input factors both ann models developed for toc and cod removal were employed in an optimization procedure using genetic algorithm ga program codes using matlab version 2017b software a multi objective genetic algorithm moga is an evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm that mimics the natural evolutionary process in nature 24 through successive iterations generations moga generates a set of solutions known as pareto optimal front ga starts with an initial set of solutions known as a population which consists of chromosomes and genes or input variables the toc and cod models developed through ann modelling are used as fitness functions to maximize the response values fig 7 demonstrates the pareto optimal front which gives a set of non dominated feasible solutions that dominates other individuals in the population among this one solution toc removal 75 18 cod removal 67 23 at optimum settings ph 6 reaction time 159 36 min tio2 dosage 0 51 g l initial toc 2 58 mg l airflow rate 4 69 l min is selected for validation the validation results toc removal 73 47 cod removal 65 48 are found to be in good agreement with the predicted results 3 4 sem study of tio2 nanocoating the morphology and surface texture of the internal coating of the outer tube was determined through scanning electron microscopy fig 8 a d the sem images of tio2 thin film prepared at different settings indicate that uniform coating over the substrate is achieved and coating remains stable after 180 min of solar photocatalytic treatment the morphology of the double coated film fig 8a shows micro cracks due to insufficient coating it can be observed that when the coating is made four times fig 8b c the tio2 thin film surface has become smoother due to particle agglomeration resulting in the small porous structure these microstructures are similar to the result reported in the literature 25 where agglomeration was caused due to uniform coating methodology and the spherical dimension of tio2 particles fig 8d shows the morphology of the thin film after photocatalytic treatment for 180 min which was prepared at a calcination temperature of 350 c and was coated four times it was noticed that the film was stable and adhered to the surface without any detachment and mass reduction in the literature 20 a tio2 thin film prepared under similar conditions and immobilized to glass surface was reported as stable with good adhesiveness despite its reuse even after 12 photocatalytic reaction cycles also a band gap of 2 96 ev that leads to efficient solar photocatalysis was reported in a previous study 8 with similar coating strategy 3 5 results of placket burman screening design the orthogonal experimental matrix of the eight runs as per the placket burman experimental design matrix along with toc and cod removals are shown in table 5 the final equations obtained in terms of coded factors for toc and cod removals are shown in eq 11 and eq 12 respectively 11 toc removal 32 44 8 66 x 1 7 97 x 2 6 34 x 3 0 835 x 4 0 717 x 5 0 84 x 6 4 56 x 7 12 cod removal 35 63 10 33 x 1 8 13 x 2 6 10 x 3 1 98 x 4 1 49 x 5 1 21 x 6 4 6 x 7 the coded equations are used for detecting the relative effect of input factors by comparing their coefficients from eq 11 and eq 12 the coefficients of factors x 1 methanol tio2 ratio and x 2 nitric acid tio2 ratio are found to be high compared to other factors hence these two factors significantly affect the efficiency of tio2 thin film and have been selected as input factors for full factorial study the negative coefficient of factor x 3 calcination temperature in eq 11 and eq 12 indicates its negative influence on toc and cod removal efficiencies similar results 26 were obtained in a study that demonstrated the efficiency of immobilized tio2 film for degradation of green and low cost tetracycline the high positive coefficient of factor x 7 calcination time indicates that for maximum toc and cod removal the time required for calcination required to be set at a higher value 120 min hence in the present research work for the second stage full factorial design the calcination temperature was set at its lower limit 350 c and the time required for calcination was set at its higher value since the coefficient of factor x 4 is positive in both cod and toc removal equations four numbers of coatings were made for all borosilicate glass tubes moreover the xrd analysis of tio2 coating in a previous study 20 revealed enhanced crystallinity of the thin film with increasing coating thickness also it was reported that the crystalline structure was preserved despite several multilayer calcination procedures other factors in this study were ignored and could be set at any level due to lower values of coefficients and hence negligible influence on tio2 thin film efficiency 3 6 two level full factorial design the experimental values and predicted values of toc and cod responses obtained from the full factorial design are shown in table 6 in full factorial input settings the average of low and high levels coded middle level 0 are also included with repetition to assess random process variation pure error and to have more insight into the process behaviour doe full factorial design enables determining the main effects and two factor interactions between the input parameters 27 in the present study the experimental runs consist of eight factorial points and three centre points coded as zero at the centre of the experimental design space centre points are useful to determine the curvature effect and pure error occurring due to replication if the curvature effects are significant the design should be augmented with axial runs to quantify the quadratic effect of the variables analysis of variance anova results suggest that the curvature effect is insignificant and the full factorial empirical model is sufficient to describe the process variations the anova results obtained for toc and cod models are shown in table 7 and table 8 respectively the toc model f value of 35 67 indicates that the model is statistically significant the p value of 0 0006 indicates that only a 0 06 chance that an f value of this large could occur due to noise the p values less than 0 05 shows that model terms b c ab and bc are significant the p value more than 0 10 indicate that model terms are insignificant in this case factor a has p value higher than 0 10 but is included in the model to support ab interaction hierarchy lack of fit f value of 5 98 signifies that lack of fit of the model is not significant compared to the pure error an insignificant lack of fit indicates that the model is well fit to the experimental data points similarly from the anova results obtained for the cod model table 8 all the three main factors a b and c and interaction effects of ab and bc are found to be statistically significant 3 7 interaction and 3 d surface plot to examine the effect of input factors on toc and cod removal the final equations for toc and cod removal in terms of coded factors a methanol tio 2 ratio b nitric acid tio 2 ratio and c solar irradiation time are given in eq 13 and eq 14 respectively 13 toc removal 31 91 1 69 a 7 31 b 5 06 c 3 56 a b 5 81 b c 14 cod removal 36 67 2 41 a 7 88 b 6 26 c 3 70 a b 5 15 b c the relative weight of coefficients in eq 13 and eq 14 indicate that the main effects of factor a methanol tio2 ratio and factor b nitric acid tio2 ratio are positive whereas the main effect of factor c solar irradiation time is negative in the present study factor b has a more prominent effect than factors a and c the results are in agreement with a similar study 28 conducted using immobilized tio2 film for acid dye degradation when main effects are considered it is optimal to keep a and b at their high 1 levels and keep c at its low 1 level to maximize toc and cod removal efficiencies in photocatalytic processes like seawater organics degradation it is important to analyze any possible interaction that is statistically significant very often interaction terms are more significant than the main effects interaction happens when the output response behaves differently depending on the settings of two factors 29 two non parallel lines in the interaction graph indicate that the effect of one factor is depended on the level of the other fig 9 a and fig 9b show the graphical presentation of the statistical evaluation of two factor interaction on toc and cod removal efficiencies respectively in fig 9a the effect of nitric acid tio2 ratio on toc removal efficiency depends on the solar irradiation time setting similarly for the interaction graph for cod removal in fig 9b the effect of solar irradiation time depends on whether the nitric acid tio2 ratio is at a higher setting line with triangle endpoints or the lower setting bold line with square endpoints among two factor interaction effects bc interaction is more significant than other terms in the model this finding validates the fact that in the slurry preparation process acidification using nitric acid enables uniform dispersion that is directly affecting the final tio2 film performance 20 however the interaction between nitric acid tio2 ratio and solar irradiation time found to be negatively influencing both the responses the 3d model graph of toc removal as shown in fig 10 a indicates that maximum toc removal is achieved at the minimum setting of methanol tio2 ratio 15 1 and at the maximum setting of nitric acid tio2 ratio 6 1 this result validates the fact that the ph of the slurry prepared for nano coating has a significant influence on the adhesive strength between tio2 and borosilicate glass substrate 30 as the nitric acid tio2 ratio increases the slurry becomes more acidic and the ph of the suspension goes below the point of zero charge ph pzc of tio2 particles 6 the zero point charge of tio2 is in the range of 4 5 ph pzc 7 in basic solution the photocatalyst surface is negatively charged and when the ph is less than the lower limit of ph pzc it is charged positively the positive surface charge of tio2 under acidic ph enhances the electrostatic attraction between the two surfaces and result in strongly adhered and uniform nanocoating this in turn enhances the photocatalytic removal efficiency of toc and cod the peak region in cod removal in 3d plot as shown in fig 10b indicates that maximum organic degradation is achieved at 120 min which is at the minimum setting of solar irradiation time this finding validates the fact that treatment time depends on the initial concentration of organics and the solar irradiance in the region 4 the minimum photocatalytic treatment time is due to high solar insolation in the region which is in the order of 30 mj m2 day the lower irradiation time also accounts for the negative interaction effect among factor b nitric acid tio2 ratio and factor c solar irradiation time as presented in eq 13 and eq 14 respectively the photocatalytic reaction rate and hence the value of irradiation time for maximum degradation also depends on the seawater flow rate through the photo reactor for efficient photocatalysis to occur the pollutant the photocatalyst the irradiation oxidant highly active super oxide generated by the photo excited chargers and hydroxyl radicals must be in close proximity in a semiconductor photocatalytic reaction for water treatment the photo mineralization will not occur unless oxygen o2 is present in the system hence keeping sufficient oxygen concentration is vital 4 6 in the current study the supply of oxygen is ensured through the aeration process using an air pump air bubbling through a diffuser acts as a source of oxygen enhancing the overall degradation rate 22 moreover the presence of oxygen o2 in the photocatalytic system significantly acts as an oxidizing agent for the organics present in the aquatic environment 23 3 8 rsm optimization results of toc and cod removal the numerical optimization tool of design expert software v 11 has been used to determine the ideal factor settings for optimum toc and cod removal optimum conditions for maximum toc and cod removal efficiencies have been found as follows methanol tio 2 ratio 15 1 nitric acid tio 2 ratio 6 1 and solar irradiation time 120 min at this experimental setting optimum toc and cod removal have been predicted as 53 68 and 59 15 respectively additional experiments were performed to validate the predicted response values of toc and cod removal computed through numerical optimization the predicted results at the optimum setting correspond well with the experimental results toc removal 51 98 cod removal 57 25 the optimal results obtained from this study have been compared with the results of other research works 12 that used immobilized tio2 uv photocatalysis for seawater disinfection technology the tio2 thin films immobilized on substrates were reported 20 31 32 to be mechanically stable and repeatable in the organic pollutant degradation rubio et al 12 reported that even in the presence of a high amount of inorganic ions in seawater degradation with immobilized tio2 significantly improved uv254 treatment for a specified amount of reaction time verma et al 33 investigated the durability of immobilized tio2 catalyst for the degradation of herbicides and was observed as 92 cod removal by proving the permanence of the catalyst even after 30th reuse however long term treatment using thin film tio2 as catalyst undergoes a considerable diminishing in photocatalytic activity for contaminant degradation 12 the predicted toc and cod removal efficiencies and the results from validation experiments of the current study indicate that seawater organics can be effectively removed by adopting immobilized tio2 solar process for seawater reverse osmosis swro pretreatment process as a result the fouling can be effectively controlled to attain an enhanced membrane lifespan moreover solar photocatalytic organic degradation minimizes the pressure drop in ro modules increases permeate flux and mitigate irreversible damages to the ro membrane the scanning electron microscopy sem images indicate that the coating is uniform and stable after 180 min of solar irradiation the coating strategy implemented in the current study by immobilizing tio2 on the inner surface of the outer tube is efficient since falling light enhances the photocatalytic activity when it passes through the glass substrate instead of seawater this strategy improves photodegradation since it prevents scattering and attenuation of radiation by minute particles present in the water 34 however the rate of diminishing of photocatalytic efficiency still needs to be explored the organic degradation performance of immobilized tio2 photocatalytic reaction under renewable solar energy makes this method promising and worthy of being upscaled for commercialization 4 conclusion in the current study the performance of solar photocatalytic tubular reactors coated with tio2 thin film and tio2 suspension systems to pretreat ro feed seawater were investigated immobilization of tio2 catalyst on borosilicate glass tubes was performed using an in house built nanocoating machine in tio2 immobilized system design of experiments doe methodology was employed to screen the most significant factors that affect the final tio2 film performance the optimum degradation efficiency of toc and cod removal using an immobilized system were found to be 51 98 and 57 25 respectively at the following input settings methanol tio2 ratio 15 1 nitric acid tio2 ratio 6 1 and solar irradiation time 120 min in tio2 suspension system ann ga optimization produced maximum toc and cod removal 73 47 and 65 48 respectively at the operating conditions ph 6 reaction time 159 36 min tio2 dosage 0 51 g l initial toc 2 58 mg l and airflow rate 4 69 l min the statistical and machine learning metaheuristic optimization findings from this study demonstrate that membrane fouling organics can be effectively removed by adopting tio2 solar process for seawater reverse osmosis swro pretreatment the pretreatment process enhances the membrane life minimizes the pressure drop in ro modules increases permeate flux and mitigates irreversible damages to the ro membrane renewable solar energy combined with nano photocatalytic reactors running at optimized settings enables this method to be a promising pretreatment option for commercial scale ro pretreatment in desalination plants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

adsorbents reached the equilibrium within 10 min and the equilibrium attainment data were well described by the intraparticular diffusion model r2 0 96 the phosphate monolayer adsorption was followed by diffusion through the internal clay pores the phosphate adsorption by clays in presence of competing ion was inhibited by the higher ionic charge of sulphate besides the less hydrated chloride and bicarbonate anions promoted the reduction of the sorption capacity of phosphate finally the reusability of iron doped clays is limited therefore saturated iron doped clays as single use adsorbents can be disposed for soil amendment applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords iron hydroxides phosphate recovery low cost sorbent sustainable use of resources 1 introduction sources of natural phosphorous sources are limited worldwide and their high demand predicts a shortage in the coming years at the industrial level phosphorus is used for the manufacture of fertilisers as well as other applications such as cleaning products food and beverages and metallurgy the phosphorus from detergents and household wastes is the largest inorganic source of phosphate phosphorous forms in natural water bodies and in domestic wastewater anthropogenic phosphorus from agricultural runoff farming waste industrial and domestic sewage is discharge into the aquatic bodies and is then responsible for eutrophication 1 furthermore the massive increase in the use of cleaning products due to the pandemic makes the short term eutrophication scenario even worse a recent study on phosphorus flow analysis demonstrated that wastewater treatment plants wwtp are considered as the most important secondary source of phosphorus more than 40 2 therefore the removal of phosphate from wastewater containing nutrients is important to conserve the natural aquatic environment 3 and even more important is the recovery of phosphorous from wwtp its recovery would also reduce the dependence on external supplies of phosphate rock by recovering it within the phosphorous cycle several processes such as precipitation with fe iii salts and crystallisation as struvite with mg ii salts from the richest streams e g sewage sludge anaerobic digestion side streams are used for this purpose 4 however the high operating costs limit the large deployment of these technologies in medium and small sized wwtps 5 the low levels of phosphate in wastewater according to the current regulatory framework make current technological solutions too expensive so it is necessary to propose effective and low cost technological strategies ion exchange and adsorption are postulated as viable option to recover phosphate forms from both the total phosphorous richest side streams and more diluted main streams with total phosphorous levels below 5 mg l p 16 mg l p po4 3 the use of several polymeric anion exchangers resins have been reported to be excellent phosphate adsorbents due to its selectivity and sensitivity 6 in streams with low content of dissolved organic matter accordingly low cost and environmentally friendly materials are nowadays preferred for the phosphate recovery from wastewater such as zeolites clinoptilolite 7 attapulgite 8 industrial wastes e g fly ash blast furnace slag organic inorganic hybrid adsorbents 9 and clays e g bentonites allophane nanoclay 10 clay exhibits a net negative charge which gives them an important cation adsorption and cation exchange properties the clay structure and the ph of the aqueous phase determine the development of adsorption and exchange properties of the clays the use of clays in environmental applications has been reported for the adsorption of toxic pollutants transition metals organic micro pollutants e g biocides and dyes from wastewater however the affinity of clays for phosphate adsorption is very low the use of hybrid selective phosphate adsorbents such as clays modified by physical and chemical methods is proposed to increase their affinity for oxyanions such as arsenate selenite and phosphate 11 the modification protocols based on iron oxide constructed nanomaterials have reported high stability and potential application 12 besides other metal ions as zirconium iv loaded fibrous adsorbent have been reported as efficient phosphate adsorbent 3 exceptionally allophane is a clay type with several environmental applications due to its interaction with toxic anions the small particle size high surface area and aluminol groups at the surface allow a high retention capacity for anions 13 the development of low cost material is proposed as a single use adsorbent assimilating it as a chemical for example as coagulant that could be dosed in the sedimentation or filtration stages in the wwtp the levels of total phosphorous could reach values from 5 to 15 mg l p or 50 to 250 mg l p at main and side streams respectively 14 in the case of countries where more than 80 of the sludge is disposed or applied in agriculture or for soil improvement such mixtures will improve their fertilising value 15 since phosphate loaded fe adsorbents could function as slow release fertilisers where the inorganic phosphate could be released under the controlled root mechanism 16 to the best of our knowledge several modified clays have been developed for phosphate removal but we have not found no previous studies that report detailed experimental information about iron doped clays for phosphate adsorption the literature review provided of the field indicated that adsorbents rarely develop high phosphate adsorption in neutral ph range 17 the ph is a critical operational parameter because in a full scale application the treated wastewater is usually at neutral ph e g 6 to 8 5 therefore it will not require ph adjustment in this study iron doped clays are prepared with the ability to recover phosphate efficiently at neutral ph range values this work describes the preparation of the iron doping stage and in batch experimental set up the effectiveness and selectivity were evaluated the specific objectives were i to investigate the iron doping onto raw clays to remove phosphate at neutral ph range ii to investigate the iron doping onto raw clays to recover phosphate at neutral values iii to study the effect of initial phosphate concentration to determine the clay adsorbent capacity iv to study the phosphate adsorption kinetics v to determine the selectivity of clay adsorbents for phosphate adsorption over competing ions and vi to evaluate the regeneration of clays after phosphate adsorption or their potential application as single use adsorbent 2 materials and methods 2 1 clay adsorbent preparation the raw clay samples were obtained from the san cayetano formation c1 sample 3 56 41 64 s 79 12 29 16 w c1 sample and from the zalapa formation c2 sample 3 53 51 72 s 79 15 24 12 w c2 sample from ecuador the raw clays were located in the loja miocene sedimentary basin located at the central andes cordillera in southern ecuador the raw clays in bulk were crushed and washed with deionised water and subsequently dried in an oven at 80 c for 24 h the raw clays were dry sieved to obtain homogeneous adsorbent particle sizes particles below 200 μm mesh were used for the experiments furthermore to prepare the iron doped clay forms c1 fe and c2 fe the clay samples were treated with 0 5 m of feso4 solution a mass volume ratio of 25 g 250 ml of clay sample and iron sulphate solution respectively was used the mixture was stirred under reflux conditions at 95 2 c for 4 h the ph 7 of the mixture was maintained by the constant addition of a 0 1 m naoh solution then the treated clays were recovered from the mixture the iron doping procedure was repeated twice under the same conditions finally the resulting iron doped clays were repeatedly washed and centrifugated with deionised water until not chloride ion was detected in the discharge the resulting material was vacuum filtered and dried in an oven at 90 c for 24 h the c1 fe and c2 fe doped clay samples were stored in a desiccator for further characterization and for adsorption experiments 2 2 clays physicochemical characterization the sample structures were characterised by a powder x ray diffractometer x ray diffraction xrd patterns were acquired on a powder x ray diffractometer d8 advance a25 bruker with a cu kα anode λ 0 1542 nm operating at 40 kv and 40 ma the diffraction patterns were collected at 25 c and over an angular range from 4 to 60 of 2θ by a fast lineal lynxeyexe detector nitrogen gas adsorption method was used to determine the specific surface area of the adsorbents with an automatic adsorption analyser using the multipoint brunauer emmett teller bet method the morphology of clay samples was studied by a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem in addition a wavelength dispersive x ray fluorescence spectrometer bruker s1 turbo sd le mining calibrations was used to determine the composition of the sample the infrared absorption spectra were recorded with a fourier transform ftir spectrometer in the range of 4000 550 cm 1 kbr was used to prepare a table sample and the spectra were obtained by collecting 32 scans using a 4 cm 1 resolution clay adsorbents were equilibrated with solutions at different ionic strengths to determine the point of zero charge pzc by the ph drift method in the range of ph 3 10 as described in a previous work 18 the test was replicated four times for each sample and the average data is reported 2 3 phosphate batch adsorption studies the phosphate adsorption by raw and iron doped clays was evaluated under optimal conditions obtained in our previous works and which are summarized in table 1 the phosphate solutions used in the adsorption tests were prepared by dissolving nah2po4 2h2o stock solution 1000 mg l in deionised water the ph of the phosphate solutions used in the adsorption test were adjusted using 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh after phosphate solution clay adsorbent system was equilibrated it was centrifuged at 5000 rpm and the supernatant filtered 0 45 μm before analysis the ph of the initial and final solution was measured using a combined glass electrode crison at room temperature 22 2 c in the phosphate solution the ph values were adjusted with an accuracy greater than 0 02 units the potentiometer calibration was carried out with standard buffer solutions of ph 2 ph 4 and ph 7 the concentration of the initial and equilibrated phosphate solutions were measured using the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater a calibration curve was prepared from the phosphate stock solution by using the vanadomolybdophosphoric acid colourimetric method 4500 p c 19 using a wavelength 470 nm cation and anion concentrations including iron ion were determined using a thermo scientific ionic chromatograph dionex ics 1100 and ics 1000 the tests were performed in batch by triplicate and the average values are reported the equilibrium adsorption capacity was calculated by eq 1 1 q e v c o c e w where qe was the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g po4 3 v was the volume of phosphate solution l c0 and ce were the initial and equilibrium concentration of the phosphate solution mg l po4 3 and w was the mass of the clay material g 2 3 1 phosphate adsorption as a function of ph the influence of ph on phosphate adsorption by clay adsorbents was evaluated using phosphate solutions at initial ph values between 3 and 10 2 3 2 equilibrium adsorption capacity the sorption capacity of clays adsorbents was determined using a wide range of initial concentrations 10 2000 mg l po4 3 at ph 7 ph was used adjusted according to the expected treated wastewater conditions the weighted amounts of raw and modified clays were equilibrated by mixing with the phosphate solution in a rotatory stirrer the equilibrium adsorption isotherms were fitted to the linearised langmuir eq 2 and freundlich eq 3 equations 2 c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m 3 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where q m is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g po4 3 k l langmuir adsorption constant l mg k f mg g and n were freundlich constant the separation factor rl was a dimensionless constant that explains the langmuir isotherm shape the favourability of the adsorption process is defined when 0 rl 1 and can be calculated by eq 4 4 r l 1 1 k l c 0 2 3 3 effect of competing ions the clay samples were equilibrated in solutions containing a binary combination of phosphate and the coexisting anions e g nitrate bicarbonate chloride and sulphate at equal concentration level in addition the phosphate adsorption phosphate was evaluated considering a combination of all competing anions at same concentration level 2 3 4 kinetic of phosphate adsorption the kinetic behaviour of phosphate adsorption by clay adsorbents were evaluated using two liquid adsorbent dosages samples 5 ml were withdrawn at given times for determining the phosphate concentrations in solution the phosphate adsorption capacity as a function of time was calculated by eq 5 5 q t v c o c t w where qt was the adsorption capacity as a function of time mg g po4 3 v is the volume of phosphate solution l c0 and ct were the initial and concentration of the phosphate solution at specific time mg l po4 3 and w was the mass of the clay material g the experimental kinetic data were fitted to the homogeneous diffusion model hdm and the shell progressive model spm in order to describe the phosphate recovery by clay adsorbent materials the hdm model considered the clay as a quasi homogeneous media and the adsorption diffusion rate is a controlling step on the spherical particles defined by eqs 6 and 7 20 i particle diffusion dp m2 s controls the adsorption rate it is described by eq 6 6 ln 1 x t 2 k p t 2 π 2 d p r 2 t ii liquid film diffusion df m2 s controls the adsorption rate it is described by eq 7 7 ln 1 x t k f t d f c h r c r t where x t was the fractional attainment of adsorption equilibrium between the solid and liquid phase qt qe at time t c and cr mg l were the concentrations of solute in a solution and the adsorbent phase respectively t was the contact time min r is the average radius of clay particles particles below 200 mesh particles diameter 7 4 10 5 m or particles radius 3 7 10 5 m and h was the thickness of film around the clay particle 1 10 5 m for a poorly stirred solution 21 in the spm as the porosity of the clay could be considered small and thus practically impervious to the aqueous solution the phosphate adsorption process is described by a concentration profile of the solution containing phosphate ions going forward into a spherical partially saturated clay particle 20 the adsorption rate controlling steps on the clay particles were defined by a it was controlled by the fluid film kf m s described by eq 8 8 x t 3 c s 0 k f a s r

respectively mg l 2 3 5 phosphate desorption the raw and doped clay samples were equilibrated with 100 mg l po4 3 solution the solid samples were separated from the aqueous phase for further tests therefore the loaded clay samples were further equilibrated in closed containers using deionised water at ph 3 6 and 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 clay and fe doped clay characterization the x ray diffraction patterns of raw and iron doped clays c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe are depicted in fig 1 the xrd patterns of raw and iron doped clays at lower angles 4 10 and at wide angles 10 60 are represented the analysis indicated that the c1 raw clay was a heterogeneous clay material composed of 65 9 montmorillonite mt na ca 0 3 al mg 2si4o10 oh 2 18 5 anorthite at caal2si2o8 and 15 6 quartz qt sio2 the analysis of c2 raw clay determined that it was also a heterogeneous clay composed of 25 4 dickite dt al2si2o5 oh 4 51 9 illite it k h3o al mg fe 2 si al 4o10 oh 2 h2o and 22 8 quartz qt sio2 the diffraction patterns of the doped clays did not exhibit the formation of a new crystalline mineralogical phases after iron doping a decrease of the peak intensities was observed for both iron doped clays in comparison to parent clays this effect has been attributed to the lower crystallinity of clays due to the presence of fe iii ions 22 the basal space d001 plane was calculated as 15 å for the raw c1 clay at 2θ 5 9 which was comparable to the d001 value of the montmorillonite pattern montmorillonite is a 2 1 layer clay mineral consisting of one al3 octahedral sheet between two si4 tetrahedral sheets the permanent negative charge on the montmorillonite surface occur by the isomorphous substitution of al3 for si4 in the tetrahedral layer and the substitution of mg2 zn2 and fe3 for al3 in the octahedral layer the hydrated cations like na and ca2 are in the interlayer space which depends of the water content 23 the iron doped clay c1 fe d001 value was 16 35 å which has a slight increase in the basal space as consequence of the change of the interlayer cation nature a similar behaviour was reported before for an iron activated montmorillonite where the iron polyhydroxy cations promoted a partial exchange of ca2 and na interlayer metal ions by fe3 and k 24 it was also reported the enlarge of basal space for an iron activated montmorillonite nanocomposite where the interlayer metal ions were replaced by hydrogen ions which are intercalated into the silicate layers and the interlayer water is lost during the modification process 23 the basal space d001 plane was calculated as 9 9 å for the raw c2 clay at 2θ 8 9 which was comparable to the d001 value of the illite pattern illite clay is a typical 2 1 cationic layered silicate that consists of one central si al fe mg octahedron bound to two si al tetrahedrons with k as the intermediate cation the iron doped clay c2 fe d001 value was 10 9 å which was a slight increase in comparison to c2 raw clay the enlarge of the basal space of illite clays have been previously reported as consequence of the exchange of k ions by divalent cations e g ca2 mg2 which is an extremely slow mechanism 25 the potassium from basal surface and edge interlayer have been recognized as exchangeable with other cations since iron can be found in clays as i structural iron ii iron complexed by surface hydroxyl groups and iii iron bound by ion exchange at basal siloxane surfaces and at the edge surface 26 it is confirmed that iron has been retained in c1 fe and c2 fe clays at basal and edge surface the specific surface area of c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe clay samples are detailed in table 1 the incorporation of iron also promoted the increase of specific surface up to 80 and 90 for c1 fe and c2 fe respectively in comparison to the raw clay otherwise opposite effect about the reduction of surface area of the functionalized amino form nh2 sba 15 in comparison with the parent prepared mesoporous silica material sba 15 was reported there was reported values of surface area up to 170 and 406 m2 g respectively for sba 15 and nh2 sba 15 the decrease of surface area value were reported as effect of the existence of functional groups in both outer surface as well as the mesoporous channels 27 also other mesoporous materials mcm 41 with extremely high surface area of 1450 9 m2 g has been reported as excellent adsorbent for wastewater treatment 28 the existence of a higher adsorbent surface area is associated to a larger variability of reactive sites and then higher adsorption capacities can be obtained 29 however the surface area values that have been reported for clay adsorbents in this study are lower than the mesoporous materials ones the fsem analyses of raw clays c1 and c2 presented a homogeneous morphology with plate like crystal surface distribution with a smooth surface fig s1 and s2 of the supplementary section particularly in raw clay c1 there are some rod like morphology minerals on the surface a conventional plate like structure is a representative shape for clays however some rod like structure shapes were previously attributed to some other raw clays also other pedogenic iron oxide particles were associated with the rod like morphology 30 some changes occurred in the morphology of both iron doped clays c1 fe and c2 fe with the appearance of small particles clustered covering the surface however the amorphous nature of these iron hydroxide phases did not allow their identification by xrd analysis furthermore the fsem edx results data not shown revealed also the increase of iron on the clay materials used in this study the x ray fluorescence analysis revealed the chemical composition of c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe clay samples and the sio2 al2o3 ratio table 2 the c1 and c2 clays were mainly composed of sio2 and al2o3 other components such as fe2o3 cao mgo na2o and k2o were in low contents for both clays in addition raw clays are heterogeneous clays with sio2 al2o3 ratios of 5 3 and 2 7 for c1 and c2 respectively the presence of tio2 also was determined for clay c1 at a higher content than in clay c2 the iron content of both raw clays increased after the modification process the iron oxide content of c1 fe and c2 fe clays increased 7 and 20 respectively after the iron doping process the exhausted loading solution of both iron doped c1 fe and c2 fe clays was verified by icp and the release of cations were found e g mg2 k na ca2 data not shown thus ion exchange reactions occurred between fe2 fe3 ions with the interchangeable cations mg2 k na ca2 from the raw clays as described by eq 11 11 clay mg2 na k ca2 fe2 fe3 clay fe2 fe3 mg2 na k ca2 the na content is almost the same for both raw and modified clays thus sodium exchanges again from solution to the iron doped clays while naoh was added for maintaining the ph the increase of the ph during iron doping on clays was performed to favour the formation of iron mineral phases in presence of dissolved oxygen it is worth mentioning that oxidation of fe ii to fe iii could be favoured at this condition the functional groups present in raw clays c1 and c2 were determined fig s3 supplementary section the absorption bands at 3622 cm 1 and 3614 cm 1 of c1 and c2 respectively were attributed to the external oh groups the bands at 3420 and 3693 cm 1 for c1 and 3435 and 3691 cm 1 for c2 were assigned to the internal oh groups physisorbed water molecules these hydroxyl groups can be distinguished by a doublet in these bands 31 the stretching vibrations of siosi groups were confirmed in c1 and c2 by the presence of the bands at 997 cm 1 and 1022 cm 1 respectively the bending vibration of alohsi was confirmed in both clays by the appearance of the bands at 768 and 791 cm 1 for c1 and c2 respectively 32 in addition the bands at 2402 and 1651 cm 1 for c1 and at 2380 and 1633 cm 1 for c2 were registered as indicative for the basic layer silicate structures existent on raw and iron doped clays 33 there were minimal changes at the wavenumber and positions of the main vibration peaks which demonstrates that the structural transformation of clays after iron doping did not occur the variation of the position and the intensity of bands at 1227 1089 and 793 cm 1 for c1 fe and the bands at 1228 1090 and 795 cm 1 for c2 fe confirms that the sio bonds were broken due to partial incorporation of fe into the three dimensional silica network for fe exchanged smectite the siofe bonds were confirmed with the presence of new bands at 634 cm 1 as was obtained in this study for c1 fe 688 cm 1 and c2 fe 666 cm 1 33 the shift of the bands of siosi groups was at 1028 cm 1 for c1 fe and 1038 cm 1 for c2 fe the shift of the bands of internal oh groups for c1 fe at 3398 and 3672 cm 1 and c2 fe at 3398 and 3672 cm 1 and external oh groups for c1 fe at 3613 cm 1 and c2 fe at 3622 cm 1 also occurred in iron doped clays in comparison to raw clays the oh group bands were related to the stretching mode of water molecules from the interlayer and clay surface 34 thus the modification of the both iron doped clays c1 fe and c2 fe occurred then at these sites forming iron hydroxide bonds the vibration modes of the iron hydroxide feoh species occurred at 1003 and cm 1 for c1 fe and 1007 and cm 1 c2 fe respectively however it may overlap with the conventional vibration mode of clays thus the vibration mode of iron species formed is not well resolved in the infrared spectra 35 after the phosphate loading on iron doped clays the silicate layer structures were conserved the loaded phosphate clays c1 fe and c2 fe presented shifts of the bands of siosi and iron hydroxide feoh groups resulting in unique bands at 1009 cm 1 and 1001 cm 1 respectively 33 considering the characterization of raw and iron doped clays iron was retained on c1 fe and c2 fe in different proportion in accordance with their structure which determines their reactivity and enable the chemical modification 3 2 effect of ph on the adsorption of phosphate the phosphate adsorption capacities of raw clays c1 and c2 were improved after iron particles were incorporated on c1 fe and c2 fe clays under the evaluated ph conditions the initial ph of the solution plays an important role in phosphate adsorption fig 2 the points of zero charge of the raw clays c1 and c2 were found to be 5 2 0 2 and 4 7 0 4 respectively after being doped the points of zero charge were 7 2 0 2 and 6 7 0 1 for c1 fe and c2 fe respectively the values of the zero charge points of this study were comparable with those reported for other clay materials in their raw and iron doped state 36 the increase of the point of zero charge values of the doped clay represents a valuable improvement of adsorbent properties due to the existence of iron and iron hydr oxides on the surface since hydroxylation occurs when the existing iron on the surface of the clays is exposed to water which promotes coordination with hydroxyl groups the phosphate adsorption capacity exhibited by both raw and iron doped clays followed the same trend since it increased in the range of ph solutions from 3 to 6 below phpzc and decreased from 7 to 10 above phpzc these results endorsed the oxyanionic speciation of phosphate h2po4 hpo4 2 and the phpzc of the adsorbents played an important role in the adsorption stage since clay minerals contains also other surface hydroxyl groups e g aloh in its external basal or edge surface under ph conditions below the phpzc the protonation of iron hydroxyl groups promote positive charges that generate an electric field the clay adsorbents used in this study in contact with an aqueous medium at this ph condition develop positive charges therefore these sites are very reactive for phosphate interaction through hydrogen bonding interactions considering the speciation of phosphate anion in aqueous solutions at the experimental conditions ph 7 both h2po4 ca 60 and hpo4 2 ca 40 anionic forms were present phosphate anions hpo4 2 have high basicity with a pair of high electronic density that can form hydrogen bond with the protonated iron doped clay surface oh 37 38 at ph conditions above the phpzc the hydroxylation occurred and the hard lewis base oh ions compete with phosphate oxyanions adsorption especially hpo4 2 at the clay surface 39 the occurrence of physisorption or non specific phosphate adsorption by electric interactions forces outer sphere adsorption complexes is observed in this study thus phosphate is adsorbed by iron oxi hydroxy surface groups existent on the surface of raw and doped clays in this study 40 an advantage of the raw and iron doped clays used in this study in comparison to many other functional materials is the effectiveness of phosphate removal at ph between 6 and 7 which is the usual ph condition for surface water and treated wastewater therefore iron doped clays can be an efficient alternative for the phosphate recovery from wastewater treatment plants at neutral ph of main or side streams after anaerobic digestion 17 3 3 phosphate adsorption isotherms the phosphate adsorption capacities of clays in their doped c1 fe and c2 fe forms were higher than for c1 and c2 raw clays fig 3a b the increase of phosphate adsorption capacity was around 80 higher in modified clays in comparison to the raw clays the maximum adsorption capacity of an adsorbent is one of the most important physicochemical parameter to characterize the adsorbent performance 41 the phosphate equilibrium adsorption capacity as a function of the equilibrium concentration of the four clay samples followed a similar trend then the data provide evidence of the use of iron doped clays for sensitive phosphate adsorption from a broad range of concentration in treated wastewater a similar result was reported for a mesoporous silica and ligand embedded composite adsorbent where higher phosphate concentration provided a driving force that promotes the easier mass transfer from aqueous phase to solid material surface 38 the langmuir and freundlich isotherm were used to identify the phosphate adsorption behaviour by the clay adsorbents table 3 the experimental data were best fitted to the langmuir isotherm model or monolayer adsorption thus indicating that phosphate adsorption takes place at specific equivalent and identical fixed sites 42 the highest regression coefficient r2 values were obtained for the langmuir isotherm model for all clays c1 c2 c1 fe and c2 fe and the maximum adsorption capacities values determined were 21 4 2 3 20 9 1 6 38 0 2 6 and 37 6 3 3 mg g po4 3 respectively in addition the separation factor value was determined to be 0 rl 1 for all clay adsorbents thus phosphate adsorption by clay adsorbents is favourable the freundlich isotherm model represent multilayer adsorption that occur on heterogeneous surface energy active sites 43 the experimental data fitting revealed the lowest r2 value for the phosphate adsorption this fact was expected since clays have a homogeneous morphology and a smooth surface the examination of phosphate adsorption data using freundlich isotherm model was discard onto a mesoporous silica and ligand embedded composite adsorbent due to its homogeneous surface 38 the results suggested the existence of a second mechanism of phosphate adsorption by clays due to specific reactions in both raw and iron doped forms the phosphate adsorption onto the raw c1 and c2 clays occurred mainly due to the surface hydroxyl groups the iron incorporated into the c1 fe and c2 fe clays improved the phosphate adsorption capacity due to the increase of iron surface hydroxyl groups it is worth mentioning that iron was not detected in the equilibrated solutions therefore the iron complexed by surface hydroxyl groups are chemical stable and highly relevant groups for phosphate removal at the expected ph of treated urban wastewater phosphate can replace the protonated hydroxyl groups generated at the clay s surfaces promoting mono dentade and bi dentade complexation process the protonated hydroxyl groups on the adsorbent surface allowed the phosphate inner sphere complexation reactions the phosphate can be bounded to an iron atom forming the mononuclear form or phosphate can be bound to two iron to the bidentate form which is schematically described by eq 12 7 12 c fe oh h 2 p o 4 pka 2 14 hp o 4 2 pka 7 20 complexation ph ph pzc c fe o oh p o oh o h monodentate c fe o o p oh o o h bidentate mononuclear c fe o c fe o p oh o 2 o h bidentate binuclear the phosphate adsorption process was governed by some physicochemical mechanisms including electrostatic attraction physical adsorption and complexation reaction chemical adsorption the adsorption capacities for clay minerals used for phosphate adsorption from aqueous solutions are reported in table s3 of the supplementary section the maximum adsorption capacities values reported using raw and synthetic iron doped clays were between 10 and 40 mg g p po4 3 which are comparable with the raw and iron doped clays used in this study maximum adsorption capacity values up to 100 mg po4 3 were reported for phosphate removal using polymeric anion exchangers resins and fibber composites 3 6 45 the larger adsorption capacities the mechanical strength and the operation flow rates in column packed arrangement of polymeric exchangers involve an advantage in comparison with the iron doped clays used in this study 4 17 in addition maximum adsorption capacity values up to 50 mg g po4 3 were reported when using an iron oxyhydr oxides ferrihydrite impregnated polymeric exchangers 46 however from a practical and economical point of view the potential use of such materials at full scale is limited due to the large content od dissolved organic matter in solution a convenient method to control the problem of particle size of iron hydroxides could be the preparation in a template such as clays as it is proposed in this work 3 4 adsorption kinetic evaluation of the clay based adsorbents by plotting the phosphate adsorption capacity qt as a function of time clay adsorbents c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe extracted 50 of phosphate within 5 min of operation fig 4 the phosphate adsorption subsequently increased at a slower rate reaching the equilibrium at approximately 10 min the easy access of phosphate to the binding sites on surface of clays allowed fast adsorption due to their structure as had been previously reported for open pore mesoporous silica that reached equilibrium within 1 min 47 otherwise a mesoporous material sba 15 and its amino form nh2 sba 15 reached the equilibrium above 110 min for metal ion removal it seems the lowest passage to inner surface adsorbent promote lower adsorbent efficiency due to the reactivity of the bonding processes involved even though nh2 sba 15 and sba 15 have higher surface areas in comparison to the clays reported in this study 27 then kinetic performance of iron doped clays is very attractive for their application in stirred reactors the experimental data of phosphate adsorption on c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe were adjusted to three conventional kinetic models table s1 of the supplementary section the adsorption kinetic modelling explains the rate of phosphate adsorption from aqueous solution to a solid phase interface at different conditions 43 e g physisorption and chemisorption therefore pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models were used to explain the phosphate adsorption mechanisms the data were best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model with an r2 value 1 this fact supports the fact that phosphate was chemisorbed through monolayer adsorption as previously described complexation reactions involving the iron oxyhydroxide species and phosphate anions turns out to be the dominant phosphate adsorption mechanism in clay adsorbents also the experimental data demonstrated a good fitting to the intraparticular diffusion kinetic model which describes the adsorbate diffusion controlled in macroscopic adsorbent particles in addition kinetic parameters were obtained from the linear regression of the adsorption rate equation of the homogeneous diffusion model hdm and shell progressive model spm table 4 the analysis of the kinetic data of c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe indicated that the adsorption mechanisms governing the phosphate adsorption were well described by the hdm and spm according to the r2 values closer to 1 the values of effective diffusion coefficients dp and df were in the range of 10 12 to 10 10 m2 s similar to other systems governed by chemisorption as was reported for a synthetic zeolite 48 two consecutive phases controlled the adsorption rate of phosphate by raw and iron doped clay adsorbents there was an initial process of quick adsorption of phosphate on the surface of the clay materials until saturation then slower adsorption occurred and phosphate was diffused through the internal clay pores this means quick phosphate removal is due electrostatic attraction and the second stage of slow phosphate adsorption occurred by complexation reactions thus the mechanisms involved in phosphate removal determine the kinetic efficiency of adsorbents it is comparable to ligand exchange polymeric adsorbents where the ligand coordinated to the central metal ion is after substituted by the phosphate anion these ligand exchangers develop slower kinetic performances than anion exchange and hydrogen bonding adsorption mechanisms of conventional polymeric exchangers 4 kinetic parameters would be critical in the integration of the synthesised fe doped clays in stirred reactor based applications according to the kinetic parameters even with low hydraulic residence times e g shorter than 10 min more than 90 of the adsorption equilibrium attainment would be reached the performance of iron doped clays was better than that obtained with natural zeolites in our previous studies where higher equilibrium times were obtained 49 it is worth mentioning that kinetic depends on several parameters such as the arrangement and the type of adsorbents used for phosphate removal the fixed bed column adsorption arrangement is conventionally limited for the iron doped clay adsorbents used in this study however fixed bed column is the best layout for phosphate removal at low levels where polymeric resins and fibbers adsorbents develop high efficiencies the diffusion path of granular resin adsorbents is higher in comparison to fibrous adsorbents promoting low kinetic performances where flow rate disturb their kinetic behaviour 17 therefore kinetic efficiency of adsorbents is relevant when large volumes of treated water exist as is the case of urban wastewater and a rapid extraction is desired then iron doped clays can achieve these conditions for a rapid phosphate adsorption in low and high concentration feeds 3 5 effect of competitive anions typically present in treated wastewater the phosphate adsorption capacity of clay adsorbents was determined when other ionic species were present in the solutions table 5a b the phosphate adsorption selectivity on c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe was evaluated at equal level in comparison with main anions existing in urban wastewater adsorption changes were quantified in terms of the adsorption ratio qmix q0 on the presence of competing ions qmix and in the absence of competing ions q0 at ph 7 both phosphate species h2po4 and hpo4 2 coexist in the solution the phosphate adsorption capacity was reduced by sulphate chloride and bicarbonate the sulphate ion inhibited the adsorption of phosphate reporting a qmix q0 ratio near to zero for all clay adsorbents sulphate has higher ionic charges and compete with phosphate through enhanced electrostatic interaction as has been reported for polymeric exchangers 6 therefore the adsorption of phosphate at ph 7 hpo4 2 was inhibited by sulphate ion according to the helfferich s electroselectivity concept in which the donnan potential acts proportionally to the ionic charge 50 thus the existence of equivalent content of sulphate limit the ability of phosphate hpo4 2 to form hydrogen bonds at protonated sites of iron doped clays 6 the phosphate adsorption was also reduced by monovalent anions cl hco3 the less hydrated chloride anion was preferred in comparison to the highly hydrated phosphate the results obtained for iron doped clays is comparable with conventional anion exchange resins that prefer less hydrated anions to highly hydrated ones and exhibited the hofmeister anion series behaviour 6 37 moreover a non hofmeister anion selectivity was provided by a crosslinked poly allylamine resin 51 and by a zirconium iv loaded fibrous used for phosphate removal 3 nevertheless the nitrate ion potentiates the phosphate adsorption on clay adsorbents obtaining a qmix q0 ratio above 1 the increase of phosphate adsorption by the presence of nitrate was related to the donnan invasion mechanism 52 53 a similar result was reported for a zirconium iv loaded fibrous adsorbent for phosphate removal in presence of sulphate it can be explained in terms of the co ion sodium ion when iron doped clays adsorbed phosphate it promotes an increase of sodium ion that enter in the exchanger phase through ion pair formation with phosphate maintaining electroneutrality the increase of sodium ion concentration in aqueous solution promotes the equilibrium and enhanced the phosphate adsorption 3 the simultaneous existence of competing ions at the same concentration level decreased the phosphate adsorption on iron doped clay adsorbents due to the competition for active sites otherwise metal ligand exchange adsorbents are not strongly affected by common anions present in solution due to the phosphate outer sphere complex formation 54 this suppose an advantage in comparison to the iron doped clays used for phosphate adsorption used in this study resulting in higher selectivity 3 6 phosphate desorption studies simulating soil amendment applications according to soil chemistry soil ph can become acidic basic or neutral therefore batch experiments were performed at different ph values 3 0 6 0 and 10 0 using water as a regeneration solution the phosphate desorption efficiencies of clay adsorbents onto raw and iron doped clays were governed by physical and chemical adsorption and it was not fully reversible fig 5 according to the results at ph 3 and 6 the monobasic anion phosphate specie h2po4 was the main specie recovered from adsorbents since it is the main source of available phosphorus for plants 55 the phosphate recovered at ph 6 from raw and doped clay adsorbents is higher for c1 than c2 this phosphate fraction was mainly physically adsorbed or linked by weak electrostatic bonds as was reported before when a neutral solution was used for phosphate desorption of natural modified zeolites 18 at ph 10 the phosphate fraction recovered from clay adsorbents was limited even the hydroxide is a hardest lewis base the phosphate adsorption by the formation of chemical reactions covalent bonds to oxyhydroxide iron groups of clays could be partially reversed by strong basic solutions in this condition also the contents of phosphate anionic forms e g h2po4 and hpo4 2 were reduced phosphate exists mainly as triple charged anion which partially avoids the formation of an inner sphere complex and has oh as a competing ion in this work a higher release of phosphate was reported using a desorption solution at acidic conditions for clay c2 a difference was found in the regeneration solution at ph 3 between raw and iron doped adsorbents clays since the phosphate released from c2 and c2 fe was higher than that from c1 and c1 fe this effect can be attributed to the phosphate bonded to the alkaline earth elements the c1 and c1 fe contained higher amounts of ca2 and mg2 than the c2 and c2 fe clays did these elements impeded the release of loaded phosphate due to the inner sphere surface complexes electrostatic forces and surface precipitation mechanisms involved 56 the higher phosphate desorption determined for c2 and c2 fe could be explained in terms of the higher content of phosphate bonded to iron hydroxyl groups at acidic conditions it has been demonstrated that iron species complexed by surface hydroxyl groups of clays are desorbed 26 therefore the phosphate bounded by iron hydroxyl groups is mainly released from clays at this condition it should be noted that iron was not detected in the desorbed solutions therefore iron was not released in comparison to the iron immobilized at the doping stage determining the chemical stability of the iron doped clays at the experimental conditions using at desorption stage the reusability for long term use of iron doped clays is limited in comparison to other phosphate adsorbents such as polymeric exchangers and ligand exchangers 45 such materials can be used in several operational cycles without deterioration and maintaining their performance which balance their high cost of investment in a practical viewpoint 17 even if the adsorbents used in this study seems to be inefficient for reuse their low cost and availability brings new perspectives for final disposal since the saturated phosphate iron doped clays can be assigned for soil amendment applications such as saturated zeolites were used in our previous studies for plant growth 57 3 7 implications of the potential use of fe doped clays as low cost adsorbents for phosphate recovery from wwtp the p adsorption capacity shown by the synthesised fe doped clays from this study was compared with the values previously reported by inorganic adsorbents p n and blends of p and n containing loaded reactive adsorbents loaded with bio solids from urban wastewater were proposed for sustainable soil enrichment taking into account economic agronomic and circularity criteria 58 there are several examples of initiatives to promote valorisation pathways of nutrients from wastewater table s2 supplementary information efforts to provide a feasibility analysis on the promotion of the p recovery and valorisation options using single use low cost adsorbents such as fe doped clays focused on economic and regulatory concerns are scarce in the case of the eu a new directive on fertilisers will be a useful tool that will promote and define the quality control of by products to identify the type of agronomic application or potential applications in the solid amendment in two previous studies with al fe and mn doped natural zeolites the loaded carrier and the nutrient release rate with three different soils showed how the dissolution of soil minerals and soil acidity control the release of nutrients from the loaded carriers 16 the proposed methodology on the development of low cost sorbents is supported on the fact that natural clays are not containing trace of hazardous metals studies with natural zeolites demonstrated that enrichment due to the trace levels of hazardous metals in urban wastewater did not provide concerns on accumulation and latter release from the sorbent to the soil as can be seen in a large number of studies table s3 supplementary section information online increasing activity on the promotion of low cost adsorption processes to recover p from wastewater the general trend was the use of metal hydroxide adsorbents e g al and fe as pure component or impregnated onto a high surface area adsorbent typically of inorganic nature however some examples on the use of organic adsorbents as polymeric macroporous supports ion exchangers of divinyl benzene have been also reported 4 conclusion in this study two raw clays were successfully doped with iron hydr oxides for the phosphate recovery from simulated urban treated wastewater is evaluated the iron doped clays can adsorb phosphate efficiently at neutral ph range which is an advantage in comparison with other adsorbents used with this purpose the experimental data were best fitted to the langmuir isotherm model and the intraparticular diffusion model phosphate adsorption was governed by the combined effect of physi sorption and chemi sorption the occurrence of hydrogen bonding and complexation reactions were determined as the main mechanisms for phosphate adsorption to raw and doped clays the presence of sulphate inhibited the phosphate adsorption limiting the ability of phosphate to form hydrogen bonds at protonated sites of iron doped clays the phosphate adsorption onto clays was also reduced by monovalent anions chloride and bicarbonate exhibited the hofmeister anion series behaviour which is comparable with conventional polymeric anion exchangers finally iron ions were not released during the phosphate adsorption and desorption stages revealing a good chemical stability of iron doped clays the reusability of iron doped clays is limited in comparison to other phosphate adsorbents such as polymeric exchangers however saturated phosphate iron doped clays can be used for soil amendment applications due to their low cost and availability since natural minerals do not provide concerns on accumulation and latter release of hazardous contaminants from the adsorbent to the soil then the use of iron doped clays as single use adsorbents could allow reaching the regulatory levels of total phosphorous in wastewater and being an

13378,natural inorganic adsorbents are attractive for pollutants removal due to the easy operation non toxic characteristics and low cost in this study two raw clays c1 and c2 were doped with iron and evaluated for the recovery of phosphate from simulated urban treated wastewater the adsorbents performances were evaluated through batch adsorption assays iron was stably retained in doped clays c1 fe and c2 fe at basal and edge surface at adsorption and desorption stages clay adsorbents were effective for adsorption of phosphate at neutral ph 7 and in broad range of phosphate concentrations the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity values were 21 38 21 and 38 for c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe respectively the equilibrium sorption data of raw and iron doped clays were well described by the langmuir isotherm model r2 0 97 therefore monolayer phosphate adsorption occurred through hydrogen bonding and complexation between protonated hydroxyl groups and phosphate anions the raw and iron doped clay adsorbents reached the equilibrium within 10 min and the equilibrium attainment data were well described by the intraparticular diffusion model r2 0 96 the phosphate monolayer adsorption was followed by diffusion through the internal clay pores the phosphate adsorption by clays in presence of competing ion was inhibited by the higher ionic charge of sulphate besides the less hydrated chloride and bicarbonate anions promoted the reduction of the sorption capacity of phosphate finally the reusability of iron doped clays is limited therefore saturated iron doped clays as single use adsorbents can be disposed for soil amendment applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords iron hydroxides phosphate recovery low cost sorbent sustainable use of resources 1 introduction sources of natural phosphorous sources are limited worldwide and their high demand predicts a shortage in the coming years at the industrial level phosphorus is used for the manufacture of fertilisers as well as other applications such as cleaning products food and beverages and metallurgy the phosphorus from detergents and household wastes is the largest inorganic source of phosphate phosphorous forms in natural water bodies and in domestic wastewater anthropogenic phosphorus from agricultural runoff farming waste industrial and domestic sewage is discharge into the aquatic bodies and is then responsible for eutrophication 1 furthermore the massive increase in the use of cleaning products due to the pandemic makes the short term eutrophication scenario even worse a recent study on phosphorus flow analysis demonstrated that wastewater treatment plants wwtp are considered as the most important secondary source of phosphorus more than 40 2 therefore the removal of phosphate from wastewater containing nutrients is important to conserve the natural aquatic environment 3 and even more important is the recovery of phosphorous from wwtp its recovery would also reduce the dependence on external supplies of phosphate rock by recovering it within the phosphorous cycle several processes such as precipitation with fe iii salts and crystallisation as struvite with mg ii salts from the richest streams e g sewage sludge anaerobic digestion side streams are used for this purpose 4 however the high operating costs limit the large deployment of these technologies in medium and small sized wwtps 5 the low levels of phosphate in wastewater according to the current regulatory framework make current technological solutions too expensive so it is necessary to propose effective and low cost technological strategies ion exchange and adsorption are postulated as viable option to recover phosphate forms from both the total phosphorous richest side streams and more diluted main streams with total phosphorous levels below 5 mg l p 16 mg l p po4 3 the use of several polymeric anion exchangers resins have been reported to be excellent phosphate adsorbents due to its selectivity and sensitivity 6 in streams with low content of dissolved organic matter accordingly low cost and environmentally friendly materials are nowadays preferred for the phosphate recovery from wastewater such as zeolites clinoptilolite 7 attapulgite 8 industrial wastes e g fly ash blast furnace slag organic inorganic hybrid adsorbents 9 and clays e g bentonites allophane nanoclay 10 clay exhibits a net negative charge which gives them an important cation adsorption and cation exchange properties the clay structure and the ph of the aqueous phase determine the development of adsorption and exchange properties of the clays the use of clays in environmental applications has been reported for the adsorption of toxic pollutants transition metals organic micro pollutants e g biocides and dyes from wastewater however the affinity of clays for phosphate adsorption is very low the use of hybrid selective phosphate adsorbents such as clays modified by physical and chemical methods is proposed to increase their affinity for oxyanions such as arsenate selenite and phosphate 11 the modification protocols based on iron oxide constructed nanomaterials have reported high stability and potential application 12 besides other metal ions as zirconium iv loaded fibrous adsorbent have been reported as efficient phosphate adsorbent 3 exceptionally allophane is a clay type with several environmental applications due to its interaction with toxic anions the small particle size high surface area and aluminol groups at the surface allow a high retention capacity for anions 13 the development of low cost material is proposed as a single use adsorbent assimilating it as a chemical for example as coagulant that could be dosed in the sedimentation or filtration stages in the wwtp the levels of total phosphorous could reach values from 5 to 15 mg l p or 50 to 250 mg l p at main and side streams respectively 14 in the case of countries where more than 80 of the sludge is disposed or applied in agriculture or for soil improvement such mixtures will improve their fertilising value 15 since phosphate loaded fe adsorbents could function as slow release fertilisers where the inorganic phosphate could be released under the controlled root mechanism 16 to the best of our knowledge several modified clays have been developed for phosphate removal but we have not found no previous studies that report detailed experimental information about iron doped clays for phosphate adsorption the literature review provided of the field indicated that adsorbents rarely develop high phosphate adsorption in neutral ph range 17 the ph is a critical operational parameter because in a full scale application the treated wastewater is usually at neutral ph e g 6 to 8 5 therefore it will not require ph adjustment in this study iron doped clays are prepared with the ability to recover phosphate efficiently at neutral ph range values this work describes the preparation of the iron doping stage and in batch experimental set up the effectiveness and selectivity were evaluated the specific objectives were i to investigate the iron doping onto raw clays to remove phosphate at neutral ph range ii to investigate the iron doping onto raw clays to recover phosphate at neutral values iii to study the effect of initial phosphate concentration to determine the clay adsorbent capacity iv to study the phosphate adsorption kinetics v to determine the selectivity of clay adsorbents for phosphate adsorption over competing ions and vi to evaluate the regeneration of clays after phosphate adsorption or their potential application as single use adsorbent 2 materials and methods 2 1 clay adsorbent preparation the raw clay samples were obtained from the san cayetano

sedimentary basin located at the central andes cordillera in southern ecuador the raw clays in bulk were crushed and washed with deionised water and subsequently dried in an oven at 80 c for 24 h the raw clays were dry sieved to obtain homogeneous adsorbent particle sizes particles below 200 μm mesh were used for the experiments furthermore to prepare the iron doped clay forms c1 fe and c2 fe the clay samples were treated with 0 5 m of feso4 solution a mass volume ratio of 25 g 250 ml of clay sample and iron sulphate solution respectively was used the mixture was stirred under reflux conditions at 95 2 c for 4 h the ph 7 of the mixture was maintained by the constant addition of a 0 1 m naoh solution then the treated clays were recovered from the mixture the iron doping procedure was repeated twice under the same conditions finally the resulting iron doped clays were repeatedly washed and centrifugated with deionised water until not chloride ion was detected in the discharge the resulting material was vacuum filtered and dried in an oven at 90 c for 24 h the c1 fe and c2 fe doped clay samples were stored in a desiccator for further characterization and for adsorption experiments 2 2 clays physicochemical characterization the sample structures were characterised by a powder x ray diffractometer x ray diffraction xrd patterns were acquired on a powder x ray diffractometer d8 advance a25 bruker with a cu kα anode λ 0 1542 nm operating at 40 kv and 40 ma the diffraction patterns were collected at 25 c and over an angular range from 4 to 60 of 2θ by a fast lineal lynxeyexe detector nitrogen gas adsorption method was used to determine the specific surface area of the adsorbents with an automatic adsorption analyser using the multipoint brunauer emmett teller bet method the morphology of clay samples was studied by a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem in addition a wavelength dispersive x ray fluorescence spectrometer bruker s1 turbo sd le mining calibrations was used to determine the composition of the sample the infrared absorption spectra were recorded with a fourier transform ftir spectrometer in the range of 4000 550 cm 1 kbr was used to prepare a table sample and the spectra were obtained by collecting 32 scans using a 4 cm 1 resolution clay adsorbents were equilibrated with solutions at different ionic strengths to determine the point of zero charge pzc by the ph drift method in the range of ph 3 10 as described in a previous work 18 the test was replicated four times for each sample and the average data is reported 2 3 phosphate batch adsorption studies the phosphate adsorption by raw and iron doped clays was evaluated under optimal conditions obtained in our previous works and which are summarized in table 1 the phosphate solutions used in the adsorption tests were prepared by dissolving nah2po4 2h2o stock solution 1000 mg l in deionised water the ph of the phosphate solutions used in the adsorption test were adjusted using 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh after phosphate solution clay adsorbent system was equilibrated it was centrifuged at 5000 rpm and the supernatant filtered 0 45 μm before analysis the ph of the initial and final solution was measured using a combined glass electrode crison at room temperature 22 2 c in the phosphate solution the ph values were adjusted with an accuracy greater than 0 02 units the potentiometer calibration was carried out with standard buffer solutions of ph 2 ph 4 and ph 7 the concentration of the initial and equilibrated phosphate solutions were measured using the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater a calibration curve was prepared from the phosphate stock solution by using the vanadomolybdophosphoric acid colourimetric method 4500 p c 19 using a wavelength 470 nm cation and anion concentrations including iron ion were determined using a thermo scientific ionic chromatograph dionex ics 1100 and ics 1000 the tests were performed in batch by triplicate and the average values are reported the equilibrium adsorption capacity was calculated by eq 1 1 q e v c o c e w where qe was the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g po4 3 v was the volume of phosphate solution l c0 and ce were the initial and equilibrium concentration of the phosphate solution mg l po4 3 and w was the mass of the clay material g 2 3 1 phosphate adsorption as a function of ph the influence of ph on phosphate adsorption by clay adsorbents was evaluated using phosphate solutions at initial ph values between 3 and 10 2 3 2 equilibrium adsorption capacity the sorption capacity of clays adsorbents was determined using a wide range of initial concentrations 10 2000 mg l po4 3 at ph 7 ph was used adjusted according to the expected treated wastewater conditions the weighted amounts of raw and modified clays were equilibrated by mixing with the phosphate solution in a rotatory stirrer the equilibrium adsorption isotherms were fitted to the linearised langmuir eq 2 and freundlich eq 3 equations 2 c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m 3 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where q m is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g po4 3 k l langmuir adsorption constant l mg k f mg g and n were freundlich constant the separation factor rl was a dimensionless constant that explains the langmuir isotherm shape the favourability of the adsorption process is defined when 0 rl 1 and can be calculated by eq 4 4 r l 1 1 k l c 0 2 3 3 effect of competing ions the clay samples were equilibrated in solutions containing a binary combination of phosphate and the coexisting anions e g nitrate bicarbonate chloride and sulphate at equal concentration level in addition the phosphate adsorption phosphate was evaluated considering a combination of all competing anions at same concentration level 2 3 4 kinetic of phosphate adsorption the kinetic behaviour of phosphate adsorption by clay adsorbents were evaluated using two liquid adsorbent dosages samples 5 ml were withdrawn at given times for determining the phosphate concentrations in solution the phosphate adsorption capacity as a function of time was calculated by eq 5 5 q t v c o c t w where qt was the adsorption capacity as a function of time mg g po4 3 v is the volume of phosphate solution l c0 and ct were the initial and concentration of the phosphate solution at specific time mg l po4 3 and w was the mass of the clay material g the experimental kinetic data were fitted to the homogeneous diffusion model hdm and the shell progressive model spm in order to describe the phosphate recovery by clay adsorbent materials the hdm model considered the clay as a quasi homogeneous media and the adsorption diffusion rate is a controlling step on the spherical particles defined by eqs 6 and 7 20 i particle diffusion dp m2 s controls the adsorption rate it is described by eq 6 6 ln 1 x t 2 k p t 2 π 2 d p r 2 t ii liquid film diffusion df m2 s controls the adsorption rate it is described by eq 7 7 ln 1 x t k f t d f c h r c r t where x t was the fractional attainment of adsorption equilibrium between the solid and liquid phase qt qe at time t c and cr mg l were the concentrations of solute in a solution and the adsorbent phase respectively t was the contact time min r is the average radius of clay particles particles below 200 mesh particles diameter 7 4 10 5 m or particles radius 3 7 10 5 m and h was the thickness of film around the clay particle 1 10 5 m for a poorly stirred solution 21 in the spm as the porosity of the clay could be considered small and thus practically impervious to the aqueous solution the phosphate adsorption process is described by a concentration profile of the solution containing phosphate ions going forward into a spherical partially saturated clay particle 20 the adsorption rate controlling steps on the clay particles were defined by a it was controlled by the fluid film kf m s described by eq 8 8 x t 3 c s 0 k f a s r

respectively mg l 2 3 5 phosphate desorption the raw and doped clay samples were equilibrated with 100 mg l po4 3 solution the solid samples were separated from the aqueous phase for further tests therefore the loaded clay samples were further equilibrated in closed containers using deionised water at ph 3 6 and 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 clay and fe doped clay characterization the x ray diffraction patterns of raw and iron doped clays c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe are depicted in fig 1 the xrd patterns of raw and iron doped clays at lower angles 4 10 and at wide angles 10 60 are represented the analysis indicated that the c1 raw clay was a heterogeneous clay material composed of 65 9 montmorillonite mt na ca 0 3 al mg 2si4o10 oh 2 18 5 anorthite at caal2si2o8 and 15 6 quartz qt sio2 the analysis of c2 raw clay determined that it was also a heterogeneous clay composed of 25 4 dickite dt al2si2o5 oh 4 51 9 illite it k h3o al mg fe 2 si al 4o10 oh 2 h2o and 22 8 quartz qt sio2 the diffraction patterns of the doped clays did not exhibit the formation of a new crystalline mineralogical phases after iron doping a decrease of the peak intensities was observed for both iron doped clays in comparison to parent clays this effect has been attributed to the lower crystallinity of clays due to the presence of fe iii ions 22 the basal space d001 plane was calculated as 15 å for the raw c1 clay at 2θ 5 9 which was comparable to the d001 value of the montmorillonite pattern montmorillonite is a 2 1 layer clay mineral consisting of one al3 octahedral sheet between two si4 tetrahedral sheets the permanent negative charge on the montmorillonite surface occur by the isomorphous substitution of al3 for si4 in the tetrahedral layer and the substitution of mg2 zn2 and fe3 for al3 in the octahedral layer the hydrated cations like na and ca2 are in the interlayer space which depends of the water content 23 the iron doped clay c1 fe d001 value was 16 35 å which has a slight increase in the basal space as consequence of the change of the interlayer cation nature a similar behaviour was reported before for an iron activated montmorillonite where the iron polyhydroxy cations promoted a partial exchange of ca2 and na interlayer metal ions by fe3 and k 24 it was also reported the enlarge of basal space for an iron activated montmorillonite nanocomposite where the interlayer metal ions were replaced by hydrogen ions which are intercalated into the silicate layers and the interlayer water is lost during the modification process 23 the basal space d001 plane was calculated as 9 9 å for the raw c2 clay at 2θ 8 9 which was comparable to the d001 value of the illite pattern illite clay is a typical 2 1 cationic layered silicate that consists of one central si al fe mg octahedron bound to two si al tetrahedrons with k as the intermediate cation the iron doped clay c2 fe d001 value was 10 9 å which was a slight increase in comparison to c2 raw clay the enlarge of the basal space of illite clays have been previously reported as consequence of the exchange of k ions by divalent cations e g ca2 mg2 which is an extremely slow mechanism 25 the potassium from basal surface and edge interlayer have been recognized as exchangeable with other cations since iron can be found in clays as i structural iron ii iron complexed by surface hydroxyl groups and iii iron bound by ion exchange at basal siloxane surfaces and at the edge surface 26 it is confirmed that iron has been retained in c1 fe and c2 fe clays at basal and edge surface the specific surface area of c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe clay samples are detailed in table 1 the incorporation of iron also promoted the increase of specific surface up to 80 and 90 for c1 fe and c2 fe respectively in comparison to the raw clay otherwise opposite effect about the reduction of surface area of the functionalized amino form nh2 sba 15 in comparison with the parent prepared mesoporous silica material sba 15 was reported there was reported values of surface area up to 170 and 406 m2 g respectively for sba 15 and nh2 sba 15 the decrease of surface area value were reported as effect of the existence of functional groups in both outer surface as well as the mesoporous channels 27 also other mesoporous materials mcm 41 with extremely high surface area of 1450 9 m2 g has been reported as excellent adsorbent for wastewater treatment 28 the existence of a higher adsorbent surface area is associated to a larger variability of reactive sites and then higher adsorption capacities can be obtained 29 however the surface area values that have been reported for clay adsorbents in this study are lower than the mesoporous materials ones the fsem analyses of raw clays c1 and c2 presented a homogeneous morphology with plate like crystal surface distribution with a smooth surface fig s1 and s2 of the supplementary section particularly in raw clay c1 there are some rod like morphology minerals on the surface a conventional plate like structure is a representative shape for clays however some rod like structure shapes were previously attributed to some other raw clays also other pedogenic iron oxide particles were associated with the rod like morphology 30 some changes occurred in the morphology of both iron doped clays c1 fe and c2 fe with the appearance of small particles clustered covering the surface however the amorphous nature of these iron hydroxide phases did not allow their identification by xrd analysis furthermore the fsem edx results data not shown revealed also the increase of iron on the clay materials used in this study the x ray fluorescence analysis revealed the chemical composition of c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe clay samples and the sio2 al2o3 ratio table 2 the c1 and c2 clays were mainly composed of sio2 and al2o3 other components such as fe2o3 cao mgo na2o and k2o were in low contents for both clays in addition raw clays are heterogeneous clays with sio2 al2o3 ratios of 5 3 and 2 7 for c1 and c2 respectively the presence of tio2 also was determined for clay c1 at a higher content than in clay c2 the iron content of both raw clays increased after the modification process the iron oxide content of c1 fe and c2 fe clays increased 7 and 20 respectively after the iron doping process the exhausted loading solution of both iron doped c1 fe and c2 fe clays was verified by icp and the release of cations were found e g mg2 k na ca2 data not shown thus ion exchange reactions occurred between fe2 fe3 ions with the interchangeable cations mg2 k na ca2 from the raw clays as described by eq 11 11 clay mg2 na k ca2 fe2 fe3 clay fe2 fe3 mg2 na k ca2 the na content is almost the same for both raw and modified clays thus sodium exchanges again from solution to the iron doped clays while naoh was added for maintaining the ph the increase of the ph during iron doping on clays was performed to favour the formation of iron mineral phases in presence of dissolved oxygen it is worth mentioning that oxidation of fe ii to fe iii could be favoured at this condition the functional groups present in raw clays c1 and c2 were determined fig s3 supplementary section the absorption bands at 3622 cm 1 and 3614 cm 1 of c1 and c2 respectively were attributed to the external oh groups the bands at 3420 and 3693 cm 1 for c1 and 3435 and 3691 cm 1 for c2 were assigned to the internal oh groups physisorbed water molecules these hydroxyl groups can be distinguished by a doublet in these bands 31 the stretching vibrations of siosi groups were confirmed in c1 and c2 by the presence of the bands at 997 cm 1 and 1022 cm 1 respectively the bending vibration of alohsi was confirmed in both clays by the appearance of the bands at 768 and 791 cm 1 for c1 and c2 respectively 32 in addition the bands at 2402 and 1651 cm 1 for c1 and at 2380 and 1633 cm 1 for c2 were registered as indicative for the basic layer silicate structures existent on raw and iron doped clays 33 there were minimal changes at the wavenumber and positions of the main vibration peaks which demonstrates that the structural transformation of clays after iron doping did not occur the variation of the position and the intensity of bands at 1227 1089 and 793 cm 1 for c1 fe and the bands at 1228 1090 and 795 cm 1 for c2 fe confirms that the sio bonds were broken due to partial incorporation of fe into the three dimensional silica network for fe exchanged smectite the siofe bonds were confirmed with the presence of new bands at 634 cm 1 as was obtained in this study for c1 fe 688 cm 1 and c2 fe 666 cm 1 33 the shift of the bands of siosi groups was at 1028 cm 1 for c1 fe and 1038 cm 1 for c2 fe the shift of the bands of internal oh groups for c1 fe at 3398 and 3672 cm 1 and c2 fe at 3398 and 3672 cm 1 and external oh groups for c1 fe at 3613 cm 1 and c2 fe at 3622 cm 1 also occurred in iron doped clays in comparison to raw clays the oh group bands were related to the stretching mode of water molecules from the interlayer and clay surface 34 thus the modification of the both iron doped clays c1 fe and c2 fe occurred then at these sites forming iron hydroxide bonds the vibration modes of the iron hydroxide feoh species occurred at 1003 and cm 1 for c1 fe and 1007 and cm 1 c2 fe respectively however it may overlap with the conventional vibration mode of clays thus the vibration mode of iron species formed is not well resolved in the infrared spectra 35 after the phosphate loading on iron doped clays the silicate layer structures were conserved the loaded phosphate clays c1 fe and c2 fe presented shifts of the bands of siosi and iron hydroxide feoh groups resulting in unique bands at 1009 cm 1 and 1001 cm 1 respectively 33 considering the characterization of raw and iron doped clays iron was retained on c1 fe and c2 fe in different proportion in accordance with their structure which determines their reactivity and enable the chemical modification 3 2 effect of ph on the adsorption of phosphate the phosphate adsorption capacities of raw clays c1 and c2 were improved after iron particles were incorporated on c1 fe and c2 fe clays under the evaluated ph conditions the initial ph of the solution plays an important role in phosphate adsorption fig 2 the points of zero charge of the raw clays c1 and c2 were found to be 5 2 0 2 and 4 7 0 4 respectively after being doped the points of zero charge were 7 2 0 2 and 6 7 0 1 for c1 fe and c2 fe respectively the values of the zero charge points of this study were comparable with those reported for other clay materials in their raw and iron doped state 36 the increase of the point of zero charge values of the doped clay represents a valuable improvement of adsorbent properties due to the existence of iron and iron hydr oxides on the surface since hydroxylation occurs when the existing iron on the surface of the clays is exposed to water which promotes coordination with hydroxyl groups the phosphate adsorption capacity exhibited by both raw and iron doped clays followed the same trend since it increased in the range of ph solutions from 3 to 6 below phpzc and decreased from 7 to 10 above phpzc these results endorsed the oxyanionic speciation of phosphate h2po4 hpo4 2 and the phpzc of the adsorbents played an important role in the adsorption stage since clay minerals contains also other surface hydroxyl groups e g aloh in its external basal or edge surface under ph conditions below the phpzc the protonation of iron hydroxyl groups promote positive charges that generate an electric field the clay adsorbents used in this study in contact with an aqueous medium at this ph condition develop positive charges therefore these sites are very reactive for phosphate interaction through hydrogen bonding interactions considering the speciation of phosphate anion in aqueous solutions at the experimental conditions ph 7 both h2po4 ca 60 and hpo4 2 ca 40 anionic forms were present phosphate anions hpo4 2 have high basicity with a pair of high electronic density that can form hydrogen bond with the protonated iron doped clay surface oh 37 38 at ph conditions above the phpzc the hydroxylation occurred and the hard lewis base oh ions compete with phosphate oxyanions adsorption especially hpo4 2 at the clay surface 39 the occurrence of physisorption or non specific phosphate adsorption by electric interactions forces outer sphere adsorption complexes is observed in this study thus phosphate is adsorbed by iron oxi hydroxy surface groups existent on the surface of raw and doped clays in this study 40 an advantage of the raw and iron doped clays used in this study in comparison to many other functional materials is the effectiveness of phosphate removal at ph between 6 and 7 which is the usual ph condition for surface water and treated wastewater therefore iron doped clays can be an efficient alternative for the phosphate recovery from wastewater treatment plants at neutral ph of main or side streams after anaerobic digestion 17 3 3 phosphate adsorption isotherms the phosphate adsorption capacities of clays in their doped c1 fe and c2 fe forms were higher than for c1 and c2 raw clays fig 3a b the increase of phosphate adsorption capacity was around 80 higher in modified clays in comparison to the raw clays the maximum adsorption capacity of an adsorbent is one of the most important physicochemical parameter to characterize the adsorbent performance 41 the phosphate equilibrium adsorption capacity as a function of the equilibrium concentration of the four clay samples followed a similar trend then the data provide evidence of the use of iron doped clays for sensitive phosphate adsorption from a broad range of concentration in treated wastewater a similar result was reported for a mesoporous silica and ligand embedded composite adsorbent where higher phosphate concentration provided a driving force that promotes the easier mass transfer from aqueous phase to solid material surface 38 the langmuir and freundlich isotherm were used to identify the phosphate adsorption behaviour by the clay adsorbents table 3 the experimental data were best fitted to the langmuir isotherm model or monolayer adsorption thus indicating that phosphate adsorption takes place at specific equivalent and identical fixed sites 42 the highest regression coefficient r2 values were obtained for the langmuir isotherm model for all clays c1 c2 c1 fe and c2 fe and the maximum adsorption capacities values determined were 21 4 2 3 20 9 1 6 38 0 2 6 and 37 6 3 3 mg g po4 3 respectively in addition the separation factor value was determined to be 0 rl 1 for all clay adsorbents thus phosphate adsorption by clay adsorbents is favourable the freundlich isotherm model represent multilayer adsorption that occur on heterogeneous surface energy active sites 43 the experimental data fitting revealed the lowest r2 value for the phosphate adsorption this fact was expected since clays have a homogeneous morphology and a smooth surface the examination of phosphate adsorption data using freundlich isotherm model was discard onto a mesoporous silica and ligand embedded composite adsorbent due to its homogeneous surface 38 the results suggested the existence of a second mechanism of phosphate adsorption by clays due to specific reactions in both raw and iron doped forms the phosphate adsorption onto the raw c1 and c2 clays occurred mainly due to the surface hydroxyl groups the iron incorporated into the c1 fe and c2 fe clays improved the phosphate adsorption capacity due to the increase of iron surface hydroxyl groups it is worth mentioning that iron was not detected in the equilibrated solutions therefore the iron complexed by surface hydroxyl groups are chemical stable and highly relevant groups for phosphate removal at the expected ph of treated urban wastewater phosphate can replace the protonated hydroxyl groups generated at the clay s surfaces promoting mono dentade and bi dentade complexation process the protonated hydroxyl groups on the adsorbent surface allowed the phosphate inner sphere complexation reactions the phosphate can be bounded to an iron atom forming the mononuclear form or phosphate can be bound to two iron to the bidentate form which is schematically described by eq 12 7 12 c fe oh h 2 p o 4 pka 2 14 hp o 4 2 pka 7 20 complexation ph ph pzc c fe o oh p o oh o h monodentate c fe o o p oh o o h bidentate mononuclear c fe o c fe o p oh o 2 o h bidentate binuclear the phosphate adsorption process was governed by some physicochemical mechanisms including electrostatic attraction physical adsorption and complexation reaction chemical adsorption the adsorption capacities for clay minerals used for phosphate adsorption from aqueous solutions are reported in table s3 of the supplementary section the maximum adsorption capacities values reported using raw and synthetic iron doped clays were between 10 and 40 mg g p po4 3 which are comparable with the raw and iron doped clays used in this study maximum adsorption capacity values up to 100 mg po4 3 were reported for phosphate removal using polymeric anion exchangers resins and fibber composites 3 6 45 the larger adsorption capacities the mechanical strength and the operation flow rates in column packed arrangement of polymeric exchangers involve an advantage in comparison with the iron doped clays used in this study 4 17 in addition maximum adsorption capacity values up to 50 mg g po4 3 were reported when using an iron oxyhydr oxides ferrihydrite impregnated polymeric exchangers 46 however from a practical and economical point of view the potential use of such materials at full scale is limited due to the large content od dissolved organic matter in solution a convenient method to control the problem of particle size of iron hydroxides could be the preparation in a template such as clays as it is proposed in this work 3 4 adsorption kinetic evaluation of the clay based adsorbents by plotting the phosphate adsorption capacity qt as a function of time clay adsorbents c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe extracted 50 of phosphate within 5 min of operation fig 4 the phosphate adsorption subsequently increased at a slower rate reaching the equilibrium at approximately 10 min the easy access of phosphate to the binding sites on surface of clays allowed fast adsorption due to their structure as had been previously reported for open pore mesoporous silica that reached equilibrium within 1 min 47 otherwise a mesoporous material sba 15 and its amino form nh2 sba 15 reached the equilibrium above 110 min for metal ion removal it seems the lowest passage to inner surface adsorbent promote lower adsorbent efficiency due to the reactivity of the bonding processes involved even though nh2 sba 15 and sba 15 have higher surface areas in comparison to the clays reported in this study 27 then kinetic performance of iron doped clays is very attractive for their application in stirred reactors the experimental data of phosphate adsorption on c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe were adjusted to three conventional kinetic models table s1 of the supplementary section the adsorption kinetic modelling explains the rate of phosphate adsorption from aqueous solution to a solid phase interface at different conditions 43 e g physisorption and chemisorption therefore pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models were used to explain the phosphate adsorption mechanisms the data were best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model with an r2 value 1 this fact supports the fact that phosphate was chemisorbed through monolayer adsorption as previously described complexation reactions involving the iron oxyhydroxide species and phosphate anions turns out to be the dominant phosphate adsorption mechanism in clay adsorbents also the experimental data demonstrated a good fitting to the intraparticular diffusion kinetic model which describes the adsorbate diffusion controlled in macroscopic adsorbent particles in addition kinetic parameters were obtained from the linear regression of the adsorption rate equation of the homogeneous diffusion model hdm and shell progressive model spm table 4 the analysis of the kinetic data of c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe indicated that the adsorption mechanisms governing the phosphate adsorption were well described by the hdm and spm according to the r2 values closer to 1 the values of effective diffusion coefficients dp and df were in the range of 10 12 to 10 10 m2 s similar to other systems governed by chemisorption as was reported for a synthetic zeolite 48 two consecutive phases controlled the adsorption rate of phosphate by raw and iron doped clay adsorbents there was an initial process of quick adsorption of phosphate on the surface of the clay materials until saturation then slower adsorption occurred and phosphate was diffused through the internal clay pores this means quick phosphate removal is due electrostatic attraction and the second stage of slow phosphate adsorption occurred by complexation reactions thus the mechanisms involved in phosphate removal determine the kinetic efficiency of adsorbents it is comparable to ligand exchange polymeric adsorbents where the ligand coordinated to the central metal ion is after substituted by the phosphate anion these ligand exchangers develop slower kinetic performances than anion exchange and hydrogen bonding adsorption mechanisms of conventional polymeric exchangers 4 kinetic parameters would be critical in the integration of the synthesised fe doped clays in stirred reactor based applications according to the kinetic parameters even with low hydraulic residence times e g shorter than 10 min more than 90 of the adsorption equilibrium attainment would be reached the performance of iron doped clays was better than that obtained with natural zeolites in our previous studies where higher equilibrium times were obtained 49 it is worth mentioning that kinetic depends on several parameters such as the arrangement and the type of adsorbents used for phosphate removal the fixed bed column adsorption arrangement is conventionally limited for the iron doped clay adsorbents used in this study however fixed bed column is the best layout for phosphate removal at low levels where polymeric resins and fibbers adsorbents develop high efficiencies the diffusion path of granular resin adsorbents is higher in comparison to fibrous adsorbents promoting low kinetic performances where flow rate disturb their kinetic behaviour 17 therefore kinetic efficiency of adsorbents is relevant when large volumes of treated water exist as is the case of urban wastewater and a rapid extraction is desired then iron doped clays can achieve these conditions for a rapid phosphate adsorption in low and high concentration feeds 3 5 effect of competitive anions typically present in treated wastewater the phosphate adsorption capacity of clay adsorbents was determined when other ionic species were present in the solutions table 5a b the phosphate adsorption selectivity on c1 c1 fe c2 and c2 fe was evaluated at equal level in comparison with main anions existing in urban wastewater adsorption changes were quantified in terms of the adsorption ratio qmix q0 on the presence of competing ions qmix and in the absence of competing ions q0 at ph 7 both phosphate species h2po4 and hpo4 2 coexist in the solution the phosphate adsorption capacity was reduced by sulphate chloride and bicarbonate the sulphate ion inhibited the adsorption of phosphate reporting a qmix q0 ratio near to zero for all clay adsorbents sulphate has higher ionic charges and compete with phosphate through enhanced electrostatic interaction as has been reported for polymeric exchangers 6 therefore the adsorption of phosphate at ph 7 hpo4 2 was inhibited by sulphate ion according to the helfferich s electroselectivity concept in which the donnan potential acts proportionally to the ionic charge 50 thus the existence of equivalent content of sulphate limit the ability of phosphate hpo4 2 to form hydrogen bonds at protonated sites of iron doped clays 6 the phosphate adsorption was also reduced by monovalent anions cl hco3 the less hydrated chloride anion was preferred in comparison to the highly hydrated phosphate the results obtained for iron doped clays is comparable with conventional anion exchange resins that prefer less hydrated anions to highly hydrated ones and exhibited the hofmeister anion series behaviour 6 37 moreover a non hofmeister anion selectivity was provided by a crosslinked poly allylamine resin 51 and by a zirconium iv loaded fibrous used for phosphate removal 3 nevertheless the nitrate ion potentiates the phosphate adsorption on clay adsorbents obtaining a qmix q0 ratio above 1 the increase of phosphate adsorption by the presence of nitrate was related to the donnan invasion mechanism 52 53 a similar result was reported for a zirconium iv loaded fibrous adsorbent for phosphate removal in presence of sulphate it can be explained in terms of the co ion sodium ion when iron doped clays adsorbed phosphate it promotes an increase of sodium ion that enter in the exchanger phase through ion pair formation with phosphate maintaining electroneutrality the increase of sodium ion concentration in aqueous solution promotes the equilibrium and enhanced the phosphate adsorption 3 the simultaneous existence of competing ions at the same concentration level decreased the phosphate adsorption on iron doped clay adsorbents due to the competition for active sites otherwise metal ligand exchange adsorbents are not strongly affected by common anions present in solution due to the phosphate outer sphere complex formation 54 this suppose an advantage in comparison to the iron doped clays used for phosphate adsorption used in this study resulting in higher selectivity 3 6 phosphate desorption studies simulating soil amendment applications according to soil chemistry soil ph can become acidic basic or neutral therefore batch experiments were performed at different ph values 3 0 6 0 and 10 0 using water as a regeneration solution the phosphate desorption efficiencies of clay adsorbents onto raw and iron doped clays were governed by physical and chemical adsorption and it was not fully reversible fig 5 according to the results at ph 3 and 6 the monobasic anion phosphate specie h2po4 was the main specie recovered from adsorbents since it is the main source of available phosphorus for plants 55 the phosphate recovered at ph 6 from raw and doped clay adsorbents is higher for c1 than c2 this phosphate fraction was mainly physically adsorbed or linked by weak electrostatic bonds as was reported before when a neutral solution was used for phosphate desorption of natural modified zeolites 18 at ph 10 the phosphate fraction recovered from clay adsorbents was limited even the hydroxide is a hardest lewis base the phosphate adsorption by the formation of chemical reactions covalent bonds to oxyhydroxide iron groups of clays could be partially reversed by strong basic solutions in this condition also the contents of phosphate anionic forms e g h2po4 and hpo4 2 were reduced phosphate exists mainly as triple charged anion which partially avoids the formation of an inner sphere complex and has oh as a competing ion in this work a higher release of phosphate was reported using a desorption solution at acidic conditions for clay c2 a difference was found in the regeneration solution at ph 3 between raw and iron doped adsorbents clays since the phosphate released from c2 and c2 fe was higher than that from c1 and c1 fe this effect can be attributed to the phosphate bonded to the alkaline earth elements the c1 and c1 fe contained higher amounts of ca2 and mg2 than the c2 and c2 fe clays did these elements impeded the release of loaded phosphate due to the inner sphere surface complexes electrostatic forces and surface precipitation mechanisms involved 56 the higher phosphate desorption determined for c2 and c2 fe could be explained in terms of the higher content of phosphate bonded to iron hydroxyl groups at acidic conditions it has been demonstrated that iron species complexed by surface hydroxyl groups of clays are desorbed 26 therefore the phosphate bounded by iron hydroxyl groups is mainly released from clays at this condition it should be noted that iron was not detected in the desorbed solutions therefore iron was not released in comparison to the iron immobilized at the doping stage determining the chemical stability of the iron doped clays at the experimental conditions using at desorption stage the reusability for long term use of iron doped clays is limited in comparison to other phosphate adsorbents such as polymeric exchangers and ligand exchangers 45 such materials can be used in several operational cycles without deterioration and maintaining their performance which balance their high cost of investment in a practical viewpoint 17 even if the adsorbents used in this study seems to be inefficient for reuse their low cost and availability brings new perspectives for final disposal since the saturated phosphate iron doped clays can be assigned for soil amendment applications such as saturated zeolites were used in our previous studies for plant growth 57 3 7 implications of the potential use of fe doped clays as low cost adsorbents for phosphate recovery from wwtp the p adsorption capacity shown by the synthesised fe doped clays from this study was compared with the values previously reported by inorganic adsorbents p n and blends of p and n containing loaded reactive adsorbents loaded with bio solids from urban wastewater were proposed for sustainable soil enrichment taking into account economic agronomic and circularity criteria 58 there are several examples of initiatives to promote valorisation pathways of nutrients from wastewater table s2 supplementary information efforts to provide a feasibility analysis on the promotion of the p recovery and valorisation options using single use low cost adsorbents such as fe doped clays focused on economic and regulatory concerns are scarce in the case of the eu a new directive on fertilisers will be a useful tool that will promote and define the quality control of by products to identify the type of agronomic application or potential applications in the solid amendment in two previous studies with al fe and mn doped natural zeolites the loaded carrier and the nutrient release rate with three different soils showed how the dissolution of soil minerals and soil acidity control the release of nutrients from the loaded carriers 16 the proposed methodology on the development of low cost sorbents is supported on the fact that natural clays are not containing trace of hazardous metals studies with natural zeolites demonstrated that enrichment due to the trace levels of hazardous metals in urban wastewater did not provide concerns on accumulation and latter release from the sorbent to the soil as can be seen in a large number of studies table s3 supplementary section information online increasing activity on the promotion of low cost adsorption processes to recover p from wastewater the general trend was the use of metal hydroxide adsorbents e g al and fe as pure component or impregnated onto a high surface area adsorbent typically of inorganic nature however some examples on the use of organic adsorbents as polymeric macroporous supports ion exchangers of divinyl benzene have been also reported 4 conclusion in this study two raw clays were successfully doped with iron hydr oxides for the phosphate recovery from simulated urban treated wastewater is evaluated the iron doped clays can adsorb phosphate efficiently at neutral ph range which is an advantage in comparison with other adsorbents used with this purpose the experimental data were best fitted to the langmuir isotherm model and the intraparticular diffusion model phosphate adsorption was governed by the combined effect of physi sorption and chemi sorption the occurrence of hydrogen bonding and complexation reactions were determined as the main mechanisms for phosphate adsorption to raw and doped clays the presence of sulphate inhibited the phosphate adsorption limiting the ability of phosphate to form hydrogen bonds at protonated sites of iron doped clays the phosphate adsorption onto clays was also reduced by monovalent anions chloride and bicarbonate exhibited the hofmeister anion series behaviour which is comparable with conventional polymeric anion exchangers finally iron ions were not released during the phosphate adsorption and desorption stages revealing a good chemical stability of iron doped clays the reusability of iron doped clays is limited in comparison to other phosphate adsorbents such as polymeric exchangers however saturated phosphate iron doped clays can be used for soil amendment applications due to their low cost and availability since natural minerals do not provide concerns on accumulation and latter release of hazardous contaminants from the adsorbent to the soil then the use of iron doped clays as single use adsorbents could allow reaching the regulatory levels of total phosphorous in wastewater and being an

13379,the textile industry wastewater is highly harmful to the environment when it is discharged in its raw state since it might contain dyes surfactants and other dissolved compounds that adversely affect the aquatic ecosystems based on the low biodegradability of textile effluents physicochemical processes e g coagulation flocculation are usually indicated and eventually combined with biological treatment which is applied at full scale due to lower costs however the conventional processes have limitations of which it can highlight the low color removal and formation of residual sludge the present work consists of a critical analysis about the alternative processes evaluated to treat effluents generated by mills of the brazilian textile sector an important industrial segment of this country it was verified that the advanced oxidation processes aops as the electrooxidation photo fenton and classical fenton oxidation have been the most effective in reducing color average above 90 and organic matter average above 78 from such effluents in addition coagulation flocculation with plant derived inputs electrocoagulation and unconventional bacterial systems are alternatives that have also been quite efficient analyzing the characteristics of secondary effluents of biological systems normally used to treat textile effluents it was observed that some still have relevant concentrations of pollutants therefore aops have been also evaluated as a polishing step to treat them which were effective to comply with the brazilian environmental agencies for its disposal in water bodies some works described the possibility of reusing the treated effluents showing that many of the alternative processes are also promising in this regard graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords textile effluent reuse toxicity polishing environmental legislation 1 introduction the textile industry is an important sector in brazil which has been operating for almost 200 years the country represents the largest complete textile chain in the west with all stages of production from the cultivation of cotton to obtaining the fiber then spinning weaving fabric production finishing sewing up to retail sales in 2018 the sector had 25 5 thousand formal companies and produced an average of 1 2 million tons of fabrics which positioned itself as the 2nd largest employer in the converting industry in brazil 1 the manufacturing process is based on the preparation of the fibers that are transformed into threads followed by the production of the fabric wet processing and manufacturing of pieces each mill uses different raw material and steps generating effluents with very different characteristics 2 4 in this sector there is a subdivision the textile industry in general which includes all steps of the process and the industrial textile laundry which focuses on finishing the pieces 4 for both types the demand for water is expressive average of 200 m3 of water per ton of textile artifact thus generating a lot of effluent 3 4 due to the input chemicals used in manufacturing textile effluents are rich in pollutants mainly organic matter in addition this residue is usually turbid due to the significant presence of suspended solids such as spent fibers 4 complex and recalcitrant substances such as dyes are also present which did not stick to the fabric fibers during the dyeing stage corresponding to a loss of up to 15 to the effluent 5 they are responsible for the strong coloration of the final textile effluent impairing the passage of light in receiving water bodies and consequently hindering the photosynthesis of aquatic organisms 3 6 additionally they can be toxic and have a carcinogenic teratogenic and or mutagenic potential 6 7 such compounds can also result in unsafe concentrations of heavy metals mainly chromium copper lead and cadmium in the effluent because they are used in the production of some dyeing agents 7 8 due to their complex composition which can cause damages to the environment as well as to humans textile effluent treatment before disposal is essential to abide with the environmental legislation in addition adequate textile effluent treatment may even generate an effluent capable of being reused in certain cases 3 8 thereby helping to relieve stress on water demand in brazil the treatment must be performed to comply with the legislations established by the federal 9 or state environmental agencies 10 for discharging in water bodies most of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in brazil makes use of sieving followed by coagulation flocculation as the preferred choice for treating textile effluents in small industries whereas aerobic biological processes preceded or not by physicochemical treatment are the main choice of larger industries 4 11 although these conventional forms of treatment are relatively well efficient and cheaper in case of biological systems there is a major problem arising from them which is the generation of chemical coagulation flocculation and or biological activated sludge sludge these solid residues are hazardous and must be separated compacted dried and disposed of at an industrial landfill or incinerated thereby increasing treatment costs and environmental impacts 3 6 there is a recent report on the improper disposal of these residues in common waste landfill 12 in addition to sludge other disadvantages of coagulation flocculation are low efficiency in removing reactive dyes and the cost of chemical supplies 3 6 additionally biological processes such as activated sludge are also not effective for azo dye degradation most of discoloration is due to dye adsorption onto the aerobic sludge microorganisms are inhibited by some pollutants needs artificial aeration and normally requires nitrogen and phosphorus supplementation due to the lack of nutrients in textile effluents 4 8 thus alternative treatments or polishing steps to enhance the quality of secondary effluents have been widely studied oxidative physical and biological processes or their combination are gaining prominence as more efficient and economical technologies for the treatment of textile effluents 3 8 although effective some oxidative and physical treatments e g fenton reaction and use of membranes respectively are not yet implemented on a large scale nonetheless such processes have been researched in order to be optimized and applied industrially 13 15 knowing the significance of the textile sector in brazil and acknowledging the large amount of effluents generated and that the conventional treatments have disadvantages limitations this study aims to survey the alternative processes and their efficiencies to remedy effluents from brazilian textile companies industries and industrial laundries this work was based on a bibliographic research between the years 2009 and 2018 10 years through the scopus scielo google scholar and web of science platforms tables addressing the biodegradability of textile effluents and the efficiency of alternative processes applied to raw effluents have been prepared with data from several studies scientific articles book chapters and master theses in addition it has been registered the characteristics of real secondary effluents which have undergone previous treatments as well as alternative processes for polishing them to meet the discharge limits according to current legislation another aspect covered was the possibility of reusing either raw or secondary effluents that had been treated by the different alternative processes reviewed here 2 characteristics of textile effluent and the choice of an alternative treatment it is known that the effluents from textile mills are very heterogeneous 2 3 as can be seen in table 1 the characteristics of effluents from brazilian mills vary significantly concerning the organic matter concentration through data from bod5 and cod there is effluents 70 and 200 times more concentrated than others respectively cod bod5 turbidity and total solids parameters for textile industry effluents are generally higher than those reported for industrial laundries as the former makes use of more steps and chemical inputs and consequently their effluents are more concentrated and complex 4 based on the national council for the environment conama 9 and state environmental agencies 10 such effluents cannot be disposed of in the environment without proper treatment when proposing a treatment scheme one must initially know the composition of the wastewater being studied an important indicator that can guide this decision is the cod bod5 ratio that estimates the biodegradability of effluents when the ratio is lower than 2 5 the effluent has at least 40 biodegradable organic matter being then susceptible to biological treatments which are quite efficient and have a relatively low cost if the ratio is between 2 5 and 3 5 a comparative study should be made in relation to the efficiency of biological and physicochemical treatments and when it is above 3 5 physical chemical processes are more indicated at least as a pretreatment of biological processes due to the high fraction of recalcitrant substances 16 table 2 shows that almost 50 of the reported raw effluents both from the textile industries and from industrial laundries had a cod bod5 ratio above 3 5 this shows that these wastewaters are composed of many recalcitrant substances so physicochemical treatments alone or combined with biological treatment are more appropriate it was also possible to notice that treatment schemes proposed by published works in general are supposedly in accordance with the cod bod5 ratio for example unconventional biological processes have been more applied to effluents with a ratio of less than 2 5 on the other hand aops were the main choice to treat effluents with a low fraction of biodegradable organic matter 3 efficiency of alternative treatments for textile effluents several technologies have been studied to treat textile effluents fig 1 shows the diverse alternative treatments and the number of times each of them has been evaluated to treat raw textile effluents from brazilian industries such processes can be subdivided into physical and physicochemicals which are based on unit operations to separate pollutants from the liquid phase or chemical reactions to transform the pollutants respectively for instance aops are based on oxidation of pollutants through free radicals mainly ho whereas adsorption relies on the transfer of pollutants from the liquid phase to the surface of a material adsorbent in its turn biological processes are dependent on microbial metabolism which can be aerobic anaerobic or a combination of them 3 16 table 3 shows the compilation of the fundamentals some advantages and disadvantages of the most commonly investigated technologies to treat textile effluents as reported in the literature data from several works on the efficiency of treatment technologies applied to textile effluents from brazilian industries are shown in table 4 while table 5 contains data referring to treated effluents from industrial textile laundries some processes were studied by different research groups that obtained different results since each one used a specific sample of effluent which was treated using different experimental conditions therefore when the studies investigated a single treatment but under different experimental conditions the data were reported in the form of a range when researchers evaluated more than one form of treatment as well as combinations of them the data obtained were reported separately among the alternative or emerging processes it is possible to verify that aops are the most studied to treat textile effluents they can promote the degradation of organic pollutants into smaller molecules even mineralizing them fig 2 shows the features of ho radical generated by aops 40 44 95 96 considering the different types of aops the most of the works covered the heterogeneous photocatalysis photoperoxidation h2o2 uv and photo fenton process fe h2o2 uv unlike coagulation flocculation with fe or al salts already implemented in many wwtps 5 8 97 some recent studies have tested natural coagulants such as tannins although the compounds considered green are attractive there is still the generation of residual sludge however less toxic and which can be used in the production of fertilizers or soil amenders 98 electrocoagulation has been considered as another alternative to conventional coagulation flocculation the main difference is the in situ generation of coagulant species 39 it is known that the ph of the effluent from brazilian textile industries varies from 5 to 12 4 most of the treatments proposed in the literature reported the need to adjust the ph so that the treatment applied became more effective a minority did not report such information or performed the treatment with the inherent characteristic of the wastewater which is attractive because it does not generate expenses with acids or alkalis it was observed that unconventional biological treatments are generally evaluated at a ph close to 7 this is because values that are distant from neutrality affect the microorganisms involved in the treatment especially bacteria and favor the growth of other unwanted ones 16 on the other hand fenton processes are evaluated in effluents with the ph changed to near 3 in order to avoid precipitation of the iron based catalyst 40 95 96 the other aops were commonly studied at different ph values as a means of optimization usually many of the works presented here made use of experimental design methodology in which they studied the effect of variables such as ph concentration of reagents and or time hydrogen peroxide is the main source of reactive radicals in aops and the ph is an important parameter since at alkaline conditions h2o2 is easily decomposed in oxygen and water therefore h2o2 based treatments usually require a ph control 95 96 besides that its concentration is another relevant aspect to be considered when treating a textile effluent with h2o2 uv nagel hassemer et al 21 found that h2o2 doses above 500 mg l 1 did not increase effluent discoloration but decreased the reaction rate constant mounteer et al 18 suggested that adding above 170 mg l 1 of h2o2 would be a waste of oxidizing agent when using the same treatment according to the literature excess hydrogen peroxide can scavenge hydroxyl radicals decreasing the oxidation rate of target pollutants 96 other aops can be also affected negatively by high concentrations of h2o2 such as fenton and photo fenton systems 96 99 3 1 efficiency of the treatments and environmental legislation based on conama resolution 430 9 that establishes a minimum reduction of 60 of bod5 for an industrial effluent discharge it is perceived from tables 4 and 5 that 50 of the processes investigated comply with this legislative standard however the cod parameter is not regulated by conama resolution 430 and it is up to the state agencies establish maximum values for cod based discharge or minimum removals of bod5 and cod the agencies establish standards varying from 40 to 180 mg l 1 for bod5 and from 60 to 400 mg l 1 for cod depending on each state minimum efficiency also varies with 30 to 95 for dbo5 and 60 to 90 for cod 10 most of the treatments reviewed here report data that meet the minimum removals of cod and bod5 according to brazilian legislation for treated effluents that do not meet the disposal standards it is often necessary to apply a tertiary treatment polishing total organic carbon toc is another common parameter to measure organic matter concentration in water and effluents but it is not regulated by any environmental agency in brazil even so this parameter has been used by research groups to evaluate the efficiency of the treatments 72 of these studies have shown that toc was reduced by more than 60 with the treatment technologies tested the processes based on the fenton reaction fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho ho were the ones that led to the highest toc reduction although the brazilian environmental agencies do not regulate discharge limits for turbidity and color the routine evaluation of such parameters is important for considering alternative or polishing treatments for textile effluents 89 and 91 of the treatments reviewed here were able to reduce turbidity and color above 60 respectively electrocoagulation anaerobic uasb and combined anaerobic aerobic uasb sab bioreactors microfiltration solar photo fenton photooxidation with semiconductors and electrooxidation were very effective in removing color with efficiencies up to 100 commonly the traditional biological processes mainly the aerobic ones are not efficient in discoloration 6 in the present survey this was not noticed since most biological treatments reduced the color of effluents from industries in general and laundries by more than 80 anaerobic processes can be effective in promoting azo dye reduction mainly in the presence of redox mediators but have the disadvantage of producing an effluent loaded with aromatic amines 100 101 whereas the removal of dyes in aerobic processes are mainly related to their adsorption onto biological flocs 102 with regard to the aops the treatments based on the fenton reaction and its variations have proven to be very effective when comparing the classical fenton oxidation alone chelator aided classical fenton and zero valent iron zvi fenton processes for a same effluent no great differences have been observed between them such processes have the ability of promoting cod toc turbidity and color reductions from 80 to 90 82 83 when treating a textile laundry effluent salgado et al 78 observed that classical fenton and h2o2 uv were more efficient than uv alone in another comparative study the conventional photo fenton system led to better results in the removal of cod than h2o2 uv and photo fenton oxalate which was more efficient only in removing turbidity 74 when evaluating microfiltration followed by photo fenton system alvarenga 17 did not observe significant differences between the two catalysts tested fe2 salt and zvi on the other hand lima et al 72 found that the classical fenton reaction was more effective than tio2 uv h2o2 uv even when compared with the treatment applied by company that supplied the effluent turbidity for example was reduced by 82 through fenton reaction while tio2 uv h2o2 uv and the company wwtp decreased by 0 51 and 66 respectively in the study developed by cardoso et al 66 they compared direct ozonation with uv tio2 uv or tio2 uv electricity using a bubbling reactor among the gases evaluated o3 was more effective than o2 regarding o3 color reduction was high above 95 for all treatments tested after 60 min while cod removals were less than 35 a significant difference between the treatments was observed regarding turbidity removal with the uv o3 system being the most effective when evaluating heterogeneous photocatalysis it has been reported that tio2 based catalysts are quite efficient 33 37 94 the main advantages of using tio2 are that it is a non toxic and of low cost besides being a highly active and stable semiconductor 44 on the other hand the main drawback to the wide application of tio2 to treat industrial wastewaters is related to the difficulties in efficiently immobilize and or recover catalyst from treated effluents 103 104 comparative studies involving different semiconductors observed that the tio2 and nb2o5 were more efficient than zno 33 94 the same research group has found a similar effect between artificial and solar light sources for the different semiconductors in optimized conditions of treatment 33 48 50 94 for photo fenton oxidation the two irradiation sources tested also presented similar effects 54 81 considering that operating cost with sunlight is lower its use is more attractive besides it being a clean and renewable source of energy 44 the influence of ph on heterogeneous photocatalysis was evaluated by tavares et al 30 and souza et al 33 using zno the optimum ph found was 4 0 and 3 0 respectively while higher values of this parameter reduced the discoloration efficiency for tio2 and nb2o5 souza et al 33 observed similar effect of ph in discoloring the same effluent it is known that the ph influences the dissociation of compounds in solution and surface charge properties of the semiconductors thereby affecting the adsorption of the pollutants for further degradation 45 in works involving electrooxidation and photo electrooxidation the most used materials were boron doped diamond and tio2 anodes respectively these treatments promoted varied removal efficiencies of cod and color which were up to 100 evaluating the effect of current density martínez huitle et al 58 observed an increase from 50 to 100 of discoloration increasing from 20 ma cm 2 to 60 ma cm 2 a similar result was obtained by solano et al 60 which evaluated the same current density change and observed an increase of approximately 40 in the cod removal efficiency both works suggested that a greater charge passing into the system improves the electrogeneration of hydroxyl radicals as mentioned earlier some studies have evaluated alternative inputs e g plant extracts in coagulation flocculation to mix or replace conventional coagulants e g fecl3 fig 3 summarizes conventional alternative inputs and their mixtures as reported in the literature natural coagulants are biodegradable safer to human health and hence cause smaller environmental impacts than metallic or polymeric coagulants 5 98 as an example of the efficiency of natural coagulants freitas et al 91 verified a 50 reduction of cod using 320 mg l 1 of fecl3 6h2o by adding 3 2 mg l 1 of okra mucilage as a coagulation aid it was possible to decrease the concentration of fecl3 6h2o to 88 mg l 1 while attaining a higher reduction of cod 86 opuntia ficus indica cactus was tested by souza et al 90 to treat jeans washing laundry effluent by using 160 mg l 1 of fecl3 6h2o 2 6 mg l 1 of cactus extract at ph 5 led to the removal of 65 of cod and 91 of turbidity the same study tested the cactus extract to treat a fabric dyeing effluent and obtained removals of 87 for cod and 94 for turbidity at the optimal conditions fecl3 6h2o 640 mg l 1 cactus extract 160 mg l 1 ph 6 when using 10 mg l 1 of cereus peruvianus cactus mucilage with 320 mg l 1 of fecl3 6h2o at ph 5 souza et al 68 observed removals of 58 3 for cod and 85 4 for turbidity chayote residue was also evaluated and high removals 98 of turbidity and 84 of cod were observed in presence of 15 mg l 1 of this natural coagulant combined with 47 4 mg l 1 of fecl3 at ph 6 14 93 in general when conventional and natural coagulants are mixed the amount of the former can be reduced on the other hand some works studied commercial tannins as the only coagulant of textile effluents and observed reductions above 90 for both color and turbidity 79 85 when natural coagulant is used only less sludge is generated which is more susceptible to biological treatment 5 the use of moringa oleifera seeds which contains cationic proteins was also tested as coagulant by ströher et al 85 and led to removal efficiencies lower than tannin 74 for color and 79 for turbidity unlike conventional coagulants tannins and m oleifera proved to be efficient in removing color and turbidity without ph adjustment however the cod parameter increased by 12 4 with the latter due to organic matter from a high concentration of seeds evaluated 1600 mg l 1 souza et al 92 in turn compared tannin with aluminum sulfate and poly aluminum chloride pac and found the latter was the most effective to coagulate a textile effluent such study also evaluated the use of aluminum electrodes and found that electrocoagulation was the least effective iron 32 77 and stainless acid electrodes 73 were used by other authors in electrocoagulation treatments cerqueira et al 47 compared different electrode compositions iron aluminum or iron aluminum under varied experimental conditions and reported that the best removal efficiencies were attained with aluminum although it is a very studied technique in bench scale a brazilian textile company makes use of sieving followed by electrocoagulation as the main treatment step of its effluent 105 for the treatment of textile effluents employing adsorbents different materials have been tested as a single treatment or as a polishing step ribeiro et al 52 evaluated three agro industrial residues sugarcane and coconut bagasses as well as orange pomace to adsorb pollutants of raw textile effluent the first material removed 79 of the effluent color the second 48 while orange pomace was not effective silva et al 67 verified that only for the effluent diluted 60 v v color and cod removals above 80 were obtained through adsorption with orange waste powder on the other hand when applying adsorption process to polish an effluent that had been treated with ultrafiltration the discoloration increased from 70 9 to 84 4 26 interestingly the addition of the most known adsorbent powdered activated carbon in submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor improved cod and color removals from textile effluents this was supposedly due to a combined effect of adsorption of toxic and recalcitrant compounds and the presence of redox mediators e g quinone groups on the activated carbon surface such a system evaluated by baêta et al 56 65 is outlined in fig 4 a small percentage 20 of the works reviewed here studied biological processes knowing that textile effluent do not have significant amounts of n p and other micronutrients 4 106 some works reported the need to supplement them prior to the use of biological processes in addition to n and p organic redox mediators have also been tested for different research groups to accelerate color removal 27 56 65 it is worth to mention that supplementing an effluent can increase its organic content which may become a problem if the treatment is not effective unfortunately pizato et al 35 verified that nutrient and carbon source supplementation with magnesium sulfate potassium phosphate sucrose and ammonium nitrate followed by fungal treatment discolored above 90 but dramatically increased the cod and total phenols of the tested effluent on the other hand the addition of wheat bran 0 5 m v or yeast extract 0 05 m v as a source of nitrogen promoted different effects in discoloring a textile effluent dependent of trametes strains as tested by lisboa et al 34 for example they verified that the yeast extract stimulated the discoloration by t asperellum but inhibited t virens in order to have an overview of the efficiency of the treatments reviewed box plot graphs were assembled with the cod and color removal data fig 5 since these are the parameters mostly reported in the tables aforementioned only treatments studied more than twice were considered with the number on top of the boxes corresponding to the amount of times each system was tested when a study varied operating parameters the data of the optimized system were considered here when analyzing data on cod removal electrooxidation was shown to be the most efficient treatment reducing this parameter by an average of 98 the photo fenton system membranes and classical fenton were also very efficient whose average reductions were 86 80 and 78 respectively according to discoloration data it was observed that all treatments reduced color with an average higher than 70 electrooxidation electrocoagulation classical fenton and photo fenton for example were the treatments that exhibited average color removals above 90 therefore when comparing both cod and color removals the electrooxidation photo fenton and modified bacterial treatments deserve to be highlighted as they exhibited low variability between different studies for the two parameters despite having a larger amount of data this is very interesting because it shows that these treatments are efficient when applied to effluents from different companies that produce different fabrics use different inputs and are located in different regions of the country table 6 shows the physicochemical characteristics of secondary textile effluents that is which have undergone previous biological treatment even with a limited number of data there are samples with a higher concentration of organic matter than others all works using secondary effluents reported here were also treated by using an alternative process most studied aops mainly based on the fenton reaction the minority did not adjust the ph or did not mention this aspect considering the brazilian environmental agencies 10 it is seen that secondary effluents treated by the investigated technologies comply with the standards for disposal of effluents in water bodies it is noteworthy that it is not possible to compare these data with legislation regarding the percentage of bod5 and cod removal since raw effluent data is not available nevertheless it can be seen that more than half of the processes led to cod removals higher than 60 enough data on cod5 has been reported and it is seen that there are effluents that fell within the limits by brazilian legislation 10 regarding the color most studies have reported reductions over 80 the works published by nagel hassemer et al 21 guimarães et al 25 and teixeira et al 62 were the only ones that treated both raw and secondary effluents through h2o2 uv photo fenton and adsorption respectively the treatments were more efficient in removing pollutants from raw effluents which are more concentrated the first study observed that the application of conventional secondary treatment before h2o2 uv enabled the use of a lower concentration of oxidizing agent the other two works reported that secondary treatment with activated sludge efficiently reduced organic matter from the effluent but not its color when a polishing step was evaluated the discoloration was above 70 thus complementing the conventional biological treatment in general the vast majority of the studies reviewed here evaluated the treatments in bench scale up to 10 l either with raw or secondary effluent the few studies carried out in pilot scale 50 to 500 l tested unconventional biological treatments 24 84 86 or aops 37 75 as far as reactor operation is concerned most studies employed batch mode while a few employed continuous flow systems bench scale studies operating in batch mode are essential for a parametric evaluation to find optimum treatment conditions however scaled up studies must be encouraged aiming at real application continuous flow is also an important way to treat large amounts of effluents generated uninterruptedly as in big size companies an interesting pilot scale reactor was used by starling et al 75 when studying the solar photo fenton oxidation the photo reactor constructed by them has a total volume of 55 l being composed of five borosilicate tubes that were connected in series by polyvinylchloride junctions and a recirculation tank to operate in batch mode below each tube there were anodized aluminum reflectors which were oriented to the north and tilted 20 an optimized condition of this system was reached with 20 mg l 1 of fe2 500 mg l 1 of h2o2 and ph 3 reducing on average 90 of the cod and color of real effluent samples 75 3 2 toxicity of textile effluents treated by alternative processes a major problem with textile effluent besides the high color and organic matter concentration is its toxicity 2 4 this parameter should also be reduced when considering the discharge of treated effluents into water bodies 9 10 to verify whether an alternative treatment is efficient in this regard some authors usually report lc50 lethal concentration that causes the death of 50 of the organisms values derived from acute toxicity tests in many of the studies reviewed here the germination of plant seeds or the quantity of surviving organisms colonies after exposure to effluents was analyzed regarding textile effluents treated by aops garcia et al 48 used lactuca sativa seeds and verified that the effluent treated by tio2 uv or tio2 h2o2 uv did not have its toxicity reduced significantly after 6 h on the other hand in experiments with artemia salina such authors found that the treated effluents were less toxic since they increased the percentage of live microcrustaceans from 67 raw effluent to 100 and 90 respectively 49 the treatment with h2o2 exhibited a toxicity reduction lower than the treatment in its absence this might have happened due to residual h2o2 since the authors do not report its elimination only one research group 74 75 reported the use of the catalase enzyme to remove the residual h2o2 starling et al 75 used aliivibrio fischeri and observed that an effluent treated by solar photo fenton had its acute toxicity reduced from 3 to 1 which is equivalent to the absence of toxicity according to the authors with a salina the photocatalytic treatment of a laundry effluent completely eliminated its acute toxicity since the lc50 of the treated effluents was greater than 100 no matter the semiconductor tested 94 daphnia similis was used to evaluate the toxicity of an industrial effluent treated with h2o2 uv less toxicity was observed when the treatment lasted longer with higher doses of h2o2 and ph below 7 18 nagel hassemer et al 21 also studied h2o2 uv to treat textile effluents and used daphnia magna for acute toxicity and tilapia cf rendalli for mutagenicity tests no toxicity was observed in the treated effluents since lc50 increased from 26 8 to 82 and 100 when using 750 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 of h2o2 respectively in addition the treated effluents did not exhibit mutagenicity when investigating the effect of electrocoagulation the lowest toxicity level of a laundry effluent for l sativa and a salina was reached in shorter treatment times lc50 of the effluent was increased from 21 to 41 after 5 min and reduced to 29 after 30 min according to the authors more toxic forms of nitrogen were generated as the treatment time increased 77 using the same microcrustacean palácio et al 32 analyzed electrocoagulation heterogeneous photocatalysis and the combination of both they found that the toxicity of the laundry effluent treated by the tandem processes electrocoagulation photocatalysis reduced more than the separate processes a lc50 of 94 was observed after 6 h of combined electrocoagulation photocatalysis while the isolated treatments generated an effluent with lc50 of 70 electrocoagulation after 1 5 h and 75 photocatalysis after 6 h in another study electrocoagulation was slightly more effective than conventional coagulation with aluminum sulfate since the mortality of 100 for a salina was reduced to 0 and 6 9 respectively 64 using the test organism d magna it was found that using sequential anaerobic aerobic biological treatments decreased the toxicity of textile laundry wastewaters 24 86 treatment in a fluidized bed bioreactor also significantly decreased by 87 the acute toxicity of an effluent to d magna 31 when treating an effluent with fungi miranda et al 27 found that c lunata removed toxicity for allium cepa while with p chrysosporium an increase in the toxicity was observed according to the authors the mutagenic effects were probably associated with the oxidized metabolite found in the effluent treated by this fungus the biological treatment evaluated by pizato et al 35 also increased toxicity for a salina since the lc50 decreased from 14 7 to 5 the authors also attributed their results to the possible generation of toxic metabolites in addition to the partial degradation of dyes and the decrease in the ph of the medium to near 2 0 on the other hand increased toxicity has also been observed in some studies which treated textile effluents by aops for example the h2o2 uv system proved to be inefficient when the algae pseudokirchneriella subcapitata was tested since the lc50 decreased from 2 50 to 0 05 v v after treatment the increased toxicity of the treated effluent was probably due to the residual h2o2 and the presence of cu2 ions formed during the degradation of a dye used by the industry under study according to the authors 20 franco and azevedo 28 also noticed a small increase in the toxicity of the effluent treated by h2o2 uv or uv alone the lc50 decreased from 49 5 to 39 9 and 39 1 respectively using l sativa in testing this same organism the electrooxidation and photo electrooxidation treatments increased the toxicity of a textile effluent from 26 to 1 5 and 1 7 respectively 51 the last two studies suggested the formation of products more toxic than their precursors which were not identified arcanjo et al 111 used d similis and verified that photocatalysis with tio2 or hydrotalcite iron tio2 of a secondary textile effluent reduced its toxicity since the lc50 value went from 70 7 to 95 and 78 6 respectively likewise dalari 113 found that heterogeneous photo fenton process decreased the toxicity of a secondary textile laundry effluent but it was still considered slightly toxic since it did not allow l sativa germination above 80 according to the authors 3 3 cost analysis although it is a very important aspect in choosing a treatment for real application few studies reviewed here have performed cost analysis for example the integration of microfiltration with ultrafiltration was the least costly process reaching 0 31 m 3 69 starling et al 74 compared the cost of three oxidative treatments being the photoperoxidation the most expensive 2 24 m 3 due the longtime tested of artificial light irradiation photo fenton cost was 0 91 m 3 lower than photo fenton oxalate 1 07 m 3 due to addition of the chemical as brazil is a very sun irradiated country employing natural light could reduce the cost of photo oxidation treatments electro oxidation with boron doped diamond anode is a more expensive treatment when compared to the other aforementioned ranging from 3 28 to 20 99 m 3 depending on the energy consumed type of salt added nacl na2so4 and its concentration for the highest tested nacl concentration 30 g l 1 it was observed the lowest cost of treatment due to the lower consumption of energy although the undesired production of chloroform occurred from this electrolyte 60 4 reuse of textile effluents submitted to alternative treatments in addition to the discharge into water bodies another goal of a treatment is the possibility of reusing water resources demanding less fresh water some industrial textile laundries in the country have already been doing this the laundries cited by lenhard et al 19 and viana et al 114 reuse the effluent conventionally treated by physicochemical and biological processes while the companies approached by marcelino 84 and porto and schoenhals 115 reuse a physicochemically treated effluent however such works do not report how these wastewaters are reused in a recent survey carried out in the brazilian state of pernambuco it was found that 89 of laundries are reusing treated effluent but in small quantities since it is difficult to store the effluent or carry out direct reuse 116 unfortunately brazilian legislation has not yet set standards for industrial reuse of effluents although there are a few laws which are not specific for industrial effluents 10 117 therefore research usually draws arbitrary conclusions about reuse based on the reduction of certain physicochemical parameters the reviewed works have considered that when the percentage of removal of some characterization parameter is high the treated effluent is suitable for reuse it is seen that color and turbidity are the most relevant parameters for industrial reuse since the treated effluent should not interfere with the dyeing of the fabrics alvarenga 17 for example mentions that it may be feasible to reuse membrane treated effluent followed by photo fenton oxidation due to observed high reduction in color and organic matter photocatalysis with immobilized tio2 has proven to be a promising alternative for the generation of an effluent proper to reuse since it often leads to high discoloration 19 baêta et al 56 suggested that it is possible to reuse wastewater treated by membranes coupled to bioreactors based on observed removals of color turbidity and cod coagulation flocculation followed by flotation in their turn proved to be viable for the generation of reuse water based on color and turbidity removals according to gonçalves et al 89 souza et al 90 showed that pac based coagulation removed 90 of the color of an effluent indicating high potential of recycling water with such technology besides color turbidity and cod other characterization parameters of treated effluent should also be paid attention when considering its reuse electrocoagulation for example did not reduce nacl concentration of textile effluent and this was considered an attraction for its reuse as it would be a way to save this chemical input in the dyeing stage 73 microfiltration alone or followed by nanofiltration or a microfiltration membrane bioreactor also proved to be efficient in retaining another chemical input the indigo dye which is widely used in dyeing jeans 69 71 87 some works have specified at which step the treated wastewater should be reused permeates from micro and nanofiltered effluents has been indicated to be reused in less demanding processes as washing of equipment and floors 69 71 since the treated effluent can be used in the dyeing step with a new dye load some works have evaluated this approach fenton and photo fenton processes proved to be viable because they did not affect the quality of dyeing when using treated effluent according to ribeiro et al 110 a jeans laundry effluent treated by photocatalysis was used to manufacture cotton fabric which went through the desizing bleaching dyeing and softening steps the treated effluent did not interfere with the quality of the fabric as it remained unstained and with color intensity similar to the control 37 starling et al 74 compared an effluent from light tissues dyeing step which was treated by photo fenton photo fenton oxalate h2o2 uv and a reclaimed effluent chlorination filtration the authors found similarities between the characteristics of aop treated effluents and reclaimed water and considered all them suitable for reuse in dark tissue dyeing the same group 75 evaluated an effluent treated by solar photo fenton in the dyeing and washing stages and the fabrics obtained did not exhibit spots stains or change of tone for a secondary effluent fortino 97 mentions that the high color reduction of the effluent treated by reverse osmosis with spiral module indicates the possibility of reusing it in the dyeing stage on the other hand two other forms of treatment tested were not effective according to the author ultrafiltration did not reduce enough color and the osmosis treatment with a flat module was not considered viable since it recovered small volumes of water 5 concluding remarks and perspectives textile sector is one of the main sources of environmental pollution knowing that the effluent generated by brazilian textile industries is rich in pollutants besides being highly coloured its treatment before disposal is essential since conventional biological processes and coagulation flocculation have limitations in treating such effluents alternative technologies have been researched and reviewed here these attempts are important to treat textile effluents so that environmental discharge limits or reuse standards are met aops mainly electrooxidation photo fenton and classical fenton oxidation are physicochemical processes widely studied to treat textile effluents which seem promising due to reported high reduction of color and cod average above 90 and 78 respectively electrooxidation was shown to be the most efficient treatment by reducing the cod with an average of 98 considering the different photooxidation treatments reviewed the similar efficiency between artificial and solar light indicates the use of the latter is more attractive because it employs a clean and renewable source of energy besides that the use of sunlight can minimize the high requirement of energy by aops coagulation with tannins and electrocoagulation are treatments that have also been extensively investigated with competitive results when compared with conventional coagulants reaching average cod reductions around 68 and 74 respectively it has also been verified that the addition of different plant derived inputs can decrease the requirement for conventional chemicals without any loss of efficiency in the coagulation flocculation processes thus the use of them must be encouraged because of their eco friendly nature contrary to conventional activated sludge modified bacterial processes i e with addition of redox mediators and activated carbon were efficient in removing above 80 the color of effluents while those based on fungus can increase adversely the toxicity of the treated effluents due the excreted metabolites for secondary effluents generated after conventional biological treatment it is observed that their physicochemical characteristics do not meet current brazilian environmental standards indicating the need for a tertiary treatment the most studied polishing techniques researched for this are the ones based on aops which seem quite effective to comply with the current legislation different researches have described reduction of toxicity and production of an effluent adequate for industrial reuse hence indicating many of these emerging technologies are promising and should be further evaluated for their economic and environmental sustainability for future studies it is recommended further tests on a pilot scale cost analysis of different technologies as well as continuous flow operation for real application credit authorship contribution statement márcio d n ramos data curation formal analysis writing original draft juan p p lima data curation formal analysis sergio f

13379,the textile industry wastewater is highly harmful to the environment when it is discharged in its raw state since it might contain dyes surfactants and other dissolved compounds that adversely affect the aquatic ecosystems based on the low biodegradability of textile effluents physicochemical processes e g coagulation flocculation are usually indicated and eventually combined with biological treatment which is applied at full scale due to lower costs however the conventional processes have limitations of which it can highlight the low color removal and formation of residual sludge the present work consists of a critical analysis about the alternative processes evaluated to treat effluents generated by mills of the brazilian textile sector an important industrial segment of this country it was verified that the advanced oxidation processes aops as the electrooxidation photo fenton and classical fenton oxidation have been the most effective in reducing color average above 90 and organic matter average above 78 from such effluents in addition coagulation flocculation with plant derived inputs electrocoagulation and unconventional bacterial systems are alternatives that have also been quite efficient analyzing the characteristics of secondary effluents of biological systems normally used to treat textile effluents it was observed that some still have relevant concentrations of pollutants therefore aops have been also evaluated as a polishing step to treat them which were effective to comply with the brazilian environmental agencies for its disposal in water bodies some works described the possibility of reusing the treated effluents showing that many of the alternative processes are also promising in this regard graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords textile effluent reuse toxicity polishing environmental legislation 1 introduction the textile industry is an important sector in brazil which has been operating for almost 200 years the country represents the largest complete textile chain in the west with all stages of production from the cultivation of cotton to obtaining the fiber then spinning weaving fabric production finishing sewing up to retail sales in 2018 the sector had 25 5 thousand formal companies and produced an average of 1 2 million tons of fabrics which positioned itself as the 2nd largest employer in the converting industry in brazil 1 the manufacturing process is based on the preparation of the fibers that are transformed into threads followed by the production of the fabric wet processing and manufacturing of pieces each mill uses different raw material and steps generating effluents with very different characteristics 2 4 in this sector there is a subdivision the textile industry in general which includes all steps of the process and the industrial textile laundry which focuses on finishing the pieces 4 for both types the demand for water is expressive average of 200 m3 of water per ton of textile artifact thus generating a lot of effluent 3 4 due to the input chemicals used in manufacturing textile effluents are rich in pollutants mainly organic matter in addition this residue is usually turbid due to the significant presence of suspended solids such as spent fibers 4 complex and recalcitrant substances such as dyes are also present which did not stick to the fabric fibers during the dyeing stage corresponding to a loss of up to 15 to the effluent 5 they are responsible for the strong coloration of the final textile effluent impairing the passage of light in receiving water bodies and consequently hindering the photosynthesis of aquatic organisms 3 6 additionally they can be toxic and have a carcinogenic teratogenic and or mutagenic potential 6 7 such compounds can also result in unsafe concentrations of heavy metals mainly chromium copper lead and cadmium in the effluent because they are used in the production of some dyeing agents 7 8 due to their complex composition which can cause damages to the environment as well as to humans textile effluent treatment before disposal is essential to abide with the environmental legislation in addition adequate textile effluent treatment may even generate an effluent capable of being reused in certain cases 3 8 thereby helping to relieve stress on water demand in brazil the treatment must be performed to comply with the legislations established by the federal 9 or state environmental agencies 10 for discharging in water bodies most of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in brazil makes use of sieving followed by coagulation flocculation as the preferred choice for treating textile effluents in small industries whereas aerobic biological processes preceded or not by physicochemical treatment are the main choice of larger industries 4 11 although these conventional forms of treatment are relatively well efficient and cheaper in case of biological systems there is a major problem arising from them which is the generation of chemical coagulation flocculation and or biological activated sludge sludge these solid residues are hazardous and must be separated compacted dried and disposed of at an industrial landfill or incinerated thereby increasing treatment costs and environmental impacts 3 6 there is a recent report on the improper disposal of these residues in common waste landfill 12 in addition to sludge other disadvantages of coagulation flocculation are low efficiency in removing reactive dyes and the cost of chemical supplies 3 6 additionally biological processes such as activated sludge are also not effective for azo dye degradation most of discoloration is due to dye adsorption onto the aerobic sludge microorganisms are inhibited by some pollutants needs artificial aeration and normally requires nitrogen and phosphorus supplementation due to the lack of nutrients in textile effluents 4 8 thus alternative treatments or polishing steps to enhance the quality of secondary effluents have been widely studied oxidative physical and biological processes or their combination are gaining prominence as more efficient and economical technologies for the treatment of textile effluents 3 8 although effective some oxidative and physical treatments e g fenton reaction and use of membranes respectively are not yet implemented on a large scale nonetheless such processes have been researched in order to be optimized and applied industrially 13 15 knowing the significance of the textile sector in brazil and acknowledging the large amount of effluents generated and that the conventional treatments have disadvantages limitations this study aims to survey the alternative processes and their efficiencies to remedy effluents from brazilian textile companies industries and industrial laundries this work was based on a bibliographic research between the years 2009 and 2018 10 years through the scopus scielo google scholar and web of science platforms tables addressing the biodegradability of textile effluents and the efficiency of alternative processes applied to raw effluents have been prepared with data from several studies scientific articles book chapters and master theses in addition it has been registered the characteristics of real secondary effluents which have undergone previous treatments as well as alternative processes for polishing them to meet the discharge limits according to current legislation another aspect covered was the possibility of reusing either raw or secondary effluents that had been treated by the different alternative processes reviewed here 2 characteristics of textile effluent and the choice of an alternative treatment it is known that the effluents from textile mills are very heterogeneous 2 3 as can be seen in table 1 the characteristics of effluents from brazilian mills vary significantly concerning the organic matter concentration through data from bod5 and cod there is effluents 70 and 200 times more concentrated than others respectively cod bod5 turbidity and total solids parameters for textile industry effluents are generally higher than those reported for industrial laundries as the former makes use of more steps and chemical inputs and consequently their effluents are more concentrated and complex 4 based on the national council for the environment conama 9 and state environmental agencies 10 such effluents cannot be disposed of in the environment without proper treatment when proposing a treatment scheme one must initially know the composition of the wastewater being studied an important indicator that can guide this decision is the cod bod5 ratio that estimates the biodegradability of effluents when the ratio is lower than 2 5 the effluent has at least 40 biodegradable organic matter being then susceptible to biological treatments which are quite efficient and have a relatively low cost if the ratio is between 2 5 and 3 5 a comparative study should be made in relation to the efficiency of biological and physicochemical treatments and when it is above 3 5 physical chemical processes are more indicated at least as a pretreatment of biological processes due to the high fraction of recalcitrant substances 16 table 2 shows that almost 50 of the reported raw effluents both from the textile industries and from industrial laundries had a cod bod5 ratio above 3 5 this shows that these wastewaters are composed of many recalcitrant substances so physicochemical treatments alone or combined with biological treatment are more appropriate it was also possible to notice that treatment schemes proposed by published works in general are supposedly in accordance with the cod bod5 ratio for example unconventional biological processes have been more applied to effluents with a ratio of less than 2 5 on the other hand aops were the main choice to treat effluents with a low fraction of biodegradable organic matter 3 efficiency of alternative treatments for textile effluents several technologies have been studied to treat textile effluents fig 1 shows the diverse alternative treatments and the number of times each of them has been evaluated to treat raw textile effluents from brazilian industries such processes can be subdivided into physical and physicochemicals which are based on unit operations to separate pollutants from the liquid phase or chemical reactions to transform the pollutants respectively for instance aops are based on oxidation of pollutants through free radicals mainly ho whereas adsorption relies on the transfer of pollutants from the liquid phase to the surface of a material adsorbent in its turn biological processes are dependent on microbial metabolism which can be aerobic anaerobic or a combination of them 3 16 table 3 shows the compilation of the fundamentals some advantages and disadvantages of the most commonly investigated technologies to treat textile effluents as reported in the literature data from several works on the efficiency of treatment technologies applied to textile effluents from brazilian industries are shown in table 4 while table 5 contains data referring to treated effluents from industrial textile laundries some processes were studied by different research groups that obtained different results since each one used a specific sample of effluent which was treated using different experimental conditions therefore when the studies investigated a single treatment but under different experimental conditions the data were reported in the form of a range when researchers evaluated more than one form of treatment as well as combinations of them the data obtained were reported separately among the alternative or emerging processes it is possible to verify that aops are the most studied to treat textile effluents they can promote the degradation of organic pollutants into smaller molecules even mineralizing them fig 2 shows the features of ho radical generated by aops 40 44 95 96 considering the different types of aops the most of the works covered the heterogeneous photocatalysis photoperoxidation h2o2 uv and photo fenton process fe h2o2 uv unlike coagulation flocculation with fe or al salts already implemented in many wwtps 5 8 97 some recent studies have tested natural coagulants such as tannins although the compounds considered green are attractive there is still the generation of residual sludge however less toxic and which can be used in the production of fertilizers or soil amenders 98 electrocoagulation has been considered as another alternative to conventional coagulation flocculation the main difference is the in situ generation of coagulant species 39 it is known that the ph of the effluent from brazilian textile industries varies from 5 to 12 4 most of the treatments proposed in the literature reported the need to adjust the ph so that the treatment applied became more effective a minority did not report such information or performed the treatment with the inherent characteristic of the wastewater which is attractive because it does not generate expenses with acids or alkalis it was observed that unconventional biological treatments are generally evaluated at a ph close to 7 this is because values that are distant from neutrality affect the microorganisms involved in the treatment especially bacteria and favor the growth of other unwanted ones 16 on the other hand fenton processes are evaluated in effluents with the ph changed to near 3 in order to avoid precipitation of the iron based catalyst 40 95 96 the other aops were commonly studied at different ph values as a means of optimization usually many of the works presented here made use of experimental design methodology in which they studied the effect of variables such as ph concentration of reagents and or time hydrogen peroxide is the main source of reactive radicals in aops and the ph is an important parameter since at alkaline conditions h2o2 is easily decomposed in oxygen and water therefore h2o2 based treatments usually require a ph control 95 96 besides that its concentration is another relevant aspect to be considered when treating a textile effluent with h2o2 uv nagel hassemer et al 21 found that h2o2 doses above 500 mg l 1 did not increase effluent discoloration but decreased the reaction rate constant mounteer et al 18 suggested that adding above 170 mg l 1 of h2o2 would be a waste of oxidizing agent when using the same treatment according to the literature excess hydrogen peroxide can scavenge hydroxyl radicals decreasing the oxidation rate of target pollutants 96 other aops can be also affected negatively by high concentrations of h2o2 such as fenton and photo fenton systems 96 99 3 1 efficiency of the treatments and environmental legislation based on conama resolution 430 9 that establishes a minimum reduction of 60 of bod5 for an industrial effluent discharge it is perceived from tables 4 and 5 that 50 of the processes investigated comply with this legislative standard however the cod parameter is not regulated by conama resolution 430 and it is up to the state agencies establish maximum values for cod based discharge or minimum removals of bod5 and cod the agencies establish standards varying from 40 to 180 mg l 1 for bod5 and from 60 to 400 mg l 1 for cod depending on each state minimum efficiency also varies with 30 to 95 for dbo5 and 60 to 90 for cod 10 most of the treatments reviewed here report data that meet the minimum removals of cod and bod5 according to brazilian legislation for treated effluents that do not meet the disposal standards it is often necessary to apply a tertiary treatment polishing total organic carbon toc is another common parameter to measure organic matter concentration in water and effluents but it is not regulated by any environmental agency in brazil even so this parameter has been used by research groups to evaluate the efficiency of the treatments 72 of these studies have shown that toc was reduced by more than 60 with the treatment technologies tested the processes based on the fenton reaction fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho ho were the ones that led to the highest toc reduction although the brazilian environmental agencies do not regulate discharge limits for turbidity and color the routine evaluation of such parameters is important for considering alternative or polishing treatments for textile effluents 89 and 91 of the treatments reviewed here were able to reduce turbidity and color above 60 respectively electrocoagulation anaerobic uasb and combined anaerobic aerobic uasb sab bioreactors microfiltration solar photo fenton photooxidation with semiconductors and electrooxidation were very effective in removing color with efficiencies up to 100 commonly the traditional biological processes mainly the aerobic ones are not efficient in discoloration 6 in the present survey this was not noticed since most biological treatments reduced the color of effluents from industries in general and laundries by more than 80 anaerobic processes can be effective in promoting azo dye reduction mainly in the presence of redox mediators but have the disadvantage of producing an effluent loaded with aromatic amines 100 101 whereas the removal of dyes in aerobic processes are mainly related to their adsorption onto biological flocs 102 with regard to the aops the treatments based on the fenton reaction and its variations have proven to be very effective when comparing the classical fenton oxidation alone chelator aided classical fenton and zero valent iron zvi fenton processes for a same effluent no great differences have been observed between them such processes have the ability of promoting cod toc turbidity and color reductions from 80 to 90 82 83 when treating a textile laundry effluent salgado et al 78 observed that classical fenton and h2o2 uv were more efficient than uv alone in another comparative study the conventional photo fenton system led to better results in the removal of cod than h2o2 uv and photo fenton oxalate which was more efficient only in removing turbidity 74 when evaluating microfiltration followed by photo fenton system alvarenga 17 did not observe significant differences between the two catalysts tested fe2 salt and zvi on the other hand lima et al 72 found that the classical fenton reaction was more effective than tio2 uv h2o2 uv even when compared with the treatment applied by company that supplied the effluent turbidity for example was reduced by 82 through fenton reaction while tio2 uv h2o2 uv and the company wwtp decreased by 0 51 and 66 respectively in the study developed by cardoso et al 66 they compared direct ozonation with uv tio2 uv or tio2 uv electricity using a bubbling reactor among the gases evaluated o3 was more effective than o2 regarding o3 color reduction was high above 95 for all treatments tested after 60 min while cod removals were less than 35 a significant difference between the treatments was observed regarding turbidity removal with the uv o3 system being the most effective when evaluating heterogeneous photocatalysis it has been reported that tio2 based catalysts are quite efficient 33 37 94 the main advantages of using tio2 are that it is a non toxic and of low cost besides being a highly active and stable semiconductor 44 on the other hand the main drawback to the wide application of tio2 to treat industrial wastewaters is related to the difficulties in efficiently immobilize and or recover catalyst from treated effluents 103 104 comparative studies involving different semiconductors observed that the tio2 and nb2o5 were more efficient than zno 33 94 the same research group has found a similar effect between artificial and solar light sources for the different semiconductors in optimized conditions of treatment 33 48 50 94 for photo fenton oxidation the two irradiation sources tested also presented similar effects 54 81 considering that operating cost with sunlight is lower its use is more attractive besides it being a clean and renewable source of energy 44 the influence of ph on heterogeneous photocatalysis was evaluated by tavares et al 30 and souza et al 33 using zno the optimum ph found was 4 0 and 3 0 respectively while higher values of this parameter reduced the discoloration efficiency for tio2 and nb2o5 souza et al 33 observed similar effect of ph in discoloring the same effluent it is known that the ph influences the dissociation of compounds in solution and surface charge properties of the semiconductors thereby affecting the adsorption of the pollutants for further degradation 45 in works involving electrooxidation and photo electrooxidation the most used materials were boron doped diamond and tio2 anodes respectively these treatments promoted varied removal efficiencies of cod and color which were up to 100 evaluating the effect of current density martínez huitle et al 58 observed an increase from 50 to 100 of discoloration increasing from 20 ma cm 2 to 60 ma cm 2 a similar result was obtained by solano et al 60 which evaluated the same current density change and observed an increase of approximately 40 in the cod removal efficiency both works suggested that a greater charge passing into the system improves the electrogeneration of hydroxyl radicals as mentioned earlier some studies have evaluated alternative inputs e g plant extracts in coagulation flocculation to mix or replace conventional coagulants e g fecl3 fig 3 summarizes conventional alternative inputs and their mixtures as reported in the literature natural coagulants are biodegradable safer to human health and hence cause smaller environmental impacts than metallic or polymeric coagulants 5 98 as an example of the efficiency of natural coagulants freitas et al 91 verified a 50 reduction of cod using 320 mg l 1 of fecl3 6h2o by adding 3 2 mg l 1 of okra mucilage as a coagulation aid it was possible to decrease the concentration of fecl3 6h2o to 88 mg l 1 while attaining a higher reduction of cod 86 opuntia ficus indica cactus was tested by souza et al 90 to treat jeans washing laundry effluent by using 160 mg l 1 of fecl3 6h2o 2 6 mg l 1 of cactus extract at ph 5 led to the removal of 65 of cod and 91 of turbidity the same study tested the cactus extract to treat a fabric dyeing effluent and obtained removals of 87 for cod and 94 for turbidity at the optimal conditions fecl3 6h2o 640 mg l 1 cactus extract 160 mg l 1 ph 6 when using 10 mg l 1 of cereus peruvianus cactus mucilage with 320 mg l 1 of fecl3 6h2o at ph 5 souza et al 68 observed removals of 58 3 for cod and 85 4 for turbidity chayote residue was also evaluated and high removals 98 of turbidity and 84 of cod were observed in presence of 15 mg l 1 of this natural coagulant combined with 47 4 mg l 1 of fecl3 at ph 6 14 93 in general when conventional and natural coagulants are mixed the amount of the former can be reduced on the other hand some works studied commercial tannins as the only coagulant of textile effluents and observed reductions above 90 for both color and turbidity 79 85 when natural coagulant is used only less sludge is generated which is more susceptible to biological treatment 5 the use of moringa oleifera seeds which contains cationic proteins was also tested as coagulant by ströher et al 85 and led to removal efficiencies lower than tannin 74 for color and 79 for turbidity unlike conventional coagulants tannins and m oleifera proved to be efficient in removing color and turbidity without ph adjustment however the cod parameter increased by 12 4 with the latter due to organic matter from a high concentration of seeds evaluated 1600 mg l 1 souza et al 92 in turn compared tannin with aluminum sulfate and poly aluminum chloride pac and found the latter was the most effective to coagulate a textile effluent such study also evaluated the use of aluminum electrodes and found that electrocoagulation was the least effective iron 32 77 and stainless acid electrodes 73 were used by other authors in electrocoagulation treatments cerqueira et al 47 compared different electrode compositions iron aluminum or iron aluminum under varied experimental conditions and reported that the best removal efficiencies were attained with aluminum although it is a very studied technique in bench scale a brazilian textile company makes use of sieving followed by electrocoagulation as the main treatment step of its effluent 105 for the treatment of textile effluents employing adsorbents different materials have been tested as a single treatment or as a polishing step ribeiro et al 52 evaluated three agro industrial residues sugarcane and coconut bagasses as well as orange pomace to adsorb pollutants of raw textile effluent the first material removed 79 of the effluent color the second 48 while orange pomace was not effective silva et al 67 verified that only for the effluent diluted 60 v v color and cod removals above 80 were obtained through adsorption with orange waste powder on the other hand when applying adsorption process to polish an effluent that had been treated with ultrafiltration the discoloration increased from 70 9 to 84 4 26 interestingly the addition of the most known adsorbent powdered activated carbon in submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor improved cod and color removals from textile effluents this was supposedly due to a combined effect of adsorption of toxic and recalcitrant compounds and the presence of redox mediators e g quinone groups on the activated carbon surface such a system evaluated by baêta et al 56 65 is outlined in fig 4 a small percentage 20 of the works reviewed here studied biological processes knowing that textile effluent do not have significant amounts of n p and other micronutrients 4 106 some works reported the need to supplement them prior to the use of biological processes in addition to n and p organic redox mediators have also been tested for different research groups to accelerate color removal 27 56 65 it is worth to mention that supplementing an effluent can increase its organic content which may become a problem if the treatment is not effective unfortunately pizato et al 35 verified that nutrient and carbon source supplementation with magnesium sulfate potassium phosphate sucrose and ammonium nitrate followed by fungal treatment discolored above 90 but dramatically increased the cod and total phenols of the tested effluent on the other hand the addition of wheat bran 0 5 m v or yeast extract 0 05 m v as a source of nitrogen promoted different effects in discoloring a textile effluent dependent of trametes strains as tested by lisboa et al 34 for example they verified that the yeast extract stimulated the discoloration by t asperellum but inhibited t virens in order to have an overview of the efficiency of the treatments reviewed box plot graphs were assembled with the cod and color removal data fig 5 since these are the parameters mostly reported in the tables aforementioned only treatments studied more than twice were considered with the number on top of the boxes corresponding to the amount of times each system was tested when a study varied operating parameters the data of the optimized system were considered here when analyzing data on cod removal electrooxidation was shown to be the most efficient treatment reducing this parameter by an average of 98 the photo fenton system membranes and classical fenton were also very efficient whose average reductions were 86 80 and 78 respectively according to discoloration data it was observed that all treatments reduced color with an average higher than 70 electrooxidation electrocoagulation classical fenton and photo fenton for example were the treatments that exhibited average color removals above 90 therefore when comparing both cod and color removals the electrooxidation photo fenton and modified bacterial treatments deserve to be highlighted as they exhibited low variability between different studies for the two parameters despite having a larger amount of data this is very interesting because it shows that these treatments are efficient when applied to effluents from different companies that produce different fabrics use different inputs and are located in different regions of the country table 6 shows the physicochemical characteristics of secondary textile effluents that is which have undergone previous biological treatment even with a limited number of data there are samples with a higher concentration of organic matter than others all works using secondary effluents reported here were also treated by using an alternative process most studied aops mainly based on the fenton reaction the minority did not adjust the ph or did not mention this aspect considering the brazilian environmental agencies 10 it is seen that secondary effluents treated by the investigated technologies comply with the standards for disposal of effluents in water bodies it is noteworthy that it is not possible to compare these data with legislation regarding the percentage of bod5 and cod removal since raw effluent data is not available nevertheless it can be seen that more than half of the processes led to cod removals higher than 60 enough data on cod5 has been reported and it is seen that there are effluents that fell within the limits by brazilian legislation 10 regarding the color most studies have reported reductions over 80 the works published by nagel hassemer et al 21 guimarães et al 25 and teixeira et al 62 were the only ones that treated both raw and secondary effluents through h2o2 uv photo fenton and adsorption respectively the treatments were more efficient in removing pollutants from raw effluents which are more concentrated the first study observed that the application of conventional secondary treatment before h2o2 uv enabled the use of a lower concentration of oxidizing agent the other two works reported that secondary treatment with activated sludge efficiently reduced organic matter from the effluent but not its color when a polishing step was evaluated the discoloration was above 70 thus complementing the conventional biological treatment in general the vast majority of the studies reviewed here evaluated the treatments in bench scale up to 10 l either with raw or secondary effluent the few studies carried out in pilot scale 50 to 500 l tested unconventional biological treatments 24 84 86 or aops 37 75 as far as reactor operation is concerned most studies employed batch mode while a few employed continuous flow systems bench scale studies operating in batch mode are essential for a parametric evaluation to find optimum treatment conditions however scaled up studies must be encouraged aiming at real application continuous flow is also an important way to treat large amounts of effluents generated uninterruptedly as in big size companies an interesting pilot scale reactor was used by starling et al 75 when studying the solar photo fenton oxidation the photo reactor constructed by them has a total volume of 55 l being composed of five borosilicate tubes that were connected in series by polyvinylchloride junctions and a recirculation tank to operate in batch mode below each tube there were anodized aluminum reflectors which were oriented to the north and tilted 20 an optimized condition of this system was reached with 20 mg l 1 of fe2 500 mg l 1 of h2o2 and ph 3 reducing on average 90 of the cod and color of real effluent samples 75 3 2 toxicity of textile effluents treated by alternative processes a major problem with textile effluent besides the high color and organic matter concentration is its toxicity 2 4 this parameter should also be reduced when considering the discharge of treated effluents into water bodies 9 10 to verify whether an alternative treatment is efficient in this regard some authors usually report lc50 lethal concentration that causes the death of 50 of the organisms values derived from acute toxicity tests in many of the studies reviewed here the germination of plant seeds or the quantity of surviving organisms colonies after exposure to effluents was analyzed regarding textile effluents treated by aops garcia et al 48 used lactuca sativa seeds and verified that the effluent treated by tio2 uv or tio2 h2o2 uv did not have its toxicity reduced significantly after 6 h on the other hand in experiments with artemia salina such authors found that the treated effluents were less toxic since they increased the percentage of live microcrustaceans from 67 raw effluent to 100 and 90 respectively 49 the treatment with h2o2 exhibited a toxicity reduction lower than the treatment in its absence this might have happened due to residual h2o2 since the authors do not report its elimination only one research group 74 75 reported the use of the catalase enzyme to remove the residual h2o2 starling et al 75 used aliivibrio fischeri and observed that an effluent treated by solar photo fenton had its acute toxicity reduced from 3 to 1 which is equivalent to the absence of toxicity according to the authors with a salina the photocatalytic treatment of a laundry effluent completely eliminated its acute toxicity since the lc50 of the treated effluents was greater than 100 no matter the semiconductor tested 94 daphnia similis was used to evaluate the toxicity of an industrial effluent treated with h2o2 uv less toxicity was observed when the treatment lasted longer with higher doses of h2o2 and ph below 7 18 nagel hassemer et al 21 also studied h2o2 uv to treat textile effluents and used daphnia magna for acute toxicity and tilapia cf rendalli for mutagenicity tests no toxicity was observed in the treated effluents since lc50 increased from 26 8 to 82 and 100 when using 750 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 of h2o2 respectively in addition the treated effluents did not exhibit mutagenicity when investigating the effect of electrocoagulation the lowest toxicity level of a laundry effluent for l sativa and a salina was reached in shorter treatment times lc50 of the effluent was increased from 21 to 41 after 5 min and reduced to 29 after 30 min according to the authors more toxic forms of nitrogen were generated as the treatment time increased 77 using the same microcrustacean palácio et al 32 analyzed electrocoagulation heterogeneous photocatalysis and the combination of both they found that the toxicity of the laundry effluent treated by the tandem processes electrocoagulation photocatalysis reduced more than the separate processes a lc50 of 94 was observed after 6 h of combined electrocoagulation photocatalysis while the isolated treatments generated an effluent with lc50 of 70 electrocoagulation after 1 5 h and 75 photocatalysis after 6 h in another study electrocoagulation was slightly more effective than conventional coagulation with aluminum sulfate since the mortality of 100 for a salina was reduced to 0 and 6 9 respectively 64 using the test organism d magna it was found that using sequential anaerobic aerobic biological treatments decreased the toxicity of textile laundry wastewaters 24 86 treatment in a fluidized bed bioreactor also significantly decreased by 87 the acute toxicity of an effluent to d magna 31 when treating an effluent with fungi miranda et al 27 found that c lunata removed toxicity for allium cepa while with p chrysosporium an increase in the toxicity was observed according to the authors the mutagenic effects were probably associated with the oxidized metabolite found in the effluent treated by this fungus the biological treatment evaluated by pizato et al 35 also increased toxicity for a salina since the lc50 decreased from 14 7 to 5 the authors also attributed their results to the possible generation of toxic metabolites in addition to the partial degradation of dyes and the decrease in the ph of the medium to near 2 0 on the other hand increased toxicity has also been observed in some studies which treated textile effluents by aops for example the h2o2 uv system proved to be inefficient when the algae pseudokirchneriella subcapitata was tested since the lc50 decreased from 2 50 to 0 05 v v after treatment the increased toxicity of the treated effluent was probably due to the residual h2o2 and the presence of cu2 ions formed during the degradation of a dye used by the industry under study according to the authors 20 franco and azevedo 28 also noticed a small increase in the toxicity of the effluent treated by h2o2 uv or uv alone the lc50 decreased from 49 5 to 39 9 and 39 1 respectively using l sativa in testing this same organism the electrooxidation and photo electrooxidation treatments increased the toxicity of a textile effluent from 26 to 1 5 and 1 7 respectively 51 the last two studies suggested the formation of products more toxic than their precursors which were not identified arcanjo et al 111 used d similis and verified that photocatalysis with tio2 or hydrotalcite iron tio2 of a secondary textile effluent reduced its toxicity since the lc50 value went from 70 7 to 95 and 78 6 respectively likewise dalari 113 found that heterogeneous photo fenton process decreased the toxicity of a secondary textile laundry effluent but it was still considered slightly toxic since it did not allow l sativa germination above 80 according to the authors 3 3 cost analysis although it is a very important aspect in choosing a treatment for real application few studies reviewed here have performed cost analysis for example the integration of microfiltration with ultrafiltration was the least costly process reaching 0 31 m 3 69 starling et al 74 compared the cost of three oxidative treatments being the photoperoxidation the most expensive 2 24 m 3 due the longtime tested of artificial light irradiation photo fenton cost was 0 91 m 3 lower than photo fenton oxalate 1 07 m 3 due to addition of the chemical as brazil is a very sun irradiated country employing natural light could reduce the cost of photo oxidation treatments electro oxidation with boron doped diamond anode is a more expensive treatment when compared to the other aforementioned ranging from 3 28 to 20 99 m 3 depending on the energy consumed type of salt added nacl na2so4 and its concentration for the highest tested nacl concentration 30 g l 1 it was observed the lowest cost of treatment due to the lower consumption of energy although the undesired production of chloroform occurred from this electrolyte 60 4 reuse of textile effluents submitted to alternative treatments in addition to the discharge into water bodies another goal of a treatment is the possibility of reusing water resources demanding less fresh water some industrial textile laundries in the country have already been doing this the laundries cited by lenhard et al 19 and viana et al 114 reuse the effluent conventionally treated by physicochemical and biological processes while the companies approached by marcelino 84 and porto and schoenhals 115 reuse a physicochemically treated effluent however such works do not report how these wastewaters are reused in a recent survey carried out in the brazilian state of pernambuco it was found that 89 of laundries are reusing treated effluent but in small quantities since it is difficult to store the effluent or carry out direct reuse 116 unfortunately brazilian legislation has not yet set standards for industrial reuse of effluents although there are a few laws which are not specific for industrial effluents 10 117 therefore research usually draws arbitrary conclusions about reuse based on the reduction of certain physicochemical parameters the reviewed works have considered that when the percentage of removal of some characterization parameter is high the treated effluent is suitable for reuse it is seen that color and turbidity are the most relevant parameters for industrial reuse since the treated effluent should not interfere with the dyeing of the fabrics alvarenga 17 for example mentions that it may be feasible to reuse membrane treated effluent followed by photo fenton oxidation due to observed high reduction in color and organic matter photocatalysis with immobilized tio2 has proven to be a promising alternative for the generation of an effluent proper to reuse since it often leads to high discoloration 19 baêta et al 56 suggested that it is possible to reuse wastewater treated by membranes coupled to bioreactors based on observed removals of color turbidity and cod coagulation flocculation followed by flotation in their turn proved to be viable for the generation of reuse water based on color and turbidity removals according to gonçalves et al 89 souza et al 90 showed that pac based coagulation removed 90 of the color of an effluent indicating high potential of recycling water with such technology besides color turbidity and cod other characterization parameters of treated effluent should also be paid attention when considering its reuse electrocoagulation for example did not reduce nacl concentration of textile effluent and this was considered an attraction for its reuse as it would be a way to save this chemical input in the dyeing stage 73 microfiltration alone or followed by nanofiltration or a microfiltration membrane bioreactor also proved to be efficient in retaining another chemical input the indigo dye which is widely used in dyeing jeans 69 71 87 some works have specified at which step the treated wastewater should be reused permeates from micro and nanofiltered effluents has been indicated to be reused in less demanding processes as washing of equipment and floors 69 71 since the treated effluent can be used in the dyeing step with a new dye load some works have evaluated this approach fenton and photo fenton processes proved to be viable because they did not affect the quality of dyeing when using treated effluent according to ribeiro et al 110 a jeans laundry effluent treated by photocatalysis was used to manufacture cotton fabric which went through the desizing bleaching dyeing and softening steps the treated effluent did not interfere with the quality of the fabric as it remained unstained and with color intensity similar to the control 37 starling et al 74 compared an effluent from light tissues dyeing step which was treated by photo fenton photo fenton oxalate h2o2 uv and a reclaimed effluent chlorination filtration the authors found similarities between the characteristics of aop treated effluents and reclaimed water and considered all them suitable for reuse in dark tissue dyeing the same group 75 evaluated an effluent treated by solar photo fenton in the dyeing and washing stages and the fabrics obtained did not exhibit spots stains or change of tone for a secondary effluent fortino 97 mentions that the high color reduction of the effluent treated by reverse osmosis with spiral module indicates the possibility of reusing it in the dyeing stage on the other hand two other forms of treatment tested were not effective according to the author ultrafiltration did not reduce enough color and the osmosis treatment with a flat module was not considered viable since it recovered small volumes of water 5 concluding remarks and perspectives textile sector is one of the main sources of environmental pollution knowing that the effluent generated by brazilian textile industries is rich in pollutants besides being highly coloured its treatment before disposal is essential since conventional biological processes and coagulation flocculation have limitations in treating such effluents alternative technologies have been researched and reviewed here these attempts are important to treat textile effluents so that environmental discharge limits or reuse standards are met aops mainly electrooxidation photo fenton and classical fenton oxidation are physicochemical processes widely studied to treat textile effluents which seem promising due to reported high reduction of color and cod average above 90 and 78 respectively electrooxidation was shown to be the most efficient treatment by reducing the cod with an average of 98 considering the different photooxidation treatments reviewed the similar efficiency between artificial and solar light indicates the use of the latter is more attractive because it employs a clean and renewable source of energy besides that the use of sunlight can minimize the high requirement of energy by aops coagulation with tannins and electrocoagulation are treatments that have also been extensively investigated with competitive results when compared with conventional coagulants reaching average cod reductions around 68 and 74 respectively it has also been verified that the addition of different plant derived inputs can decrease the requirement for conventional chemicals without any loss of efficiency in the coagulation flocculation processes thus the use of them must be encouraged because of their eco friendly nature contrary to conventional activated sludge modified bacterial processes i e with addition of redox mediators and activated carbon were efficient in removing above 80 the color of effluents while those based on fungus can increase adversely the toxicity of the treated effluents due the excreted metabolites for secondary effluents generated after conventional biological treatment it is observed that their physicochemical characteristics do not meet current brazilian environmental standards indicating the need for a tertiary treatment the most studied polishing techniques researched for this are the ones based on aops which seem quite effective to comply with the current legislation different researches have described reduction of toxicity and production of an effluent adequate for industrial reuse hence indicating many of these emerging technologies are promising and should be further evaluated for their economic and environmental sustainability for future studies it is recommended further tests on a pilot scale cost analysis of different technologies as well as continuous flow operation for real application credit authorship contribution statement márcio d n ramos data curation formal analysis writing original draft juan p p lima data curation formal analysis sergio f
