22530,datasets with missing values can adversely affect the accuracy of any subsequent decision making for instance in condition and performance monitoring for energy efficient operations of ship systems missing data imputation is therefore a necessary step as it ensures that the data can reach their full knowledge extracting potential this paper aims at developing a novel hybrid imputation method which can be employed to condition data acquired from marine machinery systems thus increasing the quality of the original dataset and improving the decision making for ship efficient operations the paper includes of all necessary imputation preparatory steps and further post imputation processes the developed method employs a hybrid knnk nn and micemice imputation algorithm which combines data mining with first principle knowledge the proposed hybrid approach is compared with the individual performance of knn and mice algorithms and is implemented in a dataset acquired from the main engine system of an oceangoing vessel it is shown that the hybrid approach performs best exhibiting an average error of 2 2 compared to the knn and mice algorithms with errors 5 6 and 3 3 respectively highlighting that the small error of the proposed novel method improves the quality of data used in condition and performance monitoring keywords marine machinery energy efficiency data mining data analytics missing data imputation 1 introduction shipping is undoubtedly one of the major driving forces of the global economy as demonstrated by the yearly volume and value of the seaborne trade unctad 2017 well maintained ships exhibit higher reliability energy efficiency profitability and safety modern condition and performance monitoring methods based on both probabilistic and machine learning models mobley et al 2008 kobbacy 2008 dikis et al 2014 beşikçi et al 2016 meng et al 2016 lazakis et al 2016 2018a raptodimos and lazakis 2018 lazakis et al 2018b can help minimise ship machinery failures and promote energy efficient operation of marine systems lazakis and ölçer 2014 trodden et al 2015 lepistö et al 2016 the accuracy of any ship condition and performance monitoring model depends heavily among other things on the availability and quality of its input data dikis 2017 mohanty 2015 improving the quality of a dataset prior to its use in a condition monitoring model is a very important task which includes treating the missing values kotsiantis et al 2006 tan et al 2006 international organization for standardization 2008 han et al 2012 mohammed and wagner 2014 bokde et al 2018 missing values befall in most data driven research efforts and applications and involve the loss of relevant information if they are not dealt with in a case appropriate manner they can reduce the power of models skew results and lead to inefficient machinery operations as discussed by 4 16 reducing the number of missing values has a positive effect on the accuracy of any following models e g decision making for energy efficiency in the maritime industry there is a lack of a formalised approach for handling missing data imputation despite the increasing popularity of modern data analytics pampaka et al 2016 this is a concerning phenomenon as datasets from marine machinery systems tend to contain from 4 4 to 26 missing values depending on each case tsitsilonis and theotokatos 2018 lazakis et al 2018a also the need for an imputation approach is becoming more prominent when considering the increased use of machine learning ml algorithms for maritime condition monitoring and other purposes the need for the above can be seen from analogous efforts in other industries including the offshore wind industry as proposed by 47 in the maritime industry a formalised and accurate approach for the imputation of missing data that includes all necessary imputation preparatory steps and any further post imputation processes has not yet been suggested to tackle the previously mentioned gaps the novelty of this study lies within the proposal of a new hybrid imputation method that combines data driven solutions with valuable first principles fp domain knowledge applicable to the efficient operations of marine machinery this approach is shown to yield more accurate results compared to traditional application agnostic imputation methods as it will be shown in the following sections of the paper moreover alongside the hybrid imputation method all the needed pre imputation and post imputation steps are covered while this study is demonstrated on a marine main engine it can be adapted to deal with any other physical system in the following paragraphs section 2 provides the relative background section 3 presents the proposed methodology section 4 demonstrates the results of the methodology through a case study of a marine main engine and finally section 5 shows the conclusions drawn 2 background 2 1 peculiarities of shipping daq and data analysis advanced data analytics and ml tools have so far only limited applicability in the maritime industry due to the lack of reliable and complete datasets this becomes even more prominent when considering methodologies for data pre processing and the imputation of missing data from marine machinery condition and performance monitoring any attempts for formalised data analysis in the maritime industry and especially for condition and performance monitoring purposes should take into consideration the plethora of different sensors from different manufacturers the fragile connection links different sensor sampling rates the frequent sensor malfunctions and the inherent synchronisation issues also the engineering interconnection of the different measured systems may be incorporated the literature for data imputation in the maritime industry is very limited and covers very few of its facets for example claramunt et al 2017 proposed a methodology which includes missing data handling for the purpose of maritime traffic management under the scope of safety and security other maritime oriented studies that include missing data can be found in dobrkovic et al 2018 fruth and teuteberg 2017 iphar et al 2015 studies that deal with maritime barge logistics prediction maritime logistics in general and the automated identification system ais respectively it is becoming evident that there is very little work that provides the steps required for a complete imputation methodology regarding the pre processing of data from marine machinery systems the available literature is also limited currently the existing knowledge is limited to original equipment manufacturer oem manuals academic publications and industrial empirical knowledge 2 2 imputation importance handling missing data is a very important part of data pre processing as many ml tools used in condition monitoring are restrictive to missing data more specifically when unsupervised ml tools are used e g clustering analysis in datasets with missing values the models performance is adversely affected as clustering algorithms do not have an internal way to manage missing data in such cases most clustering algorithms will produce incomplete and therefore misguiding results as instances with missing values will not get assigned into clusters this will reduce the accuracy of the clustering analysis as the information in instance with missing data will be discarded and lost alternatively the clustering algorithms will simply fail when presented with missing values similarly supervised learning algorithms e g regression classification are adversely affected by missing data for example missing values in regression analysis can result in poorly fitted models also in most supervised learning algorithms e g classification missing data can reduce the size of the training data and consequently hinder the models predictive power this becomes even more crucial during the deployment of supervised algorithms as points with missing features cannot be used as input the issue of missing data is amplified especially when data are limited in the maritime industry and especially in the field of marine predictive maintenance missing data can lead to inaccurate maintenance scheduling which can cause machinery failures accidents and risk harm to human life and the environment there are many reasons that many lead in missing values especially in shipboard systems such factors can include the loss of calibration due to external influences the loss of sensor connectivity and the inherent difficulty to replace failed sensors in the context of ship operations planning and maintenance missing data can occur in datasets representing equipment condition process or performance monitoring missing data can also be present in voyage related datasets which can include environmental information and general ship information e g speed propeller slip currents speed etc 2 3 missingness mechanisms in the maritime industry there are many factors that can make identifying the missing mechanisms of data challenging external and environmental disturbances and the inherent sensitivity of marine data acquisition daq systems can result in missing data with hybrid missing mechanisms e g both missing completely at random mcar and missing at random mar nonetheless understanding the underlying causes of missing data is an important step in data imputation as it dictates the way the missing data can be handled little and rubin 2002 specifies three mechanisms that affect how data are missing the reader is also referred to rubin 1976 taylor and rubin 1996 schafer 1997 the mcar mechanism refers to cases where the missingness is independent of the data in that case there is no correlation between the missing data and the variables in the dataset as the missingness is completely unsystematic for example in the maritime domain a random failure of the fuel flowmeter will lead to data that are mcar mar is when missing data are related to other observations in other words the missingness is conditional on another variable even though mcar and mar seem similar they should not be used interchangeably as the key difference lies in the condition of the missingness for instance if a main engine m e is not operational data from dependant systems may not be recorded for example the turbocharger s speed or the exhaust gas eg temperature missing not at random mnar refers to cases where the missingness of an observation depends only on the variable with the missing data that is the missingness is conditional to itself this is inherently a very difficult mechanism to identify for example mnar could result when missing data originate from a m e that is known to be malfunctioning at the time of the recording 2 4 missing data handling methodologies understanding the cause of missing data can dictate the strategy that is used to impute them nonetheless attributing all missing data in a dataset to a single missing data mechanism is a difficult task as missing data do not only conform to one missing mechanism generally there are two broad missing data management methodologies the simplest methodology includes techniques that discard the missing data these techniques are simple to implement and they allow for a hastened initiation of the analysis such techniques reduce the size of the dataset which reduces the computational requirements but can also affect the models accuracy data retention methodologies have also been developed as an alternative to avoid deleting data points and reducing the number of observations there are many different data retention techniques which range from very simple to rather complex all of which replace the missing values with an estimate in data science terminology all these approaches fall under the imputation umbrella 2 5 imputation techniques selecting the appropriate imputation technique is an important decision that has to be made prior to the initiation of the analysis in theory the choice of the technique depends on the missing mechanism since most missing data do not conform to only one missing mechanism the selection of the best fitting technique can be case specific lately it is becoming more common to use hybrid approaches for the best predicting accuracy li et al 2015 which will be presented among other things in the following section 2 5 1 complete case and available case analysis complete case analysis is one of the simplest and easiest to use techniques which is applied in cases of limited missing values and it is usually employed in purely mcar data pigott 2003 in complete case analysis instances with missing data are excluded from the analysis this is also known as listwise deletion listwise deletion reduces the statistical power of the model and can skew the results significantly as shown in marsh 1998 wothke 2000 graham 2009 available case analysis or pairwise deletion is an imputation technique based on the erasure of missing instances it is an approach which is easy to use but has decreasing popularity in pairwise deletion only the missing values are removed and not the entire instance pairwise deletion changes the sample size of each variable and thus makes comparison difficult it also skews the results and reduces the efficiency of the model as presented by kim and curry 1997 myers 2011 fig 1 summarises the difference between the two methods this approach is incompatible with most ml algorithms as these require the same number of instances for all the variables listwise and pairwise deletion are both valid techniques for managing missing data in many different applications however listwise and pairwise deletion should not be used for machinery performance and condition data in fact listwise and pairwise deletion should not be used in the following situations in multivariate datasets with synchronised sampling pairwise deletion may cause synchronisation issues for instance in the case of examining the synchronised measurements from a motor coupled to a pump applying pairwise deletion will cause the data synchronisation to be lost as each instance of measurements for the two pieces of equipment should correspond to the same time stamp also listwise and pairwise deletion should not be used in datasets representing systems with different operational profiles both listwise and pairwise deletion will create an artificial operating profile for example removing data samples from a vector containing the power of the main engine will create an operating profile which is not representative of the m e operating profile 2 5 2 vertical imputation vertical imputation is a group of easy deterministic techniques that use information from the same column as the one of the missing value pigott 2003 one common deterministic strategy is to carry forward the last value in that way the last known value before a missing point is carried forward to replace it another approach is to impute using the mean of the observed values this approach can be useful when it is used to impute isolated points in uncorrelated variables e g lubricating oil pressure of a turbocharger vertical imputation can also use other descriptive metrics such as the median and the mode in general vertical imputation is not suitable for successive missing points as it artificially increases the observations frequency underestimates the variability of the results and biases the results donders et al 2006 pigott 2003 however mcknight et al 2007 states that vertical imputation is an intuitive method that can perform well if combined with other more sophisticated approaches 2 5 3 horizontal imputation an alternative to vertical imputation is to impute the missing values with ones from similar parameters or by using other logical rules this is commonly known as horizontal imputation as information from the same record is used under the scope of the maritime sector this approach could be used to treat missing values between two identical pieces of machinery e g pumps the main drawback of this approach is that there may not be two similar parameters in the available dataset therefore this approach is not always viable longford 2005 gibert 2014 2 5 4 hot deck imputation hot deck imputation is an approach that is based on the similarity of a missing instance with a complete one as initially suggested by ford 1983 rizvi 1983 roth 1994 hot deck imputation is more complicated compared with complete case available case and vertical imputation this approach matches donors i e instances with observed values with recipients i e instances with missing values a pool of possible donors is formed based on the similarity between the recipient and the complete instances the similarity is quantified using a variety of different metrics including the euclidean distance manhattan distance mahalanobis distance and maximum deviation fig 2 demonstrates the working principle of hot deck imputation depending on the donor selection hot deck can be considered both deterministic and stochastic andridge and little 2010 myers 2011 deterministic hot deck imputation is a non probabilistic approach a single donor is selected from the donor pool based on the similarity criteria previously discussed alternatively the imputation can be facilitated by using a summary value mean median and mode from the donor pool stochastic hot deck imputation is a probabilistic approach from the donor pool a single donor is selected at random and its value is parsed on the missing instance the benefit of stochastic imputation is that it accounts for uncertainty in a more realistic way the most common implementation of hot deck is through the use of k nearest neighbours k nn batista and monard 2002 further discussed in section 3 the main benefit of hot deck imputation is that it does not rely on parameter specific models hence the imputation is not influenced by any parameter selection also as the imputation is based on actual values the dataset is not completed by artificial ones however even though hot deck is suitable for different missing mechanisms mcar mar mnar when it is used in single imputation it fails to account for the uncertainty in an efficient way more so there is no explicit mathematical model behind the hot deck methodology 2 5 5 regression based imputation fitting a regression model to appropriate instances with recorded values is another widely used imputation method regression based imputation is more complicated compared with complete case available case and vertical imputation a regression model is fitted between the target variable i e variable with missing data and the selected independent variables the regression model can be linear polynomial or of another type depending on the dataset the resulting regression equation is then used to impute instances with missing points in the target variable in principle regression based imputation can be both stochastic and deterministic based on how uncertainty is factored in deterministic regression can lead to inaccuracies as it does not account for uncertainty and it artificially reinforces linear relationships instead exact predictions are used without considering the error term enders 2001 on the other hand stochastic regression is more common and realistic as it accounts for the error nonetheless stochastic regression can be more complicated as the distribution of the error term has to be taken into account lang and little 2016 as shown by longford 2005 the general form of stochastic imputation between the associated variables y with missing instances and w complete dataset is provided by 1 y f w ϵ in eq 1 f w is some appropriate function e g linear polynomial etc and ϵ is the error term which is used to account for the uncertainty 2 5 6 multiple imputation multiple imputation mi represents a modern and more sophisticated approach to imputation mi can increase the accuracy of the imputation while reducing the bias as discussed by azur et al 2011 using a mi approach allows for better accountability of the statistical uncertainty as opposed to single imputations the mi approach is based on the improved use of predominant imputation techniques assuming an incomplete dataset y mi follows the subsequent steps fig 3 1 impute the missing values of y m times 2 analyse separately the m different datasets 3 merge the m different results into one dataset mi depends on certain user specified selection steps initially the imputation method has to be specified selection can include deterministic or stochastic methods next the number of imputation cycles must be identified increasing the number of cycles can increase the model s accuracy however this comes at a computational cost the final selection involves the determination of the concluding missing values from m different datasets the selection can be facilitated in either a deterministic mean median or a stochastic random or probabilistic selection way all of the above choices are case and application dependant through the recent literature it is seen that the multiple imputation by chained equations mice approach further discussed in section 3 is one of the most promising and accurate implementation of multiple mi royston 2004 royston and white 2015 2 6 comparison table 1 provides a qualitative summary of the above imputation techniques from 1 it can be observed that both the hot deck and regression imputation techniques exhibit the best overall quality hron et al 2010 templ et al 2011 srebotnjak et al 2012 sullivan and andridge 2015 both approaches retain the size of the database which is a big advantage especially when dealing with limited data similarly both approaches can account for uncertainty in their predictions which is not easily possible with other techniques and especially vertical imputation lastly both hot deck and regression imputation populate the dataset with plausible values especially in hot deck imputation where the predictions are based on actual observations when selecting imputation approaches another consideration should be the ability to combine engineering knowledge with the imputation model in hot deck imputation this is facilitated as the donors for the imputation can be specified by the researcher this means that when there is a missing value in a specific variable the donor is selected based on the variables interconnection within the engineering system the same philosophy can be applied to regression imputation when specifying the target independent variables pair taking into account the merits of hot deck imputation it is worth examining in greater detail its most useful and widespread implementation k nn not only k nn is an effective imputation tool on its own but it can easily be used in hybrid models moreover k nn is a lazy algorithm and as such it does not require an explicit training phase this greatly reduces the required computational cost and increases the efficiency batista and monard 2003 armina et al 2017 similarly considering the enhanced capabilities of mi schafer and olsen 1998 ibrahim et al 2005 and the merits of regression based approaches batista and monard 2003 it is worth examining mice which represents an ideal combination of the two approaches corben 1954 mice like k nn is an approach that can be successfully used in hybrid models armina et al 2017 moreover a novel hybrid methodology combining the merits of k nn and mice will be demonstrated filling the gap of a formalised approach for handling missing data in the maritime industry 3 methodology the focus of this study is the development of a novel hybrid imputation methodology for the maritime industry through the assessment and performance evaluation of different state of the art imputation approaches as mentioned above this is the first step towards an advanced framework which will employ a novel data condition and performance imputation method for energy efficient operations of marine systems the established approach is holistic and includes all the necessary steps for successful imputation including pre and post imputation steps which as shown in the previous sections of this paper is currently missing from the maritime industry it has to be kept in mind that the selected imputation approach must cater to the specific needs of the maritime industry i e subsequent use of data in condition or performance monitoring the necessary steps to achieve this are included in the following distinctive processes 1 data collection including the data gathering effort 2 preliminary analysis including form handling data synchronisation data filtering and correlation examination 3 imputation process including the implementation and assessment of the different imputation approaches by examining theabsolute percentage error ape mean absolute percentage error mape and standard deviation of error σ 4 operational analysis including the correction of variables based on relevant manufacture s guidelines the proposed methodology is shown in fig 4 in which the assessed imputation approaches including k nn mice and the novel hybrid method are described in more detail together with the preliminary analysis and operational analysis 3 1 data collection the data collection step includes the required activities and efforts to gather the data used in the methodology the collected data originate from a marine commercial daq system installed onboard a merchant navy vessel in general data collection is not restricted to only commercial daq systems as it can be facilitated from numerous other sources including log books and other archives e g noon reports spread sheets etc however commercial daq systems offer great advantages with regards to the ease of their use and their increased accuracy 3 2 preliminary analysis preliminary analysis is an essential preparatory step for the implementation and assessment of the hybrid imputation approach it includes the form handling synchronisation filtering and correlation examination of the data and variables of the given dataset the preliminary analysis initiates with the form handling of data this is a simple yet important step as data are tabulated in the appropriate form for the next steps of the methodology next the data are synchronised using linear interpolation eq 2 a process that is necessary as the daq sensors do not have exactly the same sampling rate 2 y 2 x 2 x 1 y 3 y 1 x 3 x 1 y 1 in eq 2 x represents the different time stamps and y the variables values subscripts 1 refers to values before the selected timestamp subscripts 2 refers to values at the synchronisation point and subscripts 3 refer to values after the selected timestamp the synchronisation of the data ensures that there is consistency among them and they are harmonised over time it is an especially important process when using similarity based imputation approaches this is necessary as all the measurements from a potential imputation donor must correspond to a single time stamp data filtering is a very important process that prepares the dataset for imputation this process determines the points that need to be imputed by determining if a sensor reading is missing or it has an illogical value the assessment of whether a recorded value is logical or not depends on the engineering knowledge of the variable being measured to determine if an instance has an illogical value e g negative exhaust gas temperatures sources from the equipment s manufacturer or the results from the commissioning tests e g sea trials are used the last step of the preliminary analysis is the correlation examination of the variables this is a common step in most data driven applications as it gives a better understanding of the data identifying the correlation between the different variables makes imparting fp knowledge to the imputation process easier the correlation of the available data was examined by using the pearson correlation coefficient and cross referencing the results with fp engineering knowledge the pearson correlation coefficient ranges between 1 perfect negative linear correlation and 1 perfect positive linear correlation while 0 denotes no linear correlation 3 3 imputation process following the preliminary analysis step the imputation process takes place which includes the implementation of the novel hybrid method and its comparison with the identified state of the art mice and widely used k nn algorithms the assessment includes the application of the different imputation approaches to the required points as identified during data filtering in the dataset and the evaluation of the results using residual errors for the hot deck imputation approach the k nn algorithm is used this is a very popular tool for value prediction and it has widespread applicability in imputation the k nn algorithm is intuitively easy to understand and produces accurate results zhang 2012 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 for the regression based approach the mice algorithm is selected the mice algorithm is a very effective tool in predicting values in multivariate datasets as it incorporates the benefits of mi with regression this algorithm is relatively new compared to the more traditional imputation approaches e g vertical imputation van buuren and oudshoorn 1999 white et al 2011 the hybrid approach that is presented is a novel tool that incorporates the benefits of k nn and mice while avoiding their respective shortcomings in detail the hybrid approach has the following unique benefits 1 provides realistic imputations due to the use of the k nn algorithm 2 provides easy incorporation of fp knowledge due to the use of the k nn algorithm 3 is based on the widely recognised k nn algorithm 4 takes advantage of the non artificial replication of values offered by mice 5 takes advantage of the flexible implementation of mice mice is a flexible and state of the art as already discussed approach that avoids bias in the results by fitting a series of regression models in the dataset shah et al 2014 mice is used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed novel hybrid imputation method this approach is considered as an implementation of mi which uses linear regressions to help in the estimate of the missing values for the rest of the section let y and k be variables with observed y o b s k o b s and missing points y m i s s k m i s s and z a set of complete variables with z o b s and z m i s s corresponding to the observed and missing points of y and k mice calculates the missing points by using a bayesian approach to update prior distributions of the variables the y and k variables are assumed random and prior distributions are assigned usually an uninformative one by taking into account the z variables posterior distributions are obtained the steps for the application of mice are the following 1 impute all the missing points of y and k with the means of the y o b s and k o b s eqs 3 and 4 n y o b s and n k o b s represent the total number of observations for the y and k variables respectively 3 y ˆ m i s s i y o b s i n y o b s 4 k ˆ m i s s i k o b s i n k o b s these initial estimates y ˆ m i s s i k ˆ m i s s i are placeholders and they only facilitate the initiation of the process 2 set the placeholders of one of the variables e g y ˆ m i s s i back to missing 3 fit a linear regression model eq 5 between the observed points of the target variable y o b s and the appropriate independent variables either all or a subset of z 5 y ˆ m i s s i θ t z in eq 5 z is a column vector of the independent variables and θ is row vector of the regression parameters the y ˆ m i s s i parameter represents the imputation estimates produced by the regression model 4 find the row vector θ by minimising the mean squared error eq 6 6 m s e 1 n y o b s i 1 n y o b s y o b s i y ˆ o b s i 2 the row vector θ can be calculated based on two different approaches if the dataset is large then an optimisation approach can be used e g gradient decent to fit the regression model and find the row vector θ however due to the size of the dataset used an algebraic method was employed to fit the regression model and find the row vector θ generally if the dataset is relatively small algebraic methods can be used as they offer greater simplicity as the size of the dataset increases optimisation approaches are used as they offer a significant reduction in the required computational time 5 use eq 5 to impute the missing points of the y variable 6 repeat steps 2 3 4 and 5 for every variable with missing points in the dataset 7 reaching step 6 is one cycle the entire process is repeated for a predetermined number of cycles usually 10 repetitions is an empirically accepted number in summary mice uses linear regression in an iterative manner the process initiates by using mean imputation every variable with missing values is used in a regression model to update the initial mean imputation the second algorithm that is implemented and assessed isk nn k nearest neighbours k nn is used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed novel hybrid imputation method in k nn k stands for a specified number of instances nearest neighbours that will be considered this is a non parametric and lazy algorithm as it does not take into account the distribution of the data in the examined vectors and it has no explicit training phase zhang and zhou 2007 as with any hot deck approach k nn is based on the similarity between features there is no standard number for the k hyperparameter it depends on the field of application and it selection lies with the researcher in general a small k will restrict the algorithm to a small region of the data and as a result it will produce results with low bias and high variance a very small k e g k 1 creates models sensitive to outliers noise and anomalous data as the model is overfitted and not generalised enough for use in out of sample data conversely a high k e g k 20 will create overgeneralised models as it averages more possible donors generating results with low variance and an increased bias the similarity of the instances is assessed by the minkowski distance eq 7 7 d i 1 n x i y i p 1 p in eq 7 the p hyperparameter is set to 2 which transforms d to the euclidean distance the most common distance metric groenen and jajuga 2001 similarly x i and y i represent the examined instances in addition to the distance metric a weight is also assigned to each possible donor based on its distance by doing so closer neighbouring points i e similar and most recent operating conditions have greater influence over the instance to be predicted this is a very important feature as it allows taking into account the actual operation of the system under examination lastly a hybrid approach combining k nn and mice is applied and assessed against the state of the art mice and widely used k nn algorithms the k nn component is based on fp this approach begins with the correlation analysis where the systemic correlation between the variables is specified in the hybrid approach each vector in the dataset is examined in turn when an instance with a missing value is identified the k nn algorithm is deployed however the algorithm searches for possible donors only in correlated variables as determined during the correlation analysis by doing so the entire process is executed quicker because only certain vectors of the dataset are examined also the predictive power of the model is enhanced as only correlated variables are used to predict missing points this process is repeated until no further changes occur to the dataset in many cases the cessation of the k nn algorithm signifies its incapacity to impute any more missing points as points from the correlated vectors may be missing simultaneously in that case the remaining missing points are predicted using the aforementioned mice approach the structure of the proposed novel hybrid methodology is demonstrated in algorithm 1 for the assessment of the different imputation tools the ape eq 8 mape eq 9 and the standard deviation of the error σ eq 10 are calculated for each case the goal is to select the imputation approach with minimum mape and σ the ape and mape are selected as they are common and easy to understand metrics for the evaluation of the model s performance bryne 2012 the standard deviation of the error was used to determine the possibility of introducing outliers within the predictions in the following equations x i and x i ˆ represent the actual value of the variable and the predicted value respectively 8 a p e x i x i ˆ x i 9 m a p e 100 n i 1 n a p e 10 σ a p e i m a p e 2 n in summary a total of three different approaches are implemented and assessed the first one is mice which is applied to the entire dataset until no missing points were left the mice approach uses the computational validness of regression with the similarity considerations of the hot deck approaches and it was implemented in a data driven manner the second approach that is tried is the k nn this approach is applied to the entire dataset without taking into consideration any systemic correlations until all the missing points in the dataset are imputed lastly the hybrid approach is tested which combines k nn with fp analysis and mice the k nn algorithm is deployed by taking into account systemic interdependencies between variables then the mice algorithm is used to impute any missing points that the fp k nn cannot predict 3 4 operational analysis the operational analysis is the last step of the developed methodology and includes the correction of the variables to account for ambient conditions this step ensures that the data are prepared for subsequent analysis for example condition monitoring to account for the ambient conditions various sources are taken into including international standards and the manufacturers recommendations accounting for ambient conditions is a common step in many applications as it ensures that the affected variables are adjusted accordingly 4 case study 4 1 preliminary analysis the described methodology is applied in the case of a chemical tanker with length l o a 183 m and deadweight 38 000 tonnes in the turbocharger t c and m e system the selection of the system is based on its criticality and overall importance as discussed by harrington 1986 taylor 1990 cheliotis and lazakis 2018 the t c in question is the tca66 20032 by man b w and has a maximum speed rating of 16000 rpm it is connected to the m e 6s50mc c which has a maximum continuous rating mcr of 9600 kw at 127 rpm see fig 5 the variables available for the analysis as supplied by a marine daq are m e power in kw m e speed in rpm t c inlet eg temperature in c t c outlet eg temperature in c t c speed in rpm t c lubricating oil lo inlet pressure in bar and t c lo outlet temperature c also the engine room air and the air cooler cooling water temperatures are recorded the descriptive statistics of the synchronised uniform and filtered data are shown in table 3 as mentioned in the methodology the first step of the preliminary analysis is the form handling of the dataset the variables in the dataset are tabulated and a uniform format is given then the data are synchronised eq 2 to harmonise them over time after the synchronisation the dataset is filtered to determine the points that need to be imputed table 2 shows the limits used for data filtration the entire dataset is scanned based on limits shown in table 2 in any instance with values outside of the range specified in table 2 the values are treated as missing points the final step of the preliminary analysis is the correlation examination of the variables for that reason the pearson correlation coefficient is initially calculated fig 6 the results of fig 6 are cross referenced with the engineering knowledge of the m e and t c systems for example it is known that the t c lo inlet pressure and t c lo outlet temperature are among the uncorrelated variables due to the fact that the t c lo system is independent and does not come to contact with areas of the m e or the t c where the working processes occur on the other hand the t c speed and the m e power have the biggest correlation the t c speed is influenced by many factors it is correlated with the temperature drop of the exhaust gases in the t c the t c speed is also correlated with the m e power and m e speed which in turn influences the temperature of the exhaust gases it should be noted that there are other variables that influence the t c speed m e power and the temperature of the exhaust gases for example such variables are the combustion pressure and the back pressure of the t c the combustion pressure influences the power output and subsequently the temperature of the exhaust gases on the other hand the back pressure of the t c can affect reduce the t c speed as the back pressure can restrict the flow of the gases hountalas et al 2014 guan et al 2015 even though these parameters are identified for their importance they are not included in the selected dataset for the analysis this is due to the fact that the daq used for the measuring of the parameters is not capable of recording them comparing the results from fig 6 and the engineering knowledge of the m e and t c systems the final correlation between variables is obtained table 4 as it can be observed table 4 shows only the presence of correlation between variables and not the magnitude of the correlation as required by the hybrid method it requires only the presence of correlation between variables and not the magnitude 4 2 imputation process following the completion of the preliminary analysis step the implementation and assessment of the different imputation approaches take place the results from the discussed imputation approaches are presented in figs 7 14 for each case a histogram depicting the ape and a scatter plot depicting each prediction are shown in the scatter plot the line y x representing perfect accuracy is plotted to help the determination of the accuracy of each prediction fig 7 shows the imputed values and ape for the t c lo inlet pressure through the histogram it is noted that all the approaches produce equally good predictions also from the histogram it is observed that the approaches produce predictions with ape ranging from 0 35 through the scatter plot it is observed that the k nn algorithm produces the results with the biggest standard deviation sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset as aforementioned all three approaches produce results with errors this behaviour is attributed to the fact that t c lo inlet pressure does not have a substantial correlation with the other variables it has to be kept in mind that all of the imputation approaches are based to some extent on the correlation between the variables he errors produced are justified due to the t c lo inlet pressure not following this assumption fig 8 shows the imputed values and ape for the t c lo outlet temperature through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape also from the histogram it is observed that the approaches produce predictions with ape ranging from 0 8 through the scatter plot it is observed that both k nn and mice algorithms produce results with large sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset the hybrid approach performs the best as it closely follows the y x line fig 9 shows the imputed values and ape for the m e power through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape also from the histogram it is observed that the approaches produce predictions with ape ranging from 0 12 through the scatter plot it is observed that the mice algorithm produces results with large sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset as the m e power is a highly correlated variable the fp component of the hybrid method contributes to making it perform the best fig 10 shows the imputed values and ape for the m e speed through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape also from the histogram it is observed that the approaches produce predictions with ape ranging from 0 8 through the scatter plot we observe that the mice algorithm produces results with large sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset it is observed that all the tools produce more accurate predictions from 100 rpm and above at lower speeds many of the predictions are relatively inaccurate with the mice tool predicting possible outliers as with the previous cases the hybrid approach follows the y x line the closest fig 11 show the imputed values and ape for the m e scavenging air pressure through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape also from the histogram it is observed that the approaches produce predictions with ape ranging from 0 35 through the scatter plot it is observed that the k nn algorithm produces results with large sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset in this variable all of the imputation methods produce results very close to the actual values the variation of the predictions from mice and the hybrid tool are quite low and they both follow closely the y x line fig 12 shows the imputed values and ape for the t c eg inlet temperature through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape also through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape through the scatter plot it is observed that the mice algorithm produces results with large sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset the t c eg inlet temperature exhibits a similar behaviour with the m e speed the predictions of all the tools are relatively inaccurate at lower temperatures however this behaviour is reverted at higher temperatures with the hybrid method following the y x line the closest fig 13 shows the imputed values and ape for the t c eg outlet temperature through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape also from the histogram it is observed that the approaches produce predictions with ape ranging from 0 10 through the scatter plot it is observed that the mice algorithm produces results with large sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset in general the hybrid method displays consistently good predictions in the temperature range following the y x line the closest finally fig 14 shows the imputed values and ape for the t c speed through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape also from the histogram it is observed that the approaches produce predictions with ape ranging from 0 18 through the scatter plot it is observed that the mice algorithm produces results with large sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset similarly with the previous cases the hybrid method displays consistently good predictions in the speed range following the y x line closely summarising the above table 5 encapsulates the overall performance of the three tools for the examined variables table 5 shows the mape and mean standard deviation for each approach and for each variable also an overall mape and mean standard deviation are shown to summarise the general performance of each approach as it is observed even though the two state of the art approaches perform relatively well the hybrid method outperforms them it has the lowest overall mean error of 2 21 and the smallest overall standard deviation of 2 64 the hybrid tool makes accurate predictions without running the risk of generating outliers the worst performing tool is the k nn with an overall mean error of 5 55 and an overall standard deviation of 8 9 observing the results it becomes clear that in correlated variables m e power m e speed t c speed t c eg inlet temperature t c eg outlet temperature m e scavenging air pressure t c lo outlet temperature the novel imputation method has superior performance it is observed that the fp component of the hybrid model makes a positive influence on the prediction by understanding the systemic interdependencies of the system under examination the performance of the predictions is enhanced therefore the integration of the knowledge of the system to any predictive effort is encouraged and should be preferred to purely data driven approaches 4 3 operational analysis following the imputation process step the resulting dataset is adjusted to account for the influence of the environmental conditions for that reason the t c speed m e scavenging air pressure and the t c eg inlet temperature were corrected man b w 2014 tsitsilonis and theotokatos 2018

22530,datasets with missing values can adversely affect the accuracy of any subsequent decision making for instance in condition and performance monitoring for energy efficient operations of ship systems missing data imputation is therefore a necessary step as it ensures that the data can reach their full knowledge extracting potential this paper aims at developing a novel hybrid imputation method which can be employed to condition data acquired from marine machinery systems thus increasing the quality of the original dataset and improving the decision making for ship efficient operations the paper includes of all necessary imputation preparatory steps and further post imputation processes the developed method employs a hybrid knnk nn and micemice imputation algorithm which combines data mining with first principle knowledge the proposed hybrid approach is compared with the individual performance of knn and mice algorithms and is implemented in a dataset acquired from the main engine system of an oceangoing vessel it is shown that the hybrid approach performs best exhibiting an average error of 2 2 compared to the knn and mice algorithms with errors 5 6 and 3 3 respectively highlighting that the small error of the proposed novel method improves the quality of data used in condition and performance monitoring keywords marine machinery energy efficiency data

seaborne trade unctad 2017 well maintained ships exhibit higher reliability energy efficiency profitability and safety modern condition and performance monitoring methods based on both probabilistic and machine learning models mobley et al 2008 kobbacy 2008 dikis et al 2014 beşikçi et al 2016 meng et al 2016 lazakis et al 2016 2018a raptodimos and lazakis 2018 lazakis et al 2018b can help minimise ship machinery failures and promote energy efficient operation of marine systems lazakis and ölçer 2014 trodden et al 2015 lepistö et al 2016 the accuracy of any ship condition and performance monitoring model depends heavily among other things on the availability and quality of its input data dikis 2017 mohanty 2015 improving the quality of a dataset prior to its use in a condition monitoring model is a very important task which includes treating the missing values kotsiantis et al 2006 tan et al 2006 international organization for standardization 2008 han et al 2012 mohammed and wagner 2014 bokde et al 2018 missing values befall in most data driven research efforts and applications and involve the loss of relevant information if they are not dealt with in a case appropriate manner they can reduce the power of models skew results and lead to inefficient machinery operations as discussed by 4 16 reducing the number of missing values has a positive effect on the accuracy of any following models e g decision making for energy efficiency in the maritime industry there is a lack of a formalised approach for handling missing data imputation despite the increasing popularity of modern data analytics pampaka et al 2016 this is a concerning phenomenon as datasets from marine machinery systems tend to contain from 4 4 to 26 missing values depending on each case tsitsilonis and theotokatos 2018 lazakis et al 2018a also the need for an imputation approach is becoming more prominent when considering the increased use of machine learning ml algorithms for maritime condition monitoring and other purposes the need for the above can be seen from analogous efforts in other industries including the offshore wind industry as proposed by 47 in the maritime industry a formalised and accurate approach for the imputation of missing data that includes all necessary imputation preparatory steps and any further post imputation processes has not yet been suggested to tackle the previously mentioned gaps the novelty of this study lies within the proposal of a new hybrid imputation method that combines data driven solutions with valuable first principles fp domain knowledge applicable to the efficient operations of marine machinery this approach is shown to yield more accurate results compared to traditional application agnostic imputation methods as it will be shown in the following sections of the paper moreover alongside the hybrid imputation method all the needed pre imputation and post imputation steps are covered while this study is demonstrated on a marine main engine it can be adapted to deal with any other physical system in the following paragraphs section 2 provides the relative background section 3 presents the proposed methodology section 4 demonstrates the results of the methodology through a case study of a marine main engine and finally section 5 shows the conclusions drawn 2 background 2 1 peculiarities of shipping daq and data analysis advanced data analytics and ml tools have so far only limited applicability in the maritime industry due to the lack of reliable and complete datasets this becomes even more prominent when considering methodologies for data pre processing and the imputation of missing data from marine machinery condition and performance monitoring any attempts for formalised data analysis in the maritime industry and especially for condition and performance monitoring purposes should take into consideration the plethora of different sensors from different manufacturers the fragile connection links different sensor sampling rates the frequent sensor malfunctions and the inherent synchronisation issues also the engineering interconnection of the different measured systems may be incorporated the literature for data imputation in the maritime industry is very limited and covers very few of its facets for example claramunt et al 2017 proposed a methodology which includes missing data handling for the purpose of maritime traffic management under the scope of safety and security other maritime oriented studies that include missing data can be found in dobrkovic et al 2018 fruth and teuteberg 2017 iphar et al 2015 studies that deal with maritime barge logistics prediction maritime logistics in general and the automated identification system ais respectively it is becoming evident that there is very little work that provides the steps required for a complete imputation methodology regarding the pre processing of data from marine machinery systems the available literature is also limited currently the existing knowledge is limited to original equipment manufacturer oem manuals academic publications and industrial empirical knowledge 2 2 imputation importance handling missing data is a very important part of data pre processing as many ml tools used in condition monitoring are restrictive to missing data more specifically when unsupervised ml tools are used e g clustering analysis in datasets with missing values the models performance is adversely affected as clustering algorithms do not have an internal way to manage missing data in such cases most clustering algorithms will produce incomplete and therefore misguiding results as instances with missing values will not get assigned into clusters this will reduce the accuracy of the clustering analysis as the information in instance with missing data will be discarded and lost alternatively the clustering algorithms will simply fail when presented with missing values similarly supervised learning algorithms e g regression classification are adversely affected by missing data for example missing values in regression analysis can result in poorly fitted models also in most supervised learning algorithms e g classification missing data can reduce the size of the training data and consequently hinder the models predictive power this becomes even more crucial during the deployment of supervised algorithms as points with missing features cannot be used as input the issue of missing data is amplified especially when data are limited in the maritime industry and especially in the field of marine predictive maintenance missing data can lead to inaccurate maintenance scheduling which can cause machinery failures accidents and risk harm to human life and the environment there are many reasons that many lead in missing values especially in shipboard systems such factors can include the loss of calibration due to external influences the loss of sensor connectivity and the inherent difficulty to replace failed sensors in the context of ship operations planning and maintenance missing data can occur in datasets representing equipment condition process or performance monitoring missing data can also be present in voyage related datasets which can include environmental information and general ship information e g speed propeller slip currents speed etc 2 3 missingness mechanisms in the maritime industry there are many factors that can make identifying the missing mechanisms of data challenging external and environmental disturbances and the inherent sensitivity of marine data acquisition daq systems can result in missing data with hybrid missing mechanisms e g both missing completely at random mcar and missing at random mar nonetheless understanding the underlying causes of missing data is an important step in data imputation as it dictates the way the missing data can be handled little and rubin 2002 specifies three mechanisms that affect how data are missing the reader is also referred to rubin 1976 taylor and rubin 1996 schafer 1997 the mcar mechanism refers to cases where the missingness is independent of the data in that case there is no correlation between the missing data and the variables in the dataset as the missingness is completely unsystematic for example in the maritime domain a random failure of the fuel flowmeter will lead to data that are mcar mar is when missing data are related to other observations in other words the missingness is conditional on another variable even though mcar and mar seem similar they should not be used interchangeably as the key difference lies in the condition of the missingness for instance if a main engine m e is not operational data from dependant systems may not be recorded for example the turbocharger s speed or the exhaust gas eg temperature missing not at random mnar refers to cases where the missingness of an observation depends only on the variable with the missing data that is the missingness is conditional to itself this is inherently a very difficult mechanism to identify for example mnar could result when missing data originate from a m e that is known to be malfunctioning at the time of the recording 2 4 missing data handling methodologies understanding the cause of missing data can dictate the strategy that is used to impute them nonetheless attributing all missing data in a dataset to a single missing data mechanism is a difficult task as missing data do not only conform to one missing mechanism generally there are two broad missing data management methodologies the simplest methodology includes techniques that discard the missing data these techniques are simple to implement and they allow for a hastened initiation of the analysis such techniques reduce the size of the dataset which reduces the computational requirements but can also affect the models accuracy data retention methodologies have also been developed as an alternative to avoid deleting data points and reducing the number of observations there are many different data retention techniques which range from very simple to rather complex all of which replace the missing values with an estimate in data science terminology all these approaches fall under the imputation umbrella 2 5 imputation techniques selecting the appropriate imputation technique is an important decision that has to be made prior to the initiation of the analysis in theory the choice of the technique depends on the missing mechanism since most missing data do not conform to only one missing mechanism the selection of the best fitting technique can be case specific lately it is becoming more common to use hybrid approaches for the best predicting accuracy li et al 2015 which will be presented among other things in the following section 2 5 1 complete case and available case analysis complete case analysis is one of the simplest and easiest to use techniques which is applied in cases of limited missing values and it is usually employed in purely mcar data pigott 2003 in complete case analysis instances with missing data are excluded from the analysis this is also known as listwise deletion listwise deletion reduces the statistical power of the model and can skew the results significantly as shown in marsh 1998 wothke 2000 graham 2009 available case analysis or pairwise deletion is an imputation technique based on the erasure of missing instances it is an approach which is easy to use but has decreasing popularity in pairwise deletion only the missing values are removed and not the entire instance pairwise deletion changes the sample size of each variable and thus makes comparison difficult it also skews the results and reduces the efficiency of the model as presented by kim and curry 1997 myers 2011 fig 1 summarises the difference between the two methods this approach is incompatible with most ml algorithms as these require the same number of instances for all the variables listwise and pairwise deletion are both valid techniques for managing missing data in many different applications however listwise and pairwise deletion should not be used for machinery performance and condition data in fact listwise and pairwise deletion should not be used in the following situations in multivariate datasets with synchronised sampling pairwise deletion may cause synchronisation issues for instance in the case of examining the synchronised measurements from a motor coupled to a pump applying pairwise deletion will cause the data synchronisation to be lost as each instance of measurements for the two pieces of equipment should correspond to the same time stamp also listwise and pairwise deletion should not be used in datasets representing systems with different operational profiles both listwise and pairwise deletion will create an artificial operating profile for example removing data samples from a vector containing the power of the main engine will create an operating profile which is not representative of the m e operating profile 2 5 2 vertical imputation vertical imputation is a group of easy deterministic techniques that use information from the same column as the one of the missing value pigott 2003 one common deterministic strategy is to carry forward the last value in that way the last known value before a missing point is carried forward to replace it another approach is to impute using the mean of the observed values this approach can be useful when it is used to impute isolated points in uncorrelated variables e g lubricating oil pressure of a turbocharger vertical imputation can also use other descriptive metrics such as the median and the mode in general vertical imputation is not suitable for successive missing points as it artificially increases the observations frequency underestimates the variability of the results and biases the results donders et al 2006 pigott 2003 however mcknight et al 2007 states that vertical imputation is an intuitive method that can perform well if combined with other more sophisticated approaches 2 5 3 horizontal imputation an alternative to vertical imputation is to impute the missing values with ones from similar parameters or by using other logical rules this is commonly known as horizontal imputation as information from the same record is used under the scope of the maritime sector this approach could be used to treat missing values between two identical pieces of machinery e g pumps the main drawback of this approach is that there may not be two similar parameters in the available dataset therefore this approach is not always viable longford 2005 gibert 2014 2 5 4 hot deck imputation hot deck imputation is an approach that is based on the similarity of a missing instance with a complete one as initially suggested by ford 1983 rizvi 1983 roth 1994 hot deck imputation is more complicated compared with complete case available case and vertical imputation this approach matches donors i e instances with observed values with recipients i e instances with missing values a pool of possible donors is formed based on the similarity between the recipient and the complete instances the similarity is quantified using a variety of different metrics including the euclidean distance manhattan distance mahalanobis distance and maximum deviation fig 2 demonstrates the working principle of hot deck imputation depending on the donor selection hot deck can be considered both deterministic and stochastic andridge and little 2010 myers 2011 deterministic hot deck imputation is a non probabilistic approach a single donor is selected from the donor pool based on the similarity criteria previously discussed alternatively the imputation can be facilitated by using a summary value mean median and mode from the donor pool stochastic hot deck imputation is a probabilistic approach from the donor pool a single donor is selected at random and its value is parsed on the missing instance the benefit of stochastic imputation is that it accounts for uncertainty in a more realistic way the most common implementation of hot deck is through the use of k nearest neighbours k nn batista and monard 2002 further discussed in section 3 the main benefit of hot deck imputation is that it does not rely on parameter specific models hence the imputation is not influenced by any parameter selection also as the imputation is based on actual values the dataset is not completed by artificial ones however even though hot deck is suitable for different missing mechanisms mcar mar mnar when it is used in single imputation it fails to account for the uncertainty in an efficient way more so there is no explicit mathematical model behind the hot deck methodology 2 5 5 regression based imputation fitting a regression model to appropriate instances with recorded values is another widely used imputation method regression based imputation is more complicated compared with complete case available case and vertical imputation a regression model is fitted between the target variable i e variable with missing data and the selected independent variables the regression model can be linear polynomial or of another type depending on the dataset the resulting regression equation is then used to impute instances with missing points in the target variable in principle regression based imputation can be both stochastic and deterministic based on how uncertainty is factored in deterministic regression can lead to inaccuracies as it does not account for uncertainty and it artificially reinforces linear relationships instead exact predictions are used without considering the error term enders 2001 on the other hand stochastic regression is more common and realistic as it accounts for the error nonetheless stochastic regression can be more complicated as the distribution of the error term has to be taken into account lang and little 2016 as shown by longford 2005 the general form of stochastic imputation between the associated variables y with missing instances and w complete dataset is provided by 1 y f w ϵ in eq 1 f w is some appropriate function e g linear polynomial etc and ϵ is the error term which is used to account for the uncertainty 2 5 6 multiple imputation multiple imputation mi represents a modern and more sophisticated approach to imputation mi can increase the accuracy of the imputation while reducing the bias as discussed by azur et al 2011 using a mi approach allows for better accountability of the statistical uncertainty as opposed to single imputations the mi approach is based on the improved use of predominant imputation techniques assuming an incomplete dataset y mi follows the subsequent steps fig 3 1 impute the missing values of y m times 2 analyse separately the m different datasets 3 merge the m different results into one dataset mi depends on certain user specified selection steps initially the imputation method has to be specified selection can include deterministic or stochastic methods next the number of imputation cycles must be identified increasing the number of cycles can increase the model s accuracy however this comes at a computational cost the final selection involves the determination of the concluding missing values from m different datasets the selection can be facilitated in either a deterministic mean median or a stochastic random or probabilistic selection way all of the above choices are case and application dependant through the recent literature it is seen that the multiple imputation by chained equations mice approach further discussed in section 3 is one of the most promising and accurate implementation of multiple mi royston 2004 royston and white 2015 2 6 comparison table 1 provides a qualitative summary of the above imputation techniques from 1 it can be observed that both the hot deck and regression imputation techniques exhibit the best overall quality hron et al 2010 templ et al 2011 srebotnjak et al 2012 sullivan and andridge 2015 both approaches retain the size of the database which is a big advantage especially when dealing with limited data similarly both approaches can account for uncertainty in their predictions which is not easily possible with other techniques and especially vertical imputation lastly both hot deck and regression imputation populate the dataset with plausible values especially in hot deck imputation where the predictions are based on actual observations when selecting imputation approaches another consideration should be the ability to combine engineering knowledge with the imputation model in hot deck imputation this is facilitated as the donors for the imputation can be specified by the researcher this means that when there is a missing value in a specific variable the donor is selected based on the variables interconnection within the engineering system the same philosophy can be applied to regression imputation when specifying the target independent variables pair taking into account the merits of hot deck imputation it is worth examining in greater detail its most useful and widespread implementation k nn not only k nn is an effective imputation tool on its own but it can easily be used in hybrid models moreover k nn is a lazy algorithm and as such it does not require an explicit training phase this greatly reduces the required computational cost and increases the efficiency batista and monard 2003 armina et al 2017 similarly considering the enhanced capabilities of mi schafer and olsen 1998 ibrahim et al 2005 and the merits of regression based approaches batista and monard 2003 it is worth examining mice which represents an ideal combination of the two approaches corben 1954 mice like k nn is an approach that can be successfully used in hybrid models armina et al 2017 moreover a novel hybrid methodology combining the merits of k nn and mice will be demonstrated filling the gap of a formalised approach for handling missing data in the maritime industry 3 methodology the focus of this study is the development of a novel hybrid imputation methodology for the maritime industry through the assessment and performance evaluation of different state of the art imputation approaches as mentioned above this is the first step towards an advanced framework which will employ a novel data condition and performance imputation method for energy efficient operations of marine systems the established approach is holistic and includes all the necessary steps for successful imputation including pre and post imputation steps which as shown in the previous sections of this paper is currently missing from the maritime industry it has to be kept in mind that the selected imputation approach must cater to the specific needs of the maritime industry i e subsequent use of data in condition or performance monitoring the necessary steps to achieve this are included in the following distinctive processes 1 data collection including the data gathering effort 2 preliminary analysis including form handling data synchronisation data filtering and correlation examination 3 imputation process including the implementation and assessment of the different imputation approaches by examining theabsolute percentage error ape mean absolute percentage error mape and standard deviation of error σ 4 operational analysis including the correction of variables based on relevant manufacture s guidelines the proposed methodology is shown in fig 4 in which the assessed imputation approaches including k nn mice and the novel hybrid method are described in more detail together with the preliminary analysis and operational analysis 3 1 data collection the data collection step includes the required activities and efforts to gather the data used in the methodology the collected data originate from a marine commercial daq system installed onboard a merchant navy vessel in general data collection is not restricted to only commercial daq systems as it can be facilitated from numerous other sources including log books and other archives e g noon reports spread sheets etc however commercial daq systems offer great advantages with regards to the ease of their use and their increased accuracy 3 2 preliminary analysis preliminary analysis is an essential preparatory step for the implementation and assessment of the hybrid imputation approach it includes the form handling synchronisation filtering and correlation examination of the data and variables of the given dataset the preliminary analysis initiates with the form handling of data this is a simple yet important step as data are tabulated in the appropriate form for the next steps of the methodology next the data are synchronised using linear interpolation eq 2 a process that is necessary as the daq sensors do not have exactly the same sampling rate 2 y 2 x 2 x 1 y 3 y 1 x 3 x 1 y 1 in eq 2 x represents the different time stamps and y the variables values subscripts 1 refers to values before the selected timestamp subscripts 2 refers to values at the synchronisation point and subscripts 3 refer to values after the selected timestamp the synchronisation of the data ensures that there is consistency among them and they are harmonised over time it is an especially important process when using similarity based imputation approaches this is necessary as all the measurements from a potential imputation donor must correspond to a single time stamp data filtering is a very important process that prepares the dataset for imputation this process determines the points that need to be imputed by determining if a sensor reading is missing or it has an illogical value the assessment of whether a recorded value is logical or not depends on the engineering knowledge of the variable being measured to determine if an instance has an illogical value e g negative exhaust gas temperatures sources from the equipment s manufacturer or the results from the commissioning tests e g sea trials are used the last step of the preliminary analysis is the correlation examination of the variables this is a common step in most data driven applications as it gives a better understanding of the data identifying the correlation between the different variables makes imparting fp knowledge to the imputation process easier the correlation of the available data was examined by using the pearson correlation coefficient and cross referencing the results with fp engineering knowledge the pearson correlation coefficient ranges between 1 perfect negative linear correlation and 1 perfect positive linear correlation while 0 denotes no linear correlation 3 3 imputation process following the preliminary analysis step the imputation process takes place which includes the implementation of the novel hybrid method and its comparison with the identified state of the art mice and widely used k nn algorithms the assessment includes the application of the different imputation approaches to the required points as identified during data filtering in the dataset and the evaluation of the results using residual errors for the hot deck imputation approach the k nn algorithm is used this is a very popular tool for value prediction and it has widespread applicability in imputation the k nn algorithm is intuitively easy to understand and produces accurate results zhang 2012 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 for the regression based approach the mice algorithm is selected the mice algorithm is a very effective tool in predicting values in multivariate datasets as it incorporates the benefits of mi with regression this algorithm is relatively new compared to the more traditional imputation approaches e g vertical imputation van buuren and oudshoorn 1999 white et al 2011 the hybrid approach that is presented is a novel tool that incorporates the benefits of k nn and mice while avoiding their respective shortcomings in detail the hybrid approach has the following unique benefits 1 provides realistic imputations due to the use of the k nn algorithm 2 provides easy incorporation of fp knowledge due to the use of the k nn algorithm 3 is based on the widely recognised k nn algorithm 4 takes advantage of the non artificial replication of values offered by mice 5 takes advantage of the flexible implementation of mice mice is a flexible and state of the art as already discussed approach that avoids bias in the results by fitting a series of regression models in the dataset shah et al 2014 mice is used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed novel hybrid imputation method this approach is considered as an implementation of mi which uses linear regressions to help in the estimate of the missing values for the rest of the section let y and k be variables with observed y o b s k o b s and missing points y m i s s k m i s s and z a set of complete variables with z o b s and z m i s s corresponding to the observed and missing points of y and k mice calculates the missing points by using a bayesian approach to update prior distributions of the variables the y and k variables are assumed random and prior distributions are assigned usually an uninformative one by taking into account the z variables posterior distributions are obtained the steps for the application of mice are the following 1 impute all the missing points of y and k with the means of the y o b s and k o b s eqs 3 and 4 n y o b s and n k o b s represent the total number of observations for the y and k variables respectively 3 y ˆ m i s s i y o b s i n y o b s 4 k ˆ m i s s i k o b s i n k o b s these initial estimates y ˆ m i s s i k ˆ m i s s i are placeholders and they only facilitate the initiation of the process 2 set the placeholders of one of the variables e g y ˆ m i s s i back to missing 3 fit a linear regression model eq 5 between the observed points of the target variable y o b s and the appropriate independent variables either all or a subset of z 5 y ˆ m i s s i θ t z in eq 5 z is a column vector of the independent variables and θ is row vector of the regression parameters the y ˆ m i s s i parameter represents the imputation estimates produced by the regression model 4 find the row vector θ by minimising the mean squared error eq 6 6 m s e 1 n y o b s i 1 n y o b s y o b s i y ˆ o b s i 2 the row vector θ can be calculated based on two different approaches if the dataset is large then an optimisation approach can be used e g gradient decent to fit the regression model and find the row vector θ however due to the size of the dataset used an algebraic method was employed to fit the regression model and find the row vector θ generally if the dataset is relatively small algebraic methods can be used as they offer greater simplicity as the size of the dataset increases optimisation approaches are used as they offer a significant reduction in the required computational time 5 use eq 5 to impute the missing points of the y variable 6 repeat steps 2 3 4 and 5 for every variable with missing points in the dataset 7 reaching step 6 is one cycle the entire process is repeated for a predetermined number of cycles usually 10 repetitions is an empirically accepted number in summary mice uses linear regression in an iterative manner the process initiates by using mean imputation every variable with missing values is used in a regression model to update the initial mean imputation the second algorithm that is implemented and assessed isk nn k nearest neighbours k nn is used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed novel hybrid imputation method in k nn k stands for a specified number of instances nearest neighbours that will be considered this is a non parametric and lazy algorithm as it does not take into account the distribution of the data in the examined vectors and it has no explicit training phase zhang and zhou 2007 as with any hot deck approach k nn is based on the similarity between features there is no standard number for the k hyperparameter it depends on the field of application and it selection lies with the researcher in general a small k will restrict the algorithm to a small region of the data and as a result it will produce results with low bias and high variance a very small k e g k 1 creates models sensitive to outliers noise and anomalous data as the model is overfitted and not generalised enough for use in out of sample data conversely a high k e g k 20 will create overgeneralised models as it averages more possible donors generating results with low variance and an increased bias the similarity of the instances is assessed by the minkowski distance eq 7 7 d i 1 n x i y i p 1 p in eq 7 the p hyperparameter is set to 2 which transforms d to the euclidean distance the most common distance metric groenen and jajuga 2001 similarly x i and y i represent the examined instances in addition to the distance metric a weight is also assigned to each possible donor based on its distance by doing so closer neighbouring points i e similar and most recent operating conditions have greater influence over the instance to be predicted this is a very important feature as it allows taking into account the actual operation of the system under examination lastly a hybrid approach combining k nn and mice is applied and assessed against the state of the art mice and widely used k nn algorithms the k nn component is based on fp this approach begins with the correlation analysis where the systemic correlation between the variables is specified in the hybrid approach each vector in the dataset is examined in turn when an instance with a missing value is identified the k nn algorithm is deployed however the algorithm searches for possible donors only in correlated variables as determined during the correlation analysis by doing so the entire process is executed quicker because only certain vectors of the dataset are examined also the predictive power of the model is enhanced as only correlated variables are used to predict missing points this process is repeated until no further changes occur to the dataset in many cases the cessation of the k nn algorithm signifies its incapacity to impute any more missing points as points from the correlated vectors may be missing simultaneously in that case the remaining missing points are predicted using the aforementioned mice approach the structure of the proposed novel hybrid methodology is demonstrated in algorithm 1 for the assessment of the different imputation tools the ape eq 8 mape eq 9 and the standard deviation of the error σ eq 10 are calculated for each case the goal is to select the imputation approach with minimum mape and σ the ape and mape are selected as they are common and easy to understand metrics for the evaluation of the model s performance bryne 2012 the standard deviation of the error was used to determine the possibility of introducing outliers within the predictions in the following equations x i and x i ˆ represent the actual value of the variable and the predicted value respectively 8 a p e x i x i ˆ x i 9 m a p e 100 n i 1 n a p e 10 σ a p e i m a p e 2 n in summary a total of three different approaches are implemented and assessed the first one is mice which is applied to the entire dataset until no missing points were left the mice approach uses the computational validness of regression with the similarity considerations of the hot deck approaches and it was implemented in a data driven manner the second approach that is tried is the k nn this approach is applied to the entire dataset without taking into consideration any systemic correlations until all the missing points in the dataset are imputed lastly the hybrid approach is tested which combines k nn with fp analysis and mice the k nn algorithm is deployed by taking into account systemic interdependencies between variables then the mice algorithm is used to impute any missing points that the fp k nn cannot predict 3 4 operational analysis the operational analysis is the last step of the developed methodology and includes the correction of the variables to account for ambient conditions this step ensures that the data are prepared for subsequent analysis for example condition monitoring to account for the ambient conditions various sources are taken into including international standards and the manufacturers recommendations accounting for ambient conditions is a common step in many applications as it ensures that the affected variables are adjusted accordingly 4 case study 4 1 preliminary analysis the described methodology is applied in the case of a chemical tanker with length l o a 183 m and deadweight 38 000 tonnes in the turbocharger t c and m e system the selection of the system is based on its criticality and overall importance as discussed by harrington 1986 taylor 1990 cheliotis and lazakis 2018 the t c in question is the tca66 20032 by man b w and has a maximum speed rating of 16000 rpm it is connected to the m e 6s50mc c which has a maximum continuous rating mcr of 9600 kw at 127 rpm see fig 5 the variables available for the analysis as supplied by a marine daq are m e power in kw m e speed in rpm t c inlet eg temperature in c t c outlet eg temperature in c t c speed in rpm t c lubricating oil lo inlet pressure in bar and t c lo outlet temperature c also the engine room air and the air cooler cooling water temperatures are recorded the descriptive statistics of the synchronised uniform and filtered data are shown in table 3 as mentioned in the methodology the first step of the preliminary analysis is the form handling of the dataset the variables in the dataset are tabulated and a uniform format is given then the data are synchronised eq 2 to harmonise them over time after the synchronisation the dataset is filtered to determine the points that need to be imputed table 2 shows the limits used for data filtration the entire dataset is scanned based on limits shown in table 2 in any instance with values outside of the range specified in table 2 the values are treated as missing points the final step of the preliminary analysis is the correlation examination of the variables for that reason the pearson correlation coefficient is initially calculated fig 6 the results of fig 6 are cross referenced with the engineering knowledge of the m e and t c systems for example it is known that the t c lo inlet pressure and t c lo outlet temperature are among the uncorrelated variables due to the fact that the t c lo system is independent and does not come to contact with areas of the m e or the t c where the working processes occur on the other hand the t c speed and the m e power have the biggest correlation the t c speed is influenced by many factors it is correlated with the temperature drop of the exhaust gases in the t c the t c speed is also correlated with the m e power and m e speed which in turn influences the temperature of the exhaust gases it should be noted that there are other variables that influence the t c speed m e power and the temperature of the exhaust gases for example such variables are the combustion pressure and the back pressure of the t c the combustion pressure influences the power output and subsequently the temperature of the exhaust gases on the other hand the back pressure of the t c can affect reduce the t c speed as the back pressure can restrict the flow of the gases hountalas et al 2014 guan et al 2015 even though these parameters are identified for their importance they are not included in the selected dataset for the analysis this is due to the fact that the daq used for the measuring of the parameters is not capable of recording them comparing the results from fig 6 and the engineering knowledge of the m e and t c systems the final correlation between variables is obtained table 4 as it can be observed table 4 shows only the presence of correlation between variables and not the magnitude of the correlation as required by the hybrid method it requires only the presence of correlation between variables and not the magnitude 4 2 imputation process following the completion of the preliminary analysis step the implementation and assessment of the different imputation approaches take place the results from the discussed imputation approaches are presented in figs 7 14 for each case a histogram depicting the ape and a scatter plot depicting each prediction are shown in the scatter plot the line y x representing perfect accuracy is plotted to help the determination of the accuracy of each prediction fig 7 shows the imputed values and ape for the t c lo inlet pressure through the histogram it is noted that all the approaches produce equally good predictions also from the histogram it is observed that the approaches produce predictions with ape ranging from 0 35 through the scatter plot it is observed that the k nn algorithm produces the results with the biggest standard deviation sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset as aforementioned all three approaches produce results with errors this behaviour is attributed to the fact that t c lo inlet pressure does not have a substantial correlation with the other variables it has to be kept in mind that all of the imputation approaches are based to some extent on the correlation between the variables he errors produced are justified due to the t c lo inlet pressure not following this assumption fig 8 shows the imputed values and ape for the t c lo outlet temperature through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape also from the histogram it is observed that the approaches produce predictions with ape ranging from 0 8 through the scatter plot it is observed that both k nn and mice algorithms produce results with large sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset the hybrid approach performs the best as it closely follows the y x line fig 9 shows the imputed values and ape for the m e power through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape also from the histogram it is observed that the approaches produce predictions with ape ranging from 0 12 through the scatter plot it is observed that the mice algorithm produces results with large sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset as the m e power is a highly correlated variable the fp component of the hybrid method contributes to making it perform the best fig 10 shows the imputed values and ape for the m e speed through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape also from the histogram it is observed that the approaches produce predictions with ape ranging from 0 8 through the scatter plot we observe that the mice algorithm produces results with large sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset it is observed that all the tools produce more accurate predictions from 100 rpm and above at lower speeds many of the predictions are relatively inaccurate with the mice tool predicting possible outliers as with the previous cases the hybrid approach follows the y x line the closest fig 11 show the imputed values and ape for the m e scavenging air pressure through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape also from the histogram it is observed that the approaches produce predictions with ape ranging from 0 35 through the scatter plot it is observed that the k nn algorithm produces results with large sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset in this variable all of the imputation methods produce results very close to the actual values the variation of the predictions from mice and the hybrid tool are quite low and they both follow closely the y x line fig 12 shows the imputed values and ape for the t c eg inlet temperature through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape also through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape through the scatter plot it is observed that the mice algorithm produces results with large sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset the t c eg inlet temperature exhibits a similar behaviour with the m e speed the predictions of all the tools are relatively inaccurate at lower temperatures however this behaviour is reverted at higher temperatures with the hybrid method following the y x line the closest fig 13 shows the imputed values and ape for the t c eg outlet temperature through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape also from the histogram it is observed that the approaches produce predictions with ape ranging from 0 10 through the scatter plot it is observed that the mice algorithm produces results with large sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset in general the hybrid method displays consistently good predictions in the temperature range following the y x line the closest finally fig 14 shows the imputed values and ape for the t c speed through the histogram it is noted that the hybrid method has the best performance with the majority of the predictions having less than 1 ape also from the histogram it is observed that the approaches produce predictions with ape ranging from 0 18 through the scatter plot it is observed that the mice algorithm produces results with large sparsity which can introduce outliers in the dataset similarly with the previous cases the hybrid method displays consistently good predictions in the speed range following the y x line closely summarising the above table 5 encapsulates the overall performance of the three tools for the examined variables table 5 shows the mape and mean standard deviation for each approach and for each variable also an overall mape and mean standard deviation are shown to summarise the general performance of each approach as it is observed even though the two state of the art approaches perform relatively well the hybrid method outperforms them it has the lowest overall mean error of 2 21 and the smallest overall standard deviation of 2 64 the hybrid tool makes accurate predictions without running the risk of generating outliers the worst performing tool is the k nn with an overall mean error of 5 55 and an overall standard deviation of 8 9 observing the results it becomes clear that in correlated variables m e power m e speed t c speed t c eg inlet temperature t c eg outlet temperature m e scavenging air pressure t c lo outlet temperature the novel imputation method has superior performance it is observed that the fp component of the hybrid model makes a positive influence on the prediction by understanding the systemic interdependencies of the system under examination the performance of the predictions is enhanced therefore the integration of the knowledge of the system to any predictive effort is encouraged and should be preferred to purely data driven approaches 4 3 operational analysis following the imputation process step the resulting dataset is adjusted to account for the influence of the environmental conditions for that reason the t c speed m e scavenging air pressure and the t c eg inlet temperature were corrected man b w 2014 tsitsilonis and theotokatos 2018 according to the manufactures guides and the iso 3046 1 2002 standards international organization for standardization 2008 the measured m e scavenging air pressure p s c a v was adjusted to its

e g i n 5 conclusion this paper develops a novel data condition and performance imputation method for energy efficient operations of marine systems this study examined imputations from a holistic view including all the necessary pre and post imputation steps at the same time it is shown how a treated dataset with no missing values can lead to more accurate condition monitoring models and therefore improve the efficient operation of ship systems the superior performance of the proposed novel imputation method is compared against the existing k nn and mice methods and is demonstrated in the case of a m e andt c system of a 38 000 tonnes chemical tanker in total eight variables are examined including the m e power m e speed m e scavenging air pressure t c eg inlet temperature t c eg outlet

used in condition and performance monitoring the highlight of using fp analysis in the prediction of measurements from an engineering system compared to purely data driven approaches in the case of uncorrelated variables e g t c lo inlet pressure similarity based imputation methods did not perform well yielding errors above 8 in those cases time series analysis should be preferred following the

22531,the applicability of the second generation intact stability criteria for preventing pure loss of stability in astern waves to offshore supply vessels osv is investigated osvs show an inconsistency problem in the first and second level criteria thus free running model experiments of an osv by changing its length of low weather deck in regular stern quartering waves were conducted and were compared with numerical simulation used for pure loss of stability so far as a result it was confirmed that the effects of water on deck wod on the behaviour of the osv could prevent the occurrence of typical pure loss of stability for the cases of long low weather deck one of wod s effects is the increase of roll damping and the other is the loss of static stability keywords offshore supply vessel water on deck pure loss of stability roll damping bulwark 1 introduction at the international maritime organization imo the second generation intact stability criteria are currently under development these criteria are physics based consisting of two level vulnerability criteria and direct stability assessment they are designed to cover five major failure modes such as pure loss of stability parametric roll surfing and broaching dead ship condition and excessive acceleration for pure loss of stability failure mode the vulnerability level 1 and level 2 criteria developed at the imo utilize the metacentric height gm and righting arm gz in longitudinal waves respectively imo 2015 the vulnerability criteria are summarised in appendix 1 the sample calculations performed by two delegations japan 2018 indicate that offshore supply vessels easily pass the lowest level level 1 criteria but often fail to pass the second level level 2 this suggests that draft criteria may overlook some physics thus the current vulnerability criteria are allowed not to be applied to a vessel with extended low weather deck due to increased likelihood of water on deck or deck in water however the definition of the extended low weather deck was not yet established until now therefore one of the remaining issues is the applicability of criteria for preventing pure loss of stability in astern waves to offshore supply vessels osv osvs are essential needs in the offshore oilfield business and these vessels are required to operate and work in harsh environments osvs often have extended low weather decks about half the ship length which is surrounded by bulwarks with freeing ports among the different types of osvs some often have no bulwarks at stern end because of operational purpose such as anchor handling and towing thus in heavy seas large amount of water can be temporarily trapped on the weather deck this may be one of factors that the draft criteria overlook there are some reports of accidents of offshore supply vessels such as m v sabine seashore and m v laverne herbert which include capsizing and loss of ship where water on deck could have been one of the causes ntsb 1978 1983 many researchers studied the effect of water on deck concerning fishing vessels and osvs dillingham 1981 performed numerical simulation of 2d flow of water on deck of a fishing vessel in beam seas falzarano et al 2002 improved this method for application to 3d flow of water on deck of an osv in beam seas both concluded by numerical simulations that the water on deck reduces the roll but not always umeda et al 2016 performed a model experiment of an osv in regular stern quartering waves and compared it with numerical model proposed by kubo et al 2012 they found that there were no severe roll at high speed but there was large heel at low speed these results cannot be explained by the simulation which does not take into account the water on deck in this research the effect of low weather deck length and the effect of wod on the behaviour of osv in regular stern quartering seas are investigated free running model experiments of osvs are performed with models having the same hull form but with different low weather deck lengths also the experiment results are compared with numerical simulation which considers the wod effect 2 model experiment 2 1 subject ship free running model experiment was performed at the seakeeping and manoeuvring basin at the national research institute of fisheries engineering the basin is 60 m in long 25 m in wide and 3 2 m in deep the ship model used is the same one as in umeda et al 2016 hull form view and principal particulars of the osv are shown in fig 1 and table 1 respectively the vessel has a deck house in the bow part and a low weather deck from its middle part to aft end it has twin propellers and twin rudders a model scale of 1 30 is used for the model experiment the displacement value itself is confidential business information so that it cannot be presented here the metacentric height is set to marginally comply with level 2 criteria for pure loss of stability which is lower than the designed one the vessel under the experimental condition is judged not vulnerable to pure loss of stability with the level 1 criterion because the gm as the slope of gz curve at the upright condition with the wave steepness of 0 0334 is 1 32 m which is much larger than 0 05 m however it critically complies with the level 2 criterion with cr value of 0 06 thus an inconsistency between the two levels could appear if the calm water gm is smaller than 1 45 m umeda et al 2016 2 2 experiment condition the experiment procedures were based on the ittc international towing tank committee recommended procedures for intact stability model test ittc 2008 propulsion power was supplied from the rechargeable batteries which were placed inside the model hull the ship model was equipped with an optical fibre gyroscope to get the roll angle pitch angle and yaw angle propeller rate and rudder angle steering gear and a pd autopilot for course keeping water surface elevation was measured by a servo needle type wave probe the probe was fixed and positioned 11 m from the wave maker for avoiding the wave reflection from the wave absorbing beach situated opposite to the wave maker and sufficiently far away from the local non propagating waves due to wave maker actions instantaneous position of the model relative to the basin was optically measured with total station system which consists of two theodolites at the basin and two prisms on board umeda et al 2014 to modify the length of low weather deck of original vessel three additional decks are added systematically each additional deck has equal length of 14 73 m and is watertight they have the same width as width between bulwarks and the same height as bulwark height based on the mode of addition the ship model was modified into four cases as shown in table 2 here l refers to the length of low weather deck measured from ap for case 1 all three additional decks are added for case 2 two additional decks are added for case 3 only one additional deck is added the metacentric heights of models of case 1 case 2 and case 3 are kept the same as that of original model for case 4 the low weather deck length is the same as case 3 but the metacentric height is reduced from 1 45 m to 1 053 m as a result both the original model and case 4 marginally comply with the 2008 is code while case 3 has some margin due to buoyancy of the additional super structure the displacements of all model cases are kept the same as that of original model model ships of all four cases are shown in fig 2 free running model experiments were conducted for regular waves of two wave cases one is the wavelength to ship length ratio λ l of 1 0 and the wave steepness h λ of 0 1 as a well known worst situation of restoring reduction the other is λ l of 1 5 and h λ of 0 1 as the case inducing heave motions relevant to water ingress the heading angle was 30 from the wave direction and the tested froude numbers ranged from 0 15 to 0 37 the model was situated near the wave maker first after the wave train propagated enough in the model basin the model propeller revolutions were increased to the specified value to achieve the required speed and the steering system activated several runs were performed with possible combinations of wave conditions and speeds the righting arm curves of all four model cases in calm water and in waves with λ l of 1 0 and h λ of 0 1 are shown in fig 3 for the sake of comparison the righting arm curve of the original model umeda et al 2016 is also included in these calculations effects of the bulwark thickness are ignored 3 experiment results and discussion 3 1 pure loss level 2 criteria check first of all case 1 case 2 and case 3 models are checked with draft pure loss level 2 criteria imo 2015 in level 2 criteria there are two criteria values cr1 and cr2 cr1 is a criterion based on the calculation of the angle of vanishing stability cr2 is a criterion based on the calculation of the angle of heel under the action of heeling lever which is calculated by equation 1 1 8 h λ d f n 2 where h is the wave height λ is the wave length d is the ship draught and fn is the service froude number the results shown in fig 4 show the relationship between the lengths of low weather deck and the level 2 index values when the length of low weather deck increases the index values increase this is because the osv has less gz values in waves when the model has longer low weather deck as shown in fig 3 even negative righting arms can appear when a wave crest is at amidships for models with larger lengths of low weather decks it is obvious from fig 4 that the restoring moment can be decreased and the cases were judged as dangerous by the level 2 criteria when the low weather deck length is longer than 0 4 l pp this means that case 1 and case 2 models are safe for pure loss while case 3 and original design can be vulnerable to pure loss 3 2 model experiment results the results from the model experiment for the wave case of λ l of 1 5 and h λ of 0 1 are shown in fig 5 here the maximum roll angles recorded in the free running experiment for different froude number are shown for the sake of comparison the experiment result of the original model umeda et al 2016 is also included for case 1 case 2 and case 3 models the roll angles are not so large and also no tendency of pure loss of stability was observed in a typical pure loss of stability phenomenon the roll amplitude usually increases with increasing speed the level 2 criteria check however indicates that the model of case 3 can be vulnerable to pure loss there is a contradiction between the level 2 criteria result and the experiment results for case 3 for case 4 as well as the original vessel umeda et al 2016 large roll angles are found for the froude number smaller than 0 25 this behaviour is similar to that of the original model during the experiment it was found that a large amount of water entered from the stern end for this case and despite the egress through the freeing ports the ingress from the stern was much larger thus this large roll angles can be considered due to the static heeling moment of large volume of trapped water on deck 4 numerical simulation 4 1 simulation without wod numerical simulation using a coupled surge sway yaw roll 4dof model developed by kubo et al 2012 which is based on the manoeuvring model for ships in calm water by hirano and takashina 1980 is applied the linear wave induced forces and moments are calculated by a slender body theory with low encounter frequency assumption umeda et al 1995 the roll restoring arm variation is estimated with grim 1961 s effective wave concept more details of the numerical model are described in appendix 2 the comparison between the experiment results and simulation results are shown in fig 6 here the wave condition is λ l of 1 5 and h λ of 0 1 froude number fn is 0 15 for case 1 0 29 for case 2 and case 3 and 0 15 for case 4 for case 1 the model has no low weather deck so that also no wod there is good agreement in the amplitudes between the simulation result and the experiment result for case 2 and case 3 it can be seen that the simulation result overestimates the roll motion the models in both cases have low weather deck and therefore a certain amount of water can enter and be trapped if some phase lag exists between the trapped water and the ship roll motion the water may act as anti rolling device nevertheless this simulation does not take into account this effect for case 4 the simulation result and the experiment result are even qualitatively different a certain mean heel angle exists due to the static heeling moment of trapped water which might be in phase with the ship roll motion also here the simulation does not take into account this heeling moment 4 2 water on deck effect water trapped on deck may sometimes act as an anti rolling mechanism when there is a phase lag between the trapped water and ship roll motion to examine if this is the case two roll decay tests were performed during the experiment small angle roll decay tests and large angle roll decay tests for the small angle tests an initial heel angle of about 10 was given to the model and then released no water entered from the freeing ports this can be considered as roll damping due to hull only for the large angle tests an initial heel angle of about 25 which results in a smaller maximum mean roll angle because of roll damping nature was given to the model and released some water entered from the freeing ports so the latter test results included the wod effect the roll extinction curves of these two kinds of tests are shown in fig 7 following the standard procedure of the roll decay tests for roll damping coefficients ittc 2011 it can be seen that the damping with wod increases compared with the one without wod generally it can be concluded that wod plays a somewhat important role in the roll damping of this ship model therefore roll damping of this osv should be provided as the sum of the damping due to hull only and the damping due to wod for the hull only damping the data from the small angle roll decay tests can be used for the damping due to wod the ittc recommended formula ittc 2011 for the equivalent linear roll damping due to flooded water as shown in 1 is attempted to use the estimation formula is based on the database obtained from a systematic model experiment by katayama et al 2009 and ikeda and kawahara 2008 2 b 44 i w a h b comp φ a

ship gravitational centre cg from the water surface the formulae of the functions a b and c are available in ittc 2011 in applying equation 2 to the ship model the deck is considered as a tank with the length equal to the length of low weather deck the breadth equal to the width between bulwarks and the height equal to the bulwark height this estimation equation is used to calculate the additional damping due to wod in this stage both the water depth and the roll amplitude are unknown among them the measured roll amplitude averaged within an encounter wave cycle was substituted here because the purpose of this paper is to clarify the effect of wod on the critical ship behaviour thus the largest wod amount within the encounter wave cycle can be geometrically determined with the bulwark height and the deck breadth in other words the feasible range of water that can be trapped on deck is first estimated for a particular speed and for an average roll angle for that condition then a certain depth of water is assumed to be trapped within the bulwarks of ship the freeing ports are assumed to be closed and then the numerical simulation is repeated until the obtained average roll amplitude is sufficiently close to the assumed roll amplitude apart from hydrodynamic effect of wod the static heeling arm due to wod can be dominant in some cases in case 4 it is apparent because of mean roll angle as shown in fig 6 for these cases the static heeling arm due to wod is calculated using hydrostatics without assuming the enclosed tank mentioned before here the amount of water on deck which was not measured in the experiments is systematically changed for realizing good agreements in the numerical simulation focusing on the mean roll angle for the heeling arm calculation the movement of cg is calculated assuming that the shape of free surface is horizontal and the dynamic effect of water is not considered the freeing ports are assumed to be closed and the flow of water is considered only over the bulwark 4 3 simulation with wod the numerical simulation model is extended to take account of the above roll damping effect and the heel moment effect of the wod and then applied to the experiment cases the results as shown in fig 8 indicate the reasonably better agreements between the experiment and the simulation the roll amplitudes in the numerical simulation for case 2 and case 3 are reduced because of roll damping effect due to water on deck here the used water depth on deck is around 0 3 m while the bulwark height is 2 7 m the ratio of the frequency of roll motion to the natural roll frequency of water is about 1 the mean roll angle in the simulation for case 4 increases because of hydrostatic heeling moment due to accumulated water on deck here the used water depth is 0 5 m while the bulwark height is 2 7 m the ratio of frequency of roll motion to the natural roll frequency of water is smaller than 1 the mutual importance of these two different effects of wod could depend on the magnitude of hull restoring moment also the comparison of the maximum roll angles obtained from the model experiments and the simulation with and without wod effect is shown in fig 9 the results from the simulation with wod effect are relatively comparable to those of model experiments for case 4 the simulation results without wod effect for fn 0 25 and fn 0 27 are plotted as 90 as the simulation indicates the vessel to be capsized 5 conclusions it is confirmed experimentally that the level 2 pure loss of stability criteria should not be applied to ships with low weather deck length greater than 0 4 l pp and which is not completely surrounded by bulwarks this fact could be a clue for establishing the definition of the ships with extended low weather decks in future the presence of wod is important for the stability of the osv for high metacentric height the presence of wod reduces the roll motion like case 2 and case 3 in contrast when metacentric height is reduced the heeling moment due to accumulated water becomes more relevant like case 4 the numerical model used here could open a door to use the direct stability assessment for this type of ships but the estimation of the amount of water on deck without a model experiment is a remaining issue to be overcome acknowledments this work was supported by a grants in aid for scientific research from the japan society for promotion of science jsps kakenhi grant number 15h02327 it was partly carried out as a research activity of goal based stability criteria project of japan ship technology research association in the fiscal years of 2016 funded by the nippon foundation appendix 1 draft vulnerability criteria for pure loss of stability failure mode the sub committee on ship design and construction sdc of the imo developed the draft vulnerability criteria for pure loss of stability in 2015 imo 2015 they consist of the level 1 and level 2 criteria these criteria should be applied to ships having the operational froude number of 0 24 or larger this is because stability failure known as pure loss of stability normally occurs when a ship spends longer duration at a wave crest in astern waves at which the transverse restoring moment is reduced its level 2 criteria require that the probability of dangerous sea state for pure loss of stability is smaller than the standard of 0 06 using the wave scatter diagram for the north atlantic for defining the danger sea states the wave spectrum specified by the significant wave height and the mean zero crossing wave period is represented with the 3 largest grim s effective waves and then the righting arm of the ship in the effective waves is calculated if the largest value of the static heel angle under the heeling moment due to yaw motions in waves during one encounter wave cycle is larger than 25 or the smallest angle of vanishing stability in waves during one encounter wave cycle is smaller than 30 such sea states are regarded as dangerous the standard of 0 06 was determined to explain the accident of a ropax ship in astern waves its level 1 criterion was developed by simplifying the level 2 criteria for reducing the computational loads in place of the righting arm the metacentric height in longitudinal waves is requested to be larger than the standard of 0 05 m the used wave steepness is a typical value of the north atlantic since the level 1 is simpler than the level 2 the level 1 criterion is expected to be more conservative thus the sdc sub committee executed sample calculations for a few hundred existing vessels japan 2018 as a result the inconsistent cases i e the cases that ships complying with the level 1 criterion fail to comply with the level 2 criteria were reported only for the limited number of ship types the offshore supply vessels are one of them because of the low freeboards thus the sdc sub committee agreed not to apply these vulnerability criteria for pure loss of stability to a vessel with extended low weather deck due to increased likelihood of water on deck or deck in water such as offshore supply vessels therefore it is expected to develop stability criteria for phenomena related to water on deck appendix 2 numerical model of a coupled surge sway yaw roll model kubo et al 2012 a coupled surge sway yaw roll 4 dof model was developed and validated with model experiments of a containership model by kubo et al 2012 in this numerical model manoeuvring effect on roll is carefully modelled with captive model experiment and heave and pitch motions are assumed to be regarded as a static equilibrium because of low encounter frequency the coordinate systems are defined as shown in fig 10 the space fixed one is o ξηζ and the horizontal body fixed one is g xyz umeda and yamakoshi 1994 the mathematical model used here is shown in equations 3 7 and is based on the manoeuvring model for ships in calm water with coupling from the heel hirano and takashina 1980 and the wave induced forces and moments calculated by a slender body theory with low encounter frequency assumption umeda et al 1995 and the roll restoring arm variation estimated with grim s effective wave concept grim 1961 are added the roll damping moment the ship resistance the propeller thrust and the manoeuvring coefficients were determined with model tests with forward velocity the wave induced surge force is corrected with an empirical correction factor α for a diffraction effect ito et al 2014 a proportional and differential auto pilot is added for simulating course keeping steering the rudder gain and the differential time constant in model scale used here are 3 and 6 08s respectively the symbols used here are defined in nomenclature 3 m m

22531,the applicability of the second generation intact stability criteria for preventing pure loss of stability in astern waves to offshore supply vessels osv is investigated osvs show an inconsistency problem in the first and second level criteria thus free running model experiments of an osv by changing its length of low weather deck in regular stern quartering waves were conducted and were compared with numerical simulation used for pure loss of stability so far as a result it was confirmed that the effects of water on deck wod on the behaviour of the osv could prevent the occurrence of typical pure loss of stability for the cases of long low weather deck one of wod s effects is the increase of roll damping and the other is the loss of static stability keywords offshore supply vessel water on deck pure loss of stability roll damping bulwark 1 introduction at the international maritime organization imo the second generation intact stability criteria are currently under development these criteria are physics based consisting of two level vulnerability criteria and direct stability assessment they are designed to cover five major failure modes such as pure loss of stability parametric roll surfing and broaching dead ship condition and excessive acceleration for pure loss of stability failure mode the vulnerability level 1 and level 2 criteria developed at the imo utilize the metacentric height gm and righting arm gz in longitudinal waves respectively imo 2015 the vulnerability criteria are summarised in appendix 1 the sample calculations performed by two delegations japan 2018 indicate that offshore supply vessels easily pass the lowest level level 1 criteria but often fail to pass the second level level 2 this suggests that draft criteria may overlook some physics thus the current vulnerability criteria are allowed not to be applied to a vessel with extended low weather deck due to increased likelihood of water on deck or deck in water however the definition of the extended low weather deck was not yet established until now therefore one of the remaining issues is the applicability of criteria for preventing pure loss of stability in astern waves to offshore supply vessels osv osvs are essential needs in the offshore oilfield business and these vessels are required to operate and work in harsh environments osvs often have extended low weather decks about half the ship length which is surrounded by bulwarks with freeing ports among the different types of osvs some often have no bulwarks at stern end because of operational purpose such as anchor handling and towing thus in heavy seas large amount of water can be temporarily trapped on the weather deck this may be one of factors that the draft criteria overlook there are some reports of accidents of offshore supply vessels such as m v sabine seashore and m v laverne herbert which include capsizing and loss of ship where water on deck could have been one of the causes ntsb 1978 1983 many researchers studied the effect of water on deck concerning fishing vessels and osvs dillingham 1981 performed numerical simulation of 2d flow of water on deck of a fishing vessel in beam seas falzarano et al 2002 improved this method for application to 3d flow of water on deck of an osv in beam seas both concluded by numerical simulations that the water on deck reduces the roll but not always umeda et al 2016 performed a model experiment of an osv in regular stern quartering waves and compared it with numerical model proposed by kubo et al 2012 they found that there were no severe roll at high speed but there was large heel at low speed these results cannot be explained by the simulation which does not take into account the water on deck in this research the effect of low weather deck length and the effect of wod on the behaviour of osv in regular stern quartering seas are investigated free running model experiments of osvs are performed with models having the same hull form but with different low weather deck lengths also the experiment results are compared with numerical simulation which considers the wod effect 2 model experiment 2 1 subject ship free running model experiment was performed at the seakeeping and manoeuvring basin at the national research institute of fisheries engineering the basin is 60 m in long 25 m in wide and 3 2 m in deep the ship model used is the same one as in umeda et al 2016 hull form view and principal particulars of the osv are shown in fig 1 and table 1 respectively the vessel has a deck house in the bow part and a low weather deck from its middle part to aft end it has twin propellers and twin rudders a model scale of 1 30 is used for the model experiment the displacement value itself is confidential business information so that it cannot be presented here the metacentric height is set to marginally comply with level 2 criteria for pure loss of stability which is lower than the designed one the vessel under the experimental condition is judged not vulnerable to pure loss of stability with the level 1 criterion because the gm as the slope of gz curve at the upright condition with the wave steepness of 0 0334 is 1 32 m which is much larger than 0 05 m however it critically complies with the level 2 criterion with cr value of 0 06 thus an inconsistency between the two levels could appear if the calm water gm is smaller than 1 45 m umeda et al 2016 2 2 experiment condition the experiment procedures were based on the ittc international towing tank committee recommended procedures for intact stability model test ittc 2008 propulsion power was supplied from the rechargeable batteries which were placed inside the model hull the ship model was equipped with an optical fibre gyroscope to get the roll angle pitch angle and yaw angle propeller rate and rudder angle steering gear and a pd autopilot for course keeping water surface elevation was measured by a servo needle type wave probe the probe was fixed and positioned 11 m from the wave maker for avoiding the wave reflection from the wave absorbing beach situated opposite to the wave maker and sufficiently far away from the local non propagating waves due to wave maker actions instantaneous position of the model relative to the basin was optically measured with total station system which consists of two theodolites at the basin and two prisms on board umeda et al 2014 to modify the length of low weather deck of original vessel three additional decks are added systematically each additional deck has equal length of 14 73 m and is watertight they have the same width as width between bulwarks and the same height as bulwark height based on the mode of addition the ship model was modified into four cases as shown in table 2 here l refers to the length of low weather deck measured from ap for case 1 all three additional decks are added for case 2 two additional decks are added for case 3 only one additional deck is added the metacentric heights of models of case 1 case 2 and case 3 are kept the same as that of original model for case 4 the low weather deck length is the same as case 3 but the metacentric height is reduced from 1 45 m to 1 053 m as a result both the original model and case 4 marginally comply with the 2008 is code while case 3 has some margin due to buoyancy of the additional super structure the displacements of all model cases are kept the same as that of original model model ships of all four cases are shown in fig 2 free running model experiments were conducted for regular waves of two wave cases one is the wavelength to ship length ratio λ l of 1 0 and the wave steepness h λ of 0 1 as a well known worst situation of restoring reduction the other is λ l of 1 5 and h λ of 0 1 as the case inducing heave motions relevant to water ingress the heading angle was 30 from the wave direction and the tested froude numbers ranged from 0 15 to 0 37 the model was situated near the wave maker first after the wave train propagated enough in the model basin the model propeller revolutions were increased to the specified value to achieve the required speed and the steering system activated several runs were performed with possible combinations of wave conditions and speeds the righting arm curves of all four model cases in calm water and in waves with λ l of 1 0 and h λ of 0 1 are shown in fig 3 for the sake of comparison the righting arm curve of the original model umeda et al 2016 is also included in these calculations effects of the bulwark thickness are ignored 3 experiment results and discussion 3 1 pure loss level 2 criteria check first of all case 1 case 2 and case 3 models are checked with draft pure loss level 2 criteria imo 2015 in level 2 criteria there are two criteria values cr1 and cr2 cr1 is a criterion based on the calculation of the angle of vanishing stability cr2 is a criterion based on the calculation of the angle of heel under the action of heeling lever which is calculated by equation 1 1 8 h λ d f n 2 where h is the wave height λ is the wave length d is the ship draught and fn is the service froude number the results shown in fig 4 show the relationship between the lengths of low weather deck and the level 2 index values when the length of low weather deck increases the index values increase this is because the osv has less gz values in waves when the model has longer low weather deck as shown in fig 3 even negative righting arms can appear when a wave crest is at amidships for models with larger lengths of low weather decks it is obvious from fig 4 that the restoring moment can be decreased and the cases were judged as dangerous by the level 2 criteria when the low weather deck length is longer than 0 4 l pp this means that case 1 and case 2 models are safe for pure loss while case 3 and original design can be vulnerable to pure loss 3 2 model experiment results the results from the model experiment for the wave case of λ l of 1 5 and h λ of 0 1 are shown in fig 5 here the maximum roll angles recorded in the free running experiment for different froude number are shown for the sake of comparison the experiment result of the original model umeda et al 2016 is also included for case 1 case 2 and case 3 models the roll angles are not so large and also no tendency of pure loss of stability was observed in a typical pure loss of stability phenomenon the roll amplitude usually increases with increasing speed the level 2 criteria check however indicates that the model of case 3 can be vulnerable to pure loss there is a contradiction between the level 2 criteria result and the experiment results for case 3 for case 4 as well as the original vessel umeda et al 2016 large roll angles are found for the froude number smaller than 0 25 this behaviour is similar to that of the original model during the experiment it was found that a large amount of water entered from the stern end for this case and despite the egress through the freeing ports the ingress from the stern was much larger thus this large roll angles can be considered due to the static heeling moment of large volume of trapped water on deck 4 numerical simulation 4 1 simulation without wod numerical simulation using a coupled surge sway yaw roll 4dof model developed by kubo et al 2012 which is based on the manoeuvring model for ships in calm water by hirano and takashina 1980 is applied the linear wave induced forces and moments are calculated by a slender body theory with low encounter frequency assumption umeda et al 1995 the roll restoring arm variation is estimated with grim 1961 s effective wave concept more details of the numerical model are described in appendix 2 the comparison between the experiment results and simulation results are shown in fig 6 here the wave condition is λ l of 1 5 and h λ of 0 1 froude number fn is 0 15 for case 1 0 29 for case 2 and case 3 and 0 15 for case 4 for case 1 the model has no low weather deck so that also no wod there is good agreement in the amplitudes between the simulation result and the experiment result for case 2 and case 3 it can be seen that the simulation result overestimates the roll motion the models in both cases have low weather deck and therefore a certain amount of water can enter and be trapped if some phase lag exists between the trapped water and the ship roll motion the water may act as anti rolling device nevertheless this simulation does not take into account this effect for case 4 the simulation result and the experiment result are even qualitatively different a certain mean heel angle exists due to the static heeling moment of trapped water which might be in phase with the ship roll motion also here the simulation does not take into account this heeling moment 4 2 water on deck effect water trapped on deck may sometimes act as an anti rolling mechanism when there is a phase lag between the trapped water and ship roll motion to examine if this is the case two roll decay tests were performed during the experiment small angle roll decay tests and large angle roll decay tests for the small angle tests an initial heel angle of about 10 was given to the model and then released no water entered from the freeing ports this can be considered as roll damping due to hull only for the large angle tests an initial heel angle of about 25 which results in a smaller maximum mean roll angle because of roll damping nature was given to the model and released some water entered from the freeing ports so the latter test results included the wod effect the roll extinction curves of these two kinds of tests are shown in fig 7 following the standard procedure of the roll decay tests for roll damping coefficients ittc 2011 it can be seen that the damping with wod increases compared with the one without wod generally it can be concluded that wod plays a somewhat important role in the roll damping of this ship model therefore roll damping of this osv should be provided as the sum of the damping due to hull only and the damping due to wod for the hull only damping the data from the small angle roll decay tests can be used for the damping due to wod the ittc recommended formula ittc 2011 for the equivalent linear roll damping due to flooded water as shown in 1 is attempted to use the estimation formula is based on the database obtained from a systematic model experiment by katayama et al 2009 and ikeda and kawahara 2008 2 b 44 i w a h b comp φ a

ship gravitational centre cg from the water surface the formulae of the functions a b and c are available in ittc 2011 in applying equation 2 to the ship model the deck is considered as a tank with the length equal to the length of low weather deck the breadth equal to the width between bulwarks and the height equal to the bulwark height this estimation equation is used to calculate the additional damping due to wod in this stage both the water depth and the roll amplitude are unknown among them the measured roll amplitude averaged within an encounter wave cycle was substituted here because the purpose of this paper is to clarify the effect of wod on the critical ship behaviour thus the largest wod amount within the encounter wave cycle can be geometrically determined with the bulwark height and the deck breadth in other words the feasible range of water that can be trapped on deck is first estimated for a particular speed and for an average roll angle for that condition then a certain depth of water is assumed to be trapped within the bulwarks of ship the freeing ports are assumed to be closed and then the numerical simulation is repeated until the obtained average roll amplitude is sufficiently close to the assumed roll amplitude apart from hydrodynamic effect of wod the static heeling arm due to wod can be dominant in some cases in case 4 it is apparent

0 25 and fn 0 27 are plotted as 90 as the simulation indicates the vessel to be capsized 5 conclusions it is confirmed experimentally that the level 2 pure loss of stability criteria should not be applied to ships with low weather deck length greater than 0 4 l pp and which is not completely surrounded by bulwarks this fact could be a clue for establishing the definition of the ships with

22532,in the present study a structural health monitoring shm method for floating offshore wind turbines fowts is suggested and tested using operational modal analysis oma with numerical sensor signals the numerical accelerometer signals along the tower and blade of fowt in dynamic wind field are used for the oma the numerical sensor signals are simulated using a time domain turbine floater mooring fully coupled dynamic simulation computer program to perform the shm of a fowt through oma natural frequencies displacement mode shapes dms and curvature mode shapes cms of the tower and blades are obtained and analyzed the modal properties are systematically compared between the intact and damaged conditions their differences are used for damage detection the results show that cms is found to be the most effective modal property to detect damage locations and intensities the performance of the damage detection based on the oma cms analysis is verified by independent fem finite element method results this study is unique in that the shm using oma and cms for fowts is implemented including the floater tower blade coupling effects the technology can contribute to the design of remote shm system for future fowts a further validated model with field data may build up a huge database for various damage scenarios so that it can be applied to digital twin based smart health monitoring technology keywords operational modal analysis floating offshore wind turbine health monitoring damage detection curvature mode shape numerical sensor turbine floater mooring coupled dynamics simulation 1 introduction despite various advantages of the floating offshore wind turbine fowt it is still slow for it to be commercialized currently fowts installed in the real field are only a few and most of them are just for the test one of the disadvantages of fowts is related to operation and maintenance cost opex the predictions of the dynamics associated with moored system are more challenging than those associated with fixed one which yields the large uncertainties and higher costs in the floating type turbine system compared to the fixed type turbine system levitt et al 2011 moné et al 2015 one way to reduce the uncertainty and opex is the remote structural health monitoring shm by continuously monitoring the sensor signals of the tower or blade the on site maintenance schedule can be more flexible and the inspection intervals can be increased hameed et al 2009 besides catastrophic failures and secondary damages can be prevented by early detecting initial damage if the tower or blades are fully broken the repair cost is dramatically increased because the entire or partial fowt units need to be transported to on land griffith et al 2012 nowadays operational modal analysis oma is a well accepted method to estimate the modal identification of a structure under actual operating conditions by examining the sensor signals of responses therefore any artificial excitation such as hammer test is not needed by using oma the change of the modal natural frequencies traditional mode shape and curvature mode shape cms can be estimated by observing the magnitude of difference in modal characteristics between intact and damaged conditions structural damages can be detected the oma has been used for bridges conte et al 2008 magalhães 2012 brownjohn et al 2007 2010 and on land wind turbines white 2010 and manzato et al 2014 measured the modal properties of the micon 65 13m on land wind turbine with a cx 100 rotor blade using oma and they showed that the oma results agreed with the hammer test results tcherniak et al 2013 and chauhan et al 2011 also showed the feasibility of the oma by applying it to the vestas 225 kw v27 on land wind turbine and the 3 mw alstom wind turbine respectively this method has also been used for offshore structures in various offshore fixed wind farms the modal properties of wind turbines are measured using the oma van der valk and ogno 2014 devriendt et al 2012 2013 de sitter et al 2013 liu et al 2015 kim et al 2015 and mieloszyk et al 2015 applied oma to the jacket type offshore platform the segmented ship and the tripod submerged structure respectively additionally ruzzo et al 2016 have measured the modal properties of 6dof motions of a spar floater using the oma the advancement of oma for on land wind turbines has been made by several researchers siebel et al 2012 performed a model test for a small scaled on land wind turbine they measured the acceleration on the tower in the operational condition and estimated the modal properties of the tower using oma they showed that the combination of the oma and the damage detection method based on cmss was feasible in the real small scale wind turbine excited by ambient vibration di lorenzo et al 2016 used the vibration based shm for detecting blade damage an experiment for obtaining modal properties was performed and the modal properties of multi layered blades were estimated using the oma the oma results were compared to the finite element method fem results for validation then the validated fem model was used for detecting the local damage of blades by observing the cms including blade rotation effect devriendt et al 2014 and weijtjens et al 2017 proved that the vibration based health monitoring is effective to detect blade icing or blade damage they analyzed the collected data of 15 year vibration measurements on five monopile offshore wind turbines with many accelerometers on them they showed how wind condition affected the vibration phenomenon of the turbine and investigated the interaction effect between wind loads and the blade tower dynamics besides they obtained the first and second fore aft and side to side mode shapes of the tower resonance frequencies and damping value using automated oma regarding the mode shapes pandey et al 1991 showed that the cms might be better than the displacement mode shape dms in determining the damage location in a beam wang et al 2014 used the fem for modal analysis and dynamic response analysis the calculated aerodynamic force is applied to the fe model through the modal frequency response under aerodynamic wind load the natural frequencies and mode shapes are estimated and compared to those in damaged condition they also used the difference in cms for damage detection as well as the dms this study showed that the difference in cms could more precisely catch the damage location so far shm studies for fowts with physical sensors are hard to find however numerical simulations and numerical sensors can be used for the design of shm system for fowts in the numerical simulation various damaged conditions can easily be considered and extensive comparison studies between pre damage and post damage states can be performed ahead of the actual measurement in the real field the general processes and algorithms of shm for fowts can be economically developed using numerical simulations and numerical sensors of course there are several limitations when using numerical sensors such as measurement noise and variation caused by the environmental and operational factors such as wind speed temperature rotational speed and blade pitch hu et al 2015 however through the noise filtering technique their differences can be reduced sainz et al 2009 also the key environmental and operational factors and their effects on modal properties can be included in the numerical modeling in this paper the shm method using numerical simulations numerical sensors oma and the difference in cms is applied to a fowt the numerical sensor signals are obtained from turbine floater mooring fully coupled dynamics simulation program in the time domain bae and kim 2013 2014a bae et al 2017 the author developed coupled dynamic simulation tool has extensively been verified through comparisons with several experiments kim et al 2017 kim and kim 2015 as far as the authors know the use of oma and cms for the shm of fowt s including all of their coupling effects cannot be found in the open literature the modal properties such as natural frequencies dmss and cmss are estimated using the oma of numerical sensor signals the modal properties are systematically compared between the intact and damaged conditions and their differences are used for local damage detection especially the cms and natural frequency are used as the primary indicator for finding the damage location and intensity the oma results are double checked using the independent calculation based on commercial fem code 2 methods the present shm method for the fowt is divided into four parts like below first oma with time domain numerical simulations for fowt is verified the verification is performed by comparing the modal properties of the intact tower and blade obtained from oma with those obtained from fem model second the effects of non linear mooring stiffness wave and coupling between tower and blades on the modal properties in time domain simulations and fem analysis are investigated third the shm of the tower is carried out the mode shapes and natural frequencies are compared between the intact or pre damage and damaged or post damage conditions in the frequency domain fem analysis then the time domain simulation analysis is carried out by applying frequency domain decomposition fdd which is one method of oma to the acceleration results obtained from the time domain numerical sensors the natural frequencies and cmss are estimated and the dynamics of blades and tower are analyzed in the intact and damaged conditions through the differences in the modal properties between the intact and damaged conditions the damaged location can be detected and the intensity of damage can be estimated additionally the fem results can also be used for the verification of the changes of modal properties obtained from the oma lastly the shm of the blade is carried out in the parking condition which can be so during the periodic maintenance period using the developed oma the numerical simulations and the corresponding oma with blades rotating and controlled is to be detailed in the authors sequel paper the exemplary analysis chart for the present shm is given in fig 1 the concepts about oma and difference in cms are introduced in the next two sections 2 1 operation modal analysis oma frequency domain decomposition fdd method the fdd which was first suggested by brincker et al 2001 is an output only modal analysis technique in the frequency domain through this method modal properties can be estimated from the output power spectral densities psd gained in the white noise loading condition the psd matrix of the output response for each frequency can be decomposed by applying the singular value decomposition to the psd matrix as a result modal properties such as the natural frequencies and mode shapes are obtained 1 g x x ω i u i s i u i h where g xx ω i is an output psd matrix s i is a diagonal matrix which includes singular values and u i is the unitary matrix that includes singular vectors singular values can be acquired from the output response and the singular values of the psd matrix are plotted in the frequency domain the dominant peaks displayed in the plotted graph mean the natural frequencies and mode shapes can be estimated by finding the corresponding singular vectors of the singular values the detailed information of fdd techniques is given by brincker et al 2001 2 2 difference in cms curvature mode shape as the indicator of damage detection for the simulation of shm numerical accelerometers along the blade tower length are installed the acceleration is measured in the time domain on each location using the oma method the modal characteristics of blade tower such as natural frequencies and mode shapes are estimated when a structure is damaged the stiffness on the damaged region decreases which causes the change of the modal characteristics of the structure the damage can be detected by comparing the difference in the modal characteristics between intact and damaged conditions the displacement mode shape dms is usually used for damage detection schulz et al 2003 pandey showed that the cms might sometimes be better than dms pandey et al 1991 wang et al 2014 curvature can be defined as follows 2 κ ϕ m e i where ϕ is dms m is the bending moment e is young s modulus and i is the second moment of the cross sectional area 3 numerical model 3 1 configurations of 5 mw deepcwind fowt and on land wind turbine fig 2 shows the 5 mw deepcwind fowt and on land wind turbine respectively the property of the floating platform excluding the wind turbine part is given in table 1 the wind turbine is based on the nrel 5 mw baseline turbine and the detailed material properties of blade and tower are presented in the nrel technical report by jonkman et al 2009 for the on land wind turbine the same wind turbine is used for the comparison to the fowt case and it is assumed that the tower is fixed at the bottom the wind turbine related mass properties used in the fem analysis and the time domain analysis are tabulated in table 2 and table 3 the platform added mass is also given in table 1 the added mass of fowt is obtained from the frequency domain potential theory based 3d diffraction radiation program about the mooring line modeling three catenary mooring lines are installed for the fowt and the high order finite rod element method was used for the mooring dynamics in the time domain analysis the mooring stiffness and hydrostatic stiffness are obtained from the static offset test and they are summarized in table 4 3 2 fem analysis the mode shapes of the blade and tower are pre calculated using fem modal analysis for the modal analysis in the frequency domain both blade tower semi coupled bmodes fem sub program in fast and blade tower fully coupled abaqus fem programs are used for double checking in the case of blade differences between the two results are negligible in the case of tower the fully coupled effect is not ignorable this difference can affect the ensuing oma results therefore abaqus fem is used for the tower and bmodes fem is used for the blade in the subsequent oma in the abaqus modeling the actual three blades are modeled as beam elements and only the hub and nacelle are assumed as point mass and inertia as shown in fig 3 the point mass properties of tower top nacelle and hub are summarized in table 2 in case of fowt the added mass and added inertia of platform hydrostatic restoring force inertia actual mass and inertia of platform and the mooring stiffness are entered with respect to the platform center of mass cm in abaqus as shown in fig 3 the values are summarized in tables 1 and 4 the blade tower fully coupled abaqus fem results were double checked against adams fem program results by di lorenzo et al 2013 and the two independently calculated results for the same wind tower and blades agree very well 3 3 time domain coupled model in the fowt dynamic analysis hydro dynamic loading and mooring tensions are obtained from charm3d they are fed to fast at each time step then fast fills out the forcing function of the platform dofs using those forces and solves displacements velocities and accelerations of all the degrees of freedom including elastic responses of towers and blades the obtained platform displacement and velocity data are then fed into charm3d side to update the relevant external forces the exemplary combined left hand side matrix for the coupled dynamic analysis has total 24 dofs including six dofs for platform rigid body motion four dofs for tower flexibility three dofs for flexibility of each blade and five dofs for nacelle yaw rotor furl generator azimuth tail furl and drive train flexibility more details of the numerical modeling of the platform and mooring are referred in kim and kim 2015 bae and kim 2014b for the implementation of the dynamics caused by the elasticity of tower and blade in time domain simulation the elastodyn subroutine module of fast is used in elastodyn the modal based dynamic formulations are used for employing the blade and tower elasticity and the nonlinear equations of motions are derived and implemented using kane s dynamics the pre calculated mode shapes include the first and second fore aft tower modes first and second side to side tower modes the first and second flap blade modes and first edge blade mode they are specified as polynomial coefficients and entered to the fast time domain simulation the mode shape polynomial equations are used as shape functions in a nonlinear beam model using the rayleigh ritz method 3 4 time domain simulation the time domain numerical simulation is carried out using fast v7 for the on land wind turbine and using charm3d fast for the fowt the simulations are carried out in the parking blade fixed condition without blade rotation and control for simplicity in total 25 and 19 numerical sensors are installed along the tower length and blade length respectively and their locations are tabulated in table 5 many numbers of numerical sensors enough to detect any damaged locations are used for examining the feasibility of this method the optimization of the number of sensors can be discussed in a follow up study in the case of physical sensors there may exist unwanted noises in the sensor signals but in the present study by using numerical sensors this is not considered the full field wind is generated using the turbsim program jonkman 2009 which is a stochastic full field turbulent wind simulator using various wind spectra and turbulence models for the implementation of turbulence the kaimal turbulence model is used the average wind speed turbulence intensity and the vertical power law exponent of wind data used in the simulation are 6 15 m sec 8 and 0 1 respectively if the turbulence is included in the wind speed data the wind spectrum becomes very similar to the white noise spectrum in the high frequency range in the simulation the wind speed varies in all directions x y and z directions because of the turbulence effect this also means that the wind causes the excitations on the blade and tower in all directions the accelerations of fore aft and side to side directions are obtained from the numerical sensors based on the acceleration results the graphs of the first singular value of the psd matrix are plotted in fig 4 the yellow and green portions of the figures represent the 1st tower mode and the 2nd tower mode respectively other excitations are generated by 6dof platform motions and the blade modes in the fowt the same wind data is used as that used in the on land case the sea condition is assumed to be still water i e the platform dynamics result from dynamic wind loadings wind forces including wind turbulence are more desirable for oma since they have broadband spectra tcherniak et al 2011 osgood et al 2011 in section 4 2 2 it is shown that the additional wave effect on the oma and modal properties of the tower is minimal i e the same oma results can be obtained with waves 4 shm process 4 1 verification of developed numerical models for fowt dynamic behavior caused by the elasticity of tower and blade is very complicated the reason is that three rotor blades are connected to the hub allowing rotation with respect to the drive train axis in the nacelle which is connected to the tower and they are dynamically coupled because of this complication various structural modes are generated in the modal analysis by using the oma or fem programs various tower and blade modes can be found in the given condition and their mode shapes are displayed in fig 5 and fig 6 in the on land case the presently calculated natural frequencies of modes mentioned above are compared between fem and oma the oma results are obtained through the numerical sensor signals from time domain simulations their average difference of all the modes is 2 besides the present abaqus based fem results were double checked against di lorenzo et al 2013 adams based fem results for the same wind turbine the comparison is tabulated in table 6 and the frequencies of tower and blade agree well with each other for the fowt case the same wind turbine is mounted on the floating base instead of land as far as the authors know there is no shm study for fowts in the open literature by utilizing coupled system numerical simulations fem and oma before going into the details of fowt results the natural frequencies of the tower and blade modes of fowt are compared with those of on land wind turbine this shows the effects of foundation on the modal properties of the wind turbine first the modal properties of tower are compared using fem abaqus as shown in fig 7 there is little difference in the second mode between them but larger discrepancies can be observed in the natural frequencies of first tower modes i e that of fowt is increased by 13 0 15 5 compared to the on land case this difference is mainly caused by the boundary condition of the tower base bir and jonkman 2007 in the case of blade modes there is little difference in the natural frequencies of the first flap and first edge modes between on land wind turbine and fowt but the natural frequencies of fowt s second flap mode are 2 3 greater than those of on land wind turbine as shown in fig 8 and table 7 these results show that using a floating base more influences the tower mode than blade mode next the applicability of oma for fowt is tested in this regard the natural frequencies are obtained using the abaqus software and the results are compared against those from the oma with the charm3d fast time domain simulation results as shown in table 8 and fig 9 fig 10 the fem results agree well with the oma results the maximum difference is 3 1 in the second blade pitch mode it means that the oma analysis can reliably catch the modes of blade and tower even for the fowt 4 2 effects of nonlinear mooring stiffness wave and coupling between tower and blade on wind turbine modes 4 2 1 mooring stiffness effect the actual mooring stiffness for the fowt can be obtained from the numerical static offset test in the surge and sway the corresponding mooring stiffness increases with displacements showing nonlinear hardening behavior kim and kim 2015 this nonlinearity can change the surge and sway stiffness when they are large in charm3d fast numerical simulation the actual mooring is modeled as it is however in abaqus fem modeling the actual mooring is modeled by equivalent linear spring so the equivalent spring may not be accurate when surge sway are large which may affect the accuracy of modal property comparison between the two for the present case study however the effects turn out to be negligible the natural frequencies of the tower modes are estimated with various mooring stiffness within 100 of variation using abaqus and the resulting change in natural frequencies is less than 0 1 in the first ten modes based on the fem analysis results this means that the nonlinear behavior of fowt s mooring stiffness in the expected range of surge sway does not significantly affect the modal properties of tower and blade 4 2 2 wave effect on tower mode let us also consider the effects of sea waves in the assessment of natural frequencies and mode shapes of fowt tower and blade through oma in the present case study only dynamic wind loadings were given and the corresponding oma was carried out to obtain the modal properties in this regard the oma of the fowt with additional irregular waves is also tested jonswap spectrum with significant wave height hs 2m peak period tp 7 5s and enhancement parameter 2 was used for the generation of uni directional irregular waves the two oma results were compared in both cases the same wind excitations were used the comparison is summarized in table 9 we see little difference between the two cases which is somewhat expected because the modal properties of the tower and blade do not change according to the input force also typical linear wave frequencies are far from the typical wind turbine natural frequencies and the effect of second order sum frequency wave excitation on the dynamics of the wind turbine is significantly low compared to the effect of wind turbulence since both cases produce almost identical results from this point on irregular waves are not considered and only dynamic wind excitations are inputted in the ensuing fowt simulations 4 2 3 coupled effect between tower and blade to evaluate the rotor coupled effects on the tower modes two comparison studies are carried out and the results are displayed in fig 11 the first is the comparison of natural frequencies of the tower obtained from fem between when the rotor is simplified to be the top point mass and inertia fem sim and when the full rotor blades are included as the beam elements fem full a considerable difference in the natural frequencies of second tower modes is shown the second is the comparison of the natural frequencies of the tower between oma and fem when the mode shapes obtained from the simplified fem are entered to the time domain analysis the oma results oma sim show appreciable differences in the second modes compared to fem analysis results fem full however the mode shapes obtained from full rotor modeled fem are entered the oma results oma full agree well with the fem results fem full this means that the rotor coupled effect is appreciable in the second mode of the tower thus the rotor coupled tower mode shapes must be entered to the time domain simulation for obtaining the accurate tower modal properties through oma in the case of blade the tower coupled effect is not included in the pre calculated blade mode shapes which means the blade is assumed to be fixed free beam the uncoupled blade mode shapes are plugged into the time domain simulation and the natural frequencies of blade are estimated from the oma even though the tower coupled effect is not included in the pre calculated blade mode shapes the actual tower blade coupling effect is considered in the time domain simulation the natural frequencies of blade obtained from the oma are compared to the natural frequencies obtained from fem fem abaqus including tower coupled effect as shown in fig 12 and fig 13 the differences in natural frequencies of the 1st and 2nd blade modes obtained by fem abaqus and oma are significantly low besides the other fem results fem adams presented by di lorenzo et al 2013 agree well with our fem and oma results this infers that the tower coupled effect on the blade mode shape doesn t affect much the oma results of the first two blade modes 4 3 structural health monitoring 4 3 1 modeling of damaged tower and blade in the simulation by the reduction of stiffness various damage types of blade tower have been reported poor quality control improper installation lightning fire and strong wind have been blamed for the structural damage of blade and tower typical damages in turbine blades are splitting and fracture cracks and the de bonding of the adhesive layer and joint with fatigue damage ciang et al 2008 sørensen et al 2004 shokrieh and rafiee 2006 the initial crack development can be modeled by the reduction of local stiffness griffith et al 2012 shokrieh and rafiee 2006 kim et al 2014 therefore in the present study the damaged condition is implemented by reducing the stiffness of the damaged part in the fem modal analysis and the subsequent fully coupled time domain simulation for example 10 and 30 damaged conditions at some position mean that the stiffness of the specific damaged location is decreased by 10 and 30 respectively the reduced stiffness at a specific point is assumed to gradually vary with distance so that it matches with the original value of ambient parts the damaged positions are started from tower blade base and normalized by the entire length for example when damage develops at 0 3 section of the tower the damage occurs at the location of 30 of total tower length from the tower base the exemplary stiffness variation along the blade for 10 and 30 damage is shown in fig 14 in the next section the presumed local damage is modeled by the fully coupled abaqus fem to obtain the corresponding elastic modes which in turn is used in the fully coupled charm3d fast dynamic simulation to generate numerical sensor signals then the numerical sensor signals are used in the oma with cms to check whether the inputted local damage can correctly be recovered in real health monitoring system we only get signals from physical sensors then by applying the present oma cms algorithms the structural problem can be detected from the shift of natural frequencies and the difference in curvature mode shapes then the severity of the damage can be judged from the computer generated big database generated for numerous damage scenarios the correspondence between the actual damage scenarios and the numerically modeled scenarios also needs to be investigated 4 3 2 structural health monitoring of fowt tower using fem each damage of tower is assumed to happen at 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 sections from the tower base respectively the stiffness reduction of 10 and 30 is considered for each case the natural frequencies and the mode shapes are compared between intact and damaged conditions by fem first in the first fore aft mode of the tower the difference in natural frequency is the highest when the damage occurs at the 0 1 section the difference decreases as the damaged location is higher as shown in fig 15 a in the second fore aft mode of the tower the difference is high when the damage occurs at the 0 1 and 0 7 sections whereas the difference is minimal when the damage occurs at the 0 3 section as shown in fig 15b the trend is the same in the tower side to side mode as shown in fig 16 fig 17 shows the differences in cmss between intact and damaged conditions in the figures it is seen that a large difference in cms develops in the damaged section and thus the damaged location and intensity can be predicted through the difference fig 18 also shows the same case when using dms instead of cms it is seen that damage detection is very difficult by observing the difference in displacement mode shape this explains why the curvature based method should be used in detecting damage in the fem analysis 100 and 49 elements are used for the tower and blades respectively 4 3 3 structural health monitoring of fowt tower using oma in this section the natural frequencies and modal properties estimated by oma are presented the fem based mode shapes for intact and damaged conditions can be inputted for the fully coupled fowt dynamics simulation in the time domain to obtain the respective numerical sensor signals then we can do oma for both intact and damaged cases they are compared and their differences are presented in the following as for natural frequencies and modal properties a similar pattern shown in the fem results figs 15 18 is also found in the oma results although there exist nontrivial differences between them as shown in fig 19 fig 20 fig 21 shows the differences in cmss of fore aft tower mode and side to side tower mode respectively the damaged location can be predicted through the differences because significant peaks in the differences of cmss mean damaged region besides the damaged intensity can also be predicted through the magnitude of difference in the cms as demonstrated in the figures in the oma results in fig 21 the pattern of peaks as the indication of damaged location and degree is less clear than the fem cases especially when the damage is less than 10 however there is still no problem in detecting the damage location and degree by monitoring the difference in natural frequencies of side to side second tower mode and cms of side to side first tower mode as shown in figs 20b and 21b the above discussion shows that by continuously analyzing the differences of sensor signals by oma damage detection can be made fig 22 shows the differences in the exemplary numerical accelerometer signals and its psd between the intact case and 30 damaged case of the fowt tower the numerical sensor 5 is at normalized length 0 1 above the tower base the damage causes changes in time series and shifts blue circles from 2 30 rad sec to 2 24 rad sec and from 18 59 rad sec to 18 12 rad sec of natural frequencies in the psd the natural frequencies correspond to the first and second side to side tower modes 4 3 4 structural health monitoring of fowt blade using oma in this section we consider the shm of fowt blades under the same environmental condition and the upright blade among three blades is selected to monitor the status of the upright blade using oma 19 numerical sensors are installed along the blade length and the normalized locations of sensors are tabulated in table 5 by applying the oma technique to the numerical sensor signals the 1st and 2nd flap modes and the 1st edge modes are captured among those blade modes the edge modes are the most appropriate to use for health monitoring due to a more noticeable appearance fig 23 a shows the entire mode spectrum obtained from the blade signals of edge direction in the 1st blade edge mode three neighboring peaks for edge symmetry edge pitch and edge yaw modes are generated as shown in fig 23b table 8 shows the comparison of natural frequencies of blade modes between abaqus fem and fast charm3d oma and their results agree well with each other it means that the present oma can catch the blade modes well even for the fowt fig 24 shows the differences in natural frequencies a and cmss b obtained from the fem analysis like the tower case the damaged location can be found by the difference in cms and the pattern of difference in blade natural frequencies is very similar to that of the 1st mode of tower fig 25 shows the corresponding results of fig 24 when the oma is used instead of fem the general trend is very similar between the two this means that blade damage can also be detected from the recorded sensor signals using the present oma cms algorithm 5 conclusions in this study the feasibility to detect the damage on the blade and tower of fowt using oma and difference in modal properties was examined the modal properties were obtained by applying oma from the signals of numerical sensors on blade and tower the numerical sensor signals were obtained using a turbine floater mooring fully coupled dynamics simulation program in the time domain which has been extensively validated through comparisons with experiments by authors in the previous papers also the oma results were also self checked against independent fem results the locally damaged conditions were modeled by reducing the local structural stiffness then it was observed that the local damage could be effectively detected using oma and cms which improve the performance of the damage detection compared to the method using dms it was also confirmed that the general trend of differences between intact and damaged cases by fem agreed well to those obtained from oma with numerical sensor signals for a fowt the considerable differences in cmss between intact and damaged conditions at the damaged location were displayed the differences increased with the degree of damage the similarity in the pattern of fem oma results between on land and floating wind turbines was explained it was also seen that the deduced modal properties of the fowt by oma were negligibly affected by the mooring non linearity or and additional wave environments when it comes to the coupling effect between the tower and blades the rotor coupled effect on the tower affects much the modal properties of the tower while the tower coupled effect on the blade is negligible in the first and second blade modes the present numerical simulation and damage detecting method may be used to build up a huge database for various damage scenarios and the corresponding patterns of tower blade dynamic behaviors so that it can be applied to machine generated and machine learning shm technology in the future acknowledgment this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation grant 1700406

22532,in the present study a structural health monitoring shm method for floating offshore wind turbines fowts is suggested and tested using operational modal analysis oma with numerical sensor signals the numerical accelerometer signals along the tower and blade of fowt in dynamic wind field are used for the oma the numerical sensor signals are simulated using a time domain turbine floater mooring fully coupled dynamic simulation computer program to perform the shm of a fowt through oma natural frequencies displacement mode shapes dms and curvature mode shapes cms of the tower and blades are obtained and analyzed the modal properties are systematically compared between the intact and damaged conditions their differences are used for damage detection the results show that cms is found to be the most effective modal property to detect damage locations and intensities the performance of the damage detection based on the oma cms analysis is verified by independent fem finite element method results this study is unique in that the shm using oma and cms for fowts is implemented including the floater tower blade coupling effects the technology can contribute to the design of remote shm system for future fowts a further validated model with field data may build up a huge database for various damage scenarios so that it can be applied to digital twin based smart health monitoring technology keywords operational modal analysis floating offshore wind turbine health monitoring damage detection curvature mode shape numerical sensor turbine floater mooring coupled dynamics simulation 1 introduction despite various advantages of the floating offshore wind turbine fowt it is still slow for it to be commercialized currently fowts installed in the real field are only a few and most of them are just for the test one of the disadvantages of fowts is related to operation and maintenance cost opex the predictions of the dynamics associated with moored system are more challenging than those associated with fixed one which yields the large uncertainties and higher costs in the floating type turbine system compared to the fixed type turbine system levitt et al 2011 moné et al 2015 one way to reduce the uncertainty and opex is the remote structural health monitoring shm by continuously monitoring the sensor signals of the tower or blade the on site maintenance schedule can be more flexible and the inspection intervals can be increased hameed et al 2009 besides catastrophic failures and secondary damages can be prevented by early detecting initial damage if the tower or blades are fully broken the repair cost is dramatically increased because the entire or partial fowt units need to be transported to on land griffith et al 2012 nowadays operational modal analysis oma is a well accepted method to estimate the modal identification of a structure under actual operating conditions by examining the sensor signals of responses therefore any artificial excitation such as hammer test is not needed by using oma the change of the modal natural frequencies traditional mode shape and curvature mode shape cms can be estimated by observing the magnitude of difference in modal characteristics between intact and damaged conditions structural damages can be detected the oma has been used for bridges conte et al 2008 magalhães 2012 brownjohn et al 2007 2010 and on land wind turbines white 2010 and manzato et al 2014 measured the modal properties of the micon 65 13m on land wind turbine with a cx 100 rotor blade using oma and they showed that the oma results agreed with the hammer test results tcherniak et al 2013 and chauhan et al 2011 also showed the feasibility of the oma by applying it to the vestas 225 kw v27 on land wind turbine and the 3 mw alstom wind turbine respectively this method has also been used for offshore structures in various offshore fixed wind farms the modal properties of wind turbines are measured using the oma van der valk and ogno 2014 devriendt et al 2012 2013 de sitter et al 2013 liu et al 2015 kim et al 2015 and mieloszyk et al 2015 applied oma to the jacket type offshore platform the segmented ship and the tripod submerged structure respectively additionally ruzzo et al 2016 have measured the modal properties of 6dof motions of a spar floater using the oma the advancement of oma for on land wind turbines has been made by several researchers siebel et al 2012 performed a model test for a small scaled on land wind turbine they measured the acceleration on the tower in the operational condition and estimated the modal properties of the tower using oma they showed that the combination of the oma and the damage detection method based on cmss was feasible in the real small scale wind turbine excited by ambient vibration di lorenzo et al 2016 used the vibration based shm for detecting blade damage an experiment for obtaining modal properties was performed and the modal properties of multi layered blades were estimated using the oma the oma results were compared to the finite element method fem results for validation then the validated fem model was used for detecting the local damage of blades by observing the cms including blade rotation effect devriendt et al 2014 and weijtjens et al 2017 proved that the vibration based health monitoring is effective to detect blade icing or blade damage they analyzed the collected data of 15 year vibration measurements on five monopile offshore wind turbines with many accelerometers on them they showed how wind condition affected the vibration phenomenon of the turbine and investigated the interaction effect between wind loads and the blade tower dynamics besides they obtained the first and second fore aft and side to side mode shapes of the tower resonance frequencies and damping value using automated oma regarding the mode shapes pandey et al 1991 showed that the cms might be better than the displacement mode shape dms in determining the damage location in a beam wang et al 2014 used the fem for modal analysis and dynamic response analysis the calculated aerodynamic force is applied to the fe model through the modal frequency response under aerodynamic wind load the natural frequencies and mode shapes are estimated and compared to those in damaged condition they also used the difference in cms for damage detection as well as the dms this study showed that the difference in cms could more precisely catch the damage location so far shm studies for fowts with physical sensors are hard to find however numerical simulations and numerical sensors can be used for the design of shm system for fowts in the numerical simulation various damaged conditions can easily be considered and extensive comparison studies between pre damage and post damage states can be performed ahead of the actual measurement in the real field the general processes and algorithms of shm for fowts can be economically developed using numerical simulations and numerical sensors of course there are several limitations when using numerical sensors such as measurement noise and variation caused by the environmental and operational factors such as wind speed temperature rotational speed and blade pitch hu et al 2015 however through the noise filtering technique their differences can be reduced sainz et al 2009 also the key environmental and operational factors and their effects on modal properties can be included in the numerical modeling in this paper the shm method using numerical simulations numerical sensors oma and the difference in cms is applied to a fowt the numerical sensor signals are obtained from turbine floater mooring fully coupled dynamics simulation program in the time domain bae and kim 2013 2014a bae et al 2017 the author developed coupled dynamic simulation tool has extensively been verified through comparisons with several experiments kim et al 2017 kim and kim 2015 as far as the authors know the use of oma and cms for the shm of fowt s including all of their coupling effects cannot be found in the open literature the modal properties such as natural frequencies dmss and cmss are estimated using the oma of numerical sensor signals the modal properties are systematically compared between the intact and damaged conditions and their differences are used for local damage detection especially the cms and natural frequency are used as the primary indicator for finding the damage location and intensity the oma results are double checked using the independent calculation based on commercial fem code 2 methods the present shm method for the fowt is divided into four parts like below first oma with time domain numerical simulations for fowt is verified the verification is performed by comparing the modal properties of the intact tower and blade obtained from oma with those obtained from fem model second the effects of non linear mooring stiffness wave and coupling between tower and blades on the modal properties in time domain simulations and fem analysis are investigated third the shm of the tower is carried out the mode shapes and natural frequencies are compared between the intact or pre damage and damaged or post damage conditions in the frequency domain fem analysis then the time domain simulation analysis is carried out by applying frequency domain decomposition fdd which is one method of oma to the acceleration results obtained from the time domain numerical sensors the natural frequencies and cmss are estimated and the dynamics of blades and tower are analyzed in the intact and damaged conditions through the differences in the modal properties between the intact and damaged conditions the damaged location can be detected and the intensity of damage can be estimated additionally the fem results can also be used for the verification of the changes of modal properties obtained from the oma lastly the shm of the blade is carried out in the parking condition which can be so during the periodic maintenance period using the developed oma the numerical simulations and the corresponding oma with blades rotating and controlled is to be detailed in the authors sequel paper the exemplary analysis chart for the present shm is given in fig 1 the concepts about oma and difference in cms are introduced in the next two sections 2 1 operation modal analysis oma frequency domain decomposition fdd method the fdd which was first suggested by brincker et al 2001 is an output only modal analysis technique in the frequency domain through this method modal properties can be estimated from the output power spectral densities psd gained in the white noise loading condition the psd matrix of the output response for each frequency can be decomposed by applying the singular value decomposition to the psd matrix as a result modal properties such as the natural frequencies and mode shapes are obtained 1 g x x ω i u i s i u i h where g xx ω i is an output psd matrix s i is a diagonal matrix which includes singular values and u i is the unitary matrix that includes singular vectors singular values can be acquired from the output response and the singular values of the psd matrix are plotted in the frequency domain the dominant peaks displayed in the plotted graph mean the natural frequencies and mode shapes can be estimated by finding the corresponding singular vectors of the singular values the detailed information of fdd techniques is given by brincker et al 2001 2 2 difference in cms curvature mode shape as the indicator of damage detection for the simulation of shm numerical accelerometers along the blade tower length are installed the acceleration is measured in the time domain on each location using the oma method the modal characteristics of blade tower such as natural frequencies and mode shapes are estimated when a structure is damaged the stiffness on the damaged region decreases which causes the change of the modal characteristics of the structure the damage can be detected by comparing the difference in the modal characteristics between intact and damaged conditions the displacement mode shape dms is usually used for damage detection schulz et al 2003 pandey showed that the cms might sometimes be better than dms pandey et al 1991 wang et al 2014 curvature can be defined as follows 2 κ ϕ m e i where ϕ is dms m is the bending moment e is young s modulus and i is the second moment of the cross sectional area 3 numerical model 3 1 configurations of 5 mw deepcwind fowt and on land wind turbine fig 2 shows the 5 mw deepcwind fowt and on land wind turbine respectively the property of the floating platform excluding the wind turbine part is given in table 1 the wind turbine is based on the nrel 5 mw baseline turbine and the detailed material properties of blade and tower are presented in the nrel technical report by jonkman et al 2009 for the on land wind turbine the same wind turbine is used for the comparison to the fowt case and it is assumed that the tower is fixed at the bottom the wind turbine related mass properties used in the fem analysis and the time domain analysis are tabulated in table 2 and table 3 the platform added mass is also given in table 1 the added mass of fowt is obtained from the frequency domain potential theory based 3d diffraction radiation program about the mooring line modeling three catenary mooring lines are installed for the fowt and the high order finite rod element method was used for the mooring dynamics in the time domain analysis the mooring stiffness and hydrostatic stiffness are obtained from the static offset test and they are summarized in table 4 3 2 fem analysis the mode shapes of the blade and tower are pre calculated using fem modal analysis for the modal analysis in the frequency domain both blade tower semi coupled bmodes fem sub program in fast and blade tower fully coupled abaqus fem programs are used for double checking in the case of blade differences between the two results are negligible in the case of tower the fully coupled effect is not ignorable this difference can affect the ensuing oma results therefore abaqus fem is used for the tower and bmodes fem is used for the blade in the subsequent oma in the abaqus modeling the actual three blades are modeled as beam elements and only the hub and nacelle are assumed as point mass and inertia as shown in fig 3 the point mass properties of tower top nacelle and hub are summarized in table 2 in case of fowt the added mass and added inertia of platform hydrostatic restoring force inertia actual mass and inertia of platform and the mooring stiffness are entered with respect to the platform center of mass cm in abaqus as shown in fig 3 the values are summarized in tables 1 and 4 the blade tower fully coupled abaqus fem results were double checked against adams fem program results by di lorenzo et al 2013 and the two independently calculated results for the same wind tower and blades agree very well 3 3 time domain coupled model in the fowt dynamic analysis hydro dynamic loading and mooring tensions are obtained from charm3d they are fed to fast at each time step then fast fills out the forcing function of the platform dofs using those forces and solves displacements velocities and accelerations of all the degrees of freedom including elastic responses of towers and blades the obtained platform displacement and velocity data are then fed into charm3d side to update the relevant external forces the exemplary combined left hand side matrix for the coupled dynamic analysis has total 24 dofs including six dofs for platform rigid body motion four dofs for tower flexibility three dofs for flexibility of each blade and five dofs for nacelle yaw rotor furl generator azimuth tail furl and drive train flexibility more details of the numerical modeling of the platform and mooring are referred in kim and kim 2015 bae and kim 2014b for the implementation of the dynamics caused by the elasticity of tower and blade in time domain simulation the elastodyn subroutine module of fast is used in elastodyn the modal based dynamic formulations are used for employing the blade and tower elasticity and the nonlinear equations of motions are derived and implemented using kane s dynamics the pre calculated mode shapes include the first and second fore aft tower modes first and second side to side tower modes the first and second flap blade modes and first edge blade mode they are specified as polynomial coefficients and entered to the fast time domain simulation the mode shape polynomial equations are used as shape functions in a nonlinear beam model using the rayleigh ritz method 3 4 time domain simulation the time domain numerical simulation is carried out using fast v7 for the on land wind turbine and using charm3d fast for the fowt the simulations are carried out in the parking blade fixed condition without blade rotation and control for simplicity in total 25 and 19 numerical sensors are installed along the tower length and blade length respectively and their locations are tabulated in table 5 many numbers of numerical sensors enough to detect any damaged locations are used for examining the feasibility of this method the optimization of the number of sensors can be discussed in a follow up study in the case of physical sensors there may exist unwanted noises in the sensor signals but in the present study by using numerical sensors this is not considered the full field wind is generated using the turbsim program jonkman 2009 which is a stochastic full field turbulent wind simulator using various wind spectra and turbulence models for the implementation of turbulence the kaimal turbulence model is used the average wind speed turbulence intensity and the vertical power law exponent of wind data used in the simulation are 6 15 m sec 8 and 0 1 respectively if the turbulence is included in the wind speed data the wind spectrum becomes very similar to the white noise spectrum in the high frequency range in the simulation the wind speed varies in all directions x y and z directions because of the turbulence effect this also means that the wind causes the excitations on the blade and tower in all directions the accelerations of fore aft and side to side directions are obtained from the numerical sensors based on the acceleration results the graphs of the first singular value of the psd matrix are plotted in fig 4 the yellow and green portions of the figures represent the 1st tower mode and the 2nd tower mode respectively other excitations are generated by 6dof platform motions and the blade modes in the fowt the same wind data is used as that used in the on land case the sea condition is assumed to be still water i e the platform dynamics result from dynamic wind loadings wind forces including wind turbulence are more desirable for oma since they have broadband spectra tcherniak et al 2011 osgood et al 2011 in section 4 2 2 it is shown that the additional wave effect on the oma and modal properties of the tower is minimal i e the same oma results can be obtained with waves 4 shm process 4 1 verification of developed numerical models for fowt dynamic behavior caused by the elasticity of tower and blade is very complicated the reason is that three rotor blades are connected to the hub allowing rotation with respect to the drive train axis in the nacelle which is connected to the tower and they are dynamically coupled because of this complication various structural modes are generated in the modal analysis by using the oma or fem programs various tower and blade modes can be found in the given condition and their mode shapes are displayed in fig 5 and fig 6 in the on land case the presently calculated natural frequencies of modes mentioned above are compared between fem and oma the oma results are obtained through the numerical sensor signals from time domain simulations their average difference of all the modes is 2 besides the present abaqus based fem results were double checked against di lorenzo et al 2013 adams based fem results for the same wind turbine the comparison is tabulated in table 6 and the frequencies of tower and blade agree well with each other for the fowt case the same wind turbine is mounted on the floating base instead of land as far as the authors know there is no shm study for fowts in the open literature by utilizing coupled system numerical simulations fem and oma before going into the details of fowt results the natural frequencies of the tower and blade modes of fowt are compared with those of on land wind turbine this shows the effects of foundation on the modal properties of the wind turbine first the modal properties of tower are compared using fem abaqus as shown in fig 7 there is little difference in the second mode between them but larger discrepancies can be observed in the natural frequencies of first tower modes i e that of fowt is increased by 13 0 15 5 compared to the on land case this difference is mainly caused by the boundary condition of the tower base bir and jonkman 2007 in the case of blade modes there is little difference in the natural frequencies of the first flap and first edge modes between on land wind turbine and fowt but the natural frequencies of fowt s second flap mode are 2 3 greater than those of on land wind turbine as shown in fig 8 and table 7 these results show that using a floating base more influences the tower mode than blade mode next the applicability of oma for fowt is tested in this regard the natural frequencies are obtained using the abaqus software and the results are compared against those from the oma with the charm3d fast time domain simulation results as shown in table 8 and fig 9 fig 10 the fem results agree well with the oma results the maximum difference is 3 1 in the second blade pitch mode it means that the oma analysis can reliably catch the modes of blade and tower even for the fowt 4 2 effects of nonlinear mooring stiffness wave and coupling between tower and blade on wind turbine modes 4 2 1 mooring stiffness effect the actual mooring stiffness for the fowt can be obtained from the numerical static offset test in the surge and sway the corresponding mooring stiffness increases with displacements showing nonlinear hardening behavior kim and kim 2015 this nonlinearity can change the surge and sway stiffness when they are large in charm3d fast numerical simulation the actual mooring is modeled as it is however in abaqus fem modeling the actual mooring is modeled by equivalent linear spring so the equivalent spring may not be accurate when surge sway are large which may affect the accuracy of modal property comparison between the two for the present case study however the effects turn out to be negligible the natural frequencies of the tower modes are estimated with various mooring stiffness within 100 of variation using abaqus and the resulting change in natural frequencies is less than 0 1 in the first ten modes based on the fem analysis results this means that the nonlinear behavior of fowt s mooring stiffness in the expected range of surge sway does not significantly affect the modal properties of tower and blade 4 2 2 wave effect on tower mode let us also consider the effects of sea waves in the assessment of natural frequencies and mode shapes of fowt tower and blade through oma in the present case study only dynamic wind loadings were given and the corresponding oma was carried out to obtain the modal properties in this regard the oma of the fowt with additional irregular waves is also tested jonswap spectrum with significant wave height hs 2m peak period tp 7 5s and enhancement parameter 2 was used for the generation of uni directional irregular waves the two oma results were compared in both cases the same wind excitations were used the comparison is summarized in table 9 we see little difference between the two cases which is somewhat expected because the modal properties of the tower and blade do not change according to the input force also typical linear wave frequencies are far from the typical wind turbine natural frequencies and the effect of second order sum frequency wave excitation on the dynamics of the wind turbine is significantly low compared to the effect of wind turbulence since both cases produce almost identical results from this point on irregular waves are not considered and only dynamic wind excitations are inputted in the ensuing fowt simulations 4 2 3 coupled effect between tower and blade to evaluate the rotor coupled effects on the tower modes two comparison studies are carried out and the results are displayed in fig 11 the first is the comparison of natural frequencies of the tower obtained from fem between when the rotor is simplified to be the top point mass and inertia fem sim and when the full rotor blades are included as the beam elements fem full a considerable difference in the natural frequencies of second tower modes is shown the second is the comparison of the natural frequencies of the tower between oma and fem when the mode shapes obtained from the simplified fem are entered to the time domain analysis the oma results oma sim show appreciable differences in the second modes compared to fem analysis results fem full however the mode shapes obtained from full rotor modeled fem are entered the oma results oma full agree well with the fem results fem full this means that the rotor coupled effect is appreciable in the second mode of the tower thus the rotor coupled tower mode shapes must be entered to the time domain simulation for obtaining the accurate tower modal properties through oma in the case of blade the tower coupled effect is not included in the pre calculated blade mode shapes which means the blade is assumed to be fixed free beam the uncoupled blade mode shapes are plugged into the time domain simulation and the natural frequencies of blade are estimated from the oma even though the tower coupled effect is not included in the pre calculated blade mode shapes the actual tower blade coupling effect is considered in the time domain simulation the natural frequencies of blade obtained from the oma are compared to the natural frequencies obtained from fem fem abaqus including tower coupled effect as shown in fig 12 and fig 13 the differences in natural frequencies of the 1st and 2nd blade modes obtained by fem abaqus and oma are significantly low besides the other fem results fem adams presented by di lorenzo et al 2013 agree well with our fem and oma results this infers that the tower coupled effect on the blade mode shape doesn t affect much the oma results of the first two blade modes 4 3 structural health monitoring 4 3 1 modeling of damaged tower and blade in the simulation by the reduction of stiffness various damage types of blade tower have been reported poor quality control improper installation lightning fire and strong wind have been blamed for the structural damage of blade and tower typical damages in turbine blades are splitting and fracture cracks and the de bonding of the adhesive layer and joint with fatigue damage ciang et al 2008 sørensen et al 2004 shokrieh and rafiee 2006 the initial crack development can be modeled by the reduction of local stiffness griffith et al 2012 shokrieh and rafiee 2006 kim et al 2014 therefore in the present study the damaged condition is implemented by reducing the stiffness of the damaged part in the fem modal analysis and the subsequent fully coupled time domain simulation for example 10 and 30 damaged conditions at some position mean that the stiffness of the specific damaged location is decreased by 10 and 30 respectively the reduced stiffness at a specific point is assumed to gradually vary with distance so that it matches with the original value of ambient parts the damaged positions are started from tower blade base and normalized by the entire length for example when damage develops at 0 3 section of the tower the damage occurs at the location of 30 of total tower length from the tower base the exemplary stiffness variation along the blade for 10 and 30 damage is shown in fig 14 in the next section the presumed local damage is modeled by the fully coupled abaqus fem to obtain the corresponding elastic modes which in turn is used in the fully coupled charm3d fast dynamic simulation to generate numerical sensor signals then the numerical sensor signals are used in the oma with cms to check whether the inputted local damage can correctly be recovered in real health monitoring system we only get signals from physical sensors then by applying the present oma cms algorithms the structural problem can be detected from the shift of natural frequencies and the difference in curvature mode shapes then the severity of the damage can be judged from the computer generated big database generated for numerous damage scenarios the correspondence between the actual damage scenarios and the numerically modeled scenarios also needs to be investigated 4 3 2 structural health monitoring of fowt tower using fem each damage of tower is assumed to happen at 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 sections from the tower base respectively the stiffness reduction of 10 and 30 is considered for each case the natural frequencies and the mode shapes are compared between intact and damaged conditions by fem first in the first fore aft mode of the tower the difference in natural frequency is the highest when the damage occurs at the 0 1 section the difference decreases as the damaged location is higher as shown in fig 15 a in the second fore aft mode of the tower the difference is high when the damage occurs at the 0 1 and 0 7 sections whereas the difference is minimal when the damage occurs at the 0 3 section as shown in fig 15b the trend is the same in the tower side to side mode as shown in fig 16 fig 17 shows the differences in cmss between intact and damaged conditions in the figures it is seen that a large difference in cms develops in the damaged section and thus the damaged location and intensity can be predicted through the difference fig 18 also shows the same case when using dms instead of cms it is seen that damage detection is very difficult by observing the difference in displacement mode shape this explains why the curvature based method should be used in detecting damage in the fem analysis 100 and 49 elements are used for the tower and blades respectively 4 3 3 structural health monitoring of fowt tower using oma in this section the natural frequencies and modal properties estimated by oma are presented the fem based mode shapes for intact and damaged conditions can be inputted for the fully coupled fowt dynamics simulation in the time domain to obtain the respective numerical sensor signals then we can do oma for both intact and damaged cases they are compared and their differences are presented in the following as for natural frequencies and modal properties a similar pattern shown in the fem results figs 15 18 is also found in the oma results although there exist nontrivial differences between them as shown in fig 19 fig 20 fig 21 shows the differences in cmss of fore aft tower mode and side to side tower mode respectively the damaged location can be predicted through the differences because significant peaks in the differences of cmss mean damaged region besides the damaged intensity can also be predicted through the magnitude of difference in the cms as demonstrated in the figures in the oma results in fig 21 the pattern of peaks as the indication of damaged location and degree is less clear than the fem cases especially when the damage is less than 10 however there is still no problem in detecting the damage location and degree by monitoring the difference in natural frequencies of side to side second tower mode and cms of side to side first tower mode as shown in figs 20b and 21b the above discussion shows that by continuously analyzing the differences of sensor signals by oma damage detection can be made fig 22 shows the differences in the exemplary numerical accelerometer signals and its psd between the intact case and 30 damaged case of the fowt tower the numerical sensor 5 is at normalized length 0 1 above the tower base the damage causes changes in time series and shifts blue circles from 2 30 rad sec to 2 24 rad sec and from 18 59 rad sec to 18 12 rad sec of natural frequencies in the psd the natural frequencies correspond to the first and second side to side tower modes 4 3 4 structural health monitoring of fowt blade using oma in this section we consider the shm of fowt blades under the same environmental condition and the upright blade among three blades is selected to monitor the status of the upright blade using oma 19 numerical sensors are installed along the blade length and the normalized locations of sensors are tabulated in table 5 by applying the oma technique to the numerical sensor signals the 1st and 2nd flap modes and the 1st edge modes are captured among those blade modes the edge modes are the most appropriate to use for health monitoring due to a more noticeable appearance fig 23 a shows the entire mode spectrum obtained from the blade signals of edge direction in the 1st blade edge mode three neighboring peaks for edge symmetry edge pitch and edge yaw modes are generated as shown in fig 23b table 8 shows the comparison of natural frequencies of blade modes between abaqus fem and fast charm3d oma and their results agree well with each other it means that the present oma can catch the blade modes well even for the fowt fig 24 shows the differences in natural frequencies a and cmss b obtained from the fem analysis like the tower case the damaged location can be found by the difference in cms and the pattern of difference in blade natural frequencies is very similar to that of the 1st mode of tower fig 25 shows the corresponding results of fig 24 when the oma is used instead of fem the general trend is very similar between the two this means that blade damage can also be detected from the recorded sensor signals using the present oma cms algorithm 5 conclusions in this study the feasibility to detect the damage on the blade and tower of fowt using oma and difference in modal properties was examined the modal properties were obtained by applying oma from the signals of numerical sensors on blade and tower the numerical sensor signals were obtained using a turbine floater mooring fully coupled dynamics simulation program in the time domain which has been extensively validated through comparisons with experiments by authors in the previous papers also the oma results were also self checked against independent fem results the locally damaged conditions were modeled by reducing the local structural stiffness then it was observed that the local damage could be effectively detected using oma and cms which improve the performance of the damage detection compared to the method using dms it was also confirmed that the general trend of differences between intact and damaged cases by fem agreed well to those obtained from oma with numerical sensor signals for a fowt the considerable differences in cmss between intact and damaged conditions at the damaged location were displayed the differences increased with the degree of damage the similarity in the pattern of fem oma results between on land and floating wind turbines was explained it was also seen that the deduced modal properties of the fowt by oma were negligibly affected by the mooring non linearity or and additional wave environments when it comes to the coupling effect between the tower and blades the rotor coupled effect on the tower affects much the modal properties of the tower while the tower coupled effect on the blade is negligible in the first and second blade modes the present numerical simulation and damage detecting method may be used to build up a huge database for various damage scenarios and the corresponding patterns of tower blade dynamic behaviors so that it can be applied to machine generated and machine learning shm technology in the future acknowledgment this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation grant 1700406

22533,marine environmental protection committee mepc and other organizations have made calls to develop regulations for limiting noise levels at sea the propeller noise plays an important role in underwater radiated noise pumpjet propulsor pjp as a new type of propulsion system is widely used in underwater vehicles a propeller noise reduction technology using sawtooth duct is proposed and applied for the first time to pjp in this paper a normal pjp model and a pjp model with the sawtooth duct are presented to investigate effects of the sawtooth duct on hydrodynamic and noise performances flow of the models is simulated using a commercial cfd software and noise is predicted based on des simulation and fw h equation results show that the sawtooth duct results in 2 of maximum water efficiency loss the sawtooth duct directly changes the morphology of wake vortices and reduce the tke value at most of the wake region of pjp furthermore the sawtooth duct can significantly reduce the noise generated by pjp from 10hz to 5000hz especially in the low frequency below 1000 hz the overall spl of pjp is reduced about 2 5 5 db by sawtooth duct with the maximum reduction 4 88 db at the design point keywords pumpjet propulsor the underwater radiated noise the sawtooth duct ffowes williams and hawkings model 1 introduction over the past few decades due to the rapid increase in the number of vessels the sea ambient noise contributed by the commercial shipping fleet has increased by about 12 db hildebrand 2009 it is known that fish utilize sound as the main means when they navigate mate and communicate with others bass and mckibben 2003 also marine mammals mainly use sound for underwater communication and sensing wartzok and ketten 1999 the underwater radiated noise urn from commercial shipping may overlap their communication frequency band which will severely affect the fundamental living activities of marine life hildebrand in order to ensure sustainable shipping more and more international organizations such as international maritime organization imo and marine environmental protection committee mepc have made calls to develop regulations about the urn from commercial shipping to limit the noise level at sea mepc 60th session agenda item 18 the underwater noise of ships can be divided into three main classes 1 hydrodynamic noise 2 machinery noise 3 propeller noise defined by the specialist committee on hydrodynamic noise amongst the three classes propeller noise usually dominates the urn of ships ross 2013 with the development of technology the hydrodynamic noise and machinery noise of ships becoming less and less by the use of various methods the propeller noise is becoming one of the main traceable signals of noise radiated by ships for naval ships and submarines the smaller radiated noise the less likely that the possibility of being detected by sonar therefore the propeller noise determines the detectability and survivability of the ship özden et al 2016 consequently noise prediction and noise reduction technology for propeller has always been an important topic for naval ships pumpjet propulsor pjp as a new underwater propulsion system is typically composed of the rotor the stator and the duct the pjp usually has a great balance of the rotating moment due to the existence of the stator blades pan et al 2013 suryanarayana et al 2010a therefore pjp is widely used in submarines such as the american sea wolf class submarine british vanguard class submarine and other unmanned underwater vehicles uuv at present researches of pumpjet propulsor mainly concentrate on the experiment and numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic performance ch suryanarayana et al 2010b conducted an experiment on hydrodynamic performance of the underwater vehicle equipped with a pumpjet propulsor stefan ivanell ivanell studied the hydrodynamic performance of the torpedo with a pump jet using computational fluid dynamics cfd method pan guang et al pan et al 2013 carried out the numerical calculation of one vehicle equipped with a pump jet propulsor lin lu et al 2016 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a pumpjet propulsor using cfd method qin et al 2018 presented the influence of tip clearances on pjp hydrodynamic performance based on cfd method for underwater radiated noise predictions the acoustic analogy based on the ffowcs williams and hawkings fwh equation williams and hawkings 1969 is one of the most widely used approaches the noise source information is usually obtained from cfd results such as detached eddy simulation des or large eddy simulation les due to the increased computational power this method is becoming available for marine propellers varney et al varney and martino proposed that adding a perforated wear liner inside the rotor housing can alter the spectrum of noise produced by the pump jet in addition bagheri et al 2015 studied the noise trend of marine propellers fwh equation is used to predict the noise of a propeller under non cavitating and cavitating conditions sai et al sai et al 2017 proposed a semi empirical modulation model based on a generalized acoustic analogy theory to predict counter rotation propeller non cavitation noise özden et al 2016 investigated the noise of the insean e1619 propeller at different operational conditions also the noise results of propeller in open water and behind the darpa suboff submarine are compared in general most papers focus on the underwater noise of the single propeller or counter rotation propeller and there are few publications about the noise of pumpjet propulsor therefore more attention can be paid to the study of pumpjet propulsor noise the flight of most of the owl species is not audible to their prey the silent fly of owl has always been a source of inspiration for scientist to find solutions for quieter machinery the theoretical and experimental researches on mechanisms of the nearly silent flight owls were carried out by lots of researchers in past decades sarradj et al 2011 the noise reduction mechanisms for the special morphological features of owl wing had been studied and are used for airfoils resulting in sawtooth howe 1998 or serrated trailing edges howe 1991 airfoils subsequently the sawtooth trailing edge technology was applied to the aero engine exhaust nozzle called chevron exhaust nozzles which was proved to be an effective way to reduce jet noise and was widely used in the aviation industry since 1996 ge general electric company and nasa had been exploring and investigating it for noise reduction and have achieved good results this drew more attention to the sawtooth trailing edge in order to reduce jet noise of airplane exhaust systems ge martens developed the chevron nozzle it was found that the sawtooth trailing edge technology can achieve the 2 3 epn effective perceived noise db noise reduction callender callender et al 2005 carried out the far field noise test of chevron nozzles in the university of cincinnati nozzle acoustic test facility ucnatf the results show that the overall sound pressure level oaspl is reduced from 3 to 6 db the sawtooth trailing edge nozzle which developed jointly between ge aircraft engines and nasa has proven to be an effective and efficient means to reduce jet noise with minimal impact on engine performance operability weight and cost for some aircraft systems martens hence it is widely used in the aviation field but to authors best knowledge it has not been used for reducing noise of the underwater propeller however given the similar geometry and flow between the pumpjet propeller and the aircraft engine jet nozzle it is worth exploring whether the sawtooth duct can have the same noise reduction on the pjp in this paper effects of the sawtooth duct on hydrodynamic and noise performances of pjp is studied the goal of this paper is 1 assessing the applicability of des with fw h equation in predicting the underwater radiated noise of propeller 2 investigating the effect of the sawtooth duct on the flow of pjp 3 comparing the difference for wake vortices structures

background is introduced in section 1 section 2 gives the numerical methodology in section 3 the flow and noise simulation methods are validated section 4 shows the geometry the numerical set up and the grid independence test the effects of sawtooth duct on the hydrodynamic coefficients of pjp are discussed in section 5 also the structures and evolution of pjp wake vortices are compared moreover section 6 quantitatively evaluates the noise reduction by using sawtooth duct finally the conclusions are summarized in section 7 2 methodology the governing equations of incompressible and single

in this paper for the numerical simulation of propeller no further elaboration of the model will be made here secondly based on the steady flow the des simulation of pjp is carried out and then time dependent flow data is used to predict the underwater radiated noise of pjp based on the fwh equation the des model combines both rans and les the des method based on the spalart allmaras model spalart and allmaras 1992 is shown as below the eddy viscosity ν t is defined as follow 3 ν t ν f ν 1 4 f ν 1 χ 3 χ 3 c ν 1 3 5 χ ν ν where the subscript ν stands for viscous c ν 1 3 equals to a

diameter ratio p d 1 0 inside the duct 19a baltazar et al 2018 the diameter of propeller is 200 mm and the tip clearance between blades and duct is uniform and equal to 0 8 mm the computational domain of duct propeller see fig 1 is a cylinder with 5d diameter extending from 3d to 7d in the streamwise direction structural mesh is used here specifically the first boundary layer height around the walls is 0 001 mm which ensures the y value of walls is less than 1 and the growth rate is 1 05 details of the blades mesh are illustrated in zoom in view in fig 1 the total number of cells of this mesh is about 8 million the advance ratio j is j u n d h where u is the free stream velocity n is the rotor blade rotating speed r s and d h is the diameter of the propeller ρ f is the density of fluid the propeller thrust coefficient is k t thrust ρ f n 2 d h 4 and the torque coefficient is k q torque ρ f n 2 d h 5 the relative errors δ k t and δ k q are defined as below 9 δ k t k t c f d k t e x p k t e x p 100 10 δ k q k q c f d k q c f d k q c f d 100 in the des simulation of duct propeller the boundary of inlet is velocity inlet with u 2 57 m s and the boundary of outlet is pressure outlet with an average relative static pressure 1 mpa the rotating speed is changed in different work conditions in addition simplec algorithm is used and the pressure and momentum terms are discretized by second order scheme the time term is discretized using the bounded 2nd order implicit time discretization and the time iteration step is set as 1 x 10 4 s the hydrodynamic results are the mean value of the des results for the last 20 rotation period the numerical simulation results of hydrodynamic coefficient are compared with the experimental data baltazar et al 2018 see table 1 as shown all the relative errors of the thrust and torque coefficient are always less than 2 with maximum relative error δ k t 1 58 at j 0 5 so the numerical simulation results have a good agreement with the experimental data and the numerical simulation method with the des turbulence model is applicable and reliable for the propeller flow simulation 3 2 noise prediction methodology validation after conducting des simulations the fw h equation is used for acoustic prediction of propeller as for choosing of the noise contribution sources for propeller noise prediction ozden et al özden et al 2016 carried out a study for a navy propeller firstly the surface of blades and hub were set as the sound sources as a contrast a rotating domain was created around the propeller where the outer surface porous surface of this domain was employed as the noise source surface compared with the noise results using the blades and hub surface as source surface the results using the porous surface made it possible to include nonlinear terms and showed better noise prediction values also sandro ianniello et al ianniello and de bernardis 2015 carried out the research about the potential of the acoustic analogy in the analysis of the underwater noise generated by a marine propeller results show that a reliable hydroacoustic analysis of a marine propeller seems to require the computation of the fwh equation s nonlinear quadrupole sources and the noise contribution due to the nonlinear sources can be assessed through the porous formulation by using the outer surface of a rotating domain so for the noise prediction of pjp the outer surface of domain around pjp is defined as the noise source surface due to that there is no experimental noise data of the propeller ka4 70 with the 19a duct the noise prediction methodology is validated using another benchmark case and the noise results are compared with the experimental data jacob et al 2005 carried out one noise test of rod airfoil at école centrale de lyon ecl this experiment is now considered as a canonical benchmark for air noise prediction a naca0012 airfoil of chord c 0 1 m is placed downstream of a cylindrical rod with a diameter of d 0 01 m the spanwise length of the airfoil is 0 3m the incoming velocity u 0 72 m s the noise is tested through two bruel kjaer 4191 microphones and bruel kjaer 2669 preamplifier the noise receiver is located in the middle plane of the airfoil and the radius is 1 85m the numerical verification is carried out based on the experiment of jacob and the models are in the same with the experiment taking into account the relatively large amount of calculation the computational spanwise length of rod airfoil is l s i m 3 5 d 0 035 m the computational domain and boundary conditions are shown in fig 2 the computational domain extends from 6c to 7c in the streamwise direction and from 3c to 3c in the crosswise direction the total computational domain is divided into two domains near field domain and far field domain the mesh of near field domain is obviously encrypted to better simulate the flow and turbulent eddy structures around rob and airfoil the domain size is shown in fig 3 which is determined by making reference to the research of jean christophe giret giret et al 2012 the outer surface of near field domain is selected as the sound source see the red line in fig 3 this sound source choosing is applied in order to be consistent with the choosing of the noise source surface of the pumpjet propeller noise prediction fig 3 shows the grid of the center plane there are 181 nodes along the cylinder and 281 nodes on the airfoil the initial wall spacing is 0 001 mm which ensures the y value on the walls is less than 1 and the growth rate is 1 05 the zoom in view shows the boundary layer grid of the cylinder the airfoil and the local encrypted mesh nearby the total number of grids is about 2 85 million the des simulation is carried out the boundary conditions of calculation are set as same as the experiment the time step is δ t 2 5 e 6 and the 10000 time steps cfd results are sampled the receiver is located same as the microphone in the experiment based on the spl results in fig 4 the noise results agree well with the experimental value of jacob jacob et al 2005 the tonal peak can be obviously seen in f 1375 6 h z s t 0 19 which is caused by the impingement of large vortices on the leading edge of airfoil consequently it is concluded that the numerical approach using des and fw h is reliable for the application considered in this paper 4 numerical set up 4 1 geometry model the pumpjet propulsor geometry 3d model in this study is shown in fig 5 a the propeller has 11 rotor blades and 9 stator blades the rotor is in front of the stator and the rotors rotate clockwise seen from the front of the model the diameter of pumpjet propulsor is d 0 26 m and the length of original duct is l 0 0 17 m the design point of pjp is in the case the rotational speed of rotor blade n 3200 rpm and inflow velocity 25 72 m s j 1 90 an o x y z cartesian coordinate system is built the origin o is located at the center of the propeller and the positive direction of the z axis coincides with the inflow direction the direction of x and y axes are defined by the right hand rule inspired by the sawtooth nozzle the sawtooth duct is used for pumpjet propulsor fig 5 b as shown fig 6 a the sawtooth is attached to the trailing edge of original duct fig 6 b shows the sawtooth size the length of sawtooth is l s 0 025 m and the angel of sawtooth is β 70 the number of teeth of the sawtooth duct is n 18 to simulate real flow of propeller one half ellipsoid type flow guide cap has been added in the front of the propulsor model the total length of pjp with sawtooth duct after adding flow guide cap is l 0 4 m two abbreviations npm the normal pumpjet propulsor model and sdpm the sawtooth duct pumpjet propulsor model are used for clarifying the geometries of rotor and stator blades are all the same for both models 4 2 computational domain and mesh fig 7 shows the computational domain of pjp and boundary conditions setting the computational domain is a cylinder with 5d diameter extending from 3l to 7l in the streamwise direction the total computational domain is divided into four parts the rotor domain the stator domain the noise domain and the external domain the rotor domain is rotating domain and the other three domains are stationary the contacting surfaces among those domains are set as the interface to exchange flow information in order to get accurate acoustic results a mesh refine domain around the propeller called noise domain is created this domain is a cylinder with 1 5d diameter and 4d length whose rotating axis aligns with the symmetry axis of propulsor the outer wall of this domain is selected as the noise source the structured grid is favorable for the boundary layer simulation therefore the structured grids are used in this research fig 8 shows the mesh of npm in longitudinal section specifically the grids of rotating domain stator domain and noise domain are denser than that in the far field also the meshes of blades and duct for npm and sdpm are shown in fig 9 for both models the meshes of rotor and stator blades are identical and only the mesh of duct and hub of sdpm is different from npm for sdpm the grid of duct consists of 18 rotational copies of a sawtooth channel mesh additionally the rotor and stator blades are surrounded by o grids see the zoom in view which ensures a good boundary layer near the walls furthermore to accurately capture the formation and evolution of small vortices using as few grids as possible the meshes in the region of rotor tip downstream of duct and hub wake are refined see the rectangular box in fig 8 those mesh refined regions are determined and re changed based on the vortex distribution area of preliminary flow field the y value of the walls is less than 1 the total number of cells for npm is approximate 12 000 000 while the number of cells for sdpm corresponds to 14 000 000 4 3 boundary condition for boundary conditions setting the inlet is set as velocity inlet with normal speed v 25 72 m s while the rotational speed is adjusted with range of 2400 4200 revolutions per minute rpm to alter the physics conditions the turbulence intensity is 5 as the default the averaged static pressure of outlet is set as 10 mpa the flow of pjp is solved by ansys fluent version 15 ansys inc based on finite volume method solver in the des simulation the simplec algorithm is used and the pressure and momentum terms of equations are discretized by the second order scheme specifically the time term is discretized using the bounded 2nd order implicit time discretization the courant friedrichslewy cfl number is defined as c f l δ t u δ m i n where u is the local velocity and δ m i n m i n δ x δ y δ z the time step setting should satisfy that c f l 1 in case n 3200 rpm the time iteration step is set as 5 10 5 the time required for a 1 of rotor blade rotation 4 4 grid independence validation in order to facilitate the discussion the non dimensional physical quantities are defined as shown in table 2 in the table v is the far field flow velocity n denotes the rotor speed r s d is the diameter of the propulsor ρ is the fluid density t t denotes the thrust of rotor t s is the thrust of stator and duct m t denotes the torque of rotor and m s is the torque of stator and duct in this section mesh independence validation is conducted based on the two grid assessment procedure proposed by roache 1997 two different meshes of npm coarse and fine meshes are generated for both meshes the geometric dimensions and topological structures are maintained as identical and the only difference is the mesh size setting for the coarse mesh the y value of the walls is about 1 while the y value of the walls for fine mesh is about 0 5 in addition the nodes number of blades and duct surfaces are refined with a factor 1 2 for fine mesh also the mesh in the vortex refinement region see fig 8 is refined to more accurately capture the development of propeller turbulence for the coarse mesh the maximum size of the vortex refinement regions δ m a x m a x δ x δ y δ z is 1 5 d while δ m a x 1 d for fine mesh the total cells number of coarse grid n c o a r s e corresponds to about 12 000 000 while the number of fine mesh n f i n e is about 24 000 000 the grid convergence index gci based on the theory of richardson extrapolation roache 1997 is used to report grid convergence tests a coarse grid richardson error is defined as 11 e c o a r s e r p ε 1 r p 12 ε f 2 f 1 13 r n f i n e n c o a r s e 1 d here f 1 and f 2 denote the torque and thrust coefficient of stator duct and rotor for coarse and fine meshes respectively p is the formal order of accuracy of the algorithm p 2 r is the refinement factor between the coarse and fine grid d is the dimensionality of the simulation the gci of coarse mesh is defined as 14 g c i c o a r s e f s e c o a r s e f s 1 is a safety factor based on the recommendation of roache 1997 f s 3 is used here the hydrodynamic coefficients of the fine and coarse meshes with different j are compared in table 3 the results are the mean value of the des results for the last 20 rotation period 7200 time steps the results indicate that the numerical results of both grids are similar the gcis of coarse mesh results are always less than 2 when j 1 52 1 79 and 2 54 and then in order to validate the grid independence for noise prediction the pressure fluctuations of one probing point p1 it will be described in fig 25 for coarse and fine meshes are compared in fig 10 as shown the pressure fluctuations of coarse mesh agree well with that of fine mesh in addition the period of pressure fluctuation is about 0 0017 s which is consistent with the blade passage period it s mean that the rotation periodicity of the rotor is well captured generally speaking the hydrodynamic coefficients and flow pressure fluctuation of coarse mesh agree well with that of fine mesh and the grid convergence test is great in addition for a typical case j 1 79 with a coarse mesh about 12 000 000 the computational time consuming 1 468 800 s approximately 17 days for 12 000 time steps using cpu inter r xeon r e5 2630 v4 2 2 ghz 20 processors for the fine grid computing will take more time so for the sake of reducing computing resources consumption the coarse mesh is more applicable in this research therefore the coarse grid is used in the subsequent analyses 5 flow results and discussion 5 1 results of the hydrodynamic performance of pjp the flow simulations of npm and sdpm with inlet velocity v 25 72 m s are carried out and the rotational speed n varies from 2400 rpm to 4200 rpm fig 11 shows the hydrodynamic coefficients and open water efficiency results for npm as shown the thrust and torque coefficients of the rotor and stator duct all decrease linearly with the increase of j also the torque coefficients of the rotor k m t is almost the same as the torque coefficients of stator duct k m s which shows that this propulsor is well designed and has a good torque performance additionally the thrust coefficient of rotor k t t is obviously greater than that of stator and duct system k t s in j 1 45 the stator duct provide about 20 of the total thrust but in work condition of maximum efficiency j 1 79 the rotor blades supply about 90 of total thrust of propulsor while the thrust of stator duct accounts for 10 of total thrust furthermore it should be noted that the thrust coefficient of the stator duct is negative when j 2 03 hence the stator duct provide about 10 20 thrust of propulsor at low j but changes from thrust to drag at high j conditions finally the open water efficiency firstly increases then decreases with the increase of j especially reaching peak value about 70 17 at j 1 79 in order to explore the effects of sawtooth duct on the hydrodynamic performance of pjp the open water efficiencies of npm and sdpm are compared in fig 12 in addition the hydrodynamic coefficients of both models are shown in table 4 k t t k t s k t k m t k m s and η are the thrust coefficient of rotor the thrust coefficient of stator duct the total thrust coefficient the torque coefficient of rotor the torque coefficient of stator duct and the open water efficiency of sdpm respectively while k t t k t s k t k m t k m s and η are the according physical quantities of npm δ k t is defined as k t k t k t also δ k t t δ k t s δ k m t δ k m s δ η are defined in the same way e g δ η η η η as shown in fig 12 the open water efficiency curve of sdpm also shows the same change law of npm which first increases and then decreases with the increasing of j however the η of sdpm is smaller than that of npm at j 1 45 2 18 but greater than that at j 2 18 2 54 the η of npm reaches its maximum 70 17 at j 1 79 but the η of sdpm has a peak about 68 03 at j 2 03 hence it means that the maximum water efficiency has been reduced about 2 by sawtooth duct in contrast the sawtooth duct improves the η of pjp at high j range about 3 4 at j 2 54 as shown in table 4 the relative error of total thrust δ k t varies form 3 69 to 0 7 in the case j from 1 45 to 2 18 moreover δ k t corresponds to 4 46 which resulting to the open water efficiency improvement about 3 39 at j 2 54 specifically the torque coefficient relative error of stator duct δ k t s is obviously bigger than δ k t t similarly the δ k m s is relatively bigger than δ k m t at most cases this means that the sawtooth duct is mainly affect the flow of stator duct domain rather than rotor domain and leads to the thrust and torque change of propulsor consequently the sawtooth duct results in water efficiency loss at j 1 45 2 18 but improves the open water efficiency at j 2 18 2 54 the maximum water efficiency has been reduced about 2 by sawtooth duct the sawtooth duct mainly affects the thrust and torque of stator duct resulting in the efficiency change 5 2 the effects of sawtooth duct on the flow of pjp to analysis the effects of sawtooth duct on the flow of pjp the steady rans flow results of npm and sdpm are contrasted in the case j 1 90 which is the design point of pjp fig 13 a and b visualize the pressure contours of hub and blades of npm contrast to sdpm respectively and fig 13 c and d show the duct pressure contours of npm and sdpm as shown the pressure contours of blades of npm are almost the same as those of sdpm however the pressure distributions in the inside and outside surface of sawtooth duct are obviously different with the duct of npm see zoom in view in fig 13 c and d there is a circle low pressure zone in the inner surface of duct trailing edge for npm but low pressure area appears in the root of sawtooth for sdpm the sawtooth completely changes the flow around the trailing edge of duct while has relatively little effect on the pressure distributions of rotor and stator blades the 3d streamlines around the normal duct and one sawtooth channel are illustrated in fig 14 as shown for npm the flow is sucked from the outer surface of duct to the duct trailing edge a circle of vortex called duct induced vortex is formed behind the duct trailing edge as for sdpm due to the pressure difference of side surfaces and top bottom surfaces the flow is sucked into the sawtooth channel from the top bottom surface of duct and a pair of vortexes is generated in every sawtooth channel furthermore the effect of sawtooth on the velocity field is discussed fig 15 shows the zoom in overviews of tangential and axial velocity component velocity contours around duct for npm left and sdpm right respectively there appear two low velocity zones near the root in every sawtooth channel for sdpm see in fig 15 d in contrast to a circular low velocity zone behind the trailing edge of duct for npm fig 15 c additionally it is clearly observed that the tangential velocity components of the two vortexes are opposite the red zone and the blue zone in fig 15 b therefore there is a pair of counter rotating vortexes in every sawtooth channel and the two vortexes are formed in the root of sawtooth and develop following two side surfaces of sawtooth along the streamwise direction to further study the effect of sawtooth on the wake flow of pjp the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy tke of npm and sdpm are discussed fig 16 has visualized the velocity magnitude contours of center plane for npm and sdpm respectively and fig 17 illustrates the turbulence kinetic energy tke contours of center plane for npm and sdpm respectively as shown in the fig 16 the velocity in the wake region of sdpm is nearly same with that of npm furthermore the axis velocity contours at six different z locations z l 0 45 0 5 0 75 1 2 5 for npm and sdpm are compared in fig 18 a firstly at z l 0 45 there are both 11 high velocity regions the red zones in the propulsor outflow which is caused by the high velocity flows from 11 rotor blade channels some areas are not obvious due to the effect of 9 stator blades while for sdpm there exists low velocity zone in every sawtooth channel due to the sawtooth vortexes discussed before similar features are also observed in contours at z l 0 5 and there is a petal shaped low velocity zone whose petal number is associated with sawtooth number n 18 in the wake region then from z l 0 75 to z l 2 the high velocity zone in the propulsor outflow is becoming more and more uniform for both models which means the propulsor outflow is gradually weakening however for npm the shape of outer boundary of high velocity propulsor outflow the red area in fig 18 a is changing from nearly round to petal shape which number is 9 which means the stator channel flows began to dominate the outflow in contrast for sdpm the shape of outflow outer boundary is always maintain as uniform circles and the axial velocity distribution of wake region is more uniform than that of npm the reason can be also found from fig 15 the tangential velocity of sawtooth wake region is obviously complex and there are more positive and negative regions than the npm see fig 15 a the pair of counter rotating vortexes in every sawtooth channel similar like fluid mixer strongly exchange the fluid of high velocity outflow with the surrounding fluid this results in that the shape of high velocity outflow outer boundary for sdpm is nearly circle in addition the high axis velocity fluid is mixed fully enough by the vortexes and so the distribution of axis velocity is more uniform for sdpm compared with npm see fig 15 d finally at z l 5 the axial velocity distributions of npm and sdpm are all uniform though the velocity of npm still is slightly affected by stator passage outflow moreover based on the results in figs 17 and 18 b there exist significant differences between the tke distributions of npm and sdpm as shown in fig 17 the high tke area in the wake region of sdpm is obviously less than that of npm which means that the sawtooth duct significantly reduces the tke in the most wake region of pjp the more detailed information of the tke reduction is shown in fig 18 b and the tke contours at six different z locations z l 0 45 0 5 0 75 1 2 5 of npm and sdpm are compared firstly at z l 0 45 the high tke region of npm is shown as a circle coinciding with the shape of circle duct this is due to the periodical duct shedding vortices in comparison there are 18 high tke regions in the channel of sawtooth for sdpm which is caused by the formed pair of counter rotating vortexes in every sawtooth channel then at z l 0 5 there are petal shaped high tke regions behind the sawtooth for sdpm this also resulting that the tke of sdpm in the area behind the duct is greater than npm the detail will be discussed in fig 19 additionally from z l 0 75 to z l 5 there is a circle of petal shaped high tke region for npm conversely the high tke region behind the duct for sdpm is circumferentially uniformly distributed and the magnitude is significantly less than npm the reason has been discussed before and it is caused by the formation and the development of sawtooth vortexes the pair of counter rotating vortexes in every sawtooth channel increases the contact area of low velocity surrounding flow and high velocity outflow and helps the mixing of them prompting the dissipation of tke in the wake region furthermore in order to quantitatively reveal the effect of sawtooth duct on the tke the mean tke values at different z locations for npm and sdpm are compared in fig 19 based on the results at the region behind the duct from z l 0 45 to 0 75 the mean tke value of sdpm the red curve is a little higher than that of npm black curve this is because of that the formation and development of sawtooth vortexes obviously increase the turbulent energy however at the most of the wake region from z l 0 75 5 the mean tke value of sdpm is significantly smaller than that of npm fig 17 b also clearly visualized the difference the maximum mean tke value reduction caused by sawtooth duct is about 38 at z l 2 5 3 the effects of sawtooth duct on the vortices structure of pjp with the aim of exploration of effects of sawtooth duct on the vertical structure of pjp the des simulations of npm and sdpm in the case j 1 90 are further analyzed and compared fig 20 a has visualized the local pressure contours at different streamwise locations in the rotor blade passage it is clearly observed that two low pressure zones first appear in the suction tip line the boundary line of suction surface and rotor tip surface and pressure tip line of rotor blade see zoom in view in fig 20 a this is also why the two tip vortexes tip separation vortex and tip leakage vortex see fig 20 b are formed the flow is sucked into the suction surface from the pressure side of rotor blades then by comparing the local pressure contours at different streamwise locations it is clearly observed that the low pressure zone resulting in tip leakage vortex is gradually moving towards the middle of the rotor passage along with the fluid flowing thus the tip leakage vortex is formed in the leading edge of rotor tip and develops gradually towards the middle of the rotor passage along the streamwise direction with respect to tip separation vortex it is also formed in same location but develops gradually following the boundary line of pressure surface and rotor tip surface furthermore it should be noted that those two vortexes will exchange fluid and some fluid is sucked to tip leakage vortex from tip separation vortex see fig 20 b detailed spatial structures of those vortices can be visualized in fig 21 the large amount of rotation energy in the tip vortex flow causes severe flow loss of propeller additionally the spatial structure of the instantaneous vortex in the rotor and stator domain of npm constructed by using q criterion is shown in fig 21 there are mainly rotor tip leakage vortexes propagating downstream with the fluid flowing due to the number of rotor and stator blades is different some rotor tip leakage vortexes flow directly into the stator channel called channel vortex and then hit the suction surface of the stator blade in addition other vortexes impact on the leading edge of stator blades directly called impact separation vortex and then broking into 2 strands of vortexes which mainly focus on the pressure side of stator blade see fig 21 finally those vortexes mainly impact separation vortex flow towards downstream direction of the propeller the spatial structures of the instantaneous vortex in the wake region of npm and sdpm are illustrated in fig 22 and fig 23 respectively as shown the fine vortex structures in the wake region are well captured for npm the wake vortexes are mainly composed by the impact separation vortex hub vortex and duct induced vortex as discussed before the duct induced vortex of npm is mainly periodical shedding small vortex groups with uniform circumferential distribution but for sdpm the duct induced vortex is shown as the shape of sawtooth according with the sawtooth number both duct induced vortexes gradually break down with the flow of fluid by contrast the figs 22 and 23 we can see that the sawtooth duct induced vortexes are more finely broken and the tke value is significantly smaller than normal duct induced vortexes additionally another big difference is the impact separation vortex for npm the impact separation vortexes sustain development until far away from the propeller but the impact separation vortexes of sdpm are quickly breaking down and almost disappear in the region far away from the pjp consequently the sawtooth channel has significantly changed the vortex structures of pjp wake region the vortexes in the sawtooth channel help the mixing of the high speed jet of propeller and surrounding flow and promoting dissipation of vortexes and the tke value of sdpm wake vortexes is remarkablely less than that of npm in order to explore the difference of instantaneous vortices between npm and sdpm quantitatively four probing points p1 p2 p3 p4 are chose and the spectral characteristics of the tke for those probing points are analyzed and compared the layout sketch of those probing points are shown in fig 24 p1 is in front of rotor blade and p2 is in the middle of the rotor blade and the stator blade p3 is behind of the stator blade p1 p2 and p3 are all located around the tip of blades which is aimed at exploring the evolution of the rotor tip vortices p4 is behind the trailing edge of duct for npm and in the middle of sawtooth passage for sdpm which is aimed at analyzing the spectrum characteristics of duct induced vortexes for both modes the 3 dimensional coordinates of those probing points is the same figs 25 27 show the power spectral density psd of kinetic energy for p1 p2 p3 p4 respectively the k is defined as k f f b p f and f b p f is the rotor blade passage frequency bpf for j 1 9 n 3200 rpm f b p f 586 67 h z as shown in fig 25 the peaks appear at the harmonics of f b p f k 1 2 3 it shows that the periodicity of rotor blades rotation is well simulated and the shedding frequency of rotor tip leakage vortexes are corresponding to the blade passage frequency for p1 and p2 the psd of npm and sdpm are similar in the low frequency range psd decreases with the increasing of frequency and the psd tends to stabilize in the high frequency range furthermore it should be noted that the kinetic energy psd magnitude of p2 is obviously higher than that of p1 which means that the kinetic energy fluctuation increases sharply in the area between the rotor and stator blades as discussed before the rotor tip leakage vortexes flow directly into the stator channel impacting on the leading edge of stator blades directly causing the increase of kinetic energy fluctuation however significant differences exist between the kinetic energy psd spectra of sdpm and npm for p3 and p4 as shown in figs 26 and 27 the psd characteristics of p3 and p4 show a few similarities for npm the peaks corresponding to bpf and its multiples are still clearly observed in the low frequency range but for sdpm significant peaks at k 1 2 3 are not observed while several other peaks are clear observed in the low frequency range for example k 1 4 see fig 27 in addition the psd magnitude of sdpm is significantly smaller than the signal level of npm in the middle to high frequency range as discussed before those differences are mainly caused by the duct induced vortex for npm the periodically shedding frequency of duct induced vortex is corresponding to the bpf and their harmonics see black line in fig 27 but for sdpm the duct induced vortex is shown as the shape of sawtooth according with the sawtooth number the formation and evolution of sawtooth duct induced vortexes have seriously impact the periodicity and spectrum characteristics in the flow field around the sawtooth it seem like the periodically shedding frequency of sdpm duct induced vortex is about 800hz k 1 4 in general the sawtooth has significantly change the kinetic energy psd spectrum characteristics in behind of the stator blade and the area around the sawtooth the kinetic energy psd of magnitude of sdpm is slightly lower than that of npm 6 underwater radiated noise results and discussion 6 1 the set up of noise calculation based on the des results the underwater radiated noises of npm and sdpm are predicted based on fw h equation the noise sampling time step is the same as flow time iteration step 5 10 5 s for the case n 3200 rpm 10000 time steps cfd results are sampled as discussed before results show that using porous surface around the propeller shows better noise prediction value compared with using the blades and hub in this study the pjp is placed inside a cylinder domain with 1 5d diameter and 4d length the outer wall of this domain is defined as the noise source see fig 28 as requested by ittc the sound pressure levels should be corrected to a standard measuring distance of 1 m in db and p r e f 1 μ p a hence four receivers are selected with 100d away from the propulsor center as shown in fig 28 and then underwater radiated noise results are corrected to 1 m as follow 15 s p l s p l 1 20 l o g r where s p l is the value at 1 m distance and s p l 1 is the spl in the receiver located r from the propeller center as r 100d in the study so in the following analyze the spl in db p r e f 1 μ p a 1 hz and 1 m is presented additionally to make the display of the difference between the noises of npm and sdpm more clearer some presentations of spl curves are using 1 3 octave band hanning filter is used 6 2 the noise results discussion the underwater radiated noise predictions at four receivers for npm and sdpm in the case j 1 52 1 90 and 2 18 are carried out fig 29 has visualized the spl results at varying receiver locations of npm compared to sdpm in the case j 1 90 n 3200 rpm in this case the shaft frequency sf is f h 3200 60 53 33 h z and the rotor blade passage frequency bpf is f b p f f h 11 586 67 h z the number of rotor blades is 11 a comparison of the spl curves of both models indicates that the noise of sdpm has the same noise spectrum characteristic as npm the noise frequency spectrums of both models are mainly composed by two parts the discrete tonal noise and the broadband noise the discrete tonal noise is clearly observed that the peaks appearing at the harmonics of sf and bpf see fig 29 the first obvious peak is located at about f 160hz 3 f h which shows that the influence of hub rotating frequency on noise spectrum of propeller the high peak at 2 f h can also be observed but reduces in the amplitude the peak at f h is not so prominent maybe because of the resolution of noise signal is not high enough furthermore the second obvious peak appears at about f 585hz at about 1 bpf also the clear peaks can also be observed in multiples bpf coinciding with n b p f n 2 3 4 5 but reduced in the amplitude furthermore it should be noted that the spl of broadband noise gradually undergoes intense attenuation at high frequency range of 700 5000 hz significantly by contrast the spl of sdpm the red line to that of npm the black line it is clearly observed that the noise level of sdpm is almost less than the level of npm throughout the entire frequency range 10 5000 hz a more clear differences are illustrated in fig 30 in which the spl is graphically presented in 1 3 octave band in low frequency range 10 700 hz the noise reduction of sdpm is significantly obvious with about 5 db for all the receivers at j 1 90 the maximum noise reduction of sdpm is about 10 db at f about 60 hz as shown in figs 22 and 23 it is easy to understand why the noise is reduced the duct induced vortexes of sdpm help the mixing of the high speed jet of propeller and surrounding flow and promote the dissipation of wake vortexes the large eddies of sdpm break up into small eddies faster than npm benefitting from the sawtooth the vortex intensity and turbulent energy in the wake region of sdpm are remarkablely less than that of npm therefore the spl of sdpm is obviously smaller than npm in low frequency range in addition at high frequency range the spl of sdpm is only slightly less than that of npm or even a little higher than spl of npm at frequency range 700 1000 hz see fig 30 c it should be noted that the peak at 1 bpf of sdpm is shifting to about 800 hz which also can be observed in fig 29 c as discussed before there are a counter rotating vortexes in every sawtooth channel which resulting the sawtooth duct induced vortices the periodically shedding frequency of sdpm duct induced vortex is about 800hz k 1 4 the frequency shifting is caused by the periodic shedding of sawtooth duct induced vortices furthermore the spl curves of receivers for npm and sdpm with different rotation speeds are shown in fig 31 based on the results the noise results at 3 different working conditions n 2800 3200 4000 rpm at receiver 1 and 3 are compared it is clearly observed that for both models the spl curve of n 4000 rpm with red color is obviously greater than the curve of n 3200 rpm with blue color throughout the frequency range also the same features are also observed in spl of n 3200 rpm compared to that of 2800 rpm though the noise level of high n is a little lower than spl of lower n case at some low frequency range see fig 31 b hence the spl of both models basically show the same variation tendency which increases with the increase of rotor rotation speed moreover the underwater radiated noise predictions of receivers for npm and sdpm in the case j 1 52 and 2 18 are illustrated in fig 32 and fig 33 at j 1 52 the spl of all the four receivers of sdpm are still less than the noise level of npm but the noise reduction is so obvious in contrast to the case j 1 90 also the same frequency shifting at 1 bpf is observed with respect to j 2 18 the noise level of sdpm at high frequency 1000 5000 hz is similar with that of npm or even a little bigger than that of npm see fig 33 d however the noise reduction of sdpm can still be obvious observed at low frequency in addition the overall sound pressure level oaspl results of receivers for npm and sdpm are listed in table 5 at j 1 90 the noise reduction of sdpm is the most great with the maximum noise reduction 4 88 db at receiver 2 as to j 1 52 the spl of sdpm is also less than spl of npm with the maximum noise reduction 3 43 db at receiver 2 while the noise reduction of sdpm at j 2 18 is the smallest with only 1 44 db at receiver 1 furthermore it should be noted that at all the studied work conditions the noise reductions at receiver 1 and 2 in the front and behind of the propeller are greater than receiver 3 and 4 in the circumference of the propeller also the same differences can be seen at figs 30 figs 32 and 33 so the sawtooth has a better noise effect at the axial direction than the circumference direction of propeller 7 conclusions in this paper in order to investigate the effect of the sawtooth duct on hydrodynamic and noise performances of pumpjet propulsor pjp a normal pumpjet propulsor model npm and the sawtooth duct pumpjet propulsor model sdpm have been presented firstly the flow of pjp was simulated using rans method with sst k ω turbulence model then the underwater radiated noise of pjp is predicted based on the des simulation and fw h equations numerical simulations were carried out to analyze the effect of the sawtooth duct on the hydrodynamic performance flow field 3 d structure of vortices and noise performance the hydrodynamic coefficients of npm and sdpm at different working conditions are compared additionally the effects of sawtooth duct on the pressure field velocity field and tke of pjp are discussed furthermore the instantaneous vortex structures was analysed finally the underwater radiated noise predictions at receivers of npm and sdpm were carried out the numerical results revealed that 1 the sawtooth duct results in water efficiency loss at j 1 45 2 18 but improves the open water efficiency at j 2 18 2 54 the maximum water efficiency has been reduced about 2 by sawtooth duct 2 there is a pair of counter rotating vortexes in every one of sawtooth channels and the vortexes are formed in the root of sawtooth and develop following two sides of sawtooth surfaces along the streamwise direction additionally it promotes the dissipation of tke in the wake region leading to significantly reduction of mean tke value at the most of the wake region of sdpm with maximum reduction about 38 though increasing it at the little region behind the duct 3 the pjp s wake vortex system is comprised of impact separation vortices hub vortex and duct induced vortices the sawtooth duct induced vortexes which show as the shape of sawtooth are more finely broken than npm promoting the energy redistribution in the wake flow fields leading to the rapid breaking down of impact separation vortices 4 benefiting from the sawtooth duct the noise levels of pjp are reduced over almost the entire frequency range 10 5000 hz at all the studied work condition though slightly increase it at 700 1000 hz due to the sawtooth duct induced vortexes shedding frequency specifically the noise level is reduced about 5 db in low frequency range below 1000 hz significantly when j 1 90 the design point of pjp the overall spl reduction of sdpm varies from 2 5 db to 4 88 db with the maximum value 4 88 db consequently a propeller noise reduction technology using sawtooth duct is proposed and applied for the first time to pjp this technology is very easy to apply to pumpjet propeller it only adds the sawtooth in the trailing edge of duct without changing the geometry of propeller and the basic shape of duct therefore this technology has small impact on the weight of propeller most importantly this technology has excellent noise reduction at low frequencies which has been known to propagate over long distances since low frequency sound experiences little attenuation generally speaking the sawtooth duct is an effective mean to reduce underwater radiated noise of pjp with minimal impact on the geometry operability weight cost and hydrodynamic

22533,marine environmental protection committee mepc and other organizations have made calls to develop regulations for limiting noise levels at sea the propeller noise plays an important role in underwater radiated noise pumpjet propulsor pjp as a new type of propulsion system is widely used in underwater vehicles a propeller noise reduction technology using sawtooth duct is proposed and applied for the first time to pjp in this paper a normal pjp model and a pjp model with the sawtooth duct are presented to investigate effects of the sawtooth duct on hydrodynamic and noise performances flow of the models is simulated using a commercial cfd software and noise is predicted based on des simulation and fw h equation results show that the sawtooth duct results in 2 of maximum water efficiency loss the sawtooth duct directly changes the morphology of wake vortices and reduce the tke value at most of the wake region of pjp furthermore the sawtooth duct can significantly reduce the noise generated by pjp from 10hz to 5000hz especially in the low frequency below 1000 hz the overall spl of pjp is reduced about 2 5 5 db by sawtooth duct with the maximum reduction 4 88 db at the design point keywords pumpjet propulsor the underwater radiated noise the sawtooth duct ffowes williams and hawkings model 1 introduction over the past few decades due to the rapid increase in the number of vessels the sea ambient noise contributed by the commercial shipping fleet has increased by about 12 db hildebrand 2009 it is known that fish utilize sound as the main means when they navigate mate and communicate with others bass and mckibben 2003 also marine mammals mainly use sound for underwater communication and sensing wartzok and ketten 1999 the underwater radiated noise urn from commercial shipping may overlap their communication frequency band which will severely affect the fundamental living activities of marine life hildebrand in order to ensure sustainable shipping more and more international organizations such as international maritime organization imo and marine environmental protection committee mepc have made calls to develop regulations about the urn from commercial shipping to limit the noise level at sea mepc 60th session agenda item 18 the underwater noise of ships can be divided into three main classes 1 hydrodynamic noise 2 machinery noise 3 propeller noise defined by the specialist committee on hydrodynamic noise amongst the three classes propeller noise usually dominates the urn of ships ross 2013 with the development of technology the hydrodynamic noise and machinery noise of ships becoming less and less by the use of various methods the propeller noise is becoming one of the main traceable signals of noise radiated by ships for naval ships and submarines the smaller radiated noise the less likely that the possibility of being detected by sonar therefore the propeller noise determines the detectability and survivability of the ship özden et al 2016 consequently noise prediction and noise reduction technology for propeller has always been an important topic for naval ships pumpjet propulsor pjp as a new underwater propulsion system is typically composed of the rotor the stator and the duct the pjp usually has a great balance of the rotating moment due to the existence of the stator blades pan et al 2013 suryanarayana et al 2010a therefore pjp is widely used in submarines such as the american sea wolf class submarine british vanguard class submarine and other unmanned underwater vehicles uuv at present researches of pumpjet propulsor mainly concentrate on the experiment and numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic performance ch suryanarayana et al 2010b conducted an experiment on hydrodynamic performance of the underwater vehicle equipped with a pumpjet propulsor stefan ivanell ivanell studied the hydrodynamic performance of the torpedo with a pump jet using computational fluid dynamics cfd method pan guang et al pan et al 2013 carried out the numerical calculation of one vehicle equipped with a pump jet propulsor lin lu et al 2016 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a pumpjet propulsor using cfd method qin et al 2018 presented the influence of tip clearances on pjp hydrodynamic performance based on cfd method for underwater radiated noise predictions the acoustic analogy based on the ffowcs williams and hawkings fwh equation williams and hawkings 1969 is one of the most widely used approaches the noise source information is usually obtained from cfd results such as detached eddy simulation des or large eddy simulation les due to the increased computational power this method is becoming available for marine propellers varney et al varney and martino proposed that adding a perforated wear liner inside the rotor housing can alter the spectrum of noise produced by the pump jet in addition bagheri et al 2015 studied the noise trend of marine propellers fwh equation is used to predict the noise of a propeller under non cavitating and cavitating conditions sai et al sai et al 2017 proposed a semi empirical modulation model based on a generalized acoustic analogy theory to predict counter rotation propeller non cavitation noise özden et al 2016 investigated the noise of the insean e1619 propeller at different operational conditions also the noise results of propeller in open water and behind the darpa suboff submarine are compared in general most papers focus on the underwater noise of the single propeller or counter rotation propeller and there are few publications about the noise of pumpjet propulsor therefore more attention can be paid to the study of pumpjet propulsor noise the flight of most of the owl species is not audible to their prey the silent fly of owl has always been a source of inspiration for scientist to find solutions for quieter machinery the theoretical and experimental researches on mechanisms of the nearly silent flight owls were carried out by lots of researchers in past decades sarradj et al 2011 the noise reduction mechanisms for the special morphological features of owl wing had been studied and are used for airfoils resulting in sawtooth howe 1998 or serrated trailing edges howe 1991 airfoils subsequently the sawtooth trailing edge technology was applied to the aero engine exhaust nozzle called chevron exhaust nozzles which was proved to be an effective way to reduce jet noise and was widely used in the aviation industry since 1996 ge general electric company and nasa had been exploring and investigating it for noise reduction and have achieved good results this drew more attention to the sawtooth trailing edge in order to reduce jet noise of airplane exhaust systems ge martens developed the chevron nozzle it was found that the sawtooth trailing edge technology can achieve the 2 3 epn effective perceived noise db noise reduction callender callender et al 2005 carried out the far field noise test of chevron nozzles in the university of cincinnati nozzle acoustic test facility ucnatf the results show that the overall sound pressure level oaspl is reduced from 3 to 6 db the sawtooth trailing edge nozzle which developed jointly between ge aircraft engines and nasa has proven to be an effective and efficient means to reduce jet noise with minimal impact on engine performance operability weight and cost for some aircraft systems martens hence it is widely used in the aviation field but to authors best knowledge it has not been used for reducing noise of the underwater propeller however given the similar geometry and flow between the pumpjet propeller and the aircraft engine jet nozzle it is worth exploring whether the sawtooth duct can have the same noise reduction on the pjp in this paper effects of the sawtooth duct on hydrodynamic and noise performances of pjp is studied the goal of this paper is 1 assessing the applicability of des with fw h equation in predicting the underwater radiated noise of propeller 2 investigating the effect of the sawtooth duct on the flow of pjp 3 comparing the difference for wake vortices structures of normal pjp and the sawtooth duct pjp 4 quantitatively evaluating the noise reduction of the sawtooth duct on pjp at different working conditions the structure of this article is as follow the background is introduced in section 1 section 2 gives the numerical methodology in section 3 the flow and noise simulation methods are validated section 4 shows the geometry the numerical set up and the grid independence test the effects of sawtooth duct on the hydrodynamic coefficients of pjp are discussed in section 5 also the structures and evolution of pjp wake vortices are compared moreover section 6 quantitatively evaluates the noise reduction by using sawtooth duct finally the conclusions are summarized in section 7 2 methodology the governing equations of incompressible and single phase fluid flow are reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations as follows 1 ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i x j ρ u i u j s j where ρ is the fluid density t is the

viscosity s j denotes the generalised source term for the momentum equation firstly the steady flow of pjp is simulated based on the rans with shear stress transport sst k ω model to study the hydrodynamic performance menter 1994 the superior performance of this model has been discussed in a large number of papers huang et al 1104 ji et al 2010 hence the sst k ω turbulence model is applied in this paper for the numerical simulation of propeller no further elaboration of the model will be made here secondly based on the steady flow the des simulation of pjp is carried out and then time dependent flow data is used to predict the underwater radiated noise of pjp based on the fwh equation the des model combines both rans and les the des method based on the spalart allmaras model spalart and allmaras 1992 is shown as below the eddy viscosity ν t is defined as follow 3 ν t ν f ν 1 4 f ν 1 χ 3 χ 3 c ν 1 3 5 χ ν ν where the subscript ν stands for viscous c ν 1 3 equals to a

seen in spalart et al spalart and allmaras 1992 finally the noise is predicted based on fwh equation which is shown as follow 7 1 c 0 2 2 p t 2 2 p t ρ 0 v n ρ u n v n δ f x i p i j n j ρ u i u n v n

diameter ratio p d 1 0 inside the duct 19a baltazar et al 2018 the diameter of propeller is 200 mm and the tip clearance between blades and duct is uniform and equal to 0 8 mm the computational domain of duct propeller see fig 1 is a cylinder with 5d diameter extending from 3d to 7d in the streamwise direction structural mesh is used here specifically the first boundary layer height around the walls is 0 001 mm which ensures the y value of walls is less than 1 and the growth rate is 1 05 details of the blades mesh are illustrated in zoom in view in fig 1 the total number of cells of this mesh is about 8 million the advance ratio j is j u n d h where u is the free stream velocity n is the rotor blade rotating speed r s and d h is the diameter of the propeller ρ f is the density of fluid the propeller thrust coefficient is k t thrust ρ f n 2 d h 4 and the torque coefficient is k q torque ρ f n 2 d h 5 the relative errors δ k t and δ k q are defined as below 9 δ k t k t c f d k t e x p k t e x p 100 10 δ k q k q c f d k q c f d k q c f d 100 in the des simulation of duct propeller the boundary of inlet is velocity inlet with u 2 57 m s and the boundary of outlet is pressure outlet with an average relative static pressure 1 mpa the rotating speed is changed in different work conditions in addition simplec algorithm is used and the pressure and momentum terms are discretized by second order scheme the time term is discretized using the bounded 2nd order implicit time discretization and the time iteration step is set as 1 x 10 4 s the hydrodynamic results are the mean value of the des results for the last 20 rotation period the numerical simulation results of hydrodynamic coefficient are compared with the experimental data baltazar et al 2018 see table 1 as shown all the relative errors of the thrust and torque coefficient are always less than 2 with maximum relative error δ k t 1 58 at j 0 5 so the numerical simulation results have a good agreement with the experimental data and the numerical simulation method with the des turbulence model is applicable and reliable for the propeller flow simulation 3 2 noise prediction methodology validation after conducting des simulations the fw h equation is used for acoustic prediction of propeller as for choosing of the noise contribution sources for propeller noise prediction ozden et al özden et al 2016 carried out a study for a navy propeller firstly the surface of blades and hub were set as the sound sources as a contrast a rotating domain was created around the propeller where the outer surface porous surface of this domain was employed as the noise source surface compared with the noise results using the blades and hub surface as source surface the results using the porous surface made it possible to include nonlinear terms and showed better noise prediction values also sandro ianniello et al ianniello and de bernardis 2015 carried out the research about the potential of the acoustic analogy in the analysis of the underwater noise generated by a marine propeller results show that a reliable hydroacoustic analysis of a marine propeller seems to require the computation of the fwh equation s nonlinear quadrupole sources and the noise contribution due to the nonlinear sources can be assessed through the porous formulation by using the outer surface of a rotating domain so for the noise prediction of pjp the outer surface of domain around pjp is defined as the noise source surface due to that there is no experimental noise data of the propeller ka4 70 with the 19a duct the noise prediction methodology is validated using another benchmark case and the noise results are compared with the experimental data jacob et al 2005 carried out one noise test of rod airfoil at école centrale de lyon ecl this experiment is now considered as a canonical benchmark for air noise prediction a naca0012 airfoil of chord c 0 1 m is placed downstream of a cylindrical rod with a diameter of d 0 01 m the spanwise length of the airfoil is 0 3m the incoming velocity u 0 72 m s the noise is tested through two bruel kjaer 4191 microphones and bruel kjaer 2669 preamplifier the noise receiver is located in the middle plane of the airfoil and the radius is 1 85m the numerical verification is carried out based on the experiment of jacob and the models are in the same with the experiment taking into account the relatively large amount of calculation the computational spanwise length of rod airfoil is l s i m 3 5 d 0 035 m the computational domain and boundary conditions are shown in fig 2 the computational domain extends from 6c to 7c in the streamwise direction and from 3c to 3c in the crosswise direction the total computational domain is divided into two domains near field domain and far field domain the mesh of near field domain is obviously encrypted to better simulate the flow and turbulent eddy structures around rob and airfoil the domain size is shown in fig 3 which is determined by making reference to the research of jean christophe giret giret et al 2012 the outer surface of near field domain is selected as the sound source see the red line in fig 3 this sound source choosing is applied in order to be consistent with the choosing of the noise source surface of the pumpjet propeller noise prediction fig 3 shows the grid of the center plane there are 181 nodes along the cylinder and 281 nodes on the airfoil the initial wall spacing is 0 001 mm which ensures the y value on the walls is less than 1 and the growth rate is 1 05 the zoom in view shows the boundary layer grid of the cylinder the airfoil and the local encrypted mesh nearby the total number of grids is about 2 85 million the des simulation is carried out the boundary conditions of calculation are set as same as the experiment the time step is δ t 2 5 e 6 and the 10000 time steps cfd results are sampled the receiver is located same as the microphone in the experiment based on the spl results in fig 4 the noise results agree well with the experimental value of jacob jacob et al 2005 the tonal peak can be obviously seen in f 1375 6 h z s t 0 19 which is caused by the impingement of large vortices on the leading edge of airfoil consequently it is concluded that the numerical approach using des and fw h is reliable for the application considered in this paper 4 numerical set up 4 1 geometry model the pumpjet propulsor geometry 3d model in this study is shown in fig 5 a the propeller has 11 rotor blades and 9 stator blades the rotor is in front of the stator and the rotors rotate clockwise seen from the front of the model the diameter of pumpjet propulsor is d 0 26 m and the length of original duct is l 0 0 17 m the design point of pjp is in the case the rotational speed of rotor blade n 3200 rpm and inflow velocity 25 72 m s j 1 90 an o x y z cartesian coordinate system is built the origin o is located at the center of the propeller and the positive direction of the z axis coincides with the inflow direction the direction of x and y axes are defined by the right hand rule inspired by the sawtooth nozzle the sawtooth duct is used for pumpjet propulsor fig 5 b as shown fig 6 a the sawtooth is attached to the trailing edge of original duct fig 6 b shows the sawtooth size the length of sawtooth is l s 0 025 m and the angel of sawtooth is β 70 the number of teeth of the sawtooth duct is n 18 to simulate real flow of propeller one half ellipsoid type flow guide cap has been added in the front of the propulsor model the total length of pjp with sawtooth duct after adding flow guide cap is l 0 4 m two abbreviations npm the normal pumpjet propulsor model and sdpm the sawtooth duct pumpjet propulsor model are used for clarifying the geometries of rotor and stator blades are all the same for both models 4 2 computational domain and mesh fig 7 shows the computational domain of pjp and boundary conditions setting the computational domain is a cylinder with 5d diameter extending from 3l to 7l in the streamwise direction the total computational domain is divided into four parts the rotor domain the stator domain the noise domain and the external domain the rotor domain is rotating domain and the other three domains are stationary the contacting surfaces among those domains are set as the interface to exchange flow information in order to get accurate acoustic results a mesh refine domain around the propeller called noise domain is created this domain is a cylinder with 1 5d diameter and 4d length whose rotating axis aligns with the symmetry axis of propulsor the outer wall of this domain is selected as the noise source the structured grid is favorable for the boundary layer simulation therefore the structured grids are used in this research fig 8 shows the mesh of npm in longitudinal section specifically the grids of rotating domain stator domain and noise domain are denser than that in the far field also the meshes of blades and duct for npm and sdpm are shown in fig 9 for both models the meshes of rotor and stator blades are identical and only the mesh of duct and hub of sdpm is different from npm for sdpm the grid of duct consists of 18 rotational copies of a sawtooth channel mesh additionally the rotor and stator blades are surrounded by o grids see the zoom in view which ensures a good boundary layer near the walls furthermore to accurately capture the formation and evolution of small vortices using as few grids as possible the meshes in the region of rotor tip downstream of duct and hub wake are refined see the rectangular box in fig 8 those mesh refined regions are determined and re changed based on the vortex distribution area of preliminary flow field the y value of the walls is less than 1 the total number of cells for npm is approximate 12 000 000 while the number of cells for sdpm corresponds to 14 000 000 4 3 boundary condition for boundary conditions setting the inlet is set as velocity inlet with normal speed v 25 72 m s while the rotational speed is adjusted with range of 2400 4200 revolutions per minute rpm to alter the physics conditions the turbulence intensity is 5 as the default the averaged static pressure of outlet is set as 10 mpa the flow of pjp is solved by ansys fluent version 15 ansys inc based on finite volume method solver in the des simulation the simplec algorithm is used and the pressure and momentum terms of equations are discretized by the second order scheme specifically the time term is discretized using the bounded 2nd order implicit time discretization the courant friedrichslewy cfl number is defined as c f l δ t u δ m i n where u is the local velocity and δ m i n m i n δ x δ y δ z the time step setting should satisfy that c f l 1 in case n 3200 rpm the time iteration step is set as 5 10 5 the time required for a 1 of rotor blade rotation 4 4 grid independence validation in order to facilitate the discussion the non dimensional physical quantities are defined as shown in table 2 in the table v is the far field flow velocity n denotes the rotor speed r s d is the diameter of the propulsor ρ is the fluid density t t denotes the thrust of rotor t s is the thrust of stator and duct m t denotes the torque of rotor and m s is the torque of stator and duct in this section mesh independence validation is conducted based on the two grid assessment procedure proposed by roache 1997 two different meshes of npm coarse and fine meshes are generated for both meshes the geometric dimensions and topological structures are maintained as identical and the only difference is the mesh size setting for the coarse mesh the y value of the walls is about 1 while the y value of the walls for fine mesh is about 0 5 in addition the nodes number of blades and duct surfaces are refined with a factor 1 2 for fine mesh also the mesh in the vortex refinement region see fig 8 is refined to more accurately capture the development of propeller turbulence for the coarse mesh the maximum size of the vortex refinement regions δ m a x m a x δ x δ y δ z is 1 5 d while δ m a x 1 d for fine mesh the total cells number of coarse grid n c o a r s e corresponds to about 12 000 000 while the number of fine mesh n f i n e is about 24 000 000 the grid convergence index gci based on the theory of richardson extrapolation roache 1997 is used to report grid convergence tests a coarse grid richardson error is defined as 11 e c o a r s e r p ε 1 r p 12 ε f 2 f 1 13 r n f i n e n c o a r s e 1 d here f 1 and f 2 denote the torque and thrust coefficient of stator duct and rotor for coarse and fine meshes respectively p is the formal order of accuracy of the algorithm p 2 r is the refinement factor between the coarse and fine grid d is the dimensionality of the simulation the gci of coarse mesh is defined as 14 g c i c o a r s e f s e c o a r s e f s 1 is a safety factor based on the recommendation of roache 1997 f s 3 is used here the hydrodynamic coefficients of the fine and coarse meshes with different j are compared in table 3 the results are the mean value of the des results for the last 20 rotation period 7200 time steps the results indicate that the numerical results of both grids are similar the gcis of coarse mesh results are always less than 2 when j 1 52 1 79 and 2 54 and then in order to validate the grid independence for noise prediction the pressure fluctuations of one probing point p1 it will be described in fig 25 for coarse and fine meshes are compared in fig 10 as shown the pressure fluctuations of coarse mesh agree well with that of fine mesh in addition the period of pressure fluctuation is about 0 0017 s which is consistent with the blade passage period it s mean that the rotation periodicity of the rotor is well captured generally speaking the hydrodynamic coefficients and flow pressure fluctuation of coarse mesh agree well with that of fine mesh and the grid convergence test is great in addition for a typical case j 1 79 with a coarse mesh about 12 000 000 the computational time consuming 1 468 800 s approximately 17 days for 12 000 time steps using cpu inter r xeon r e5 2630 v4 2 2 ghz 20 processors for the fine grid computing will take more time so for the sake of reducing computing resources consumption the coarse mesh is more applicable in this research therefore the coarse grid is used in the subsequent analyses 5 flow results and discussion 5 1 results of the hydrodynamic performance of pjp the flow simulations of npm and sdpm with inlet velocity v 25 72 m s are carried out and the rotational speed n varies from 2400 rpm to 4200 rpm fig 11 shows the hydrodynamic coefficients and open water efficiency results for npm as shown the thrust and torque coefficients of the rotor and stator duct all decrease linearly with the increase of j also the torque coefficients of the rotor k m t is almost the same as the torque coefficients of stator duct k m s which shows that this propulsor is well designed and has a good torque performance additionally the thrust coefficient of rotor k t t is obviously greater than that of stator and duct system k t s in j 1 45 the stator duct provide about 20 of the total thrust but in work condition of maximum efficiency j 1 79 the rotor blades supply about 90 of total thrust of propulsor while the thrust of stator duct accounts for 10 of total thrust furthermore it should be noted that the thrust coefficient of the stator duct is negative when j 2 03 hence the stator duct provide about 10 20 thrust of propulsor at low j but changes from thrust to drag at high j conditions finally the open water efficiency firstly increases then decreases with the increase of j especially reaching peak value about 70 17 at j 1 79 in order to explore the effects of sawtooth duct on the hydrodynamic performance of pjp the open water efficiencies of npm and sdpm are compared in fig 12 in addition the hydrodynamic coefficients of both models are shown in table 4 k t t k t s k t k m t k m s and η are the thrust coefficient of rotor the thrust coefficient of stator duct the total thrust coefficient the torque coefficient of rotor the torque coefficient of stator duct and the open water efficiency of sdpm respectively while k t t k t s k t k m t k m s and η are the according physical quantities of npm δ k t is defined as k t k t k t also δ k t t δ k t s δ k m t δ k m s δ η are defined in the same way e g δ η η η η as shown in fig 12 the open water efficiency curve of sdpm also shows the same change law of npm which first increases and then decreases with the increasing of j however the η of sdpm is smaller than that of npm at j 1 45 2 18 but greater than that at j 2 18 2 54 the η of npm reaches its maximum 70 17 at j 1 79 but the η of sdpm has a peak about 68 03 at j 2 03 hence it means that the maximum water efficiency has been reduced about 2 by sawtooth duct in contrast the sawtooth duct improves the η of pjp at high j range about 3 4 at j 2 54 as shown in table 4 the relative error of total thrust δ k t varies form 3 69 to 0 7 in the case j from 1 45 to 2 18 moreover δ k t corresponds to 4 46 which resulting to the open water efficiency improvement about 3 39 at j 2 54 specifically the torque coefficient relative error of stator duct δ k t s is obviously bigger than δ k t t similarly the δ k m s is relatively bigger than δ k m t at most cases this means that the sawtooth duct is mainly affect the flow of stator duct domain rather than rotor domain and leads to the thrust and torque change of propulsor consequently the sawtooth duct results in water efficiency loss at j 1 45 2 18 but improves the open water efficiency at j 2 18 2 54 the maximum water efficiency has been reduced about 2 by sawtooth duct the sawtooth duct mainly affects the thrust and torque of stator duct resulting in the efficiency change 5 2 the effects of sawtooth duct on the flow of pjp to analysis the effects of sawtooth duct on the flow of pjp the steady rans flow results of npm and sdpm are contrasted in the case j 1 90 which is the design point of pjp fig 13 a and b visualize the pressure contours of hub and blades of npm contrast to sdpm respectively and fig 13 c and d show the duct pressure contours of npm and sdpm as shown the pressure contours of blades of npm are almost the same as those of sdpm however the pressure distributions in the inside and outside surface of sawtooth duct are obviously different with the duct of npm see zoom in view in fig 13 c and d there is a circle low pressure zone in the inner surface of duct trailing edge for npm but low pressure area appears in the root of sawtooth for sdpm the sawtooth completely changes the flow around the trailing edge of duct while has relatively little effect on the pressure distributions of rotor and stator blades the 3d streamlines around the normal duct and one sawtooth channel are illustrated in fig 14 as shown for npm the flow is sucked from the outer surface of duct to the duct trailing edge a circle of vortex called duct induced vortex is formed behind the duct trailing edge as for sdpm due to the pressure difference of side surfaces and top bottom surfaces the flow is sucked into the sawtooth channel from the top bottom surface of duct and a pair of vortexes is generated in every sawtooth channel furthermore the effect of sawtooth on the velocity field is discussed fig 15 shows the zoom in overviews of tangential and axial velocity component velocity contours around duct for npm left and sdpm right respectively there appear two low velocity zones near the root in every sawtooth channel for sdpm see in fig 15 d in contrast to a circular low velocity zone behind the trailing edge of duct for npm fig 15 c additionally it is clearly observed that the tangential velocity components of the two vortexes are opposite the red zone and the blue zone in fig 15 b therefore there is a pair of counter rotating vortexes in every sawtooth channel and the two vortexes are formed in the root of sawtooth and develop following two side surfaces of sawtooth along the streamwise direction to further study the effect of sawtooth on the wake flow of pjp the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy tke of npm and sdpm are discussed fig 16 has visualized the velocity magnitude contours of center plane for npm and sdpm respectively and fig 17 illustrates the turbulence kinetic energy tke contours of center plane for npm and sdpm respectively as shown in the fig 16 the velocity in the wake region of sdpm is nearly same with that of npm furthermore the axis velocity contours at six different z locations z l 0 45 0 5 0 75 1 2 5 for npm and sdpm are compared in fig 18 a firstly at z l 0 45 there are both 11 high velocity regions the red zones in the propulsor outflow which is caused by the high velocity flows from 11 rotor blade channels some areas are not obvious due to the effect of 9 stator blades while for sdpm there exists low velocity zone in every sawtooth channel due to the sawtooth vortexes discussed before similar features are also observed in contours at z l 0 5 and there is a petal shaped low velocity zone whose petal number is associated with sawtooth number n 18 in the wake region then from z l 0 75 to z l 2 the high velocity zone in the propulsor outflow is becoming more and more uniform for both models which means the propulsor outflow is gradually weakening however for npm the shape of outer boundary of high velocity propulsor outflow the red area in fig 18 a is changing from nearly round to petal shape which number is 9 which means the stator channel flows began to dominate the outflow in contrast for sdpm the shape of outflow outer boundary is always maintain as uniform circles and the axial velocity distribution of wake region is more uniform than that of npm the reason can be also found from fig 15 the tangential velocity of sawtooth wake region is obviously complex and there are more positive and negative regions than the npm see fig 15 a the pair of counter rotating vortexes in every sawtooth channel similar like fluid mixer strongly exchange the fluid of high velocity outflow with the surrounding fluid this results in that the shape of high velocity outflow outer boundary for sdpm is nearly circle in addition the high axis velocity fluid is mixed fully enough by the vortexes and so the distribution of axis velocity is more uniform for sdpm compared with npm see fig 15 d finally at z l 5 the axial velocity distributions of npm and sdpm are all uniform though the velocity of npm still is slightly affected by stator passage outflow moreover based on the results in figs 17 and 18 b there exist significant differences between the tke distributions of npm and sdpm as shown in fig 17 the high tke area in the wake region of sdpm is obviously less than that of npm which means that the sawtooth duct significantly reduces the tke in the most wake region of pjp the more detailed information of the tke reduction is shown in fig 18 b and the tke contours at six different z locations z l 0 45 0 5 0 75 1 2 5 of npm and sdpm are compared firstly at z l 0 45 the high tke region of npm is shown as a circle coinciding with the shape of circle duct this is due to the periodical duct shedding vortices in comparison there are 18 high tke regions in the channel of sawtooth for sdpm which is caused by the formed pair of counter rotating vortexes in every sawtooth channel then at z l 0 5 there are petal shaped high tke regions behind the sawtooth for sdpm this also resulting that the tke of sdpm in the area behind the duct is greater than npm the detail will be discussed in fig 19 additionally from z l 0 75 to z l 5 there is a circle of petal shaped high tke region for npm conversely the high tke region behind the duct for sdpm is circumferentially uniformly distributed and the magnitude is significantly less than npm the reason has been discussed before and it is caused by the formation and the development of sawtooth vortexes the pair of counter rotating vortexes in every sawtooth channel increases the contact area of low velocity surrounding flow and high velocity outflow and helps the mixing of them prompting the dissipation of tke in the wake region furthermore in order to quantitatively reveal the effect of sawtooth duct on the tke the mean tke values at different z locations for npm and sdpm are compared in fig 19 based on the results at the region behind the duct from z l 0 45 to 0 75 the mean tke value of sdpm the red curve is a little higher than that of npm black curve this is because of that the formation and development of sawtooth vortexes obviously increase the turbulent energy however at the most of the wake region from z l 0 75 5 the mean tke value of sdpm is significantly smaller than that of npm fig 17 b also clearly visualized the difference the maximum mean tke value reduction caused by sawtooth duct is about 38 at z l 2 5 3 the effects of sawtooth duct on the vortices structure of pjp with the aim of exploration of effects of sawtooth duct on the vertical structure of pjp the des simulations of npm and sdpm in the case j 1 90 are further analyzed and compared fig 20 a has visualized the local pressure contours at different streamwise locations in the rotor blade passage it is clearly observed that two low pressure zones first appear in the suction tip line the boundary line of suction surface and rotor tip surface and pressure tip line of rotor blade see zoom in view in fig 20 a this is also why the two tip vortexes tip separation vortex and tip leakage vortex see fig 20 b are formed the flow is sucked into the suction surface from the pressure side of rotor blades then by comparing the local pressure contours at different streamwise locations it is clearly observed that the low pressure zone resulting in tip leakage vortex is gradually moving towards the middle of the rotor passage along with the fluid flowing thus the tip leakage vortex is formed in the leading edge of rotor tip and develops gradually towards the middle of the rotor passage along the streamwise direction with respect to tip separation vortex it is also formed in same location but develops gradually following the boundary line of pressure surface and rotor tip surface furthermore it should be noted that those two vortexes will exchange fluid and some fluid is sucked to tip leakage vortex from tip separation vortex see fig 20 b detailed spatial structures of those vortices can be visualized in fig 21 the large amount of rotation energy in the tip vortex flow causes severe flow loss of propeller additionally the spatial structure of the instantaneous vortex in the rotor and stator domain of npm constructed by using q criterion is shown in fig 21 there are mainly rotor tip leakage vortexes propagating downstream with the fluid flowing due to the number of rotor and stator blades is different some rotor tip leakage vortexes flow directly into the stator channel called channel vortex and then hit the suction surface of the stator blade in addition other vortexes impact on the leading edge of stator blades directly called impact separation vortex and then broking into 2 strands of vortexes which mainly focus on the pressure side of stator blade see fig 21 finally those vortexes mainly impact separation vortex flow towards downstream direction of the propeller the spatial structures of the instantaneous vortex in the wake region of npm and sdpm are illustrated in fig 22 and fig 23 respectively as shown the fine vortex structures in the wake region are well captured for npm the wake vortexes are mainly composed by the impact separation vortex hub vortex and duct induced vortex as discussed before the duct induced vortex of npm is mainly periodical shedding small vortex groups with uniform circumferential distribution but for sdpm the duct induced vortex is shown as the shape of sawtooth according with the sawtooth number both duct induced vortexes gradually break down with the flow of fluid by contrast the figs 22 and 23 we can see that the sawtooth duct induced vortexes are more finely broken and the tke value is significantly smaller than normal duct induced vortexes additionally another big difference is the impact separation vortex for npm the impact separation vortexes sustain development until far away from the propeller but the impact separation vortexes of sdpm are quickly breaking down and almost disappear in the region far away from the pjp consequently the sawtooth channel has significantly changed the vortex structures of pjp wake region the vortexes in the sawtooth channel help the mixing of the high speed jet of propeller and surrounding flow and promoting dissipation of vortexes and the tke value of sdpm wake vortexes is remarkablely less than that of npm in order to explore the difference of instantaneous vortices between npm and sdpm quantitatively four probing points p1 p2 p3 p4 are chose and the spectral characteristics of the tke for those probing points are analyzed and compared the layout sketch of those probing points are shown in fig 24 p1 is in front of rotor blade and p2 is in the middle of the rotor blade and the stator blade p3 is behind of the stator blade p1 p2 and p3 are all located around the tip of blades which is aimed at exploring the evolution of the rotor tip vortices p4 is behind the trailing edge of duct for npm and in the middle of sawtooth passage for sdpm which is aimed at analyzing the spectrum characteristics of duct induced vortexes for both modes the 3 dimensional coordinates of those probing points is the same figs 25 27 show the power spectral density psd of kinetic energy for p1 p2 p3 p4 respectively the k is defined as k f f b p f and f b p f is the rotor blade passage frequency bpf for j 1 9 n 3200 rpm f b p f 586 67 h z as shown in fig 25 the peaks appear at the harmonics of f b p f k 1 2 3 it shows that the periodicity of rotor blades rotation is well simulated and the shedding frequency of rotor tip leakage vortexes are corresponding to the blade passage frequency for p1 and p2 the psd of npm and sdpm are similar in the low frequency range psd decreases with the increasing of frequency and the psd tends to stabilize in the high frequency range furthermore it should be noted that the kinetic energy psd magnitude of p2 is obviously higher than that of p1 which means that the kinetic energy fluctuation increases sharply in the area between the rotor and stator blades as discussed before the rotor tip leakage vortexes flow directly into the stator channel impacting on the leading edge of stator blades directly causing the increase of kinetic energy fluctuation however significant differences exist between the kinetic energy psd spectra of sdpm and npm for p3 and p4 as shown in figs 26 and 27 the psd characteristics of p3 and p4 show a few similarities for npm the peaks corresponding to bpf and its multiples are still clearly observed in the low frequency range but for sdpm significant peaks at k 1 2 3 are not observed while several other peaks are clear observed in the low frequency range for example k 1 4 see fig 27 in addition the psd magnitude of sdpm is significantly smaller than the signal level of npm in the middle to high frequency range as discussed before those differences are mainly caused by the duct induced vortex for npm the periodically shedding frequency of duct induced vortex is corresponding to the bpf and their harmonics see black line in fig 27 but for sdpm the duct induced vortex is shown as the shape of sawtooth according with the sawtooth number the formation and evolution of sawtooth duct induced vortexes have seriously impact the periodicity and spectrum characteristics in the flow field around the sawtooth it seem like the periodically shedding frequency of sdpm duct induced vortex is about 800hz k 1 4 in general the sawtooth has significantly change the kinetic energy psd spectrum characteristics in behind of the stator blade and the area around the sawtooth the kinetic energy psd of magnitude of sdpm is slightly lower than that of npm 6 underwater radiated noise results and discussion 6 1 the set up of noise calculation based on the des results the underwater radiated noises of npm and sdpm are predicted based on fw h equation the noise sampling time step is the same as flow time iteration step 5 10 5 s for the case n 3200 rpm 10000 time steps cfd results are sampled as discussed before results show that using porous surface around the propeller shows better noise prediction value compared with using the blades and hub in this study the pjp is placed inside a cylinder domain with 1 5d diameter and 4d length the outer wall of this domain is defined as the noise source see fig 28 as requested by ittc the sound pressure levels should be corrected to a standard measuring distance of 1 m in db and p r e f 1 μ p a hence four receivers are selected with 100d away from the propulsor center as shown in fig 28 and then underwater radiated noise results are corrected to 1 m as follow 15 s p l s p l 1 20 l o g r where s p l is the value at 1 m distance and s p l 1 is the spl in the receiver located r from the propeller center as r 100d in the study so in the following analyze the spl in db p r e f 1 μ p a 1 hz and 1 m is presented additionally to make the display of the difference between the noises of npm and sdpm more clearer some presentations of spl curves are using 1 3 octave band hanning filter is used 6 2 the noise results discussion the underwater radiated noise predictions at four receivers for npm and sdpm in the case j 1 52 1 90 and 2 18 are carried out fig 29 has visualized the spl results at varying receiver locations of npm compared to sdpm in the case j 1 90 n 3200 rpm in this case the shaft frequency sf is f h 3200 60 53 33 h z and the rotor blade passage frequency bpf is f b p f f h 11 586 67 h z the number of rotor blades is 11 a comparison of the spl curves of both models indicates that the noise of sdpm has the same noise spectrum characteristic as npm the noise frequency spectrums of both models are mainly composed by two parts the discrete tonal noise and the broadband noise the discrete tonal noise is clearly observed that the peaks appearing at the harmonics of sf and bpf see fig 29 the first obvious peak is located at about f 160hz 3 f h which shows that the influence of hub rotating frequency on noise spectrum of propeller the high peak at 2 f h can also be observed but reduces in the amplitude the peak at f h is not so prominent maybe because of the resolution of noise signal is not high enough furthermore the second obvious peak appears at about f 585hz at about 1 bpf also the clear peaks can also be observed in multiples bpf coinciding with n b p f n 2 3 4 5 but reduced in the amplitude furthermore it should be noted that the spl of broadband noise gradually undergoes intense attenuation at high frequency range of 700 5000 hz significantly by contrast the spl of sdpm the red line to that of npm the black line it is clearly observed that the noise level of sdpm is almost less than the level of npm throughout the entire frequency range 10 5000 hz a more clear differences are illustrated in fig 30 in which the spl is graphically presented in 1 3 octave band in low frequency range 10 700 hz the noise reduction of sdpm is significantly obvious with about 5 db for all the receivers at j 1 90 the maximum noise reduction of sdpm is about 10 db at f about 60 hz as shown in figs 22 and 23 it is easy to understand why the noise is reduced the duct induced vortexes of sdpm help the mixing of the high speed jet of propeller and surrounding flow and promote the dissipation of wake vortexes the large eddies of sdpm break up into small eddies faster than npm benefitting from the sawtooth the vortex intensity and turbulent energy in the wake region of sdpm are remarkablely less than that of npm therefore the spl of sdpm is obviously smaller than npm in low frequency range in addition at high frequency range the spl of sdpm is only slightly less than that of npm or even a little higher than spl of npm at frequency range 700 1000 hz see fig 30 c it should be noted that the peak at 1 bpf of sdpm is shifting to about 800 hz which also can be observed in fig 29 c as discussed before there are a counter rotating vortexes in every sawtooth channel which resulting the sawtooth duct induced vortices the periodically shedding frequency of sdpm duct induced vortex is about 800hz k 1 4 the frequency shifting is caused by the periodic shedding of sawtooth duct induced vortices furthermore the spl curves of receivers for npm and sdpm with different rotation speeds are shown in fig 31 based on the results the noise results at 3 different working conditions n 2800 3200 4000 rpm at receiver 1 and 3 are compared it is clearly observed that for both models the spl curve of n 4000 rpm with red color is obviously greater than the curve of n 3200 rpm with blue color throughout the frequency range also the same features are also observed in spl of n 3200 rpm compared to that of 2800 rpm though the noise level of high n is a little lower than spl of lower n case at some low frequency range see fig 31 b hence the spl of both models basically show the same variation tendency which increases with the increase of rotor rotation speed moreover the underwater radiated noise predictions of receivers for npm and sdpm in the case j 1 52 and 2 18 are illustrated in fig 32 and fig 33 at j 1 52 the spl of all the four receivers of sdpm are still less than the noise level of npm but the noise reduction is so obvious in contrast to the case j 1 90 also the same frequency shifting at 1 bpf is observed with respect to j 2 18 the noise level of sdpm at high frequency 1000 5000 hz is similar with that of npm or even a little bigger than that of npm see fig 33 d however the noise reduction of sdpm can still be obvious observed at low frequency in addition the overall sound pressure level oaspl results of receivers for npm and sdpm are listed in table 5 at j 1 90 the noise reduction of sdpm is the most great with the maximum noise reduction 4 88 db at receiver 2 as to j 1 52 the spl of sdpm is also less than spl of npm with the maximum noise reduction 3 43 db at receiver 2 while the noise reduction of sdpm at j 2 18 is the smallest with only 1 44 db at receiver 1 furthermore it should be noted that at all the studied work conditions the noise reductions at receiver 1 and 2 in the front and behind of the propeller are greater than receiver 3 and 4 in the circumference of the propeller also the same differences can be seen at figs 30 figs 32 and 33 so the sawtooth has a better noise effect at the axial direction than the circumference direction of propeller 7 conclusions in this paper in order to investigate the effect of the sawtooth duct on hydrodynamic and noise performances of pumpjet propulsor pjp a normal pumpjet propulsor model npm and the sawtooth duct pumpjet propulsor model sdpm have been presented firstly the flow of pjp was simulated using rans method with sst k ω turbulence model then the underwater radiated noise of pjp is predicted based on the des simulation and fw h equations numerical simulations were carried out to analyze the effect of the sawtooth duct on the hydrodynamic performance flow field 3 d structure of vortices and noise performance the hydrodynamic coefficients of npm and sdpm at different working conditions are compared additionally the effects of sawtooth duct on the pressure field velocity field and tke of pjp are discussed furthermore the instantaneous vortex structures was analysed finally the underwater radiated noise predictions at receivers of npm and sdpm were carried out the numerical results revealed that 1 the sawtooth duct results in water efficiency loss at j 1 45 2 18 but improves the open water efficiency at j 2 18 2 54 the maximum water efficiency has been reduced about 2 by sawtooth duct 2 there is a pair of counter rotating vortexes in every one of sawtooth channels and the vortexes are formed in the root of sawtooth and develop following two sides of sawtooth surfaces along the streamwise direction additionally it promotes the dissipation of tke in the wake region leading to significantly reduction of mean tke value at the most of the wake region of sdpm with maximum reduction about 38 though increasing it at the little region behind the duct 3 the pjp s wake vortex system is comprised of impact separation vortices hub vortex and duct induced vortices the sawtooth duct induced vortexes which show as the shape of sawtooth are more finely broken than npm promoting the energy redistribution in the wake flow fields leading to the rapid breaking down of impact separation vortices 4 benefiting from the sawtooth duct the noise levels of pjp are reduced over almost the entire frequency range 10 5000 hz at all the studied work condition though slightly increase it at 700 1000 hz due to the sawtooth duct induced vortexes shedding frequency specifically the noise level is reduced about 5 db in low frequency range below 1000 hz significantly when j 1 90 the design point of pjp the overall spl reduction of sdpm varies from 2 5 db to 4 88 db with the maximum value 4 88 db consequently a propeller noise reduction technology using sawtooth duct is proposed and applied for the first time to pjp this technology is very easy to apply to pumpjet propeller it only adds the sawtooth in the trailing edge of duct without changing the geometry of propeller and the basic shape of duct therefore this technology has small impact on the weight of propeller most importantly this technology has excellent noise reduction at low frequencies which has been known to propagate over long distances since low frequency sound experiences little attenuation generally speaking the sawtooth duct is an effective mean to reduce underwater radiated noise of pjp with minimal impact on the geometry operability weight cost and hydrodynamic

22534,fishing is an energy intensive economic activity research in several fields is conducted to improve the energy and environmental profile of fishing vessels as regards the technical measures the assessment of benefits is often hampered by boundary conditions that are difficult to quantify and side effects that are difficult to unravel this study examined the impact of a fluoropolymer based fouling release paint on the fuel consumption rate of a mediterranean bottom trawler the analysis of a series of sea trial campaigns allowed for a quantitative and qualitative comparison of fuel consumption rate during the regular fishing activities comparing the fuel consumption rate before and after the application of the fluoropolymer based foul release coating a reduction in fuel consumption rate was observed and quantified other advantages are discussed in this paper regarding the reduction of ghg emission and the more environmental friendly approach using biocide free and non banned products keywords energy efficiency fisheries fuel saving marine propulsion plant foul release coating 1 introduction fishing is one of the oldest human activities vital to support human feeding however it is an energy intensive economic activity ship energy efficiency and related fuel consumption need to be carefully considered to assess the effectiveness of fishing activities several strategies can be adopted to improve energy efficiency on both new and existing vessels the optimization of hull geometry can lead to significant improvement in hydrodynamic performances lin et al 2018 and consequent drag reduction during normal ship operations propulsion line components such as propulsion engine gearbox and propeller play a fundamental role in energy efficiency therefore during the propulsion plant design it would be appropriate to choose those components which will provide the most efficient working condition for a large part of the ship working hours in the case of existing vessels energy efficiency could be improved by replacing one or more propulsion plant components with a more efficient one i e a new engine with low emissions and specific fuel consumption optimized propeller etc or using diesel electric propulsion hansen and wendt 2015 especially in cases where the vessels have different operational profiles the authors in previous works studied the possible benefits of the replacement of fixed pitch propellers with controllable pitch or ducted propellers the latter device being suitable for heavy load scenarios such as applications on trawlers where high thrust is needed at low vessel speed altosole et al 2012 martelli et al 2014 notti and sala 2014 however these solutions result not easy to be applied to be implemented on existing vessels due to technical and economic limitations moreover no major improvement in the hull shape can be considered as potential approach to reduce energy demand of the vessel martelli et al 2017 an important strategy for an existing vessel to save energy is to maintain a high level of efficiency the energy users the presence of fouling on the hull increases the ship resistance that results in a significant increase in fuel consumption and running costs for trawlers most of the hull fouling includes marine organisms such as weeds and barnacles indeed bacteria begin to accumulate on the submerged portion of the hull within a few hours of treatment with standard antifouling products it is noteworthy that biofouling is more detrimental than hull roughness which is formed by surface irregularities like welding seams and paints remains hua et al 2018 khor and xiao 2011 however the effect of biofouling in its early biofilm stage or slime is largely missed or neglected a fairly recent study of towing trials revealed about 5 increase in hull resistance over 40 days tupper 2013 in the early stage slime is hardly visible yet light slime has been demonstrated to increase fuel consumption by 8 or more whereas heavy slime can result in increases that exceed 18 kane 2012 the application of antifouling coatings can be considered another potential strategy for an existing vessel to reduce energy demand two hull surface treatments are used to bound the adverse effects of fouling antifouling and foul release coatings a comprehensive and critical analysis of the difference between the two types of coatings is reported in buskens et al 2013 in every case periodic cleaning and inspection of the hull are required and the frequency and costs are related to the growing capacity of the fouling antifouling coating helps to prevent the adherence of marine organisms and limit the biofilm growing by inhibiting biological processes the biocides in the antifouling coatings contain toxic components such as mercury lead or copper which leach out into the water to prevent the adherence of the marine organisms despite some of the components being prohibited for environmental reasons such products are still adopted contrary to antifouling coating the foul release technology does not rely on biocides to prevent biofouling but on the non stick principle that was discovered in the early 80 griffith 1980 foul release paints avoid the growth of fouling organisms by providing a low friction ultra smooth surface even if settling of organic material eventually occurs there is only a weak bonding between the foulants and the surface itself such that the organisms can easily be removed by either underwater cleaning or by the hydrodynamic shear forces due to the hull advance speed candries et al 2000 most modern foul release paints are based on silicone stein et al 2003 however newly developed fluoropolymer based coatings provide significant improvements with respect to the best silicone based products especially at slow speed selim et al 2016a 2016b although foul release technology is well explored in open literature in terms of environmental benefits or the chemical composition of the coating little information is available on the effects over time of coatings applied to hulls evaluated through direct measurements this paper reports on the evaluation of the impact of a foul release hull coating on the fuel consumption rate of a mediterranean fishing trawler the experiment herein described is part of a more comprehensive research activity to provide to fisheries operators a quantitative evaluation of selected technologies for reducing energy consumption the foul release technology was included in this research because at that time it was used by few italian trawlers and the interest for such technology led ship owners to approach research institutions for technical support on the evaluation of effective benefits of these coatings the study aims to enrich the technical and scientific knowledge in the field of energy efficiency improvements in fisheries several experimental campaigns on a mediterranean fishing trawler were conducted before and after the application of the foul release coating with direct measurement of vessel speed and fuel consumption the paper is organized as follows the materials and methods

1 case study vessel the case study vessel is representative of the mediterranean bottom trawl fleet in terms of size fishing technique and propulsion power bottom trawlers similar in size and performance to the case study vessel are commonly used for official surveys for the assessment of the status of the demersal stocks of biomass fiorentini et al 1999 the technical specifications of the case study vessel are reported in table 1 the prevailing operating conditions of a bottom trawler are cruising and trawling the vessel cruises at high speed from the harbor to the fishing grounds or from one fishing ground to another whereas trawling is performed at low speed generally less than half the cruising speed both phases are characterized by a high fuel consumption rate since cruising involves high speed whereas during trawling the main engine must provide almost the full power to overtake the added resistance of the fishing gear the activities between trawling and cruising or between two consecutive trawling phases i e maneuvering hauling and shooting the net and mooring usually require a negligible amount of fuel lucchetti et al 2016 in the mediterranean sea fishing is commonly conducted from monday to thursday for 11 months in a year the trawler returns ashore to land the catches every 24 h when it leaves the port the vessel sails up to 2 h before the starting of the trawling phase typically the technical specifications of fishing gear used are maintained for very long periods usually between july and august the fishing activity is suspended i e seasonal closure for biological purposes the shipowner exploits this time for the maintenance of the hull by cleaning and applying a new coating layer 2 2 foul release coating the foul release coating tested in this study is a patented fluoropolymer based hydrophobic paint based on technical reports from manufacturers the polymer can prevent interactions between the surface and organic matter drastically reducing the persistence of fouling it is particularly useful with slime even if some slime can form on the hull while the vessel is in port it is rapidly removed as the ship increases the velocity the self cleaning effect is achieved even at low speed furthermore the paint is entirely eco friendly and does not use biocides or toxic components either in the production process or as components according to the technical specifications provided by the manufacturer the application of the foul release coating is subjected to a 5 year warranty that can be extended to other 5 years after a technical inspection from the manufacturer concerning the status of the hull 2 3 monitoring system of fuel consumption and vessel speed the bottom trawler involved in the experiment was equipped since 2010 with a permanent data collection system two mass flow meters were mounted in the fuel inlet f t i n and outlet pipeline f t o u t respectively accuracy 0 25 the data from the two sensors were recorded every second by a multichannel recorder which then calculated fuel consumption f c as the difference between f t i n and f t o u t the fuel flows were recorded as litre per hour l h the captain controlled instantaneous fuel consumption throughout the experiment in fig 1 the main elements of the monitoring system are shown a is the mass flow sensors for the measurement of fuel consumption b is the multi channel recorder mounted on the vessel s bridge for the visualization of the fuel consumption and c is the gps data logger the timestamp and the vessel position route and speed were recorded by a gps data logger at a frequency of 1 hz the vessel was also equipped with a raspberry pi2 control unit a data collection system that was provided with customised routines and modules for data acquisition synchronisation and validation other details of the monitoring system are reported in gabiña et al 2016 validated data were loaded in a mysql database and averaged every 20 s annual investigations were usually carried out during normal fishing activity to measure also the power delivered to the propeller during the whole fishing activity of the vessel and gear drag during trawling these periodic controls are part of the monitoring protocol of the vessel which started in 2010 necessary to validate fuel consumption and speed measurements 2 4 sea trial schedules three observation periods have been selected each of those represents one working week the first set defined as p0 july 2014 is referred to a fouled hull just before the annual maintenance occurred in august 2014 the previous hull maintenance occurred in 2013 and the standard antifouling coating was applied the application of the foul release coating was scheduled for late june 2015 and p1 july 2015 describes a clean hull the subset of data named p2 was recorded two years after the application of the foul release coating june 2017 between july 2015 and june 2017 no dry dock was carried out

and fishing grounds the captain was requested to annotate sea and weather conditions together with information on the fishing ground and any major occurrence during fishing activity daily within the period considered for the study the vessel configuration and the fishing gear design and technical specifications remained constant the single significant change regarded the application of the foul release paint 2 5 data processing methodology all the data recorded in each dataset have been processed to identify and exclude unwanted conditions and outliers such as harbor maneuvering transient phases spikes etc data validated have been analyzed to determine the trawling and cruising working conditions according to specific distribution modes of the vessel speed the same range of speed for trawling and sailing in all the three reference periods has been applied for the analyses p 1 represents the baseline as it is referred to as a clean hull p 0 describes a fouled hull after one year of activity the comparison p 1 p 0 allows for the quantification of the degradation of the hull performance when treated with traditional antifouling paint after one year from its application the comparison p 1 p 2 described the effect of the foul release paint on the degradation of the hull performance due to fouling comparisons between the three periods were based on the observation of vessel speed v s k n and fuel consumption f c in l h data on fuel consumption and speed have been clustered in classes to group similar values and make it feasible to identify trends which are represented as bar plots in the results section mean values and standard deviations have been calculated for quantifying the impact on fuel consumption and vessel speed 3 results fig 2 represents the distribution of the vessel speed for the aggregated dataset which consisted of 53 346 samples two modes can be identified corresponding to trawling and cruising phases between 3 and 4 5 k n and 9 0

table 3 where vessel speed and fuel consumption for the trawling and the cruising phases are reported as mean values avg standard deviation sd and percentage ratio between p 1 and p 0 δ 1 and between p 1 and p 2 δ 2 the trends of trawling speed were similar for all the three periods considered fig 3 ranging table 3 from 3 75 k n p 0 3 79 k n p 1 and 3 76 k n p 2 the fuel consumption of the fouled hull was 62 03 l h p 0 the clean hull 55 89 l h p 1 the hull treated with the foul release paint after two years 55 19 l h p2 while the effect of cleaning the hull represented an 11 reduction in fuel consumption the performance of the hull remained constant between p 1 and p 2 as the variation in fuel consumption can be considered negligible 0 2 during the cruising phase fig 4 the mean cruising speed of p 1 was 10 28 k n the fouled hull p0 showed a lower cruising speed to 10 10 kn while the mean cruising speed in p 2 10 21 k n was comparable with the mean speed resulted in p 1 the fuel consumption measured for p 1 was 55 13 l h while the fouled hull resulted in higher fuel consumption up to 62 03 l h which is coherent with the reduction in cruising speed of p 0 compared to p 1 due to the added resistance of the fouling after two years from the hull cleaning p 2 the fuel consumption resulted in 58 34 l h to provide a further indication we also calculated the f c values for a standard working day which were computed by multiplying the average fuel consumption recorded for each period p 0 p 1 p 2 by the number of trawling and cruising hours see table 4 out of 24 h 16 h are usually spent trawling 4 h are spent cruising and 4 h include maneuvering and other activities involving a negligible fuel consumption and not computed in the summary table the fuel consumed l d a y and the difference δ between p 1 and p 0 and between p 1 and p 2 are reported for the trawling and the cruising phases during trawling these data indicate that f c should have increased of 98 l d a y for a one year fouled hull p 1 p 0 while it decreased of 1 l d a y from p 1 to p 2 which can be considered negligible regarding cruising phase similarly to trawling the fuel consumption of the fouled hull was recorded to be higher of about 19 l d a y while it effectively increased after two years from the application of the foul release paint of only 12 l d a y overall comparing the total fuel consumed at a daily base the fuel consumption increased by 11 l l d a y after two years while it should have been 117 l day higher after only one year 4 discussion and conclusions full scale measurements and data analytics were used to assess the benefits of the application of the foul release coating to a mediterranean trawler the benefit is coming from a cleaned hull quantified comparing p 0 and p1 persisted for two years after the application of the foul release paint without any further hull maintenance as the difference in annual fuel consumed between p 1 and p 2 can be considered negligible while the comparison p 1 p 2 is essential to demonstrate that the reduction in fuel consumption from p 0 to p 1 was maintained for two years the impact of the foul release paint can be quantified comparing the daily fuel consumption between p 0 and p 2 indeed if the foul release paint had not applied to the hull after one year the fuel consumption would have increased up to p 0 considering on average a fuel saving of 106 l d a y resulted from the difference in daily fuel consumption between p 0 and p 2 and a total of 124 d a y s y e a r as a standard reference source stecf

22534,fishing is an energy intensive economic activity research in several fields is conducted to improve the energy and environmental profile of fishing vessels as regards the technical measures the assessment of benefits is often hampered by boundary conditions that are difficult to quantify and side effects that are difficult to unravel this study examined the impact of a fluoropolymer based fouling release paint on the fuel consumption rate of a mediterranean bottom trawler the analysis of a series of sea trial campaigns allowed for a quantitative and qualitative comparison of fuel consumption rate during the regular fishing activities comparing the fuel consumption rate before and after the application of the fluoropolymer based foul release coating a reduction in fuel consumption rate was observed and quantified other advantages are discussed in this paper regarding the reduction of ghg emission and the more environmental friendly approach using biocide free and non banned products keywords energy efficiency fisheries fuel saving marine propulsion plant foul release coating 1 introduction fishing is one of the oldest human activities vital to support human feeding however it is an energy intensive economic activity ship energy efficiency and related fuel consumption need to be carefully considered to assess the effectiveness of fishing activities several strategies can be adopted to improve energy efficiency on both new and existing vessels the optimization of hull geometry can lead to significant improvement in hydrodynamic performances lin et al 2018 and consequent drag reduction during normal ship operations propulsion line components such as propulsion engine gearbox and propeller play a fundamental role in energy efficiency therefore during the propulsion plant design it would be appropriate to choose those components which will provide the most efficient working condition for a large part of the ship working hours in the case of existing vessels energy efficiency could be improved by replacing one or more propulsion plant components with a more efficient one i e a new engine with low emissions and specific fuel consumption optimized propeller etc or using diesel electric propulsion hansen and wendt 2015 especially in cases where the vessels have different operational profiles the authors in previous works studied the possible benefits of the replacement of fixed pitch propellers with controllable pitch or ducted propellers the latter device being suitable for heavy load scenarios such as applications on trawlers where high thrust is needed at low vessel speed altosole et al 2012 martelli et al 2014 notti and sala 2014 however these solutions result not easy to be applied to be implemented on existing vessels due to technical and economic limitations moreover no major improvement in the hull shape can be considered as potential approach to reduce energy demand of the vessel martelli et al 2017 an important strategy for an existing vessel to save energy is to maintain a high level of efficiency the energy users the presence of fouling on the hull increases the ship resistance that results in a significant increase in fuel consumption and running costs for trawlers most of the hull fouling includes marine organisms such as weeds and barnacles indeed bacteria begin to accumulate on the submerged portion of the hull within a few hours of treatment with standard antifouling products it is noteworthy that biofouling is more detrimental than hull roughness which is formed by surface irregularities like welding seams and paints remains hua et al 2018 khor and xiao 2011 however the effect of biofouling in its early biofilm stage or slime is largely missed or neglected a fairly recent study of towing trials revealed about 5 increase in hull resistance over 40 days tupper 2013 in the early stage slime is hardly visible yet light slime has been demonstrated to increase fuel consumption by 8 or more whereas heavy slime can result in increases that exceed 18 kane 2012 the application of antifouling coatings can be considered another potential strategy for an existing vessel to reduce energy demand two hull surface treatments are used to bound the adverse effects of fouling antifouling and foul release coatings a comprehensive and critical analysis of the difference between the two types of coatings is reported in buskens et al 2013 in every case periodic cleaning and inspection of the hull are required and the frequency and costs are related to the growing capacity of the fouling antifouling coating helps to prevent the adherence of marine organisms and limit the biofilm growing by inhibiting biological processes the biocides in the antifouling coatings contain toxic components such as mercury lead or copper which leach out into the water to prevent the adherence of the marine organisms despite some of the components being prohibited for environmental reasons such products are still adopted contrary to antifouling coating the foul release technology does not rely on biocides to prevent biofouling but on the non stick principle that was discovered in the early 80 griffith 1980 foul release paints avoid the growth of fouling organisms by providing a low friction ultra smooth surface even if settling of organic material eventually occurs there is only a weak bonding between the foulants and the surface itself such that the organisms can easily be removed by either underwater cleaning or by the hydrodynamic shear forces due to the hull advance speed candries et al 2000 most modern foul release paints are based on silicone stein et al 2003 however newly developed fluoropolymer based coatings provide significant improvements with respect to the best silicone based products especially at slow speed selim et al 2016a 2016b although foul release technology is well explored in open literature in terms of environmental benefits or the chemical composition of the coating little information is available on the effects over time of coatings applied to hulls evaluated through direct measurements this paper reports on the evaluation of the impact of a foul release hull coating on the fuel consumption rate of a mediterranean fishing trawler the experiment herein described is part of a more comprehensive research activity to provide to fisheries operators a quantitative evaluation of selected technologies for reducing energy consumption the foul release technology was included in this research because at that time it was used by few italian trawlers and the interest for such technology led ship owners to approach research institutions for technical support on the evaluation of effective benefits of these coatings the study aims to enrich the technical and scientific knowledge in the field of energy efficiency improvements in fisheries several experimental campaigns on a mediterranean fishing trawler
