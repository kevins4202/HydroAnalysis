prospective zones keywords ann data driven delineation gis groundwater prospective zones 1 introduction the lives of all living organisms are dependent on water and the ancient human civilization began near a river beach sun et al 2019 quantity and quality are the typical questions of water resources worldwide and the problems are very serious in low income achier countries mandal et al 2018 li 2018 mokadem et al 2018 the demand for clean and sufficient drinking water is intensively increasing from time to time due to the rapid population growth rani et al 2015 the scarcity of sufficient drinking water is doubling as the water sources are depleting due to climate change shomar et al 2010 the majority of sub saharan countries are suffering a shortage of drinking water and it is challenging to get reliable sources of water as a result of financial limitations rahel and hassen 2019 şener et al 2011 the availability and reliability of surface water resources rely on topographic conditions arulbalaji et al 2019 gedam and dagalo 2020 the surface sources are only recommended if the distance between the water source and the place where the community is living is acceptable unless it is time consuming while fetching the water and due to these limitations groundwater is intensively utilized in many countries of the world as an alternative source of drinking water berhanu and hatiye 2020 rajaveni et al 2017 though groundwater is considered an alternative source of drinking it is a tedious task to delineate the potential zones a reliable and sufficient groundwater prospective zones can only be identified by the field based investigation and this is possible when it is financially affordable ahmad et al 2020a rajaveni et al 2017 if direct field investigation for the exploration of groundwater potential zones is impossible due to financial limitations the application of an appropriate tool is the best solution to address the scarcity of drinking water andualem and demeke 2019 dar et al 2020 a bunch of studies is available worldwide in which several groundwater prospective zones delineation methods are extensively used arulbalaji et al 2019 arefayne shishaye and abdi 2015 kumari et al 2016 das and pardeshi 2018 the delineation of groundwater potential zones requires the integration of both surface and sub surface factors the key factors such as soil slope geology geomorphology rainfall lulc drainage density and lineament density were intensively used as criteria for the delineation of groundwater potential zones yesuph and dagnew 2019 andualem et al 2019 berhanu and hatiye 2020 the application of geographical information system gis and remote sensing rs technology was successfully used in the exploration of groundwater potential zones worldwide since the application of gis and rs is primarily based on the data retrieved from remotely sensed technology and there is no direct field investigation that causes huge cost and due to these beautiful features it is widely used in water resources ncibi et al 2020 in gis and rs landsat imagery and digital elevation models dem are the primary data for the exploration of groundwater potential zones mandal et al 2018 worqlul et al 2017 though remotely sensed data can reduce the cost for direct field investigation it doesn t mean that all data retrieved can represent the real world and it will be considered for researches with some uncertainties the error during retrieving the data in the remote sensing technology will be propagated throughout the geospatial analysis and will affect the results therefore the application of data driven models in geospatial analysis is getting international attention artificial neural networks ann are such data driven models that can learn from a mistake during the multi criteria based geospatial analysis ahmad et al 2020a it is one of the computational methods and it is a broadly used type of data driven model in which several neural networks nn are integrated to perform a non linear geospatial analysis therefore the current study is devoted to present the evaluation of a data driven ann model and gis technique for the delineation of groundwater potential zones eight key significant factors namely drainage density lineament density geomorphologic units soil slope lulc and rainfall were confirmed as the criteria for the exploration of groundwater potential zones the weights of each factor were generated and ranked in ann and analytic hierarchy process ahp and then used in thematic layer preparation 2 method and materials 2 1 study area the comparison of the performance of the ann model and gis technique was evaluated in the fincha sub basin case study this catchment is found in abay river basin which has the largest annual runoff when compared to the other rivers fincha river is one of the tributaries of the abay river this river is the main river of fincha catchment for this specific study based on the hydrologic and topographic conditions of this catchment the place where the fincha river joins abay river is considered as the outlet point of the entire regions in the catchment after fixing the outlet at the junction all contributing streams aqua and watersheds black were delineated in the gis platform as shown in fig 1 the catchment is geographically located between 37 0 06 00 e to 37 33 18 e longitude and 09 21 11 n to 10 01 00 n latitude the meteorological recorded precipitation stations contributing to the outlet were identified using thiessen polygon accordingly the contributing stations namely alibo shambu haro neshi homi hareto gabate kombolcha and wayu were identified since the intensity of rainfall and the infiltration capacity of the soil geologic and hydrogeologic settings are the main causes for groundwater recharge the exploration of potential zones considers the rainfall stations as estimated in the attribute of the delineated catchment the fincha river drains a total of 82 11 km2 areas 2 2 gis and rs for prospecting groundwater potential zones since the invention of a simple manually operated global positioning system gps researchers have been searching for sophisticated software for geospatial analysis rajaveni et al 2017 singh and panda 2017 el magd et al 2010 geographical information systems gis is a computer based geospatial analysis tool in which an algorithm of the earth s features was built for mapping and analyzing different spatial modeling phinzi and silas 2019 the reason behind the popularity of gis and rs technology is that due to the difficulties in costs for direct field investigation for data collection kayet et al 2018 the field based investigation of groundwater requires huge money and takes time to delineate the potential zones therefore the application of gis and remote sensing is an effective tool that can save cost and time during the development of a water resource the exploration of groundwater potential zones in gis and rs relies on the surface and subsurface significant factors such as slope geology rainfall geomorphological units lineament density lithology and soil berhanu and hatiye 2020 gis and rs is the best tool for the country with limited financial affordability ethiopia is known for its sufficient water resources but the majority of the community is still demanding for daily consumption gedam and dagalo 2020 therefore the aquifer is the primary factor that determines the degree of occurrence of groundwater in a given watershed the potential zones identifying factors such as rainfall lulc lineament density drainage density geology slope soil and geomorphologic units used in this study are shown in fig 2 the degree of significance of the driving factors is varied based on the specific characteristics of the watershed as revealed from past studies rainfall drainage density and lineament density reveal the high significance of the occurrence of potential zones when relatively compared with other driving factors however the driving factors such as lullc slope soil geology drainage density and lineament density derived from remote sensing are the major indicators of groundwater potential zones as explained in berhanu and hatiye 2020 the integration of these significant factors is ranked and weighted in ahp and a thematic map is generated from these weights based on overlay analysis the analytical hierarchy process ahp principle was applied to assign weights through the ahp scale and judgment arefayne shishaye and abdi 2015 then setting up priorities between the elements to be compared based on the scale pair wise comparison matrix for scale consists of the relative importance of the criterion from 1 equal importance to 9 extreme preference of one factor over the other was applied table 1 the consistency of the weights derived from the pair wise matrix should be checked and this improves the accuracy of the decision to be made in ahp method the consistency of the derived values of weights is checked by reducing the error in the estimation and this can be achieved by the method called consistency index ci and consistency ration cr as shown in eq 1 and eq 2 1 c o n s i s t e n c y i n d e x c i λ m a x n n 1 2 c o n s i s t e n c y r a t i o c r c i r i where λmax is the maximum eigen value of the pair wise matrix n is the number of criteria used in the pairwise comparison ri is a random index for a number of an attributes used in the evaluation table 2 the cr 0 1 indicates the correctness of weights assigned in ahp 2 3 data driven ann model it is a current issue that artificial neural network ann is being used as a powerful tool for water resources management utilization and modeling dtissibe et al 2020 a neural network is a data driven model that focuses on an information processing algorithm to solve a non linear problem lohani et al 2005 the application of ann in water resources are getting attention due to its effectiveness aichouri et al 2015 ann is a data driven model that is a widely used tool in areas of water resources development and management moreno et al 2020 chan and chan 2020 the selection of an appropriate tool for the delineation of groundwater potential zones depends on the availability of inputs and the skill of how to model the watershed lohani et al 2012 this study evaluates the performance of a data driven model ann and gis platforms for the delineation of groundwater potential zones in fincha catchment the steps and the input parameters used for the delineation of groundwater potential zones in the ann model and gis platform are conceptualized as shown in fig 3 the input parameters were distributed over a spatial resolution of 12 5m 12 5m before using in the training processes the productive and non functional well locations were used as target data while training the ann model a multi layer perceptron mlp structure was selected in this study based on the number of input parameters assigned in input nodes which is eight 8 a total of four 4 hidden nodes and one 1 were used in the hidden layer and output layer respectively to start the training processes the inputs values were normalized using eqn 3 and random values of weights were assigned the weight values assigned in the input nodes were multiplied with the normalized and spatially distributed input parameters the weighted sum of the inputs and weights were activated in hidden nodes using eqn 4 3 n o r m a l i z a t i o n x x m i n x m a x x m i n 4 a c t i v a t i o n f u n c t i o n 1 1 e x where x is the pixel value in the vector point data x m i n and x m a x the minimum and maximum values in the point based point values 2 3 1 training ann model feedforward is the process by which the one sided sum of weights and inputs parameters are pushed forward to get a rough result in the output node the difference error between the rough result and the target value is very high at this stage because this is the first step of the training process the reason why the error is high at this level is due to the randomness of the assigned weights a backpropagation process is a mechanism by which the error between the result and target value is minimized the overall error obtained at the output layer starts to propagate back into the networks from the output node to the entire network this process is repeated until an acceptable agreement is made between the model result and target value the steps used to delineate the potential groundwater zones using the ann model for this specific study is presented in fig 4 2 4 groundwater potential index gpi the occurrence of the groundwater potential zone is a function of the aquifer characteristics and its spatial extent the significance of the individual factor in indicating the groundwater potential zones is indexed arulbalaji et al 2019 the criteria selected for the delineation of potential groundwater zones in this catchment were ranked and indexed the integration of all the key factors of the groundwater occurrence and movement is computed as gpi ahmad et al 2020b gpi is a unitless parameter used to index eqn 5 the probability of occurrence of groundwater potential zones in a given catchment this index provides information about the quantitative based groundwater classifications as good moderate and poor zones the gpi was generated by weighted overlay analysis using the weight values fixed in ann and ahp approaches 5 g p i j 1 m i 1 n w j x i wj normalized weight in j layer and xi rate value of each class with respect to j layer 2 5 validation the accuracy of the potential zones delineated in both methods ann and gis technique was evaluated based on the potential wells in the study area a total number of 51 well locations were collected from the local government office and out of this only 36 well have potential yield and the rest are dried the pumping rate of the potential well was collected since the prediction of the potential zones is the probability it is required to evaluate the accuracy of the identified zones based on ground truthing points the receiver operating characteristics roc curve was used to evaluate the accuracy of the identified groundwater potential zones kumar and krishna 2018 3 result and discussions the thematic maps generated in the data driven model and gis technique for the selected groundwater prospecting criteria rainfall lulc drainage density lineament density slope geology soil and geomorphology were presented in figs 5 12 respectively as we can see from these maps the thematic layers generated in gis tools were labeled as a whereas the results in the data driven ann model were labeled as b in each map the individual criteria were reclassified based on their importance in indicating the groundwater potential zones the detailed information about the individual criteria was briefed in the next sections 3 1 rainfall the main source of groundwater recharge is rainfall a permeable soil that receives rainfall of high intensity can contribute to high groundwater recharge ahmad et al 2020a the volume of the water stored in an aquifer is a function of the rainfall intensity and the duration water is only stored in the aquifer if the soil and geologic units can transmit it the rechargeability of groundwater depends on the void spaces in the soil geologic structures and the topographic conditions of the area if the rainfall retains for a long time and the soil is permeable there is a high probability to recharge groundwater for potential and permeable aquifers much amount of water is stored when the rain reached the water table as shown in fig 5 the result of reclassified rainfall maps generated in the ann model and gis platform were shown in fig 5b and fig 5a respectively the classifications of the rainfall of the thematic maps in both approaches revealed almost the same categories this indicates that the ann model can also be used as an alternative in generating a thematic map the rainfall was reclassified as very poor 1 1 548 75 1 617 56 mm poor 2 617 56 1 688 70 mm moderate 3 1 688 70 1 762 24 mm high 4 1 762 24 1 834 04 mm and very high 5 1 834 04 1914 07 mm though there is no study available before the current study regarding the quality and quantity of the groundwater in this catchment it is evidenced from the community that the main problem is the quantity 3 2 land use land cover groundwater recharge is the main process through which the rainfall percolates into an aquifer this process is a function of land use and land cover urbanization is increasing in the catchment and the rechargeability of the groundwater is increasing when compared to the past non urbanized areas hamed et al 2018 hadji et al 2018 the reclassified lulc thematic maps generated in the ann model and gis technique were presented in fig 6 b and fig 6a of fig 6 five dominant land uses land covers namely trees cover areas shrub cover areas grassland cropland and swampy areas are available in the study area these were reclassified based on qualitative categories as very poor 1 poor 2 moderate 3 high 4 and very high 5 based on the rate of groundwater recharge 3 3 drainage density the permeability and the percolation rate of rainfall in specific areas are controlled by the drainage density stream networks and the corresponding land surface drained across the length of the channel can indicate the potential groundwater zones the aquifer is potential if the drainage density in the catchment is contributing to groundwater recharge the hydrogeologic conditions and moisture holding capacity of the soil initiates the drainage density and this in turn support the rechargeability of the groundwater drainage density is influenced by the topographic conditions and the permeability of the geologic units if the slope is flat the permeability is very high and the drainage density is very low drainage density derived from digital elevation model dem was classified as very poor 1 6 58 11 70 km km2 poor 2 11 70 17 70 km km2 moderate 3 17 70 24 30 km km2 high 4 24 30 32 50 km km2 and very high 5 32 50 46 60 km km2 the reclassified drainage density of the thematic maps generated in the ann model and gis technique was presented in fig 7b and fig 7a of fig 7 3 4 lineament density the features of the lineament of a watershed provide important evidence about the hydrogeology of a given catchment the features of the lineament density derived from landsat 8 imageries supported by the ground truthing points can provide information about the status of groundwater rechargeability studies conducted in fenta et al 2014 kapilan and elangovan 2018 berhanu and hatiye 2020 confirmed the importance of lineament density in providing information about the rechargeability of the hydrogeologic settings of a catchment lineaments are linear lines and zones of localized weathering that increase the permeability and porosity in the geologic settings the lineament density derived from landsat 8 imageries was classified as very poor 1 0 441 0 685 km km2 poor 2 0 685 0 938 km km2 moderate 3 0 938 1 200 km km2 high 4 1 20 1 530 km km2 very high 5 1 530 2 390 km km2 the thematic maps of the lineament density generated both in gis tools and the ann model were presented in fig 8a and fig 8b of fig 8 respectively 3 5 slope the slope is one of the key significant factors and important in identifying the groundwater recharge zones in a given catchment the basic concept behind the importance of slope in groundwater recharge is the retention period the speed and retention time of surface runoff and the infiltration capacity of the geologic units are influenced by the slope the flat regions in the catchment are good indicators of groundwater potential zones as the retention time and infiltration rate are high the majority of lower portions of the catchment are categorized under steep slopes and the groundwater potential zone ranges from very low to low the speed of the surface runoff is very high and the retention period are very low due to the steepness of the topography when the slope is flat enough the surface runoff gets much time to percolate into the subsurface for this study the slopes were reclassified into five categories to groundwater potential zones as very high 5 6 59 11 30 high 4 11 30 16 6 moderate 3 16 60 23 20 poor 4 23 2 32 1 and very poor 5 32 1 45 8 as shown in fig 9a and fig 9b of fig 9 3 6 geology the existence of groundwater in an aquifer depends on the nature of the geology and permeability of the geologic settings water is stored in the aquifer when the geologic formation holds and conveys the percolating water the amount and volume of water stored in the geology is a function of the hydrogeologic settings of the area the water can only be stored if sufficient void spaces are there between the geologic units the aquifer is assumed to be potential when there are enough spaces in the hydrogeologic settings the geologic units with uniform grain size usually have sufficient porosity and high permeability groundwater recharge occurs from precipitation that percolates into the subsurface from the surface runoff lakes and streams fincha river and fincha lake are permeable and allow the seepage of surface water into the subsurface the dominant geologic classes of the study area are grouped into adigrate sandstone blue nile basalts alluvium colluvium and marsh soils and the corresponding classes to the groundwater potential zones are very poor 1 poor 2 moderate 3 high 4 and very high 5 respectively the reclassified geologic units in the ann and gis platform based on their importance for the delineation of groundwater potential zones are presented in fig 10a and fig 10b of fig 10 3 7 soil the subsurface water is stored in void spaces between the soil particles the volume of water stored in the given hydrologic units depends on the texture and size of the soil particles the existing soil data obtained from the ministry of water mineral and energy mwme was reclassified as a thematic layer in the ann and gis platform as shown in fig 11b and fig 11a of fig 11 respectively reclassification was made based on the permeability and infiltration capacity of the soil however according to the information obtained from productive wells the depths are deep and for such cases the effect of soil is relatively low therefore other factors such as rainfall lulc and drainage density played a great role in recharging and contributing to the sub surface water the percolation of rainfall through soil is one of the interesting features which in turn helps to reach the water if there is a high probability of percolating through the soil it is obvious that much amount of water is stored in the aquifer for the sub basin there is no well documented information about the aquifer but as it can be evidenced from the geophysical investigation conducted it was found that there is high percolation 3 8 geomorphology in the study area seven dominant landforms namely flat plains irregular plains escarpments hills breaks low mountains and high mountains gis tools and ann model were used to reclassify the landforms based on their significance of contributing to groundwater a thematic layer was generated in both methods and the dominant landforms were reclassified into five groups the landforms of a geomorphologic unit vary in terms of their characteristics and spatial distribution the occurrence and movement of the subsurface water depend on the geomorphologic characteristics of the area the low mountainous and flat plains are indicators for the occurrence of groundwater if the hydrogeologic settings transmit water for a geomorphological unit a slope based landform classification was implemented and a quantitative classification namely very poor 1 high mountainous poor 2 hills moderate 3 low mountainous high 4 breaks and very high 5 flat plains as shown in fig 12a and fig 12b of fig 12 the principle of a pair wise comparison matrix developed in ahp and the overall weights for the evaluated criteria for the delineation of groundwater potential zones in the watershed was summarized in table 3 the consistency of the ahp technique in capturing the exploration of surface irrigation potential zones is evaluated by consistency index ci and consistency ratio cr and the summary of this consistency evaluation is as presented in table 3 as we can see from the table the ci 0 1 and indicates that the values of weight assigned for the individual key factor in ahp are correct the final updated weights were initially assigned between the input nodes and the hidden nodes and between hidden nodes and the output node the result of updated weights after backpropagation processes were re assigned in the ann model during the testing periods the updated weights in the ann model were taken after the training processes were reached the productive wells pumping data and other ground truthing data such as the location of spring and hand dug well locations collected by hand gps were used as the target data and the delineation of the groundwater potential was repeatedly evaluated until an agreement was made between the target and the model result since there are eight 8 nodes in the input layer four 4 nodes in the hidden layer and one 1 node in the output layer a total of 38 synoptic connections weights are there in the neural networks nn selected for this specific study the values of weights taken after the training processes the updated values of weight used in the weighted overlay analysis for each criterion were fixed as 0 35 0 19 0 27 0 28 0 07 0 31 and 0 06 for lineament density lulc slope drainage density soil geology and geomorphology respectively 3 9 delineation of groundwater potential zones gpz the values of weights fixed in ann and ahp were used to index groundwater potential zones weights fixed in the training processes and ahp were assigned to the corresponding key factors lineament density lulc slope drainage density soil geology and geomorphology to generate the groundwater potential zones weighted overlay analysis tool in the gis platform was used in both methods the delineated groundwater potential zones using the gis platform and ann model were presented in fig 13 and fig 14 as we can see from fig 13 delineated potential zones were only classified into four qualitative based classifications as high moderate low and very low whereas in fig 14 five groundwater potential zones were identified including very good qualitative classification the probability of getting groundwater potential zones with five classifications was obtained in the ann model whereas four classifications were obtained in the gis platform 3 10 validation of the potential zones the accuracy of the delineated groundwater potential zones further evaluated with existing water sources duan et al 2016 das and pardeshi 2018 berhanu and hatiye 2020 the total number of 51 well locations were collected from the local government office and out of this only 36 well have potential yield and the rest are dried the pumping rate of the potential well were collected since the prediction of the potential zones is probability it mandatory to evaluate the accuracy of the identified zones based on ground truthing points as we can see from the validated potential zones presented in figs 13 and 14 the majority of existing water sources such as shallow and hand dug wells are almost overlapped up to 86 and 82 5 with the delineated potential zones in ann model and gis technique respectively the accuracy of the predicted the potential zones evaluated in roc curve also witness the agreement made between the identified potential zones and the ground truthing points the performance of both methods was evaluated in roc separately as we can see from the figs 15 and 16 the area under curve auc of 0 96 and 0 91 were estimated for the roc curve plotted in the ann and gis results respectively the auc computed in both methods revealed an agreement of 96 and 91 were made between the ground truthing points and the ann model and between gis platforms respectively the roc curve plotted as the false positive x axis and true positive rate y axis was shown in fig 17 4 conclusion the study presents the performance evaluation made between the ann and gis platforms for the delineation of groundwater potential zones in fincha catchment abay basin ethiopia the two methods data driven ann model and the gis technique were successfully applied to delineate the groundwater potential zones using the key significant factors such as rainfall slope lulc soil drainage density lineament density geology and geomorphology as groundwater prospecting criteria the selected criteria were prepared and distributed on the 12 5m 12 5m spatial resolution and normalized before assigning to the neural networks nn the importance of the selected criteria was tanked and weighted in ann and ahp approaches that the training processes and prioritization were implemented in each method respectively the accuracy of the weights generated in the ann training model and ahp approach was evaluated by the target values assigned to the networks and consistency index ci respectively the thematic map was prepared for the individual criteria and the groundwater potential zones were delineated using the weights fixed in the ann training model and ahp respectively five and four classes of groundwater potential zones as very high high moderate low and very low and high moderate low and very low were delineated in the ann and gis platform respectively receiver operating characteristics roc curve developed from pumping rate and ground truthing points were used to validate the accuracy of the predicted groundwater potential zones the area under curve auc computed from the roc curve showed that 96 and 91 agreement were made in the ann model and gis platform results respectively therefore the performance of the ann was better than the gis technique in delineating the potential zones finally it is concluded that the ann model is an effective tool for the delineation of groundwater prospective zones and this paper will recommend that future research will focus on the implementation of the ann model for the delineation of potential groundwater zones for the region where the cost for direct field investigation is not affordable

study area the comparison of the performance of the ann model and gis technique was evaluated in the fincha sub basin case study this catchment is found in abay river basin which has the largest annual runoff when compared to the other rivers fincha river is one of the tributaries of the abay river this river is the main river of fincha catchment for this specific study based on the hydrologic and topographic conditions of this catchment the place where the fincha river joins abay river is considered as the outlet point of the entire regions in the catchment after fixing the outlet at the junction all contributing streams aqua and watersheds black were delineated in the gis platform as shown in fig 1 the catchment is geographically located between 37 0 06 00 e to 37 33 18 e longitude and 09 21 11 n to 10 01 00 n latitude the meteorological recorded precipitation stations contributing to the outlet were identified using thiessen polygon accordingly the contributing stations namely alibo shambu haro neshi homi hareto gabate kombolcha and wayu were identified since the intensity of rainfall and the infiltration capacity of the soil geologic and hydrogeologic settings are the main causes for groundwater recharge the exploration of potential zones considers the rainfall stations as estimated in the attribute of the delineated catchment the fincha river drains a total of 82 11 km2 areas 2 2 gis and rs for prospecting groundwater potential zones since the invention of a simple manually operated global positioning system gps researchers have been searching for sophisticated software for geospatial analysis rajaveni et al 2017 singh and panda 2017 el magd et al 2010 geographical information systems gis is a computer based geospatial analysis tool in which an algorithm of the earth s features was built for mapping and analyzing different spatial modeling phinzi and silas 2019 the reason behind the popularity of gis and rs technology is that due to the difficulties in costs for direct field investigation for data collection kayet et al 2018 the field based investigation of groundwater requires huge money and takes time to delineate the potential zones therefore the application of gis and remote sensing is an effective tool that can save cost and time during the development of a water resource the exploration of groundwater potential zones in gis and rs relies on the surface and subsurface significant factors such as slope geology rainfall geomorphological units lineament density lithology and soil berhanu and hatiye 2020 gis and rs is the best tool for the country with limited financial affordability ethiopia is known for its sufficient water resources but the majority of the community is still demanding for daily consumption gedam and dagalo 2020 therefore the aquifer is the primary factor that determines the degree of occurrence of groundwater in a given watershed the potential zones identifying factors such as rainfall lulc lineament density drainage density geology slope soil and geomorphologic units used in this study are shown in fig 2 the degree of significance of the driving factors is varied based on the specific characteristics of the watershed as revealed from past studies rainfall drainage density and lineament density reveal the high significance of the occurrence of potential zones when relatively compared with other driving factors however the driving factors such as lullc slope soil geology drainage density and lineament density derived from remote sensing are the major indicators of groundwater potential zones as explained in berhanu and hatiye 2020 the integration of these significant factors is ranked and weighted in ahp and a thematic map is generated from these weights based on overlay analysis the analytical hierarchy process ahp principle was applied to assign weights through the ahp scale and judgment arefayne shishaye and abdi 2015 then setting up priorities between the elements to be compared based on the scale pair wise comparison matrix for scale consists of the relative importance of the criterion from 1 equal importance to 9 extreme preference of one factor over the other was applied table 1 the consistency of the weights derived from the pair wise matrix should be checked and this improves the accuracy of the decision to be made in ahp method the consistency of the derived values of weights is checked by reducing the error in the estimation and this can be achieved by the method called consistency index ci and consistency ration cr as shown in eq 1 and eq 2 1 c o n s i s t e n c y i n d e x c i λ m a x n n 1 2 c o n s i s t e n c y r a t i o c r c i r i where λmax is the maximum eigen value of the pair wise matrix n is the number of criteria used in the pairwise comparison ri is a random index for a number of an attributes used in the evaluation table 2 the cr 0 1 indicates the correctness of weights assigned in ahp 2 3 data driven ann model it is a current issue that artificial neural network ann is being used as a powerful tool for water resources management utilization and modeling dtissibe et al 2020 a neural network is a data driven model that focuses on an information processing algorithm to solve a non linear problem lohani et al 2005 the application of ann in water resources are getting attention due to its effectiveness aichouri et al 2015 ann is a data driven model that is a widely used tool in areas of water resources development and management moreno et al 2020 chan and chan 2020 the selection of an appropriate tool for the delineation of groundwater potential zones depends on the availability of inputs and the skill of how to model the watershed lohani et al 2012 this study evaluates the performance of a data driven model ann and gis platforms for the delineation of groundwater potential zones in fincha catchment the steps and the input parameters used for the delineation of groundwater potential zones in the ann model and gis platform are conceptualized as shown in fig 3 the input parameters were distributed over a spatial resolution of 12 5m 12 5m before using in the training processes the productive and non functional well locations were used as target data while training the ann model a multi layer perceptron mlp structure was selected in this study based on the number of input parameters assigned in input nodes which is eight 8 a total of four 4 hidden nodes and one 1 were used in the hidden layer and output layer respectively to start the training processes the inputs values were normalized using eqn 3 and random values of weights were assigned the weight values assigned in the input nodes were multiplied with the normalized and spatially distributed input parameters the weighted sum of the inputs and weights were activated in hidden nodes using eqn 4 3 n o r m a l i z a t i o n x x m i n x m a x x m i n 4 a c t i v a t i o n f u n c t i o n 1 1 e x where x is the pixel value in the vector point data x m i n and x m a x the minimum and maximum values in the point based point values 2 3 1 training ann model feedforward is the process by which the one sided sum of weights and inputs parameters are pushed forward to get a rough result in the output node the difference error between the rough result and the target value is very high at this stage because this is the first step of the training process the reason why the error is high at this level is due to the randomness of the assigned weights a backpropagation process is a mechanism by which the error between the result and target value is minimized the overall error obtained at the output layer starts to propagate back into the networks from the output node to the entire network this process is repeated until an acceptable agreement is made between the model result and target value the steps used to delineate the potential groundwater zones using the ann model for this specific study is presented in fig 4 2 4 groundwater potential index gpi the occurrence of the groundwater potential zone is a function of the aquifer characteristics and its spatial extent the significance of the individual factor in indicating the groundwater potential zones is indexed arulbalaji et al 2019 the criteria selected for the delineation of potential groundwater zones in this catchment were ranked and indexed the integration of all the key factors of the groundwater occurrence and movement is computed as gpi ahmad et al 2020b gpi is a unitless parameter used to index eqn 5 the probability of occurrence of groundwater potential zones in a given catchment this index provides information about the quantitative based groundwater classifications as good moderate and poor zones the gpi was generated by weighted overlay analysis using the weight values fixed in ann and ahp approaches 5 g p i j 1 m i 1 n w j x i wj normalized weight in j layer and xi rate value of each class with respect to j layer 2 5 validation the accuracy of the potential zones delineated in both methods ann and gis technique was evaluated based on the potential wells in the study area a total number of 51 well locations were collected from the local government office and out of this only 36 well have potential yield and the rest are dried the pumping rate of the potential well was collected since the prediction of the potential zones is the probability it is required to evaluate the accuracy of the identified zones based on ground truthing points the receiver operating characteristics roc curve was used to evaluate the accuracy of the identified groundwater potential zones kumar and krishna 2018 3 result and discussions the thematic maps generated in the data driven model and gis technique for the selected groundwater prospecting criteria rainfall lulc drainage density lineament density slope geology soil and geomorphology were presented in figs 5 12 respectively as we can see from these maps the thematic layers generated in gis tools were labeled as a whereas the results in the data driven ann model were labeled as b in each map the individual criteria were reclassified based on their importance in indicating the groundwater potential zones the detailed information about the individual criteria was briefed in the next sections 3 1 rainfall the main source of groundwater recharge is rainfall a permeable soil that receives rainfall of high intensity can contribute to high groundwater recharge ahmad et al 2020a the volume of the water stored in an aquifer is a function of the rainfall intensity and the duration water is only stored in the aquifer if the soil and geologic units can transmit it the rechargeability of groundwater depends on the void spaces in the soil geologic structures and the topographic conditions of the area if the rainfall retains for a long time and the soil is permeable there is a high probability to recharge groundwater for potential and permeable aquifers much amount of water is stored when the rain reached the water table as shown in fig 5 the result of reclassified rainfall maps generated in the ann model and gis platform were shown in fig 5b and fig 5a respectively the classifications of the rainfall of the thematic maps in both approaches revealed almost the same categories this indicates that the ann model can also be used as an alternative in generating a thematic map the rainfall was reclassified as very poor 1 1 548 75 1 617 56 mm poor 2 617 56 1 688 70 mm moderate 3 1 688 70 1 762 24 mm high 4 1 762 24 1 834 04 mm and very high 5 1 834 04 1914 07 mm though there is no study available before the current study regarding the quality and quantity of the groundwater in this catchment it is evidenced from the community that the main problem is the quantity 3 2 land use land cover groundwater recharge is the main process through which the rainfall percolates into an aquifer this process is a function of land use and land cover urbanization is increasing in the catchment and the rechargeability of the groundwater is increasing when compared to the past non urbanized areas hamed et al 2018 hadji et al 2018 the reclassified lulc thematic maps generated in the ann model and gis technique were presented in fig 6 b and fig 6a of fig 6 five dominant land uses land covers namely trees cover areas shrub cover areas grassland cropland and swampy areas are available in the study area these were reclassified based on qualitative categories as very poor 1 poor 2 moderate 3 high 4 and very high 5 based on the rate of groundwater recharge 3 3 drainage density the permeability and the percolation rate of rainfall in specific areas are controlled by the drainage density stream networks and the corresponding land surface drained across the length of the channel can indicate the potential groundwater zones the aquifer is potential if the drainage density in the catchment is contributing to groundwater recharge the hydrogeologic conditions and moisture holding capacity of the soil initiates the drainage density and this in turn support the rechargeability of the groundwater drainage density is influenced by the topographic conditions and the permeability of the geologic units if the slope is flat the permeability is very high and the drainage density is very low drainage density derived from digital elevation model dem was classified as very poor 1 6 58 11 70 km km2 poor 2 11 70 17 70 km km2 moderate 3 17 70 24 30 km km2 high 4 24 30 32 50 km km2 and very high 5 32 50 46 60 km km2 the reclassified drainage density of the thematic maps generated in the ann model and gis technique was presented in fig 7b and fig 7a of fig 7 3 4 lineament density the features of the lineament of a watershed provide important evidence about the hydrogeology of a given catchment the features of the lineament density derived from landsat 8 imageries supported by the ground truthing points can provide information about the status of groundwater rechargeability studies conducted in fenta et al 2014 kapilan and elangovan 2018 berhanu and hatiye 2020 confirmed the importance of lineament density in providing information about the rechargeability of the hydrogeologic settings of a catchment lineaments are linear lines and zones of localized weathering that increase the permeability and porosity in the geologic settings the lineament density derived from landsat 8 imageries was classified as very poor 1 0 441 0 685 km km2 poor 2 0 685 0 938 km km2 moderate 3 0 938 1 200 km km2 high 4 1 20 1 530 km km2 very high 5 1 530 2 390 km km2 the thematic maps of the lineament density generated both in gis tools and the ann model were presented in fig 8a and fig 8b of fig 8 respectively 3 5 slope the slope is one of the key significant factors and important in identifying the groundwater recharge zones in a given catchment the basic concept behind the importance of slope in groundwater recharge is the retention period the speed and retention time of surface runoff and the infiltration capacity of the geologic units are influenced by the slope the flat regions in the catchment are good indicators of groundwater potential zones as the retention time and infiltration rate are high the majority of lower portions of the catchment are categorized under steep slopes and the groundwater potential zone ranges from very low to low the speed of the surface runoff is very high and the retention period are very low due to the steepness of the topography when the slope is flat enough the surface runoff gets much time to percolate into the subsurface for this study the slopes were reclassified into five categories to groundwater potential zones as very high 5 6 59 11 30 high 4 11 30 16 6 moderate 3 16 60 23 20 poor 4 23 2 32 1 and very poor 5 32 1 45 8 as shown in fig 9a and fig 9b of fig 9 3 6 geology the existence of groundwater in an aquifer depends on the nature of the geology and permeability of the geologic settings water is stored in the aquifer when the geologic formation holds and conveys the percolating water the amount and volume of water stored in the geology is a function of the hydrogeologic settings of the area the water can only be stored if sufficient void spaces are there between the geologic units the aquifer is assumed to be potential when there are enough spaces in the hydrogeologic settings the geologic units with uniform grain size usually have sufficient porosity and high permeability groundwater recharge occurs from precipitation that percolates into the subsurface from the surface runoff lakes and streams fincha river and fincha lake are permeable and allow the seepage of surface water into the subsurface the dominant geologic classes of the study area are grouped into adigrate sandstone blue nile basalts alluvium colluvium and marsh soils and the corresponding classes to the groundwater potential zones are very poor 1 poor 2 moderate 3 high 4 and very high 5 respectively the reclassified geologic units in the ann and gis platform based on their importance for the delineation of groundwater potential zones are presented in fig 10a and fig 10b of fig 10 3 7 soil the subsurface water is stored in void spaces between the soil particles the volume of water stored in the given hydrologic units depends on the texture and size of the soil particles the existing soil data obtained from the ministry of water mineral and energy mwme was reclassified as a thematic layer in the ann and gis platform as shown in fig 11b and fig 11a of fig 11 respectively reclassification was made based on the permeability and infiltration capacity of the soil however according to the information obtained from productive wells the depths are deep and for such cases the effect of soil is relatively low therefore other factors such as rainfall lulc and drainage density played a great role in recharging and contributing to the sub surface water the percolation of rainfall through soil is one of the interesting features which in turn helps to reach the water if there is a high probability of percolating through the soil it is obvious that much amount of water is stored in the aquifer for the sub basin there is no well documented information about the aquifer but as it can be evidenced from the geophysical investigation conducted it was found that there is high percolation 3 8 geomorphology in the study area seven dominant landforms namely flat plains irregular plains escarpments hills breaks low mountains and high mountains gis tools and ann model were used to reclassify the landforms based on their significance of contributing to groundwater a thematic layer was generated in both methods and the dominant landforms were reclassified into five groups the landforms of a geomorphologic unit vary in terms of their characteristics and spatial distribution the occurrence and movement of the subsurface water depend on the geomorphologic characteristics of the area the low mountainous and flat plains are indicators for the occurrence of groundwater if the hydrogeologic settings transmit water for a geomorphological unit a slope based landform classification was implemented and a quantitative classification namely very poor 1 high mountainous poor 2 hills moderate 3 low mountainous high 4 breaks and very high 5 flat plains as shown in fig 12a and fig 12b of fig 12 the principle of a pair wise comparison matrix developed in ahp and the overall weights for the evaluated criteria for the delineation of groundwater potential zones in the watershed was summarized in table 3 the consistency of the ahp technique in capturing the exploration of surface irrigation potential zones is evaluated by consistency index ci and consistency ratio cr and the summary of this consistency evaluation is as presented in table 3 as we can see from the table the ci 0 1 and indicates that the values of weight assigned for the individual key factor in ahp are correct the final updated weights were initially assigned between the input nodes and the hidden nodes and between hidden nodes and the output node the result of updated weights after backpropagation processes were re assigned in the ann model during the testing periods the updated weights in the ann model were taken after the training processes were reached the productive wells pumping data and other ground truthing data such as the location of spring and hand dug well locations collected by hand gps were used as the target data and the delineation of the groundwater potential was repeatedly evaluated until an agreement was made between the target and the model result since there are eight 8 nodes in the input layer four 4 nodes in the hidden layer and one 1 node in the output layer a total of 38 synoptic connections weights are there in the neural networks nn selected for this specific study the values of weights taken after the training processes the updated values of weight used in the weighted overlay analysis for each criterion were fixed as 0 35 0 19 0 27 0 28 0 07 0 31 and 0 06 for lineament density lulc slope drainage density soil geology and geomorphology respectively 3 9 delineation of groundwater potential zones gpz the values of weights fixed in ann and ahp were used to index groundwater potential zones weights fixed in the training processes and ahp were assigned to the corresponding key factors lineament density lulc slope drainage density soil geology and geomorphology to generate the groundwater potential zones weighted overlay analysis tool in the gis platform was used in both methods the delineated groundwater potential zones using the gis platform and ann model were presented in fig 13 and fig 14 as we can see from fig 13 delineated potential zones were only classified into four qualitative based classifications as high moderate low and very low whereas in fig 14 five groundwater potential zones were identified including very good qualitative classification the probability of getting groundwater potential zones with five classifications was obtained in the ann model whereas four classifications were obtained in the gis platform 3 10 validation of the potential zones the accuracy of the delineated groundwater potential zones further evaluated with existing water sources duan et al 2016 das and pardeshi 2018 berhanu and hatiye 2020 the total number of 51 well locations were collected from the local government office and out of this only 36 well have potential yield and the rest are dried the pumping rate of the potential well were collected since the prediction of the potential zones is probability it mandatory to evaluate the accuracy of the identified zones based on ground truthing points as we can see from the validated potential zones presented in figs 13 and 14 the majority of existing water sources such as shallow and hand dug wells are almost overlapped up to 86 and 82 5 with the delineated potential zones in ann model and gis technique respectively the accuracy of the predicted the potential zones evaluated in roc curve also witness the agreement made between the identified potential zones and the ground truthing points the performance of both methods was evaluated in roc separately as we can see from the figs 15 and 16 the area under curve auc of 0 96 and 0 91 were estimated for the roc curve plotted in the ann and gis results respectively the auc computed in both methods revealed an agreement of 96 and 91 were made between the ground truthing points and the ann model and between gis platforms respectively the roc curve plotted as the false positive x axis and true positive rate y axis was shown in fig 17 4 conclusion the study presents the performance evaluation made between the ann and gis platforms for the delineation of groundwater potential zones in fincha catchment abay basin ethiopia the two methods data driven ann model and the gis technique were successfully applied to delineate the groundwater potential zones using the key significant factors such as rainfall slope lulc soil drainage density lineament density geology and geomorphology as groundwater prospecting criteria the selected criteria were prepared and distributed on the 12 5m 12 5m spatial resolution and normalized before assigning to the neural networks nn the importance of the selected criteria was tanked and weighted in ann and ahp approaches that the training processes and prioritization were implemented in each method respectively the accuracy of the weights generated in the ann training model and ahp approach was evaluated by the target values assigned to the networks and consistency index ci respectively the thematic map was prepared for the individual criteria and the groundwater potential zones were delineated using the weights fixed in the ann training model and ahp respectively five and four classes of groundwater potential zones as very high high moderate low and very low and high moderate low and very low were delineated in the ann and gis platform respectively receiver operating characteristics roc curve developed from pumping rate and ground truthing points were used to validate the accuracy of the predicted groundwater potential zones the area under curve auc computed from the roc curve showed that 96 and 91 agreement were made in the ann model and gis platform results respectively therefore the performance of the ann was better than the gis technique in delineating the potential zones finally it is concluded that the ann model is an effective tool for the delineation of groundwater prospective zones and this paper will recommend that future research will focus on the implementation of the ann model for the delineation of potential groundwater zones for the region where the cost for direct field investigation is not affordable

silicates and anthropogenic activities multivariate analysis did not show very significant hydrochemical spatial zonation but the first major component can be used as an indication of the groundwater flow direction vertically a three part structure around depths of 1 m and 3 7 m were identified and associated with local and intermediate flow systems at the olézoa watershed scale hpi showed short range variations similar to that of ec suggesting compartmentalization of the shallow aquifer on a small scale thus a preliminary conceptual model describing groundwater dynamics has been proposed nbl and median hpi values indicate a serious concern in terms of groundwater qualitative potential and the urgency of regular monitoring of heavy metals in groundwater in this urbanized part of sub saharan africa keywords hydrogeochemical processes groundwater flow system heavy metal pollution index natural background values urban hard rock aquifer cameroon olézoa yaoundé 1 introduction groundwater is a crucial water resource in urban cities built on basement rocks particularly in humid tropical regions where public water supply may be limited due to an increase in consumption and degradation of surface water in cities of sub saharan africa as well as elsewhere in the world the exploitation of groundwater depends on socio economic conditions and the use of pit latrines is the most common way of disposing human waste often in areas where communities especially the poorest ones also depend on groundwater for drinking kulabako et al 2007 lapworth et al 2017 bon et al 2020a this is an impediment to the sustainable consumption of groundwater and requires awareness these water and sanitation issues as well as the significant effect of dramatically increasing urban populations on water supply and distribution systems are on the policy agendas but achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs requires additional efforts in most cities of the world burri et al 2019 mcgill et al 2019 jia et al 2020 sustainable groundwater use requires an adequate understanding of the complexity of natural and anthropogenic processes and how they affect groundwater quality the evolution of groundwater chemistry is a complex process and associated with the natural hydrologic cycle processes tóth 1999 burri et al 2019 jia et al 2020 one major complexity in assessing groundwater quality arises from the 3 d nature of flow systems archbold et al 2016 groundwater systems are often highly heterogeneous meaning that samples from wells in close proximity may produce very different results especially if they are taken from different depths this spatial and vertical heterogeneity with concentrations that can span a wide range of values indicates ion mobility controlled by a series of factors that can vary locally over short distances which can according to post et al 2017 complicate the interpretation of observed patterns moreover the natural groundwater composition also known as natural or geochemical background defines its natural quality and is characterized by large spatial variations at different scales muller et al 2006 thus knowledge of the processes that control the groundwater quality and assessment of the natural background range are crucial in terms of the sustainable management of groundwater resources edmunds et al 2003 biddau et al 2017 the acquisition of this knowledge is based on hydrogeochemical studies whose application allow among other things to apprehend the dynamics of natural or anthropized environments and the formulation of water management policies and decision making rodriguez espinosa et al 2020 bon et al 2020b these investigations have for example allowed to determine the natural background levels nbl or to propose threshold values tv of the chemical components of groundwater muller et al 2006 nakic et al 2007 biddau et al 2017 gao et al 2020b nlend et al 2020 and to represent a summary and communication tool facilitating the presentation of water quality state chen et al 2019 bon et al 2020b chadli and boufala 2021 zhang et al 2021 gao et al 2020b thus indicated that the natural background level nbl is a prerequisite for identifying groundwater pollution and for the evaluation of pollution control effectiveness the combined study of hydrodynamic and hydrochemical groundwater data have also helped define the groundwater flow system and the rate of groundwater renewal ayraud et al 2008 yidana et al 2011 wang et al 2015 lyu et al 2019 nlend et al 2020 li et al 2021 khangembam and singh et al 2021 and even to assess their degree of vulnerability similarly groundwater flow patterns have been defined and considered in groundwater development and protection strategies in some regions of the world see maréchal et al 2018 lyu et al 2019 and li et al 2021 however these studies are numerous whatever the geology in semi arid and mediterranean areas or in coastal aquifers of equatorial regions in the hard rock plutonic and metamorphic rocks areas in particular generally consisting of heterogeneous aquifers lachassagne et al 2011 dewandel et al 2011 maréchal et al 2018 lachassagne et al 2021 the mechanisms of groundwater recharge under equatorial conditions are widely described in the literature see taylor et al 2019 however knowledge of hydrogeology in an urban context remains more fragmented the combined application of water level and chemical data mainly relates to major ions cations and anions without integrating heavy metals somehow rendering the database inconclusive groundwater flow patterns are even less understood in the shallow aquifer saprolite even in semi arid areas where studies on flow distribution and geochemical characteristics in crystalline aquifers consider mainly the fractured zone of the aquifer alazard et al 2015 reactivity in the saprolite may be different on the other hand it is not yet known whether metal pollution levels can show local variations over short distances in the urban watershed as is the case for dissolved uranium concentrations in groundwater from northern burundi post et al 2017 this lack of information does not allow governments to make appropriate decisions especially in a covid 19 setting where people now have to wash their hands regularly they may have to choose between drinking and washing their hands due to insufficient water to do both especially in the countries of sub saharan africa however sustainable urban development implies taking into account and or reducing the threat to groundwater resources particularly in areas where the population is already facing the problem of drinking water supply the objective of this work is to provide suitable knowledge on the characteritics hydrogeochemical and hydrodynamic of shallow hard rock aquifers in a humid tropical urban context for sustainable groundwater use the study was conducted in yaoundé the political capital of cameroon central africa in particular the olézoa watershed 365 ha under strong urbanization and population increase this watershed hosts the university of yaoundé i and other important structures such as the military camp the mvolyé catholic mission diplomatic corps and the university hospital center according to the central bureau for the study and census of the population of cameroon the density per hectare in some places is greater than 600 inhabitants ha against an average of 50 inhabitants ha for the country sixty seven percent of households experience drinking water shortages and a large part of the population uses groundwater for all purposes branchet et al 2019 without reliable information this strong contrast between the magnitude of the importance of groundwater and the lack of adequate information on hydrogeological functioning can compromise the efficient management of groundwater resources this emphasizes the importance of their characterization in order to propose management tools capable of providing orientations for the future exploitation of groundwater therefore the joint assessment of hydrodynamic conditions and physico chemical properties using multivariate statistical analysis methods and the metal pollution index can allow to better understand the functioning of the system and establish a baseline for urban groundwater in this part of sub saharan africa in a changing context 2 material and methods 2 1 location and geomorphological setting the study area is located in the yaoundé region about 250 km from the atlantic coast and between latitudes 3 45 and 4 00 n and longitudes 11 20 and 11 40 e fig 1 the prevailing climate is that of humid tropical environments marked by two rainy seasons march june and september november alternating with two dry seasons december february and july august this region is located in the south cameroonian plateau average altitude 750 m whose landform corresponds to the dismantling of an old iron crust undergoing more humid climatic conditions bitom et al 2004 this morphology is dominated by smooth rocky hills 800 m with large convex slopes relayed by marshy flat valleys 700 m with widths ranging from 50 to 150 m bitom et al 2004 the yaoundé region due to its rapid extension is drained to the north by the foulou tributary of the sanaga river and to the south by the mefou tributary of the nyong river the latter at present is the main source of drinking water supply in the yaoundé city and its surroundings but is insufficiently accessible indeed hydroclimatic conditions combined with the population explosion have increased the population s water needs which are according to reports from the structures in charge of water minee camwater on average estimated at 250 000 m3 day compared to 300 000 m3 day at peak periods while production at the catchment stations akomnyada and mefou is 150 000 m3 day its urban space increased by 10 35 between 1980 and 2017 resulting in a 53 increase in the annual runoff coefficient for the mefou stream jourdan et al 2019 the mefou watershed 421 km² in nsimalen occupies the urbanized part of yaoundé and its main tributaries are the anga a in the south east and the mfoundi 100 km2 which drains the center of the city fig 1 the olézoa topographical watershed is an entity located on the right bank of the mfoundi river running north and northeast the drainage pattern is dendritic and the regional slope of the watershed is northward the topography is undulating with slopes vary between 2 and 21 and an average of 9 07 bon et al 2016a and b bon 2017 the olézoa stream has a dense hydrographic network and a drainage capacity of 1 96 km km2 this watershed is the only one in the sector which within it has five ponds created for fish farming four of which are totally eutrophic due to anthropogenic discharges only the eastern and southwestern parts of the watershed still have vegetation cover with two major landholdings the military and the catholic mission the consequences of this urbanization are visible through the increase in impermeable surfaces the extension of urban agriculture the proliferation of wastewater and household solid waste commercial activities repair shops garages paintings inns etc etc solid landfills and septic tanks bon 2017 which are not listed in this study however branchet et al 2019 indicate that over 70 of the basin s population use pit latrines as their primary mode of sanitation 2 2 geology and hydrogeology southern cameroon which contains the study

proterozoic tectonic slice of the basement that over thrust the yaoundé group to the north fig 2 a champetier de ribes and aubargue 1956 the geological basement of yaoundé consists of migmatites and gneisses belonging to the southern domain of the pan african chain of central africa mvondo et al 2007 ngnoteu et al 2012 these formations outcrop to the north of the edge of the congo craton and are subdivided into two groups of rocks metasedimentary or paragneiss and metaplutonic or orthogneiss rocks meta sedimentary rocks are the most abundant outcrop along the beds of some rivers paragneisses are essentially composed of garnet and kyanite gneisses garnet and plagioclase gneisses marbles and scapolite rocks pyriclasites intruding the metasedimentary unit feldspars tourmaline garnet pyribolites pyroxenites and biotite rich rocks characterize the orthogneisses mvondo et al 2007 it is this last group that constitutes the basement of the olézoa watershed fig 2b the roof of this basement presents an alternation of convex and concave undulations chocolate bar structure mvondo et al 2007 with thicker loose weathered materials in the concave part the weathering rocks under humid tropical conditions resulted in lateritic weathering profiles ngon ngon et al 2009 braun et al 2012 ndjigui et al 2013 which from bottom to top consist of fig 3 i the fractured horizon mostly fresh rock but intersected with fractures due to alteration ii the alteration or alteritic set isalterite surmounted by the alloterite iii the glebular set iron or bauxitic crust comprising two nodular levels surrounding the duricrust which outcrop at certain areas and iv a surface soft level soil which is clayey sandy to sandy clayey and may be absent where the nodular horizon is developed the minerals constituting these lateritic soils ph 5 5 are aluminosilicates k ca2 na silicates fe mg quartz kaolinite gibbsite and oxyhydroxides fe mn braun et al 2012 the profiles are generally thick 10 20 m and are reduced 5 m in areas where rocks are observed fissured horizon or fresh rock near the topographic surface bon et al 2016a 2021 the soil is about 2 m thick hydraulic conductivity generally decreases with depth and varies between 10 4 m s for the soil and the glebular set and 10 6 m s for the weathering set ndam ngoupayou et al 2019 bon et al 2021 the two sets are silty sandy to sandy gravel clay sandy and gravel silty in nature in addition when the duricrust level is impermeable in some areas it constitutes the base of a perched aquifer lachassagne et al 2011 2021 resulting in the presence of two hydrogeological levels within the alterites fig 3 this weathering profile unit iron or bauxitic crust in particularis hydrogeologically functional in high rainfall areas such as those with wet tropical climates belle et al 2018 groundwater is found in phreatic conditions in the weathered mantle shallow aquifer 20 m deep and is exploited through dug wells and springs by the local population for different uses domestic use drinking water etc these waters are in confined to semi confined conditions in fissured fractured zones at deeper levels 20 m and is exploited through boreholes realized by individuals with better financial means generally groundwater discharging as springs is perennial and follows the regional slope the recharging water generally flows from high topographic toward lower topographic areas through the piston flow mechanism fouépé takounjou et al 2020 the groundwater recharge is recent and is mainly done by direct infiltration of current local precipitation with no modification of the original isotopic composition by the evaporation recovery kuitcha et al 2013 the recharge goes from 30 mm year in lowlands to 40 mm year in highlands fouépé takounjou et al 2010 involving a piezometric structure of the aquifer in good agreement with the topography rapid water infiltration can be observed in high areas where fractured bedrock is almost exposed to the surface the proximity of the water table to the topographic surface and the high porosity makes these aquifers more vulnerable to surface contamination 2 3 sampling and chemical analysis twenty five 25 groundwater samples including 7 springs 17 dug wells capturing the shallow aquifer 2 12 m and one borehole fissured aquifer were used to determine the groundwater hydrogeochemical characteristics the sampling points were selected based on criteria such as accessibility owner s agreement and water table conditions for the dug wells these conditions were determined on the basis of weekly piezometric monitoring of thirty five individual dug wells throughout the watershed fig 4 the water samples were taken between april and june 2019 corresponding to the short rainy season samples from the dug wells were taken during hours when water extraction for domestic purposes is most intense between 7 a m and 10 a m in order to obtain a representative sample of water from the aquifer water samples were collected in sterilized 1 l polyethylene bottles according to standard methods prescribed by apha 2012 and stored at 4 c in a cooler for laboratory analysis temperature electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and ph were measured in situ using a hanna hi98129 brand multiparameter the ph and ec tds electrodes were previously calibrated using standard buffer solutions ph 4 01 ph 7 01 and 1413 μs cm respectively the accuracy of temperature ph and ec measurements are 0 5 0 05 and 0 02 units respectively once in the laboratory the raw water samples were filtered by the front filtration method using a thermo scientific nalgene filtration unit the cellulose acetate filters used had a diameter of 47 mm and a pore size of 0 45 mm the filters and the filtration unit were rinsed beforehand with distilled water and then with a few ml of the water to be analyzed the filtered solution was divided into two separate bottles cations and anions washed beforehand with hcl diluted to 0 1 m and rinsed with deionized water nitric acid hno3 ph 2 was added only to the filtrate of cations and trace elements to prevent the possible growth of bacteria the analysis of anions and cations mg ca and k and trace elements was carried out in the laboratory of geosciences of surface formations and applications of the university of yaoundé 1 using a branded multiparameter photometer hanna hi 83300 02 the detection limit and the accuracy of parameters are reported in esm 1 table 1 the cl in cases where the value measured with the multiparameter was outside the limits indicated by the device 0 20 mg l na cl pb and cd were analyzed in the laboratory of geochemistry and water analyses lage at nkolbisson cameroon the load balancing errors of most water samples showed a high anion deficit with an average ratio of 40 this strong deficit is consistent with what is obtained in the waters of the nyong watershed and is due to a high specific charge of organic acids boeglin et al 2003 braun et al 2005 nkoue ndondo et al 2020 2 4 data compilation and statistical analysis methods the data for the various physico chemical parameters obtained in this study were compared with the desirable limit of water potability recommended by the who 2017 major ions were plotted in the piper trilinear diagram 1944 in order to determine the chemical facies of the groundwater which indicate the polluted or unpolluted nature of the water huneau et al 2011 in order to further characterize the physical behavior of the sampling

weighed idw algorithm for spatial interpolation of parameters factor load hpi 2 5 estimation of the pollution index by heavy metals individual chemical parameters are considered descriptors of water quality that can be measured multiple times and at multiple locations this does not allow a water resources manager to have access to simple summarized and well targeted information to make better decisions chadli and boufala 2021 a water quality index represents a summary and communication tool facilitating the presentation of the state of the quality of water resources to the public bon et al 2020b for metals the heavy metal pollution index hpi was calculated to assess the overall water pollution relative to heavy metals this method is based on weighted arithmetic quality prasad and sangita 2008 singh and kamal 2016 an indexation based on weights wi between 0 and 1 has been assigned for each metal and the value of the critical pollution index is 100 prasad and sangita 2008 adeli et al 2021 the unit weight wi was taken as a value inversely proportional to the recommended standard si of a considered parameter iron aluminum manganese nickel lead copper cadmium molybdenum and zinc were used for the application of the index following the formula proposed by mohan et al 1996 1a h p i i 1 n w i q i i 1 n w i with 1b w i 1 s i and 1c q i 100 x v i s i where wi is the unit weightage of the ith parameter or the weight of coefficient on relative values of the variables reza and singh 2010 qi is the sub index of the ith parameter n is the number of parameters considered si is the permissible standard value of the ith parameter the adopted standard is the limit of who 2017 vi is the monitored value of the ith parameter reza and singh 2010 singh and kamal 2016 2 6 determination of natural background levels and threshold values the natural geochemical background nbl and geochemical threshold value tv levels of potentially toxic heavy metals were determined in order to assess metal contamination edmunds et al 2003 define the background level of a substance in groundwater as the concentration of a given element species or chemical present in solution which is derived from natural geological biological or atmospheric sources in terms of process these sources have significant differences local variation in environmental conditions is best reflected when its assessment considers the characteristics of a particular region e g geology and hydrogeology gao et al 2020b various methods and approaches exist in the literature to identify nbls and generally involve geochemical and statistical methods muller et al 2006 nakic et al 2007 rotiroti et al 2015 de caro et al 2017 regardless of the method the technical issues associated with nbl assessment lie in how relatively healthy samples are separated from samples heavily influenced by human activities according to de caro et al 2017 statistical methods include both non parameter and parameter approaches can derive nbl effectively based on monitoring data among the non parametric approaches pre selection is the simplest to address the natural groundwater composition in an aquifer even by non experts and also when no national methodology exists to calculate the nbl de caro et al 2017 nlend et al 2020 nevertheless the application of a simplified preselection method presents common minimum requirements for groundwater quality data e g the elimination of samples obtained from an unknown depth nlend et al 2020 and appropriate pre selection criteria to identify groundwater samples showing no significant anthropogenic impact should be defined muller et al 2006 gao et al 2020b these criteria based on major ions and physicochemical parameters are also valid for metals when the threshold value is based on the natural background level and practical applicability is controlled by standard norms muller et al 2006 rotiroti et al 2015 in contrast to this approach appropriate use for nbl selection from a parametric approach requires a normal or log normal characteristic of the data associated with the data size nakic et al 2007 for example successful use of the iterative 2δ technique requires a relatively large data set n 30 while smaller data sets n 30 the grubbs test is typically applied to rule out abnormal values based on the data distribution gao et al 2020b in this study as the water samples were taken at a known depth the pre selection methodology consisted in considering only analyzes of groundwater with nitrate concentrations below 10 mg l specifically those with nitrate concentrations located in the range of groundwater geogenic backgrounds and weathering fronts in saprolites from tropical environments 0 074 1 0 mg l braun et al 2005 the choice has been reinforced for samples showing hpi values below the critical value of 100 above which the overall pollution level should be considered unacceptable prasad and sangita 2008 the determined nbl was used to estimate the threshold values for groundwater gao et al 2019 last et al 2014 indicate that tv represents a groundwater quality standard based on interactions with aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems interference with legitimate groundwater uses or functions and hydrogeological characteristics including background levels the approach used in this study to determine tv is that proposed by muller et al 2006 and is also applied in other humid tropical environments nlend et al 2020 this approach is based on the relationship between the natural background level and a relevant reference value equation 2 2a n b l r e f t v n b l r e f 2 2b n b l r e f t v n b l the calculation of nbls following the parametric approach was based on the structure for calculating natural background values developed by nakic et al 2007 see esm 1 fig 1 because the data sets were smaller n 30 the grubbs test was applied to rule out abnormal values based on the data distribution see gao et al 2020b the statistical distribution of hydrochemical data was evaluated using the kolmogorov smirnov test p value 0 05 however some authors reimann and de caritat 2017 reimann et al 2018 believe that using the limits of the tukey boxplot which allow to determine the tif tukey internal fence has the great advantage that the definition of the threshold depends on the statistical distribution of the robust inner core of the data the tif provides estimates that are most often quite close to the 98th percentile and is probably the best method of identifying sites that will require special attention because they are unusual reimann and de caritat 2017 the tif is calculated on the log transformed data in order to reduce the skewness of the data distribution thus eliminating outliers biddau et al 2017 reimann et al 2018 gao et al 2019 thus when data distribution was favorable the tif was calculated as follows 3 t i f q 3 1 5 i q r where q3 stands for the 3rd quartile equivalent to the 75th percentile and iqr is the interquartile range 75th 25th percentile the multiplying factor of 1 5 in the formula is based on the assumption of a symmetrical data distribution a comparison of the tv and tif values was done in order to identify any similarities between these two methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 piezometric characteristics water extraction from dug wells in the study area was done at a shallow depth 16 m the piezometric surface was generally found at the heart of the alterites and close to the soil the depths of the dug wells in some areas were correlated with the topography the deepest dug wells in general were at the top or on the hillside the groundwater levels in the 35 dug wells ranged from 0 5 to 11 85 m with an average of 3 2 m fig 5 a the amplitude of piezometric variation in the entire watershed was between 0 1 and 4 95 m with an annual average of 1 08 1 01 m this clearly shows that hydrogeological functioning is not marked by a mass of basal groundwater with a low hydraulic gradient the influence of topography on piezometric variations is very significant fig 5b the groundwater discharge evolves according to an exponential law characteristic of environments with high inertia bon et al 2016a ndam ngoupayou et al 2019 bon et al 2021 this characteristic is similar to that generally observed within the majority of the world s shallow weathered hard rock aquifers asia europe other african countries in a similar climatic context see freeze and cherry 1979 taylor et al 2019 lachassagne et al 2021 indeed lachassagne et al 2021 indicate hard rock aquifers notably in the parts of the world where the recharge is significant groundwater watersheds are very similar to surfacewater watersheds the piezometric heads being subparallel to the topographic surface the high points were in the same places as the topographic domes and can be identified as the groundwater recharge areas however the topographic context slope varying from 2 to 21 and the humid climate can imply heterogeneous recharge processes on the whole catchment area contrary to the area of brittany france where the homogeneous topography relatively flat and the temperate climate imply homogeneous recharge processes on the whole territory ayraud et al 2008 the most representative groundwater flow directions are ne sw nne ssw e w and es e w nw esm 1 fig 2 gullies made up of ponds and hydromorphic zones are wet all year round indicating a supply of surface water by groundwater strong horizontal hydraulic gradients were observed respectively at these directions 0 065 or 0 118 0 158 0 068 and 0 071 as expected from hard rock aquifers with limited hydraulic conductivity these can be greater than 1 depending on the hydraulic conductivity value perrin et al 2011 lachassagne et al 2021 this groundwater flows direction were consistent with the main topographic lines indicating as described by bitom et al 2004 bon et al 2021 that the modeling of the landscape is induced by the hydrographic network therefore groundwater flows are then modeled on this morphology with flows from high points to low points thus the northeast and east parts serve as recharge areas and the water moves from these areas to the southwest west like that of the olézoa stream this stream is local minima of topographic relief and can be considered seepage boundary for the shallow aquifer the piezometric amplitudes corresponding to this altitudinal distribution were between 1 63 and 4 95 m average 3 15 m in dug wells at the summit between 0 28 and 2 58 m average 1 14 m in the mid slope zones against 0 1 and 1 71 m average 0 61 m at the bottom of the slope where the redistribution of water is slower in fact the characterization of hydrological processes in humid tropical environments has shown a contribution of 4 for lowland aquifers against 65 for mid slope aquifers maréchal et al 2011 nevertheless the distribution of piezometric amplitudes related to the topography seems to highlight a topographic zoning of groundwater flow in the study area 3 2 shallow groundwater hydrogeochemistry the main geochemical characteristics of groundwater are summarized in table 1 the ph values ranged from 4 09 to 5 68 and from 3 83 to 5 32 with median values of 5 18 and 4 95 respectively in the dug wells and springs indicating a zero to low buffering capacity as indicated by appelo and postma 2005 the consumption of carbonic acid during the dissolution of silicate minerals results in increased alkalinity and ph values the observed ph values 6 in the study area can therefore be attributed to a low degree of chemical weathering this result is in agreement with that obtained in natural crystalline environments in humid tropical climates ph between 3 5 and 5 6 where the surface residual aquifer laterite depleted in basic cations is recharged by rainwater boeglin et al 2003 braun et al 2005 kortatsi et al 2008 ahoussi et al 2010 yidana et al 2011 kuitcha et al 2013 post et al 2017 rejith et al 2021 which is acidic for the case of the south cameroon plateau ph 5 2 neutral ph of rainwater between 5 6 and 5 8 braun et al 2005 apart from the crystalline nature of the bedrock granito gneiss formations or lateritic soils see for example minerals in the section geology and hydrogeology various studies indicate that the oxidation of certain minerals e g pyrite eq 4 and the production of co2 in the surface soil cover under the action of biological activities can be a source of water acidity in these environments boeglin et al 2003 appelo and postma 2005 ayraud et al 2008 kortatsi et al 2008 nkoue ndondo et al 2020 adeli et al 2021 4 f e s 2 3 5 o 2 h 2 o f e 2 2 s o 4 2 2 h the tds as an important measure of water palatability had a median of 232 and 183 mg l in dug wells and springs respectively these values were below the who guide value and indicated soft water tds 1000 mg l according to the classification of freeze and cherry 1979 electrical conductivity ec values ranged from 55 to 946 μs cm and 158 549 μs cm with median values of 465 and 368 μs cm respectively in dug wells and springs these values indicated a high to significant mineralization compared to what is observed in most water from woody areas without mining activities of southern cameroon 6 3 55 6 μs cm boeglin et al 2003 braun et al 2005 rakotondrabe et al 2018 in many shallow residual aquifers in africa 37 3 75 1 μs cm kortatsi et al 2008 yidana et al 2011 and india 100 μs cm rejith et al 2021 and generally in granitic environments 50 300 μs cm where water rock interaction processes involve silicate minerals sio2 65 with low solubility boeglin et al 2003 biddau et al 2017 wali et al 2019 adeli et al 2021 the carbonate deficiency of these rocks results in poorly buffered waters smedley et al 1995 this suggests that these natural environments have a low dispersion index id ratio of the variance to the mean in contrast to urban environments as is the case in the present study 141 dug wells and 56 springs in these environments ec values may start near the geogenic background and mean value of poorly mineralized tropical urban rainwater 12 8 71 7 μs cm kulabako et al 2007 kuitcha et al 2012 and extend to highly mineralized groundwater 1000 μs cm that is not expected in natural environments in the tropics due to the strongly positive water balance kringer et al 2016 the no3 values ranged from 1 0 103 5 mg l with mean value 51 3 mg l concentrations were above the who standard value table 1 and the natural background level of nitrates in groundwater 10 mg l selvakumar et al 2017 levels above this background limit are an indicator of nitrate contamination through various human activities these concentrations except d4 1 0 mg l were higher than the nitrate concentrations in the geogenic background of groundwater in a tropical forest environment of the southern cameroonian plateau 0 07 to 0 6 mg l that of the saprolite weathering front being 0 074 1 0 mg l braun et al 2005 and in some lateritic aquifers elsewhere in the world e g india 5 1 mg l rejith et al 2021 and ghana 20 mg l kortatsi et al 2008 but quite close to the average nitrate concentration 54 85 mg l obtained by ouedraogo et al 2016 on a pan african scale compared to shallow hard rock aquifer water in the humid tropical environment of kampala in uganda 129 5 mg l kulabako et al 2007 these concentrations remain low hco3 has shown low concentrations consistent with the average alkalinity well below 1 meq l of the urban tropical environment of yaoundé ins and bgr 2013 kringel et al 2016 this is a complementary result to the acidic ph values found in groundwater the variability of hco3 is much greater 0 142 mg l from very low mineralized waters consistent with low silicate hydrolysis to high concentrations this is common in shallow urban hard rock aquifers where alkalinity differences of more than 20 orders of magnitude can be found yidana et al 2011 ouandaogo yameogo et al 2013 wali et al 2019 rejith et al 2021 this implies very high partial pressures of co2 pco2 related to the mineralization of anthropogenic organic matter ouandaogo yameogo et al 2013 or suggests heterogeneity of alkalinity produced by the alteration of silicate minerals indeed the molar concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 esm 1 table 2 ions showed that 96 of water samples had a ratio ca2 mg2 hco3 0 5 suggesting a predominance of weathering by organic acids to the detriment of carbonic acid nkoue ndondo et al 2020 the trilinary piper diagram of major ions revealed a diversity of hydrogeochemical facies with a strong anthropogenic imprint as indicated by the anion triangle fig 6 the types of groundwater encountered were camg cl 41 camg hco3 21 nak hco3 13 ca cl 8 and nak cl 4 the mixed facies corresponding to the samples d6 camg cl to ca cl and s2 d3 camg hco3 to camg cl represented 4 and 8 respectively this diversity of facies illustrates a heterogeneity of hydrochemical processes within the aquifer matrix zaidi et al 2019 bon et al 2020b or is related to groundwater flow systems back 1966 the arrangement of the points in the gibbs diagram fig 7 a suggests that rock weathering or rock water interactions associated with exogenous sources are the primary sources of control of groundwater chemistry and hydrochemistry the dominance of the ca mg cl facies involves a mixing process of anthropogenic pollution linked to surface contamination sources such as domestic sewage and septic tank effluent and ion exchange with existing water the camg hco3 facies reflects the natural geochemical processes on the groundwater chemistry that particularly correspond to the weathering of silicates under groundwater recharge in the relatively permeable weathered zone kortatsi et al 2008 srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 ewodo mboudou et al 2019 bon et al 2020a b khan et al 2020 nlend et al 2020 minerals in the rocks of the study area as noted earlier in the geology and hydrogeological section can thus be dissolved by meteoric water producing this type of facies in other studies conducted elsewhere in the world srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 ligavha mbelengwa and gomo 2020 wisitthammasri et al 2020 this facies is typically associated with recently recharged water in addition yaoundé meteoric water is dominated by ca2 and hco3 kuitcha et al 2012 so it is logical to suggest that shallow groundwater be recharged by rainfall this result are commonly recognized in other shallow aquifers worldwide wang et al 2015 gao et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 this suggests a common hydrogeological characteristic of shallow aquifers this characteristic also implies that the hydrogeochemical processes of these aquifers are associated with the natural hydrologic cycle processes burri et al 2019 jia et al 2020 in the anion triangle some dug wells showed a drift from the bicarbonate pole to the pole cl no3 according to ouandaogo yameogo et al 2013 this drift suggests that the dissolution of silicates is favored by the mineralization of anthropogenic organic matter dissolution of silicate minerals can also produce the nak hco3 type but some authors believe that this facies is characteristic of camg hco3 water type that have undergone evolution by ion exchange from recharge to discharge zones in the groundwater flow system appelo and postma 2005 yidana et al 2011 the distribution of some groundwater samples on the left side in the ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 plot fig 7 b and molar ratio ca2 mg2 hco3 is globally far from 1 see esm 1 table 2 this implies the ion exchange in geochemical processes in the study area wisitthammasri et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 and a secondary origin of ca 2 and mg 2 other than the dissolution of carbonate minerals srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 jia et al 2020 the absence of halites in this area would limits the geogenic contribution to the ca cl water type leaching of the upper layers of the soil from industrial and domestic activities eg use of sodium hypochlorite could lead to the formation of a nak cl facies in some areas na concentrations were moreover higher than those found in contact with the un weathered rock 4 1 5 9 mg l braun et al 2005 these anthropogenic inputs seem to justify the globally high concentrations of po4 3 median 0 08 to 0 13 mg l compared to what is generally observed in the shallow groundwater of granito gneissic formations 0 03 mg l meybeck 1984 the concentration of heavy metals generally varied between 0 and 1 2 mg l in the dug wells against 0 and 0 16 mg l in springs with the exception of mn cu pb cd and ag whose concentrations varied between 0 15 10 3 and 1 2 mg l and between 0 24 10 3 and 1 2 mg l in dug wells and springs respectively table 1 further analysis of these elements will be made in the following sections 3 3 multivariate analysis results 3 3 1 correlation matrix the study of associations between variables using the correlation matrix is useful in showing the consistency of the data set a high correlation coefficient close to 1 or 1 means a good relationship between two variables and its value around zero means no relationship between them at a significant level of p 0 05 varol and davraz 2014 in this study the relationship among each of the hydrogeochemical parameters was considered according to a pearson correlation matrix the parameters showing correlation coefficients r 0 5 and r between 0 3 and 0 5 were considered as strongly correlated and weakly correlated respectively the correlation matrices of all parameters including 26 for the springs and 27 for the dug wells were presented in table 2 ec showed a high positive or even perfect correlation with tds r 0 9 which implies the absence of less soluble charged compounds in groundwater that may contribute to total dissolved solids khan et al 2020 the positive correlation of other ions with ec and tds suggests their significant contribution to groundwater chemistry especially in springs the negative springs and no dug wells correlation between tds and na associated with a na cl ratio showing nearly 55 of values less than 1 esm 1 fig 3 suggests that the silicate weathering reaction or cation exchange was not the primary source of na the strong and positive correlation between cl and no3 suggests the contribution of domestic wastewater septic tank effluent and animal waste in the pollution of groundwater by nitrates the chloride contents in rainwater from yaoundé are 1 3 0 7 mg l kuitcha et al 2012 indicating a limited intake of chloride in groundwater this suggests that high levels of cl especially in dug wells indicate additional inputs other than atmospheric deposition its origin can be attributed to geogenic sources dissolution of chlorine bearing minerals present in igneous rocks such as apatite biotite and amphibole and to potential anthropogenic sources particularly water treatment chlorination of groundwater and human or animal wastewater according to kortatsi et al 2008 and khan et al 2020 the highly destructive nature of the acidic environment which leads to the concentration of certain ions results in a positive and sometimes negative correlation between ph and other ions precipitation of fe oxyhydroxides can explain low correlation between fe and so2 4 especially in dug wells kortatsi et al 2008 indicate that precipitation of iron in the amorphous fe oh 3 and hydrated form hematite feooh a characteristic mineral of weathering rocks in hot and humid climates can be observed when the so4 2 contents are low median 2 7 mg l in this study the correlation between nickel and copper indicates that they could come from the same source such as the corrosive activity of the ni cu alloy in a household material the bond observed between fe pb and cd suggests a common origin of these three elements in fact the geology of the study area consist of orthogneiss whose weathering results to ferrallitic soils see section 2 2 as such giving iron a natural terrigenous origin according to adeli et al 2021 this correlation is generally observed due to their similar geochemical behavior including adsorption and dissolution in geochemical environments the potential adsorption of cd primarily by aluminosilicates such as clay minerals as well as iron oxy hydroxides results in significant correlations between this element and fe and al therefore the weak affinity of iron or strong negative with cd and pb suggests an anthropogenic origin of these heavy metals in water this observation is also valid for mn and zn whose weak negative correlation implies according to towfiqul islam et al 2017 the existence of different sources and processes of metal pollution see urban environment section 2 1 various degrees of correlation between different pairs of parameters were observed in springs and dug wells and may be related to contrasting conditions of flow and heterogeneity of shallow groundwater 3 3 2 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca reduces the dimensionality of a multivariate data set into fewer components that describe and explain the information contained in the data jehan et al 2020 thus the pca of all data contributed for a maximum of eight 8 and six 6 components responsible for 85 84 and 100 of the total variance having eigenvalues greater than 1 for dug wells and springs respectively esm 1 fig 4 table 3 the percentages represented by each factor are relatively low indicating a limited structuring of the variance characteristic of water whose mineralization is controlled by many factors their combined action has led to the existence of the different categories of water shown in the piper diagram fig 6 in water from dug wells ec tds mg2 k so4 2 hco3 no3 and br showed high positive loads 0 5 at factor 1 and expressed 20 84 of the total variance table 3a k and no3 presented higher loads 0 6 except tds and ec however wisitthammasri et al 2020 indicated that k is generally less abundant than other ions and is present in groundwater at concentrations below 5 mg l average 10 mg l in this study this shows an anthropogenic imprint leading to a subsequent increase of tds ec the ion combinations influencing the high positive loads observed on the first factor suggest that this main factor was associated with a combination of various hydrogeochemical processes that contribute to the mineralization of groundwater in the study area this finding is not surprising in shallow aquifers in urban areas where mineralization is broadly controlled by both geogenic processes related to water soil rock interactions and the effects of human activities ouandaogo yameogo et al 2013 rajmohan et al 2017 chen et al 2019 gao et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 geogenic processes can be characterized by weathering of silicate minerals oxidation reduction eq 4 and ion exchange fig 7 b the general reaction reflecting the water silicate rocks interactions can be written garrels and mackenzie 1967 na ca mg k silicates h2co3 h4sio4 hco3 na ca mg k solid products however in crystalline terrains weathering usually takes place to a very limited extend because of the limited quantity of weatherable material kortatsi et al 2008 and fouépé takoundjou et al 2020 reported that natural processes such as the incongruent dissolution of silicates that react with co2 gas from root respiration and aqueous co2 could be a mechanism that releases na and k into the groundwater rock water reactions are generally ph dependent thus the low contribution of ph to f1 suggests a low influence of ph on mineralization this implies that anthropogenic activities small industries landfills and sewage may be the main potential contributor influencing the groundwater chemistry of this factor ligavha mbelengwa and gomo 2020 also showed a low contribution of ph to f1 due to a variety of anthropogenic sources as the main potential factor influencing groundwater chemistry in a typical karoo aquifer in beaufort west town south africa in line with the observations of these authors this factor can be called major component of ionic pollution no3 concentration in groundwater is obviously linked to the influence of sources of anthropogenic origin return irrigation fertilizers and wastewater treatment and no3 showed a combination with hco3 according to subba rao et al 2006 the combination of hco3 and no3 ions is an indication of the hydrogeochemical effect of runoff leaks on groundwater indeed the transformations mineralization of organic matter for example produced at the surface are caused by leaching of the soil with the infiltration of rainwater this is further accentuated in humid tropics where high intensity rainfall events pose a risk to shallow groundwater in urban settings due to reduced attenuation in the unsaturated zone when groundwater intersects with the base of pit latrines and sewer networks lapworth et al 2017 the factor f2 expressed 15 02 of the total variance and had high positive loads for the variables ph so4 2 hco3 in dug wells this factor also exhibited a high negative load for cl 0 61 and can thus express the hydrolysis of silicate minerals with infiltration of water containing carbon dioxide and organic acids as indicated by wisitthammasri et al 2020 the control of ph and the so4 2 hco3 levels is generally assumed to occur by natural processes the leaching of organic matter resulting from the oxidation of pyrite or precipitation of fe oxyhydroxides which produces sulphates and hydrogen ions would have created an acidic environment see eq 4 favoring the dissolution of silicates so4 2 and hco3 are probably the result of the oxidation of organic matter which has seeped from the surface into the subsoil causing an increase in ph subba rao et al 2006 conclude that bicarbonate concentrations and ph in groundwater are the result of the reaction of soil co2 with the dissolution of silicate minerals during water soil and water rock interactions factor 2 can be an acid mineralization factor the loads of so4 2 and hco3 ions in the two main components indicate that their concentration in groundwater is controlled by several factors notably weathering linked to anthropized organic acids and carbonic acids hco3 and both mineral dissolution oxidation and anthropogenic effect so4 2 however although so4 2 correlates with component 1 it has a higher load with component 2 suggesting that the processes represented by component 2 have a greater effect on the concentration of so4 2 than those represented by component 1 it is slightly the opposite for hco3 ion factor 3 with 11 63 of the total variance exhibited high positive loads 0 65 in ni and f this factor also exhibited a high negative load in mo 0 58 ni is a siderophilic element that can arise from the pedogenic process municipal discharges and vehicle emissions xiao et al 2019 on the other hand the concentration of fluoride in groundwater is generally attributed to leaching of fluoride bearing minerals exchange of fluoride and oh ions in clay minerals and intensive use of fertilizers subba rao et al 2006 machiwal and jha 2015 wisitthammasri et al 2020 the positive and negative loads in the other factors are strongly represented by metallic trace elements including mn cu cd pb by these groupings these factors can reflect a metallic mineralization of geogenic and anthropogenic origin corroborating with the geological and environmental context of the area wastewater discharges processing of materials such as welding presence of garages and automobile exhaust in the water from springs ph ec tds t c so4 2 cl hco3 no3 fe and mn exhibited high loads on f1 which represented 29 98 of the total variance table 3b these elements would come from the mixture of natural processes particularly weathering reactions ph ec tds t c so4 2 and hco3 oxidation reduction fe mn so4 2 fe and superficial inputs anthropogenic sources in the water mineralization of the area cl no3 this factor is also loaded by the ph fe and mn which may indicate the role of ph in the mobility of these elements which according to adeli et al 2021 is done in soluble conditions the factor f2 expressed 25 36 of the total variance and had high positive loads for the variables t c mg2 cu ni and f this factor also had high negative loads for al pb br and ag this factor may seemingly have a lithogenic source anthropogenic sources of br urban runoff pesticides and disinfectant products wisitthammasri et al 2020 and cu such as industrial effluents and domestic wastewater are unlikely in factor 2 while mg and f are often used to qualitatively determine the reserve and leaching of the bedrock the high negative load in so4 2 0 7 and low in ph 0 4 suggests that the leaching of organic matter resulting from the oxidation of pyrite does not occur in factor 2 factor 3 expressed 17 62 of the total variance and exhibited high positive loads in k zn and mo and high negative loads in ca2 and po4 2 like ni zn is believed to come from municipal waste and vehicle emissions and galvanized products mo could come from the oxidation of molybdenite linked to pyrite in these waters this element is not associated with sulfate or iron indicating an anthropogenic origin of this element in water unlike dug well water the other factors are less represented by metallic trace elements implying a small metallic footprint but a tendency to pollution linked to urban agriculture k po4 2 3 3 3 spatial distribution of groundwater quality based on factor scores the scores maps of the first three factors have been represented since they seem to globally involve the main geogenic and anthropogenic processes that influence the water quality of the area factor 1 scores ranged from 4 19 to 3 12 and 62 of the factor scores in most places ranged from 0 56 to 3 12 fig 8 a this suggests that the effect of geogenic and anthropogenic processes in the study area is omnipresent however the factor scores are very low 0 5 along or near the stream which is the lowest topographically and potentially high mineralization zone according to the commonly presented hydrogeochemical model tóth 1999 the dug wells corresponding to this zone presented low tds varying between 28 and 275 mg l mean 133 mg l while the zones presenting scores 0 5 presented high mineralization 169 473 mean 284 mg l most of the dug wells located in this zone low scores exhibited nitrate concentrations 46 mg l with the exception of dug wells d14 52 mg l and d18 108 mg l the high levels of which may involve local contamination related to effluent from latrines dug well 4 with an no3 concentration of less than 10 mg l can be considered as a natural biogenic background this suggests that the acidification is due to biogeochemical processes generation of co2 in the soil through the respiration of roots and the decomposition of organic matter or the mineralization of anthropogenic organic matter promotes the dissolution of silicates as discussed earlier unlike factor 1 factor 2 had high scores 0 63 and 3 73 in the low mineralization zone fig 8b which is also of high acidity ph mean 4 6 a similar analysis by dragon and gorski 2015 in poland had indicated that the areas with low scores are the areas where the potential effects due to infiltration are relatively higher this means that the whole study area could act as a recharge area the presence of high scores f2 near the stream illustrates an unexpected trend in groundwater tds evolution in the study area this type of trend also observed in the southern edge of the chinese loess plateau jia et al 2020 may imply the influence of surface water on the mineralization likely dilution with a decrease in tds of groundwater due to the hydraulic connections generally observed between them it would be important to carry out additional studies to clarify these exchanges but if the piezometric study revealed the gain conditions for the olézoa stream bon et al 2021 factor 3 scores varied between 3 05 and 4 83 but the highest scores were observed in the center of the watershed and the lowest downstream and upstream of the watershed fig 8c the distribution of these scores illustrates the urban structure of the area which is marked by a strong increase of commercial activities repair shops garages paintings inns etc and solid landfills in the center of the basin favored by the presence of relatively gentle slopes bon 2017 these anthropogenic activities can therefore lead to the release of plumbing materials containing lead the concentration of corrosion of household materials nickel or copper alloys some concentrations are due to leaching from surface solid waste landfills these elements which are leached reach the water table especially under humid conditions 3 3 4 correlation of pc to water table depth the factor 1 expressing 20 84 of the total variance presented a high load 0 5 with the depth of the water table the other factors having presented very low or even zero loads the distribution of scores for the first principal component is omnipresent in the area with positive high scores at high topographic points and negative scores at low topographic points these topographical points are at the watershed scale and in a manner consistent with general hydrogeological knowledge groundwater recharge and discharge zones respectively freeze and cherry 1979 this means that a large part of the watershed could serve as a recharge area consistent with the discussion in section 3 3 3 and that groundwater flow can be an important element on the first main factor subba rao et al 2006 showed that the first principal component acts as a dominant and extensive controlled factor in the aquifer when the score distribution pattern of this component is spread over most of the anantapur district andhra pradesh india they suggested that when topography controls the depth of groundwater levels which in turn controls the water quality the distribution pattern of the scores of the first major component can be used as an indication of the direction of groundwater flow with due regard to topographical features groundwater levels and human activities the decrease in scores from upstream to downstream is very similar to the topography gradient and therefore to groundwater flows as indicated by subba rao et al 2006 the second principal component score distribution pattern is an indication of a hydrogeologically isolated environment caused by local changes in groundwater flow 3 3 5 hierarchical cluster analysis the shape of the dendrogram showed the grouping into two main groups and five sub groups with varying levels of similarity fig 9 a group i with a distance of 84 were linked to those from group ii at a distance of 55 and tds corresponding to this groups were 316 and 148 mg l respectively other than this decrease in tds between main groups the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater did not show very significant zonation in the study area this is consistent with the ubiquitous factor 1 see principal component analysis and implies an integrated influence of anthropogenic and natural factors on groundwater chemistry the average stiff diagram of each group clearly shows the differences and similarities among clusters fig 9b all groups exhibited low so4 2 concentrations and showed facies consistent with that of piper diagram fig 6 the two pairs c1 c3 and c4 c5 are quite similar with ca2 dominance but differ on the anion side because of the high cl concentration in c1 and c5 these groups are all characterized by the ca cl type but compared to c3 c1 showed much higher mg2 concentrations this again shows a hydrogeochemical consistency on the mixing process of various water pollution sources in contrast to these 4 groups in c2 the dominant ions were hco3 for the anion and ca2 na k cations the magnitude of which indicates an ion exchange consistent with the ca mg vs hco3 so4 plot fig 7b previous analyses have indicated that the camg hco3 and nak hco3 facies reflect natural geochemical processes including silicate weathering and ion exchange ligavha mbelengwa and gomo 2020 indicated that the ca hco3 hydrochemical facies typically defines the chemistry after the first phase of evolution during recharge the ions ca2 and mg2 expressing the role of calcium feldspars and ferromagnesium biotite respectively according to back 1966 c2 with camg hco3 type implies an initial stage of groundwater evolution due to the geogenic process while the four others groups indicate a later or intermediate stage depending on the values of tds and hco3 chen et al 2019 indicate that this gradation of water evolution involves a combination of processes that result in nonlinear dynamic behaviors of chemical constituents within the aquifer matrix 3 4 groundwater flow systems 3 4 1 landscape chemical compartmentalization the distribution of groundwater flow is strongly influenced by topography and organized between slopes and the partitioning of recharge between shallow local and deep regional groundwater transfers goderniaux et al 2013 the hydrochemical flow of groundwater systems can also relate to this morphology some authors have indicated that the increase in upstream to downstream mineralization is significant when the main process contributing to mineralization is water rock interaction yidana et al 2011 ligavha mbelengwa and gomo 2020 this implies greater mineralization in landfill areas where the piezometric level is generally close to the ground independently of the other hydrogeological factors various studies have shown that the position of groundwater level is related to the climatic conditions and thus to the recharge rate of the water table indeed under wet hyper recharge conditions 4000 mm year nlend et al 2020 groundwater levels are close to the topographic surface whereas in semi arid areas with low recharge 15 mm year to 25 mm year cheo et al 2017 macdonald et al 2021 the groundwater levels are very low thus limiting the interception of the piezometric surface by topography freeze and cherry 1979 bon et al 2021 according to goderniaux et al 2013 water circulations are more local for high recharge rates while low recharge rates mainly lead to regional circulations various authors mifflin 1988 ayraud et al 2008 dragon and gorski 2015 have used geochemical tools to compartmentalize flows local regional in this study the na k vs cl so4 2 ionic ratio showed that the groundwater flow systems in the area are 88 local against 12 for intermediate flows fig 10 a the intermediate flows correspond to dug wells 1 and 10 located between 773 and 737 m altitude with a thickness of the unsaturated zone of 9 and 4 m respectively the chemical facies corresponding to these dug wells are camg cl and camg hco3 respectively indicating that groundwater flow in the metaplutonite aquifer system alters the facies distribution this predominance of local flows shows once again the groundwater surface relationship to this effect goderniaux et al 2013 indicate that in the presence of high recharge rates groundwater streamlines are generally short between recharge areas which form a very dense hydrographic network the evolution of the average concentrations of no3 na and tds according to the landscape showed an enrichment of no3 and tds from the mid slope zone downstream while the concentration of these parameters decreased from upstream to the mid slope zone the mean na concentration indicated a decrease from upstream to downstream fig 10b the downstream enrichment of tds from the mid slope zone is consistent with the hydrogeochemical flow model which is characterized by the increase in tds from high to low points as they pass through the flow system perrin et al 2011 alazard et al 2015 with high points representing recharge areas lachassagne et al 2021 indicate that when springs and rivers drain the aquifer in the basement zone the aquifer s discharge zone cannot be contrasted with an upstream aquifer recharge zone due to the unconfined nature of the aquifer the entire watershed of the aquifer contributes to its recharge therefore mid slope areas which are topographically discharge areas can also be recharge areas the ionic behavior appears to indicate different hydrodynamic and geochemical characteristics and changes in hydrogeochemical conditions along the groundwater flow path it is consistent with the discussion on correlation of pc to water table depth suggesting the existence of hydrogeologically isolated environments the stratification of mineralization is very similar to that of the landscape and therefore to the hydrodynamic conditions we are therefore in the presence of an organization of flows between the slopes with several local groundwater systems linked to the hilly nature of the study area see location and geomorphological setting bhattacharya et al 2012 indicated that local topography can influence the amount of groundwater flow divides and local flow systems can lead to shorter residence times and intense flushing and therefore low content of minerals in groundwater this distribution of hydrochemistry belonging to the groundwater spatial types demonstrates the complete embodiment of the groundwater flow system to hydrogeology and landform illustrated by other work elsewhere in the world yidana et al 2011 dragon and gorski 2015 wang et al 2015 khangembam and singh 2021 lower concentrations of na observed in the downstream sector of the aquifer contrast with the progressive mineralization that generally occurs along the flow lines this assumes that the input of na in groundwater is related to the proximity of anthropogenic sources with many student dormitories particularly water from pit latrines and the leakage of solid waste in the water mineralization where pit construction is based on the common principle of digging deep for a long fill time deep dug wells may therefore be more prone to direct contamination in addition to this the practice of regular disinfection of dug wells with chlorine bleach however some upstream dug wells have a weathered layer that acts more like a porous medium with a high storage capacity thus buffering the vertical flow except when preserved fractures are present as indicated by lachassagne et al 2011 2021 with an increase in transit times groundwater flowing through this layer will have relatively high concentrations of dissolved elements and higher mineralization due to the relatively long transit time and high solubility of the intercepted materials similarly bon et al 2021 indicate that the thickness and hydrodynamic properties of this layer may be more or less favorable to flow resulting in variable tds values while upstream downstream mineralization ionic enrichment is generally related to water rock interaction the decrease observed in this study may imply according to muller et al 2006 attenuation of elemental concentrations in a groundwater body with a long travel time between the recharge and discharge zone 3 4 2 evolution of chemical parameters with water table depth water depth is an important parameter in the identification of geochemical processes and even of the degree of vulnerability of water tables some authors wang et al 2015 machiwal and jha 2015 nlend et al 2020 have indicated that groundwater levels have significant effects on groundwater quality since the groundwater quality parameters are diluted during the rainy season due to the recharge of rainwater the groundwater levels of the dug wells sampled for quality n 17 varied from 0 5 10 m no chemical parameter showed a very strong correlation for example r 0 7 with the water table depth table 2a many authors modeled the distribution of groundwater chemistry in shallow hard rock aquifers in france ayraud et al 2008 and in india alazard et al 2015 maréchal et al 2018 and showed a lack of significant correlation between water table depth and chemical components ions and apparent water age therefore the lack of correlation indicates a heterogeneous characteristic of the aquifer consistent with what is observed in the hard rocks zones based on the stiff diagram we notice a vertical structure in three parts around the average depths 1 and 8 m and a trend of increasing tds and hco3 with depth fig 9b similar studies in china by wang et al 2015 and li et al 2021 to characterize groundwater hydrochemistry as a function of depth showed an inverse behavior illustrating what is generally observed in environments with less anthropogenic impact however tóth s 1999 classic model the lower reaches of a groundwater basin could be the discharge area of local intermediate and regional flow systems na and no3 showed a good positive correlation with the water table depth r 0 5 the concentration of na decreased above 1 m corresponding to the low altitude areas where the piezometric fluctuations are weak this zone has been identified as the one with imposed potential of stream stream boundary where the dug wells have piezometric levels very close to the ground surface except p18 the enrichment of this ion with the water table depth is similar to the tds from eight meters fig 10b where the dug wells located at high altitude show strong piezometric fluctuations there is no noticeable trend in na concentrations between these two depths 1 8 m the area corresponding to average piezometric fluctuations similarly high concentrations of no3 have been observed in shallow and deep dug wells fig 10b several studies indicate that elevated na concentrations in groundwater are frequently observed after long term water rock e g na plagioclase minerals interactions due to the denitrification process no3 concentrations are generally low at depth ayraud et al 2008 rajmohan et al 2017 therefore the excess na in deep groundwater 8 m coupled with the elevated no3 concentrations implies localized pollution related to the environment of individual dug wells e g direct contamination vertical lateral flow related to their proximity to latrines the absence of a decrease in the ph and the water table depth no correlation and the high concentrations of no3 suggests an open system with a low nitrate reduction capacity characteristic of aquifers with high susceptibility to nitrates appelo and postma 2005 rajmohan et al 2017 wali et al 2019 most studies based on knowledge of changes in aquifer hydrochemistry have shown diffuse recharge mechanisms combining piston flow and preferential flow paths perrin et al 2011 wang et al 2015 alazard et al 2015 maréchal et al 2018 burri et al 2019 lyu et al 2019 khangembam and singh 2021 the apparent existence of hydrochemical compartments at the watershed scale may imply the complexity of these mechanisms that induce according to these authors a stratification of groundwater chemistry and create local geochemical heterogeneity within a compartment spatial variations in groundwater chemistry are attributed to different residence times also depending on hydraulic properties for instance maréchal et al 2018 indicate that higher k content is caused by longer water rock interaction in low transmissivity zones lachassagne et al 2021 indicate that under natural conditions most groundwater flow results from recharge of the upper aquifer saprolite consisting of alloterite and isalterite the hydraulic conductivity of the alloterite is lower than that of the isalterite because the former is more clayey therefore this composite aquifer may have strong vertical hydrogeochemical stratification previous studies in the study area have shown vertical variation in the aquifer see fig 3 and variation in saprolite hydraulic conductivity with values from of 10 7 to 10 4 m s bon et al 2016b ndam ngoupayou et al 2019 bon et al 2021 suggesting heterogeneity in saprolite storage and thus different residence times this chemical compartmentalization can have a significant impact on the transport of contaminants and the management of pollution especially metal 4 characteristics of heavy metals 4 1 distribution of heavy metals in groundwater heavy metals are naturally redistributed in the environment by geological processes and biological cycles their concentrations can vary widely depending on the extent of exposure to these minerals however beyond certain limits in drinking water they become toxic to humans towfiqul islam et al 2017 rakotondrabe et al 2018 adeli et al 2021 in the present study metals such as fe al cd cu pb mn mo ni and zn were taken into account in order to assess the risk of metal contamination to public health the average concentrations of these metals showed the following decreasing order mn mo ni al zn cu fe pb cd in the dug wells and mn mo ni al cu fe zn pb cd see table 1 the order of abundance and the very heterogeneous variations in both springs and dug wells suggest hydrochemical differentiation linked to hydrodynamic conditions similarly substantial differences in the concentrations of these parameters with the depth of the water table have been observed suggesting heavy metal contamination according to ins and bgr 2013 very low concentrations of dissolved iron manganese and aluminum are to be expected in yaoundé s groundwater in accordance with the rigorous oxidizing hydrochemical conditions however local reducing conditions related to the proximity of waste disposal sites or to low topographic conditions can give rise to high concentrations of these elements the concentrations of mn mo ni pb and cd were above the standard values of who 2017 in some areas as indicated by the boxplots fig 11 the presence of these undesirable elements in concentrations above who standards constitute a potential danger to human health 4 2 metal pollution index the pollution index values ranged between 59 69 and 273 25 the average was 172 25 with a standard deviation of 59 10 considering the hpi classes singh and kamal 2016 hpi 15 low 15 30 medium and hpi 30 high we find that all samples belong to the high class similarly 2 samples 8 33 were below the critical hpi value of 100 above which the overall pollution level should be considered unacceptable prasad and sangita 2008 the incorporation of hpi into the correlation matrix showed that pb mo and ni are important elements in the toxicity of water see esm 2 this observation corroborates with the presence of poorly sanitized student residential areas manufactured products from mini industries and numerous uncontrolled solid landfills these contribute a considerable amount of metals to groundwater through batteries disposable household items plastics paints inks and personal care or drug products this supports a recent assessment of polar pesticide and pharmaceutical contamination of groundwater resources in yaoundé see branchet et al 2018 2019 this result must be taken into account by administrative authorities because it poses a serious threat to human health the spatial distribution of hpi fig 12 indicates heterogeneous point sources of groundwater pollution domestic wastewater small industries highlighted above by the weak negative correlation between mn and zn the lowest value was observed in dug well 4 which also had a lower ec 55μs cm and was indicated as a natural biogenic background the low hpi associated with low mineralization characteristic of precambrian formations implies minimal influence from anthropogenic sources thus the concentrations obtained in dug well 4 can reflect the geochemical background or reference concentrations of this sub saharan zone made up of orthoderived migmatites this dug well can therefore be used in monitoring the dynamics of pollutants in this urban ecosystem on the other hand the highest values were observed at dug wells 3 273 25 31 263 24 located to the north and south of the watershed respectively fig 11 dug well 3 just like dug well 27 had a low hpi 109 81 an electrical conductivity greater than 900 μs cm against 449 μs cm for dug well 31 in addition dug wells 3 and 4 which distant about 40 m are all located to the north and were dug on the same geological basement and do not have any mini industrial activity in the vicinity it is therefore noticed that ec and hpi move both from the geogenic background to very high levels in the short distance urban area while short range variations of ec in urban shallow groundwater in yaoundé is not a new fact see kringel et al 2016 that of hpi had not yet been highlighted in this urban site and even elsewhere in the world based on our current knowledge some metals like mo pb and ni also exhibit similar behavior in these dug wells and between dug wells 8 and 10 post et al 2017 also showed in groundwater in northern burundi a localized but short range occurrence of dissolved uranium concentrations that may indicate a control of structural geological features other hydrochemical studies have also highlighted the impact of physical heterogeneity and aquifer compartmentalization on groundwater chemistry these studies conducted in different climatic contexts have shown physical compartmentalization weak boreholes less than 100 m apart and strong boreholes more than 300 m apart of hard rock aquifers at the weathering profile scale ayraud et al 2008 lachassagne et al 2011 dewandel et al 2011 maréchal et al 2018 and at the fissured fractured part scale of the aquifer perrin et al 2011 alazard et al 2015 lachassagne et al 2021 while further geochemical isotope or approach weathering profile scale or geophysical evidence is still needed to strengthen our observations it is consistent to assume that the chemical contrasts between less distant dug wells suggest a compartmentalization of the aquifer on a small scale that may be related to the geologic setting of the area indeed previous studies in the study area indicated alternating convex and concave undulations 30 cm in amplitude within the wall of loose weathered material which are thicker in the concave portion bon et al 2016a bon 2017 these have been attributed to the dome and basin structure exhibited by the roof of the yaounde metaplutonite formations the compartmentalization that appears to emerge at the saprolite level even with no vertical concentration profile at the dug well level saprolite having heterogeneous materials suggests that compartmentalization is a common characteristic of hard rock aquifers saprolite fractured zone regardless of climatic context due to the geological structure which causes an altitudinal variation of the alterite basement weathered layer and the weathered fissured zone interface this variation is characterized by increased thickness of weathered material in the vicinity of faults ayraud et al 2008 lachassagne et al 2011 alazard et al 2015 4 3 background and threshold values of heavy metals nbls of groundwater chemical parameters were calculated using the pre selection method and the grubbs test n 30 based on the pre selection criteria including minimal influence of anthropogenic activities and water level de caro et al 2017 gao et al 2020b nlend et al 2020 dug well 4 d4 characterized by a no3 concentration 1 mg l falling within the range of the geogenic background of groundwater in tropical forest environments 0 07 0 6 mg l and that of the saprolite weathering front 0 074 1 0 braun et al 2005 was considered a reference in the determination of nbl since sampling was done at the depth of the piezometric level which is heterogeneous in this study the reference piezometric level similar to the relative depth of each well estimated by ayraud et al 2008 corresponding to d4 2 5 m close to the median piezometric level of the study area 2 2 m was associated with the reference concentrations the range of nbl tv and tif values retro transformed from log10 values obtained from the appropriate methods for the different metals are shown in table 4 the nbls of groundwater chemical parameters obtained showed clear distinctions between the two methods but showed fairly close values for fe 0 01 mg l al 0 1 mg l and cd 3 10 3 mg l these nbls fe al and cd correspond to the concentrations of these parameters in the d4 this shows the hydrogeochemical consistency of the criteria e g on major ions muller et al 2006 rotiroti et al 2015 de caro et al 2017 and implies that the ps approach and the grubbs test can yield similar nbls when the threshold value is based on the natural background level of a well that is likely to reference the hydrogeological conditions piezometry and chemistry in the study area only zn showed ps nbl higher than the grubbs nbl test suggesting an overestimation of the anthropogenic data de caro et al 2017 the tvs calculated from the reference concentrations d4 varied between 3 05 10 3 and 1 56 mg l the proximity of the tv to fe and al 0 2 mg l can be illustrative of the contents of these elements in laterites indeed laterites rich in iron and aluminum oxide like any residual product sexquioxides from humid tropical conditions testify to the low geochemical mobility of these metals tif values could not be determined for some metals due to the presence of zero concentrations nevertheless tv and tif of cd are quite close 0 003 mg l suggesting a concordance between the preselection and statistical methods for certain chemical elements a similarity was also observed between the tif and 98th percentile values for mn cu pb and cd esm1 table 3 esm 2 such an observation is consistent with the findings of reimann and de caritat 2017 and gao et al 2019 indicating that the tif provide estimates fairly close to the 98th percentile the concentrations of mn mo and pb were mainly higher more than 75 than nbl both in the dug wells and springs where we also find the concentrations of fe cu and ni higher than nbl over 51 of dug well and spring water samples showed values greater than tv for the metals mn mo and pb also indicating the importance of these metals in the toxicity of groundwater no element showed a concentration greater than tif but dug well d1 and spring s2 exhibited mn concentrations quite close to tif the same applies to dug well 11 for cu dug wells 11 14 and 21 for pb and with the exception of dug well 28 and spring 6 for cd whose values of tif and tv determined from the reference dug well were similar these results show that exposure to these elements could make the inhabitants of this area vulnerable to various diseases this appears to be a serious concern in terms of the quality potential of groundwater and the urgency of regular monitoring of trace elements in groundwater in this humid tropical urban area 5 simplified conceptual modelling of groundwater flow the approach used involving data from groundwater levels hydrochemistry and previous work allows to propose a conceptual model of groundwater flow and hydrochemical evolution at the olézoa watershed scale fig 13 this watershed is an entity of the mfoundi watershed mefou sub watershed subject to humid climatic conditions of sub recharge 87 mm year fouépé takounjou et al 2010 the groundwater flow regime is multidirectional from northeast to southwest north northeast to south southwest east to west and from east southeast to west northwest the spatial variability of the groundwater chemistry in this shallow aquifer as shown by na tds and no3 values is very similar to that of the landscape and suggesting an organization of flows between slopes with several local groundwater systems linked to the hilly nature of the study area this ionic behavior highlights two groundwater flow systems with intermediate flows appearing in areas where the saprolite thickness is important various studies have shown that saprolite when not fractured acts more like a porous medium that stores groundwater lachassagne et al 2011 thus increasing transit times this can justify a high average mineralization in the summit areas even though the anthropogenic impact has been evoked to explain an absence of the general increase of mineralization from upstream to downstream in this urban area in contradiction to the usual conceptual model however previous work has shown a variation in saprolite thickness related to weathering ancient weathering system 10 20 m thick derived from the degradation of lateritic systems and a more recent weathering 2 3 m thick developed on the fresh rock bon et al 2016a 2021 spatial and vertical variations in the physical soil type and hydraulic hydraulic conductivity properties of the saprolite were observed in the study area these properties coupled with the concavo convex structure of the bedrock roof may result in geochemical ec and hpi contrasts between less distant dug wells 50 m suggesting compartmentalization of the shallow aquifer on a small scale compared to other studies the hydrodynamic conditions and therefore of mineralization are generally similar to those described in hard rock aquifers ayraud et al 2008 perrin et al 2011 alazard et al 2015 due to a piezometric structure of the aquifer in great concordance with the topography the composite aquifer may show a vertical hydrogeochemical stratification both in the saprolite and in the fractured fissured zone lachassagne et al 2021 the groundwater studied is part of the active water cycle where shallow aquifers rarely reflect true natural concentration levels while deep aquifers may be free of anthropogenic impacts muller et al 2006 de caro et al 2017 water rock interaction processes prevail and may be associated with paleo recharge as is the case for the hyper recharged coastal aquifers nlend et al 2020 the physical compartmentalization of the aquifer is a common characteristic of hard rock aquifers this seems weak in porous saprolite unlike the active zone of the aquifer fractured zone where the distance between boreholes varies from 100 m to 500 m perrin et al 2011 alazard et al 2015 the results presented in this study are not sufficient to include the block geometry of the aquifer in this model and to propose an accurate conceptualization of groundwater recharge this study hypothesizes the existence of the temporal component of groundwater flow systems rapid and slow responses to recharge also occur at a local scale it would also be important to clarify the hydrogeological processes in the fractured part of the aquifer 6 conclusion the work carried out in this study illustrates the hydrogeological characteristics of a shallow hard rock aquifer in an urban context the main conclusions are the hydrochemical facies were predominantly camg cl camg hco3 nak hco3 ca cl and nak cl the multivariate analysis suggested the omnipresence of the effect of geogenic and anthropogenic processes in the study area factors which are mostly common in urban the hilly topography was favorable to a stratification of mineralization and the development of hierarchically nested groundwater flow systems nevertheless we noted the predominance of local flows more easily affected by surface contaminants regarding heavy metals the median hpi value was greater than the critical pollution index value of 100 indicating a high level of heavy metal pollution in addition hpi exhibited a behavior similar to electrical conductivity with values starting near the critical value at very high levels in the short distance urban area this suggests a physical compartmentalization of the shallow aquifer on a small scale the estimation of nbl and tv or of tif from a reference dug well showed the importance of pb mo and ni in groundwater toxicity and can thus help public authorities to efficiently evaluate the chemical state of groundwater and to implement a better management in general this study constitutes a first approach and improves the conceptual understanding of hard rock hydrogeological systems with generally complex geological and morphological characteristics it provides a knowledge base of hydrogeochemical processes and environmental levels of heavy metals useful for the sustainable management of groundwater resources in this urban part yaoundé cameroon of sub saharan africa the approach and analysis can be used as an example to attempt to characterize aquifers in other regions with the same characteristics author contributions andré firmin bon conceptualization investigation methodology resources writing original draft therese anny michelle ngo

saharan africa keywords hydrogeochemical processes groundwater flow system heavy metal pollution index natural background values urban hard rock aquifer cameroon olézoa yaoundé 1 introduction groundwater is a crucial water resource in urban cities built on basement rocks particularly in humid tropical regions where public water supply may be limited due to an increase in consumption and degradation of surface water in cities of sub saharan africa as well as elsewhere in the world the exploitation of groundwater depends on socio economic conditions and the use of pit latrines is the most common way of disposing human waste often in areas where communities especially the poorest ones also depend on groundwater for drinking kulabako et al 2007 lapworth et al 2017 bon et al 2020a this is an impediment to the sustainable consumption of groundwater and requires awareness these water and sanitation issues as well as the significant effect of dramatically increasing urban populations on water supply and distribution systems are on the policy agendas but achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs requires additional efforts in most cities of the world burri et al 2019 mcgill et al 2019 jia et al 2020 sustainable groundwater use requires an adequate understanding of the complexity of natural and anthropogenic processes and how they affect groundwater quality the evolution of groundwater chemistry is a complex process and associated with the natural hydrologic cycle processes tóth 1999 burri et al 2019 jia et al 2020 one major complexity in assessing groundwater quality arises from the 3 d nature of flow systems archbold et al 2016 groundwater systems are often highly heterogeneous meaning that samples from wells in close proximity may produce very different results especially if they are taken from different depths this spatial and vertical heterogeneity with concentrations that can span a wide range of values indicates ion mobility controlled by a series of factors that can vary locally over short distances which can according to post et al 2017 complicate the interpretation of observed patterns moreover the natural groundwater composition also known as natural or geochemical background defines its natural quality and is characterized by large spatial variations at different scales muller et al 2006 thus knowledge of the processes that control the groundwater quality and assessment of the natural background range are crucial in terms of the sustainable management of groundwater resources edmunds et al 2003 biddau et al 2017 the acquisition of this knowledge is based on hydrogeochemical studies whose application allow among other things to apprehend the dynamics of natural or anthropized environments and the formulation of water management policies and decision making rodriguez espinosa et al 2020 bon et al 2020b these investigations have for example allowed to determine the natural background levels nbl or to propose threshold values tv of the chemical components of groundwater muller et al 2006 nakic et al 2007 biddau et al 2017 gao et al 2020b nlend et al 2020 and to represent a summary and communication tool facilitating the presentation of water quality state chen et al 2019 bon et al 2020b chadli and boufala 2021 zhang et al 2021 gao et al 2020b thus indicated that the natural background level nbl is a prerequisite for identifying groundwater pollution and for the evaluation of pollution control effectiveness the combined study of hydrodynamic and hydrochemical groundwater data have also helped define the groundwater flow system and the rate of groundwater renewal ayraud et al 2008 yidana et al 2011 wang et al 2015 lyu et al 2019 nlend et al 2020 li et al 2021 khangembam and singh et al 2021 and even to assess their degree of vulnerability similarly groundwater flow patterns have been defined and considered in groundwater development and protection strategies in some regions of the world see maréchal et al 2018 lyu et al 2019 and li et al 2021 however these studies are numerous whatever the geology in semi arid and mediterranean areas or in coastal aquifers of equatorial regions in the hard rock plutonic and metamorphic rocks areas in particular generally consisting of heterogeneous aquifers lachassagne et al 2011 dewandel et al 2011 maréchal et al 2018 lachassagne et al 2021 the mechanisms of groundwater recharge under equatorial conditions are widely described in the literature see taylor et al 2019 however knowledge of hydrogeology in an urban context remains more fragmented the combined application of water level and chemical data mainly relates to major ions cations and anions without integrating heavy metals somehow rendering the database inconclusive groundwater flow patterns are even less understood in the shallow aquifer saprolite even in semi arid areas where studies on flow distribution and geochemical characteristics in crystalline aquifers consider mainly the fractured zone of the aquifer alazard et al 2015 reactivity in the saprolite may be different on the other hand it is not yet known whether metal pollution levels can show local variations over short distances in the urban watershed as is the case for dissolved uranium concentrations in groundwater from northern burundi post et al 2017 this lack of information does not allow governments to make appropriate decisions especially in a covid 19 setting where people now have to wash their hands regularly they may have to choose between drinking and washing their hands due to insufficient water to do both especially in the countries of sub saharan africa however sustainable urban development implies taking into account and or reducing the threat to groundwater resources particularly in areas where the population is already facing the problem of drinking water supply the objective of this work is to provide suitable knowledge on the characteritics hydrogeochemical and hydrodynamic of shallow hard rock aquifers in a humid tropical urban context for sustainable groundwater use the study was conducted in yaoundé the political capital of cameroon central africa in particular the olézoa watershed 365 ha under strong urbanization and population increase this watershed hosts the university of yaoundé i and other important structures such as the military camp the mvolyé catholic mission diplomatic corps and the university hospital center according to the central bureau for the study and census of the population of cameroon the density per hectare in some places is greater than 600 inhabitants ha against an average of 50 inhabitants ha for the country sixty seven percent of households experience drinking water shortages and a large part of the population uses groundwater for all purposes branchet et al 2019 without reliable information this strong contrast between the magnitude of the importance of groundwater and the lack of adequate information on hydrogeological functioning can compromise the efficient management of groundwater resources this emphasizes the importance of their characterization in order to propose management tools capable of providing orientations for the future exploitation of groundwater therefore the joint assessment of hydrodynamic conditions and physico chemical properties using multivariate statistical analysis methods and the metal pollution index can allow to better understand the functioning of the system and establish a baseline for urban groundwater in this part of sub saharan africa in a changing context 2 material and methods 2 1 location and geomorphological setting the study area is located in the yaoundé region about 250 km from the atlantic coast and between latitudes 3 45 and 4 00 n and longitudes 11 20 and 11 40 e fig 1 the prevailing climate is that of humid tropical environments marked by two rainy seasons march june and september november alternating with two dry seasons december february and july august this region is located in the south cameroonian plateau average altitude 750 m whose landform corresponds to the dismantling of an old iron crust undergoing more humid climatic conditions bitom et al 2004 this morphology is dominated by smooth rocky hills 800 m with large convex slopes relayed by marshy flat valleys 700 m with widths ranging from 50 to 150 m bitom et al 2004 the yaoundé region due to its rapid extension is drained to the north by the foulou tributary of the sanaga river and to the south by the mefou tributary of the nyong river the latter at present is the main source of drinking water supply in the yaoundé city and its surroundings but is insufficiently accessible indeed hydroclimatic conditions combined with the population explosion have increased the population s water needs which are according to reports from the structures in charge of water minee camwater on average estimated at 250 000 m3 day compared to 300 000 m3 day at peak periods while production at the catchment stations akomnyada and mefou is 150 000 m3 day its urban space increased by 10 35 between 1980 and 2017 resulting in a 53 increase in the annual runoff coefficient for the mefou stream jourdan et al 2019 the mefou watershed 421 km² in nsimalen occupies the urbanized part of yaoundé and its main tributaries are the anga a in the south east and the mfoundi 100 km2 which drains the center of the city fig 1 the olézoa topographical watershed is an entity located on the right bank of the mfoundi river running north and northeast the drainage pattern is dendritic and the regional slope of the watershed is northward the topography is undulating with slopes vary between 2 and 21 and an average of 9 07 bon et al 2016a and b bon 2017 the olézoa stream has a dense hydrographic network and a drainage capacity of 1 96 km km2 this watershed is the only one in the sector which within it has five ponds created for fish farming four of which are totally eutrophic due to anthropogenic discharges only the eastern and southwestern parts of the watershed still have vegetation cover with two major landholdings the military and the catholic mission the consequences of this urbanization are visible through the increase in impermeable surfaces the extension of urban agriculture the proliferation of wastewater and household solid waste commercial activities repair shops garages paintings inns etc etc solid landfills and septic tanks bon 2017 which are not listed in this study however branchet et al 2019 indicate that over 70 of the basin s population use pit latrines as their primary mode of sanitation 2 2 geology and hydrogeology southern cameroon which contains the study area is underlain by two rock units namely i the neo proterozoic group of yaounde series which is thrusted onto the congo craton and ii the bafia group which is classically assumed to be a palaeo proterozoic tectonic slice of the basement that over thrust the yaoundé group to the north fig 2 a champetier de ribes and aubargue 1956 the geological basement of yaoundé consists of migmatites and gneisses belonging to the southern domain of the pan african chain of central africa mvondo et al 2007 ngnoteu et al 2012 these formations outcrop to the north of the edge of the congo craton and are subdivided into two groups of rocks metasedimentary or paragneiss and metaplutonic or orthogneiss rocks meta sedimentary rocks are the most abundant outcrop along the beds of some rivers paragneisses are essentially composed of garnet and kyanite gneisses garnet and plagioclase gneisses marbles and scapolite rocks pyriclasites intruding the metasedimentary unit feldspars tourmaline garnet pyribolites pyroxenites and biotite rich rocks characterize the orthogneisses mvondo et al 2007 it is this last group that constitutes the basement of the olézoa watershed fig 2b the roof of this basement presents an alternation of convex and concave undulations chocolate bar structure mvondo et al 2007 with thicker loose weathered materials in the concave part the weathering rocks under humid tropical conditions resulted in lateritic weathering profiles ngon ngon et al 2009 braun et al 2012 ndjigui et al 2013 which from bottom to top consist of fig 3 i the fractured horizon mostly fresh rock but intersected with fractures due to alteration ii the alteration or alteritic set isalterite surmounted by the alloterite iii the glebular set iron or bauxitic crust comprising two nodular levels surrounding the duricrust which outcrop at certain areas and iv a surface soft level soil which is clayey sandy to sandy clayey and may be absent where the nodular horizon is developed the minerals constituting these lateritic soils ph 5 5 are aluminosilicates k ca2 na silicates fe mg quartz kaolinite gibbsite and oxyhydroxides fe mn braun et al 2012 the profiles are generally thick 10 20 m and are reduced 5 m in areas where rocks are observed fissured horizon or fresh rock near the topographic surface bon et al 2016a 2021 the soil is about 2 m thick hydraulic conductivity generally decreases with depth and varies between 10 4 m s for the soil and the glebular set and 10 6 m s for the weathering set ndam ngoupayou et al 2019 bon et al 2021 the two sets are silty sandy to sandy gravel clay sandy and gravel silty in nature in addition when the duricrust level is impermeable in some areas it constitutes the base of a perched aquifer lachassagne et al 2011 2021 resulting in the presence of two hydrogeological levels within the alterites fig 3 this weathering profile unit iron or bauxitic crust in particularis hydrogeologically functional in high rainfall areas such as those with wet tropical climates belle et al 2018 groundwater is found in phreatic conditions in the weathered mantle shallow aquifer 20 m deep and is exploited through dug wells and springs by the local population for different uses domestic use drinking water etc these waters are in confined to semi confined conditions in fissured fractured zones at deeper levels 20 m and is exploited through boreholes realized by individuals with better financial means generally groundwater discharging as springs is perennial and follows the regional slope the recharging water generally flows from high topographic toward lower topographic areas through the piston flow mechanism fouépé takounjou et al 2020 the groundwater recharge is recent and is mainly done by direct infiltration of current local precipitation with no modification of the original isotopic composition by the evaporation recovery kuitcha et al 2013 the recharge goes from 30 mm year in lowlands to 40 mm year in highlands fouépé takounjou et al 2010 involving a piezometric structure of the aquifer in good agreement with the topography rapid water infiltration can be observed in high areas where fractured bedrock is almost exposed to the surface the proximity of the water table to the topographic surface and the high porosity makes these aquifers more vulnerable to surface contamination 2 3 sampling and chemical analysis twenty five 25 groundwater samples including 7 springs 17 dug wells capturing the shallow aquifer 2 12 m and one borehole fissured aquifer were used to determine the groundwater hydrogeochemical characteristics the sampling points were selected based on criteria such as accessibility owner s agreement and water table conditions for the dug wells these conditions were determined on the basis of weekly piezometric monitoring of thirty five individual dug wells throughout the watershed fig 4 the water samples were taken between april and june 2019 corresponding to the short rainy season samples from the dug wells were taken during hours when water extraction for domestic purposes is most intense between 7 a m and 10 a m in order to obtain a representative sample of water from the aquifer water samples were collected in sterilized 1 l polyethylene bottles according to standard methods prescribed by apha 2012 and stored at 4 c in a cooler for laboratory analysis temperature electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and ph were measured in situ using a hanna hi98129 brand multiparameter the ph and ec tds electrodes were previously calibrated using standard buffer solutions ph 4 01 ph 7 01 and 1413 μs cm respectively the accuracy of temperature ph and ec measurements are 0 5 0 05 and 0 02 units respectively once in the laboratory the raw water samples were filtered by the front filtration method using a thermo scientific nalgene filtration unit the cellulose acetate filters used had a diameter of 47 mm and a pore size of 0 45 mm the filters and the filtration unit were rinsed beforehand with distilled water and then with a few ml of the water to be analyzed the filtered solution was divided into two separate bottles cations and anions washed beforehand with hcl diluted to 0 1 m and rinsed with deionized water nitric acid hno3 ph 2 was added only to the filtrate of cations and trace elements to prevent the possible growth of bacteria the analysis of anions and cations mg ca and k and trace elements was carried out in the laboratory of geosciences of surface formations and applications of the university of yaoundé 1 using a branded multiparameter photometer hanna hi 83300 02 the detection limit and the accuracy of parameters are reported in esm 1 table 1 the cl in cases where the value measured with the multiparameter was outside the limits indicated by the device 0 20 mg l na cl pb and cd were analyzed in the laboratory of geochemistry and water analyses lage at nkolbisson cameroon the load balancing errors of most water samples showed a high anion deficit with an average ratio of 40 this strong deficit is consistent with what is obtained in the waters of the nyong watershed and is due to a high specific charge of organic acids boeglin et al 2003 braun et al 2005 nkoue ndondo et al 2020 2 4 data compilation and statistical analysis methods the data for the various physico chemical parameters obtained in this study were compared with the desirable limit of water potability recommended by the who 2017 major ions were plotted in the piper trilinear diagram 1944 in order to determine the chemical facies of the groundwater which indicate the polluted or unpolluted nature of the water huneau et al 2011 in order to further characterize the physical behavior of the sampling sites and the processes that control groundwater chemistry multivariate statistical analyzes including correlation matrix principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca were applied to the 24 water samples taking into account of 26 hydrochemical variables ph t c ec tds ca mg na k cl no3 so4 hco3 no2 po4 fe al zn mn mo cu pb cd ni f br and ag for the dug wells the groundwater level was also considered as another parameter so as to take into account the water table conditions hca was made using squared euclidean distance and ward method the stiff diagram

hco3 and tds these analyzes were performed using statgraphics 16 02 and diagram software arcgis 9 3 software was used for creating a geodatabase of all groundwater samples and an inverse distance weighed idw algorithm for spatial interpolation of parameters factor load hpi 2 5 estimation of the pollution index by heavy metals individual chemical parameters are considered descriptors of water quality that can be measured multiple times and at multiple locations this does not allow a water resources manager to have access to simple summarized and well targeted information to make better decisions chadli and boufala 2021 a water quality index represents a summary and communication tool facilitating the presentation of the state of the quality of water resources to the public bon et al 2020b for metals the heavy metal pollution index hpi was calculated to assess the overall water pollution relative to heavy metals this method is based on weighted arithmetic quality prasad and sangita 2008 singh and kamal 2016 an indexation based on weights wi between 0 and 1 has been assigned for each metal and the value of the critical pollution index is 100 prasad and sangita 2008 adeli et al 2021 the unit weight wi was taken as a value inversely proportional to the recommended standard si of a considered parameter iron aluminum manganese nickel lead copper cadmium molybdenum and zinc were used for the application of the index following the formula proposed by mohan et al 1996 1a h p i i 1 n w i q i i 1 n w i with 1b w i 1 s i and 1c q i 100 x v i s i where wi is the unit weightage of the ith parameter or the weight of coefficient on relative values of the variables reza and singh 2010 qi is the sub index of the ith parameter n is the number of parameters considered si is the permissible standard value of the ith parameter the adopted standard is the limit of who 2017 vi is the monitored value of the ith parameter reza and singh 2010 singh and kamal 2016 2 6 determination of natural background levels and threshold values the natural geochemical background nbl and geochemical threshold value tv levels of potentially toxic heavy metals were determined in order to assess metal contamination edmunds et al 2003 define the background level of a substance in groundwater as the concentration of a given element species or chemical present in solution which is derived from natural geological biological or atmospheric sources in terms of process these sources have significant differences local variation in environmental conditions is best reflected when its assessment considers the characteristics of a particular region e g geology and hydrogeology gao et al 2020b various methods and approaches exist in the literature to identify nbls and generally involve geochemical and statistical methods muller et al 2006 nakic et al 2007 rotiroti et al 2015 de caro et al 2017 regardless of the method the technical issues associated with nbl assessment lie in how relatively healthy samples are separated from samples heavily influenced by human activities according to de caro et al 2017 statistical methods include both non parameter and parameter approaches can derive nbl effectively based on monitoring data among the non parametric approaches pre selection is the simplest to address the natural groundwater composition in an aquifer even by non experts and also when no national methodology exists to calculate the nbl de caro et al 2017 nlend et al 2020 nevertheless the application of a simplified preselection method presents common minimum requirements for groundwater quality data e g the elimination of samples obtained from an unknown depth nlend et al 2020 and appropriate pre selection criteria to identify groundwater samples showing no significant anthropogenic impact should be defined muller et al 2006 gao et al 2020b these criteria based on major ions and physicochemical parameters are also valid for metals when the threshold value is based on the natural background level and practical applicability is controlled by standard norms muller et al 2006 rotiroti et al 2015 in contrast to this approach appropriate use for nbl selection from a parametric approach requires a normal or log normal characteristic of the data associated with the data size nakic et al 2007 for example successful use of the iterative 2δ technique requires a relatively large data set n 30 while smaller data sets n 30 the grubbs test is typically applied to rule out abnormal values based on the data distribution gao et al 2020b in this study as the water samples were taken at a known depth the pre selection methodology consisted in considering only analyzes of groundwater with nitrate concentrations below 10 mg l specifically those with nitrate concentrations located in the range of groundwater geogenic backgrounds and weathering fronts in saprolites from tropical environments 0 074 1 0 mg l braun et al 2005 the choice has been reinforced for samples showing hpi values below the critical value of 100 above which the overall pollution level should be considered unacceptable prasad and sangita 2008 the determined nbl was used to estimate the threshold values for groundwater gao et al 2019 last et al 2014 indicate that tv represents a groundwater quality standard based on interactions with aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems interference with legitimate groundwater uses or functions and hydrogeological characteristics including background levels the approach used in this study to determine tv is that proposed by muller et al 2006 and is also applied in other humid tropical environments nlend et al 2020 this approach is based on the relationship between the natural background level and a relevant reference value equation 2 2a n b l r e f t v n b l r e f 2 2b n b l r e f t v n b l the calculation of nbls following the parametric approach was based on the structure for calculating natural background values developed by nakic et al 2007 see esm 1 fig 1 because the data sets were smaller n 30 the grubbs test was applied to rule out abnormal values based on the data distribution see gao et al 2020b the statistical distribution of hydrochemical data was evaluated using the kolmogorov smirnov test p value 0 05 however some authors reimann and de caritat 2017 reimann et al 2018 believe that using the limits of the tukey boxplot which allow to determine the tif tukey internal fence has the great advantage that the definition of the threshold depends on the statistical distribution of the robust inner core of the data the tif provides estimates that are most often quite close to the 98th percentile and is probably the best method of identifying sites that will require special attention because they are unusual reimann and de caritat 2017 the tif is calculated on the log transformed data in order to reduce the skewness of the data distribution thus eliminating outliers biddau et al 2017 reimann et al 2018 gao et al 2019 thus when data distribution was favorable the tif was calculated as follows 3 t i f q 3 1 5 i q r where q3 stands for the 3rd quartile equivalent to the 75th percentile and iqr is the interquartile range 75th 25th percentile the multiplying factor of 1 5 in the formula is based on the assumption of a symmetrical data distribution a comparison of the tv and tif values was done in order to identify any similarities between these two methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 piezometric characteristics water extraction from dug wells in the study area was done at a shallow depth 16 m the piezometric surface was generally found at the heart of the alterites and close to the soil the depths of the dug wells in some areas were correlated with the topography the deepest dug wells in general were at the top or on the hillside the groundwater levels in the 35 dug wells ranged from 0 5 to 11 85 m with an average of 3 2 m fig 5 a the amplitude of piezometric variation in the entire watershed was between 0 1 and 4 95 m with an annual average of 1 08 1 01 m this clearly shows that hydrogeological functioning is not marked by a mass of basal groundwater with a low hydraulic gradient the influence of topography on piezometric variations is very significant fig 5b the groundwater discharge evolves according to an exponential law characteristic of environments with high inertia bon et al 2016a ndam ngoupayou et al 2019 bon et al 2021 this characteristic is similar to that generally observed within the majority of the world s shallow weathered hard rock aquifers asia europe other african countries in a similar climatic context see freeze and cherry 1979 taylor et al 2019 lachassagne et al 2021 indeed lachassagne et al 2021 indicate hard rock aquifers notably in the parts of the world where the recharge is significant groundwater watersheds are very similar to surfacewater watersheds the piezometric heads being subparallel to the topographic surface the high points were in the same places as the topographic domes and can be identified as the groundwater recharge areas however the topographic context slope varying from 2 to 21 and the humid climate can imply heterogeneous recharge processes on the whole catchment area contrary to the area of brittany france where the homogeneous topography relatively flat and the temperate climate imply homogeneous recharge processes on the whole territory ayraud et al 2008 the most representative groundwater flow directions are ne sw nne ssw e w and es e w nw esm 1 fig 2 gullies made up of ponds and hydromorphic zones are wet all year round indicating a supply of surface water by groundwater strong horizontal hydraulic gradients were observed respectively at these directions 0 065 or 0 118 0 158 0 068 and 0 071 as expected from hard rock aquifers with limited hydraulic conductivity these can be greater than 1 depending on the hydraulic conductivity value perrin et al 2011 lachassagne et al 2021 this groundwater flows direction were consistent with the main topographic lines indicating as described by bitom et al 2004 bon et al 2021 that the modeling of the landscape is induced by the hydrographic network therefore groundwater flows are then modeled on this morphology with flows from high points to low points thus the northeast and east parts serve as recharge areas and the water moves from these areas to the southwest west like that of the olézoa stream this stream is local minima of topographic relief and can be considered seepage boundary for the shallow aquifer the piezometric amplitudes corresponding to this altitudinal distribution were between 1 63 and 4 95 m average 3 15 m in dug wells at the summit between 0 28 and 2 58 m average 1 14 m in the mid slope zones against 0 1 and 1 71 m average 0 61 m at the bottom of the slope where the redistribution of water is slower in fact the characterization of hydrological processes in humid tropical environments has shown a contribution of 4 for lowland aquifers against 65 for mid slope aquifers maréchal et al 2011 nevertheless the distribution of piezometric amplitudes related to the topography seems to highlight a topographic zoning of groundwater flow in the study area 3 2 shallow groundwater hydrogeochemistry the main geochemical characteristics of groundwater are summarized in table 1 the ph values ranged from 4 09 to 5 68 and from 3 83 to 5 32 with median values of 5 18 and 4 95 respectively in the dug wells and springs indicating a zero to low buffering capacity as indicated by appelo and postma 2005 the consumption of carbonic acid during the dissolution of silicate minerals results in increased alkalinity and ph values the observed ph values 6 in the study area can therefore be attributed to a low degree of chemical weathering this result is in agreement with that obtained in natural crystalline environments in humid tropical climates ph between 3 5 and 5 6 where the surface residual aquifer laterite depleted in basic cations is recharged by rainwater boeglin et al 2003 braun et al 2005 kortatsi et al 2008 ahoussi et al 2010 yidana et al 2011 kuitcha et al 2013 post et al 2017 rejith et al 2021 which is acidic for the case of the south cameroon plateau ph 5 2 neutral ph of rainwater between 5 6 and 5 8 braun et al 2005 apart from the crystalline nature of the bedrock granito gneiss formations or lateritic soils see for example minerals in the section geology and hydrogeology various studies indicate that the oxidation of certain minerals e g pyrite eq 4 and the production of co2 in the surface soil cover under the action of biological activities can be a source of water acidity in these environments boeglin et al 2003 appelo and postma 2005 ayraud et al 2008 kortatsi et al 2008 nkoue ndondo et al 2020 adeli et al 2021 4 f e s 2 3 5 o 2 h 2 o f e 2 2 s o 4 2 2 h the tds as an important measure of water palatability had a median of 232 and 183 mg l in dug wells and springs respectively these values were below the who guide value and indicated soft water tds 1000 mg l according to the classification of freeze and cherry 1979 electrical conductivity ec values ranged from 55 to 946 μs cm and 158 549 μs cm with median values of 465 and 368 μs cm respectively in dug wells and springs these values indicated a high to significant mineralization compared to what is observed in most water from woody areas without mining activities of southern cameroon 6 3 55 6 μs cm boeglin et al 2003 braun et al 2005 rakotondrabe et al 2018 in many shallow residual aquifers in africa 37 3 75 1 μs cm kortatsi et al 2008 yidana et al 2011 and india 100 μs cm rejith et al 2021 and generally in granitic environments 50 300 μs cm where water rock interaction processes involve silicate minerals sio2 65 with low solubility boeglin et al 2003 biddau et al 2017 wali et al 2019 adeli et al 2021 the carbonate deficiency of these rocks results in poorly buffered waters smedley et al 1995 this suggests that these natural environments have a low dispersion index id ratio of the variance to the mean in contrast to urban environments as is the case in the present study 141 dug wells and 56 springs in these environments ec values may start near the geogenic background and mean value of poorly mineralized tropical urban rainwater 12 8 71 7 μs cm kulabako et al 2007 kuitcha et al 2012 and extend to highly mineralized groundwater 1000 μs cm that is not expected in natural environments in the tropics due to the strongly positive water balance kringer et al 2016 the no3 values ranged from 1 0 103 5 mg l with mean value 51 3 mg l concentrations were above the who standard value table 1 and the natural background level of nitrates in groundwater 10 mg l selvakumar et al 2017 levels above this background limit are an indicator of nitrate contamination through various human activities these concentrations except d4 1 0 mg l were higher than the nitrate concentrations in the geogenic background of groundwater in a tropical forest environment of the southern cameroonian plateau 0 07 to 0 6 mg l that of the saprolite weathering front being 0 074 1 0 mg l braun et al 2005 and in some lateritic aquifers elsewhere in the world e g india 5 1 mg l rejith et al 2021 and ghana 20 mg l kortatsi et al 2008 but quite close to the average nitrate concentration 54 85 mg l obtained by ouedraogo et al 2016 on a pan african scale compared to shallow hard rock aquifer water in the humid tropical environment of kampala in uganda 129 5 mg l kulabako et al 2007 these concentrations remain low hco3 has shown low concentrations consistent with the average alkalinity well below 1 meq l of the urban tropical environment of yaoundé ins and bgr 2013 kringel et al 2016 this is a complementary result to the acidic ph values found in groundwater the variability of hco3 is much greater 0 142 mg l from very low mineralized waters consistent with low silicate hydrolysis to high concentrations this is common in shallow urban hard rock aquifers where alkalinity differences of more than 20 orders of magnitude can be found yidana et al 2011 ouandaogo yameogo et al 2013 wali et al 2019 rejith et al 2021 this implies very high partial pressures of co2 pco2 related to the mineralization of anthropogenic organic matter ouandaogo yameogo et al 2013 or suggests heterogeneity of alkalinity produced by the alteration of silicate minerals indeed the molar concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 esm 1 table 2 ions showed that 96 of water samples had a ratio ca2 mg2 hco3 0 5 suggesting a predominance of weathering by organic acids to the detriment of carbonic acid nkoue ndondo et al 2020 the trilinary piper diagram of major ions revealed a diversity of hydrogeochemical facies with a strong anthropogenic imprint as indicated by the anion triangle fig 6 the types of groundwater encountered were camg cl 41 camg hco3 21 nak hco3 13 ca cl 8 and nak cl 4 the mixed facies corresponding to the samples d6 camg cl to ca cl and s2 d3 camg hco3 to camg cl represented 4 and 8 respectively this diversity of facies illustrates a heterogeneity of hydrochemical processes within the aquifer matrix zaidi et al 2019 bon et al 2020b or is related to groundwater flow systems back 1966 the arrangement of the points in the gibbs diagram fig 7 a suggests that rock weathering or rock water interactions associated with exogenous sources are the primary sources of control of groundwater chemistry and hydrochemistry the dominance of the ca mg cl facies involves a mixing process of anthropogenic pollution linked to surface contamination sources such as domestic sewage and septic tank effluent and ion exchange with existing water the camg hco3 facies reflects the natural geochemical processes on the groundwater chemistry that particularly correspond to the weathering of silicates under groundwater recharge in the relatively permeable weathered zone kortatsi et al 2008 srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 ewodo mboudou et al 2019 bon et al 2020a b khan et al 2020 nlend et al 2020 minerals in the rocks of the study area as noted earlier in the geology and hydrogeological section can thus be dissolved by meteoric water producing this type of facies in other studies conducted elsewhere in the world srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 ligavha mbelengwa and gomo 2020 wisitthammasri et al 2020 this facies is typically associated with recently recharged water in addition yaoundé meteoric water is dominated by ca2 and hco3 kuitcha et al 2012 so it is logical to suggest that shallow groundwater be recharged by rainfall this result are commonly recognized in other shallow aquifers worldwide wang et al 2015 gao et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 this suggests a common hydrogeological characteristic of shallow aquifers this characteristic also implies that the hydrogeochemical processes of these aquifers are associated with the natural hydrologic cycle processes burri et al 2019 jia et al 2020 in the anion triangle some dug wells showed a drift from the bicarbonate pole to the pole cl no3 according to ouandaogo yameogo et al 2013 this drift suggests that the dissolution of silicates is favored by the mineralization of anthropogenic organic matter dissolution of silicate minerals can also produce the nak hco3 type but some authors believe that this facies is characteristic of camg hco3 water type that have undergone evolution by ion exchange from recharge to discharge zones in the groundwater flow system appelo and postma 2005 yidana et al 2011 the distribution of some groundwater samples on the left side in the ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 plot fig 7 b and molar ratio ca2 mg2 hco3 is globally far from 1 see esm 1 table 2 this implies the ion exchange in geochemical processes in the study area wisitthammasri et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 and a secondary origin of ca 2 and mg 2 other than the dissolution of carbonate minerals srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 jia et al 2020 the absence of halites in this area would limits the geogenic contribution to the ca cl water type leaching of the upper layers of the soil from industrial and domestic activities eg use of sodium hypochlorite could lead to the formation of a nak cl facies in some areas na concentrations were moreover higher than those found in contact with the un weathered rock 4 1 5 9 mg l braun et al 2005 these anthropogenic inputs seem to justify the globally high concentrations of po4 3 median 0 08 to 0 13 mg l compared to what is generally observed in the shallow groundwater of granito gneissic formations 0 03 mg l meybeck 1984 the concentration of heavy metals generally varied between 0 and 1 2 mg l in the dug wells against 0 and 0 16 mg l in springs with the exception of mn cu pb cd and ag whose concentrations varied between 0 15 10 3 and 1 2 mg l and between 0 24 10 3 and 1 2 mg l in dug wells and springs respectively table 1 further analysis of these elements will be made in the following sections 3 3 multivariate analysis results 3 3 1 correlation matrix the study of associations between variables using the correlation matrix is useful in showing the consistency of the data set a high correlation coefficient close to 1 or 1 means a good relationship between two variables and its value around zero means no relationship between them at a significant level of p 0 05 varol and davraz 2014 in this study the relationship among each of the hydrogeochemical parameters was considered according to a pearson correlation matrix the parameters showing correlation coefficients r 0 5 and r between 0 3 and 0 5 were considered as strongly correlated and weakly correlated respectively the correlation matrices of all parameters including 26 for the springs and 27 for the dug wells were presented in table 2 ec showed a high positive or even perfect correlation with tds r 0 9 which implies the absence of less soluble charged compounds in groundwater that may contribute to total dissolved solids khan et al 2020 the positive correlation of other ions with ec and tds suggests their significant contribution to groundwater chemistry especially in springs the negative springs and no dug wells correlation between tds and na associated with a na cl ratio showing nearly 55 of values less than 1 esm 1 fig 3 suggests that the silicate weathering reaction or cation exchange was not the primary source of na the strong and positive correlation between cl and no3 suggests the contribution of domestic wastewater septic tank effluent and animal waste in the pollution of groundwater by nitrates the chloride contents in rainwater from yaoundé are 1 3 0 7 mg l kuitcha et al 2012 indicating a limited intake of chloride in groundwater this suggests that high levels of cl especially in dug wells indicate additional inputs other than atmospheric deposition its origin can be attributed to geogenic sources dissolution of chlorine bearing minerals present in igneous rocks such as apatite biotite and amphibole and to potential anthropogenic sources particularly water treatment chlorination of groundwater and human or animal wastewater according to kortatsi et al 2008 and khan et al 2020 the highly destructive nature of the acidic environment which leads to the concentration of certain ions results in a positive and sometimes negative correlation between ph and other ions precipitation of fe oxyhydroxides can explain low correlation between fe and so2 4 especially in dug wells kortatsi et al 2008 indicate that precipitation of iron in the amorphous fe oh 3 and hydrated form hematite feooh a characteristic mineral of weathering rocks in hot and humid climates can be observed when the so4 2 contents are low median 2 7 mg l in this study the correlation between nickel and copper indicates that they could come from the same source such as the corrosive activity of the ni cu alloy in a household material the bond observed between fe pb and cd suggests a common origin of these three elements in fact the geology of the study area consist of orthogneiss whose weathering results to ferrallitic soils see section 2 2 as such giving iron a natural terrigenous origin according to adeli et al 2021 this correlation is generally observed due to their similar geochemical behavior including adsorption and dissolution in geochemical environments the potential adsorption of cd primarily by aluminosilicates such as clay minerals as well as iron oxy hydroxides results in significant correlations between this element and fe and al therefore the weak affinity of iron or strong negative with cd and pb suggests an anthropogenic origin of these heavy metals in water this observation is also valid for mn and zn whose weak negative correlation implies according to towfiqul islam et al 2017 the existence of different sources and processes of metal pollution see urban environment section 2 1 various degrees of correlation between different pairs of parameters were observed in springs and dug wells and may be related to contrasting conditions of flow and heterogeneity of shallow groundwater 3 3 2 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca reduces the dimensionality of a multivariate data set into fewer components that describe and explain the information contained in the data jehan et al 2020 thus the pca of all data contributed for a maximum of eight 8 and six 6 components responsible for 85 84 and 100 of the total variance having eigenvalues greater than 1 for dug wells and springs respectively esm 1 fig 4 table 3 the percentages represented by each factor are relatively low indicating a limited structuring of the variance characteristic of water whose mineralization is controlled by many factors their combined action has led to the existence of the different categories of water shown in the piper diagram fig 6 in water from dug wells ec tds mg2 k so4 2 hco3 no3 and br showed high positive loads 0 5 at factor 1 and expressed 20 84 of the total variance table 3a k and no3 presented higher loads 0 6 except tds and ec however wisitthammasri et al 2020 indicated that k is generally less abundant than other ions and is present in groundwater at concentrations below 5 mg l average 10 mg l in this study this shows an anthropogenic imprint leading to a subsequent increase of tds ec the ion combinations influencing the high positive loads observed on the first factor suggest that this main factor was associated with a combination of various hydrogeochemical processes that contribute to the mineralization of groundwater in the study area this finding is not surprising in shallow aquifers in urban areas where mineralization is broadly controlled by both geogenic processes related to water soil rock interactions and the effects of human activities ouandaogo yameogo et al 2013 rajmohan et al 2017 chen et al 2019 gao et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 geogenic processes can be characterized by weathering of silicate minerals oxidation reduction eq 4 and ion exchange fig 7 b the general reaction reflecting the water silicate rocks interactions can be written garrels and mackenzie 1967 na ca mg k silicates h2co3 h4sio4 hco3 na ca mg k solid products however in crystalline terrains weathering usually takes place to a very limited extend because of the limited quantity of weatherable material kortatsi et al 2008 and fouépé takoundjou et al 2020 reported that natural processes such as the incongruent dissolution of silicates that react with co2 gas from root respiration and aqueous co2 could be a mechanism that releases na and k into the groundwater rock water reactions are generally ph dependent thus the low contribution of ph to f1 suggests a low influence of ph on mineralization this implies that anthropogenic activities small industries landfills and sewage may be the main potential contributor influencing the groundwater chemistry of this factor ligavha mbelengwa and gomo 2020 also showed a low contribution of ph to f1 due to a variety of anthropogenic sources as the main potential factor influencing groundwater chemistry in a typical karoo aquifer in beaufort west town south africa in line with the observations of these authors this factor can be called major component of ionic pollution no3 concentration in groundwater is obviously linked to the influence of sources of anthropogenic origin return irrigation fertilizers and wastewater treatment and no3 showed a combination with hco3 according to subba rao et al 2006 the combination of hco3 and no3 ions is an indication of the hydrogeochemical effect of runoff leaks on groundwater indeed the transformations mineralization of organic matter for example produced at the surface are caused by leaching of the soil with the infiltration of rainwater this is further accentuated in humid tropics where high intensity rainfall events pose a risk to shallow groundwater in urban settings due to reduced attenuation in the unsaturated zone when groundwater intersects with the base of pit latrines and sewer networks lapworth et al 2017 the factor f2 expressed 15 02 of the total variance and had high positive loads for the variables ph so4 2 hco3 in dug wells this factor also exhibited a high negative load for cl 0 61 and can thus express the hydrolysis of silicate minerals with infiltration of water containing carbon dioxide and organic acids as indicated by wisitthammasri et al 2020 the control of ph and the so4 2 hco3 levels is generally assumed to occur by natural processes the leaching of organic matter resulting from the oxidation of pyrite or precipitation of fe oxyhydroxides which produces sulphates and hydrogen ions would have created an acidic environment see eq 4 favoring the dissolution of silicates so4 2 and hco3 are probably the result of the oxidation of organic matter which has seeped from the surface into the subsoil causing an increase in ph subba rao et al 2006 conclude that bicarbonate concentrations and ph in groundwater are the result of the reaction of soil co2 with the dissolution of silicate minerals during water soil and water rock interactions factor 2 can be an acid mineralization factor the loads of so4 2 and hco3 ions in the two main components indicate that their concentration in groundwater is controlled by several factors notably weathering linked to anthropized organic acids and carbonic acids hco3 and both mineral dissolution oxidation and anthropogenic effect so4 2 however although so4 2 correlates with component 1 it has a higher load with component 2 suggesting that the processes represented by component 2 have a greater effect on the concentration of so4 2 than those represented by component 1 it is slightly the opposite for hco3 ion factor 3 with 11 63 of the total variance exhibited high positive loads 0 65 in ni and f this factor also exhibited a high negative load in mo 0 58 ni is a siderophilic element that can arise from the pedogenic process municipal discharges and vehicle emissions xiao et al 2019 on the other hand the concentration of fluoride in groundwater is generally attributed to leaching of fluoride bearing minerals exchange of fluoride and oh ions in clay minerals and intensive use of fertilizers subba rao et al 2006 machiwal and jha 2015 wisitthammasri et al 2020 the positive and negative loads in the other factors are strongly represented by metallic trace elements including mn cu cd pb by these groupings these factors can reflect a metallic mineralization of geogenic and anthropogenic origin corroborating with the geological and environmental context of the area wastewater discharges processing of materials such as welding presence of garages and automobile exhaust in the water from springs ph ec tds t c so4 2 cl hco3 no3 fe and mn exhibited high loads on f1 which represented 29 98 of the total variance table 3b these elements would come from the mixture of natural processes particularly weathering reactions ph ec tds t c so4 2 and hco3 oxidation reduction fe mn so4 2 fe and superficial inputs anthropogenic sources in the water mineralization of the area cl no3 this factor is also loaded by the ph fe and mn which may indicate the role of ph in the mobility of these elements which according to adeli et al 2021 is done in soluble conditions the factor f2 expressed 25 36 of the total variance and had high positive loads for the variables t c mg2 cu ni and f this factor also had high negative loads for al pb br and ag this factor may seemingly have a lithogenic source anthropogenic sources of br urban runoff pesticides and disinfectant products wisitthammasri et al 2020 and cu such as industrial effluents and domestic wastewater are unlikely in factor 2 while mg and f are often used to qualitatively determine the reserve and leaching of the bedrock the high negative load in so4 2 0 7 and low in ph 0 4 suggests that the leaching of organic matter resulting from the oxidation of pyrite does not occur in factor 2 factor 3 expressed 17 62 of the total variance and exhibited high positive loads in k zn and mo and high negative loads in ca2 and po4 2 like ni zn is believed to come from municipal waste and vehicle emissions and galvanized products mo could come from the oxidation of molybdenite linked to pyrite in these waters this element is not associated with sulfate or iron indicating an anthropogenic origin of this element in water unlike dug well water the other factors are less represented by metallic trace elements implying a small metallic footprint but a tendency to pollution linked to urban agriculture k po4 2 3 3 3 spatial distribution of groundwater quality based on factor scores the scores maps of the first three factors have been represented since they seem to globally involve the main geogenic and anthropogenic processes that influence the water quality of the area factor 1 scores ranged from 4 19 to 3 12 and 62 of the factor scores in most places ranged from 0 56 to 3 12 fig 8 a this suggests that the effect of geogenic and anthropogenic processes in the study area is omnipresent however the factor scores are very low 0 5 along or near the stream which is the lowest topographically and potentially high mineralization zone according to the commonly presented hydrogeochemical model tóth 1999 the dug wells corresponding to this zone presented low tds varying between 28 and 275 mg l mean 133 mg l while the zones presenting scores 0 5 presented high mineralization 169 473 mean 284 mg l most of the dug wells located in this zone low scores exhibited nitrate concentrations 46 mg l with the exception of dug wells d14 52 mg l and d18 108 mg l the high levels of which may involve local contamination related to effluent from latrines dug well 4 with an no3 concentration of less than 10 mg l can be considered as a natural biogenic background this suggests that the acidification is due to biogeochemical processes generation of co2 in the soil through the respiration of roots and the decomposition of organic matter or the mineralization of anthropogenic organic matter promotes the dissolution of silicates as discussed earlier unlike factor 1 factor 2 had high scores 0 63 and 3 73 in the low mineralization zone fig 8b which is also of high acidity ph mean 4 6 a similar analysis by dragon and gorski 2015 in poland had indicated that the areas with low scores are the areas where the potential effects due to infiltration are relatively higher this means that the whole study area could act as a recharge area the presence of high scores f2 near the stream illustrates an unexpected trend in groundwater tds evolution in the study area this type of trend also observed in the southern edge of the chinese loess plateau jia et al 2020 may imply the influence of surface water on the mineralization likely dilution with a decrease in tds of groundwater due to the hydraulic connections generally observed between them it would be important to carry out additional studies to clarify these exchanges but if the piezometric study revealed the gain conditions for the olézoa stream bon et al 2021 factor 3 scores varied between 3 05 and 4 83 but the highest scores were observed in the center of the watershed and the lowest downstream and upstream of the watershed fig 8c the distribution of these scores illustrates the urban structure of the area which is marked by a strong increase of commercial activities repair shops garages paintings inns etc and solid landfills in the center of the basin favored by the presence of relatively gentle slopes bon 2017 these anthropogenic activities can therefore lead to the release of plumbing materials containing lead the concentration of corrosion of household materials nickel or copper alloys some concentrations are due to leaching from surface solid waste landfills these elements which are leached reach the water table especially under humid conditions 3 3 4 correlation of pc to water table depth the factor 1 expressing 20 84 of the total variance presented a high load 0 5 with the depth of the water table the other factors having presented very low or even zero loads the distribution of scores for the first principal component is omnipresent in the area with positive high scores at high topographic points and negative scores at low topographic points these topographical points are at the watershed scale and in a manner consistent with general hydrogeological knowledge groundwater recharge and discharge zones respectively freeze and cherry 1979 this means that a large part of the watershed could serve as a recharge area consistent with the discussion in section 3 3 3 and that groundwater flow can be an important element on the first main factor subba rao et al 2006 showed that the first principal component acts as a dominant and extensive controlled factor in the aquifer when the score distribution pattern of this component is spread over most of the anantapur district andhra pradesh india they suggested that when topography controls the depth of groundwater levels which in turn controls the water quality the distribution pattern of the scores of the first major component can be used as an indication of the direction of groundwater flow with due regard to topographical features groundwater levels and human activities the decrease in scores from upstream to downstream is very similar to the topography gradient and therefore to groundwater flows as indicated by subba rao et al 2006 the second principal component score distribution pattern is an indication of a hydrogeologically isolated environment caused by local changes in groundwater flow 3 3 5 hierarchical cluster analysis the shape of the dendrogram showed the grouping into two main groups and five sub groups with varying levels of similarity fig 9 a group i with a distance of 84 were linked to those from group ii at a distance of 55 and tds corresponding to this groups were 316 and 148 mg l respectively other than this decrease in tds between main groups the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater did not show very significant zonation in the study area this is consistent with the ubiquitous factor 1 see principal component analysis and implies an integrated influence of anthropogenic and natural factors on groundwater chemistry the average stiff diagram of each group clearly shows the differences and similarities among clusters fig 9b all groups exhibited low so4 2 concentrations and showed facies consistent with that of piper diagram fig 6 the two pairs c1 c3 and c4 c5 are quite similar with ca2 dominance but differ on the anion side because of the high cl concentration in c1 and c5 these groups are all characterized by the ca cl type but compared to c3 c1 showed much higher mg2 concentrations this again shows a hydrogeochemical consistency on the mixing process of various water pollution sources in contrast to these 4 groups in c2 the dominant ions were hco3 for the anion and ca2 na k cations the magnitude of which indicates an ion exchange consistent with the ca mg vs hco3 so4 plot fig 7b previous analyses have indicated that the camg hco3 and nak hco3 facies reflect natural geochemical processes including silicate weathering and ion exchange ligavha mbelengwa and gomo 2020 indicated that the ca hco3 hydrochemical facies typically defines the chemistry after the first phase of evolution during recharge the ions ca2 and mg2 expressing the role of calcium feldspars and ferromagnesium biotite respectively according to back 1966 c2 with camg hco3 type implies an initial stage of groundwater evolution due to the geogenic process while the four others groups indicate a later or intermediate stage depending on the values of tds and hco3 chen et al 2019 indicate that this gradation of water evolution involves a combination of processes that result in nonlinear dynamic behaviors of chemical constituents within the aquifer matrix 3 4 groundwater flow systems 3 4 1 landscape chemical compartmentalization the distribution of groundwater flow is strongly influenced by topography and organized between slopes and the partitioning of recharge between shallow local and deep regional groundwater transfers goderniaux et al 2013 the hydrochemical flow of groundwater systems can also relate to this morphology some authors have indicated that the increase in upstream to downstream mineralization is significant when the main process contributing to mineralization is water rock interaction yidana et al 2011 ligavha mbelengwa and gomo 2020 this implies greater mineralization in landfill areas where the piezometric level is generally close to the ground independently of the other hydrogeological factors various studies have shown that the position of groundwater level is related to the climatic conditions and thus to the recharge rate of the water table indeed under wet hyper recharge conditions 4000 mm year nlend et al 2020 groundwater levels are close to the topographic surface whereas in semi arid areas with low recharge 15 mm year to 25 mm year cheo et al 2017 macdonald et al 2021 the groundwater levels are very low thus limiting the interception of the piezometric surface by topography freeze and cherry 1979 bon et al 2021 according to goderniaux et al 2013 water circulations are more local for high recharge rates while low recharge rates mainly lead to regional circulations various authors mifflin 1988 ayraud et al 2008 dragon and gorski 2015 have used geochemical tools to compartmentalize flows local regional in this study the na k vs cl so4 2 ionic ratio showed that the groundwater flow systems in the area are 88 local against 12 for intermediate flows fig 10 a the intermediate flows correspond to dug wells 1 and 10 located between 773 and 737 m altitude with a thickness of the unsaturated zone of 9 and 4 m respectively the chemical facies corresponding to these dug wells are camg cl and camg hco3 respectively indicating that groundwater flow in the metaplutonite aquifer system alters the facies distribution this predominance of local flows shows once again the groundwater surface relationship to this effect goderniaux et al 2013 indicate that in the presence of high recharge rates groundwater streamlines are generally short between recharge areas which form a very dense hydrographic network the evolution of the average concentrations of no3 na and tds according to the landscape showed an enrichment of no3 and tds from the mid slope zone downstream while the concentration of these parameters decreased from upstream to the mid slope zone the mean na concentration indicated a decrease from upstream to downstream fig 10b the downstream enrichment of tds from the mid slope zone is consistent with the hydrogeochemical flow model which is characterized by the increase in tds from high to low points as they pass through the flow system perrin et al 2011 alazard et al 2015 with high points representing recharge areas lachassagne et al 2021 indicate that when springs and rivers drain the aquifer in the basement zone the aquifer s discharge zone cannot be contrasted with an upstream aquifer recharge zone due to the unconfined nature of the aquifer the entire watershed of the aquifer contributes to its recharge therefore mid slope areas which are topographically discharge areas can also be recharge areas the ionic behavior appears to indicate different hydrodynamic and geochemical characteristics and changes in hydrogeochemical conditions along the groundwater flow path it is consistent with the discussion on correlation of pc to water table depth suggesting the existence of hydrogeologically isolated environments the stratification of mineralization is very similar to that of the landscape and therefore to the hydrodynamic conditions we are therefore in the presence of an organization of flows between the slopes with several local groundwater systems linked to the hilly nature of the study area see location and geomorphological setting bhattacharya et al 2012 indicated that local topography can influence the amount of groundwater flow divides and local flow systems can lead to shorter residence times and intense flushing and therefore low content of minerals in groundwater this distribution of hydrochemistry belonging to the groundwater spatial types demonstrates the complete embodiment of the groundwater flow system to hydrogeology and landform illustrated by other work elsewhere in the world yidana et al 2011 dragon and gorski 2015 wang et al 2015 khangembam and singh 2021 lower concentrations of na observed in the downstream sector of the aquifer contrast with the progressive mineralization that generally occurs along the flow lines this assumes that the input of na in groundwater is related to the proximity of anthropogenic sources with many student dormitories particularly water from pit latrines and the leakage of solid waste in the water mineralization where pit construction is based on the common principle of digging deep for a long fill time deep dug wells may therefore be more prone to direct contamination in addition to this the practice of regular disinfection of dug wells with chlorine bleach however some upstream dug wells have a weathered layer that acts more like a porous medium with a high storage capacity thus buffering the vertical flow except when preserved fractures are present as indicated by lachassagne et al 2011 2021 with an increase in transit times groundwater flowing through this layer will have relatively high concentrations of dissolved elements and higher mineralization due to the relatively long transit time and high solubility of the intercepted materials similarly bon et al 2021 indicate that the thickness and hydrodynamic properties of this layer may be more or less favorable to flow resulting in variable tds values while upstream downstream mineralization ionic enrichment is generally related to water rock interaction the decrease observed in this study may imply according to muller et al 2006 attenuation of elemental concentrations in a groundwater body with a long travel time between the recharge and discharge zone 3 4 2 evolution of chemical parameters with water table depth water depth is an important parameter in the identification of geochemical processes and even of the degree of vulnerability of water tables some authors wang et al 2015 machiwal and jha 2015 nlend et al 2020 have indicated that groundwater levels have significant effects on groundwater quality since the groundwater quality parameters are diluted during the rainy season due to the recharge of rainwater the groundwater levels of the dug wells sampled for quality n 17 varied from 0 5 10 m no chemical parameter showed a very strong correlation for example r 0 7 with the water table depth table 2a many authors modeled the distribution of groundwater chemistry in shallow hard rock aquifers in france ayraud et al 2008 and in india alazard et al 2015 maréchal et al 2018 and showed a lack of significant correlation between water table depth and chemical components ions and apparent water age therefore the lack of correlation indicates a heterogeneous characteristic of the aquifer consistent with what is observed in the hard rocks zones based on the stiff diagram we notice a vertical structure in three parts around the average depths 1 and 8 m and a trend of increasing tds and hco3 with depth fig 9b similar studies in china by wang et al 2015 and li et al 2021 to characterize groundwater hydrochemistry as a function of depth showed an inverse behavior illustrating what is generally observed in environments with less anthropogenic impact however tóth s 1999 classic model the lower reaches of a groundwater basin could be the discharge area of local intermediate and regional flow systems na and no3 showed a good positive correlation with the water table depth r 0 5 the concentration of na decreased above 1 m corresponding to the low altitude areas where the piezometric fluctuations are weak this zone has been identified as the one with imposed potential of stream stream boundary where the dug wells have piezometric levels very close to the ground surface except p18 the enrichment of this ion with the water table depth is similar to the tds from eight meters fig 10b where the dug wells located at high altitude show strong piezometric fluctuations there is no noticeable trend in na concentrations between these two depths 1 8 m the area corresponding to average piezometric fluctuations similarly high concentrations of no3 have been observed in shallow and deep dug wells fig 10b several studies indicate that elevated na concentrations in groundwater are frequently observed after long term water rock e g na plagioclase minerals interactions due to the denitrification process no3 concentrations are generally low at depth ayraud et al 2008 rajmohan et al 2017 therefore the excess na in deep groundwater 8 m coupled with the elevated no3 concentrations implies localized pollution related to the environment of individual dug wells e g direct contamination vertical lateral flow related to their proximity to latrines the absence of a decrease in the ph and the water table depth no correlation and the high concentrations of no3 suggests an open system with a low nitrate reduction capacity characteristic of aquifers with high susceptibility to nitrates appelo and postma 2005 rajmohan et al 2017 wali et al 2019 most studies based on knowledge of changes in aquifer hydrochemistry have shown diffuse recharge mechanisms combining piston flow and preferential flow paths perrin et al 2011 wang et al 2015 alazard et al 2015 maréchal et al 2018 burri et al 2019 lyu et al 2019 khangembam and singh 2021 the apparent existence of hydrochemical compartments at the watershed scale may imply the complexity of these mechanisms that induce according to these authors a stratification of groundwater chemistry and create local geochemical heterogeneity within a compartment spatial variations in groundwater chemistry are attributed to different residence times also depending on hydraulic properties for instance maréchal et al 2018 indicate that higher k content is caused by longer water rock interaction in low transmissivity zones lachassagne et al 2021 indicate that under natural conditions most groundwater flow results from recharge of the upper aquifer saprolite consisting of alloterite and isalterite the hydraulic conductivity of the alloterite is lower than that of the isalterite because the former is more clayey therefore this composite aquifer may have strong vertical hydrogeochemical stratification previous studies in the study area have shown vertical variation in the aquifer see fig 3 and variation in saprolite hydraulic conductivity with values from of 10 7 to 10 4 m s bon et al 2016b ndam ngoupayou et al 2019 bon et al 2021 suggesting heterogeneity in saprolite storage and thus different residence times this chemical compartmentalization can have a significant impact on the transport of contaminants and the management of pollution especially metal 4 characteristics of heavy metals 4 1 distribution of heavy metals in groundwater heavy metals are naturally redistributed in the environment by geological processes and biological cycles their concentrations can vary widely depending on the extent of exposure to these minerals however beyond certain limits in drinking water they become toxic to humans towfiqul islam et al 2017 rakotondrabe et al 2018 adeli et al 2021 in the present study metals such as fe al cd cu pb mn mo ni and zn were taken into account in order to assess the risk of metal contamination to public health the average concentrations of these metals showed the following decreasing order mn mo ni al zn cu fe pb cd in the dug wells and mn mo ni al cu fe zn pb cd see table 1 the order of abundance and the very heterogeneous variations in both springs and dug wells suggest hydrochemical differentiation linked to hydrodynamic conditions similarly substantial differences in the concentrations of these parameters with the depth of the water table have been observed suggesting heavy metal contamination according to ins and bgr 2013 very low concentrations of dissolved iron manganese and aluminum are to be expected in yaoundé s groundwater in accordance with the rigorous oxidizing hydrochemical conditions however local reducing conditions related to the proximity of waste disposal sites or to low topographic conditions can give rise to high concentrations of these elements the concentrations of mn mo ni pb and cd were above the standard values of who 2017 in some areas as indicated by the boxplots fig 11 the presence of these undesirable elements in concentrations above who standards constitute a potential danger to human health 4 2 metal pollution index the pollution index values ranged between 59 69 and 273 25 the average was 172 25 with a standard deviation of 59 10 considering the hpi classes singh and kamal 2016 hpi 15 low 15 30 medium and hpi 30 high we find that all samples belong to the high class similarly 2 samples 8 33 were below the critical hpi value of 100 above which the overall pollution level should be considered unacceptable prasad and sangita 2008 the incorporation of hpi into the correlation matrix showed that pb mo and ni are important elements in the toxicity of water see esm 2 this observation corroborates with the presence of poorly sanitized student residential areas manufactured products from mini industries and numerous uncontrolled solid landfills these contribute a considerable amount of metals to groundwater through batteries disposable household items plastics paints inks and personal care or drug products this supports a recent assessment of polar pesticide and pharmaceutical contamination of groundwater resources in yaoundé see branchet et al 2018 2019 this result must be taken into account by administrative authorities because it poses a serious threat to human health the spatial distribution of hpi fig 12 indicates heterogeneous point sources of groundwater pollution domestic wastewater small industries highlighted above by the weak negative correlation between mn and zn the lowest value was observed in dug well 4 which also had a lower ec 55μs cm and was indicated as a natural biogenic background the low hpi associated with low mineralization characteristic of precambrian formations implies minimal influence from anthropogenic sources thus the concentrations obtained in dug well 4 can reflect the geochemical background or reference concentrations of this sub saharan zone made up of orthoderived migmatites this dug well can therefore be used in monitoring the dynamics of pollutants in this urban ecosystem on the other hand the highest values were observed at dug wells 3 273 25 31 263 24 located to the north and south of the watershed respectively fig 11 dug well 3 just like dug well 27 had a low hpi 109 81 an electrical conductivity greater than 900 μs cm against 449 μs cm for dug well 31 in addition dug wells 3 and 4 which distant about 40 m are all located to the north and were dug on the same geological basement and do not have any mini industrial activity in the vicinity it is therefore noticed that ec and hpi move both from the geogenic background to very high levels in the short distance urban area while short range variations of ec in urban shallow groundwater in yaoundé is not a new fact see kringel et al 2016 that of hpi had not yet been highlighted in this urban site and even elsewhere in the world based on our current knowledge some metals like mo pb and ni also exhibit similar behavior in these dug wells and between dug wells 8 and 10 post et al 2017 also showed in groundwater in northern burundi a localized but short range occurrence of dissolved uranium concentrations that may indicate a control of structural geological features other hydrochemical studies have also highlighted the impact of physical heterogeneity and aquifer compartmentalization on groundwater chemistry these studies conducted in different climatic contexts have shown physical compartmentalization weak boreholes less than 100 m apart and strong boreholes more than 300 m apart of hard rock aquifers at the weathering profile scale ayraud et al 2008 lachassagne et al 2011 dewandel et al 2011 maréchal et al 2018 and at the fissured fractured part scale of the aquifer perrin et al 2011 alazard et al 2015 lachassagne et al 2021 while further geochemical isotope or approach weathering profile scale or geophysical evidence is still needed to strengthen our observations it is consistent to assume that the chemical contrasts between less distant dug wells suggest a compartmentalization of the aquifer on a small scale that may be related to the geologic setting of the area indeed previous studies in the study area indicated alternating convex and concave undulations 30 cm in amplitude within the wall of loose weathered material which are thicker in the concave portion bon et al 2016a bon 2017 these have been attributed to the dome and basin structure exhibited by the roof of the yaounde metaplutonite formations the compartmentalization that appears to emerge at the saprolite level even with no vertical concentration profile at the dug well level saprolite having heterogeneous materials suggests that compartmentalization is a common characteristic of hard rock aquifers saprolite fractured zone regardless of climatic context due to the geological structure which causes an altitudinal variation of the alterite basement weathered layer and the weathered fissured zone interface this variation is characterized by increased thickness of weathered material in the vicinity of faults ayraud et al 2008 lachassagne et al 2011 alazard et al 2015 4 3 background and threshold values of heavy metals nbls of groundwater chemical parameters were calculated using the pre selection method and the grubbs test n 30 based on the pre selection criteria including minimal influence of anthropogenic activities and water level de caro et al 2017 gao et al 2020b nlend et al 2020 dug well 4 d4 characterized by a no3 concentration 1 mg l falling within the range of the geogenic background of groundwater in tropical forest environments 0 07 0 6 mg l and that of the saprolite weathering front 0 074 1 0 braun et al 2005 was considered a reference in the determination of nbl since sampling was done at the depth of the piezometric level which is heterogeneous in this study the reference piezometric level similar to the relative depth of each well estimated by ayraud et al 2008 corresponding to d4 2 5 m close to the median piezometric level of the study area 2 2 m was associated with the reference concentrations the range of nbl tv and tif values retro transformed from log10 values obtained from the appropriate methods for the different metals are shown in table 4 the nbls of groundwater chemical parameters obtained showed clear distinctions between the two methods but showed fairly close values for fe 0 01 mg l al 0 1 mg l and cd 3 10 3 mg l these nbls fe al and cd correspond to the concentrations of these parameters in the d4 this shows the hydrogeochemical consistency of the criteria e g on major ions muller et al 2006 rotiroti et al 2015 de caro et al 2017 and implies that the ps approach and the grubbs test can yield similar nbls when the threshold value is based on the natural background level of a well that is likely to reference the hydrogeological conditions piezometry and chemistry in the study area only zn showed ps nbl higher than the grubbs nbl test suggesting an overestimation of the anthropogenic data de caro et al 2017 the tvs calculated from the reference concentrations d4 varied between 3 05 10 3 and 1 56 mg l the proximity of the tv to fe and al 0 2 mg l can be illustrative of the contents of these elements in laterites indeed laterites rich in iron and aluminum oxide like any residual product sexquioxides from humid tropical conditions testify to the low geochemical mobility of these metals tif values could not be determined for some metals due to the presence of zero concentrations nevertheless tv and tif of cd are quite close 0 003 mg l suggesting a concordance between the preselection and statistical methods for certain chemical elements a similarity was also observed between the tif and 98th percentile values for mn cu pb and cd esm1 table 3 esm 2 such an observation is consistent with the findings of reimann and de caritat 2017 and gao et al 2019 indicating that the tif provide estimates fairly close to the 98th percentile the concentrations of mn mo and pb were mainly higher more than 75 than nbl both in the dug wells and springs where we also find the concentrations of fe cu and ni higher than nbl over 51 of dug well and spring water samples showed values greater than tv for the metals mn mo and pb also indicating the importance of these metals in the toxicity of groundwater no element showed a concentration greater than tif but dug well d1 and spring s2 exhibited mn concentrations quite close to tif the same applies to dug well 11 for cu dug wells 11 14 and 21 for pb and with the exception of dug well 28 and spring 6 for cd whose values of tif and tv determined from the reference dug well were similar these results show that exposure to these elements could make the inhabitants of this area vulnerable to various diseases this appears to be a serious concern in terms of the quality potential of groundwater and the urgency of regular monitoring of trace elements in groundwater in this humid tropical urban area 5 simplified conceptual modelling of groundwater flow the approach used involving data from groundwater levels hydrochemistry and previous work allows to propose a conceptual model of groundwater flow and hydrochemical evolution at the olézoa watershed scale fig 13 this watershed is an entity of the mfoundi watershed mefou sub watershed subject to humid climatic conditions of sub recharge 87 mm year fouépé takounjou et al 2010 the groundwater flow regime is multidirectional from northeast to southwest north northeast to south southwest east to west and from east southeast to west northwest the spatial variability of the groundwater chemistry in this shallow aquifer as shown by na tds and no3 values is very similar to that of the landscape and suggesting an organization of flows between slopes with several local groundwater systems linked to the hilly nature of the study area this ionic behavior highlights two groundwater flow systems with intermediate flows appearing in areas where the saprolite thickness is important various studies have shown that saprolite when not fractured acts more like a porous medium that stores groundwater lachassagne et al 2011 thus increasing transit times this can justify a high average mineralization in the summit areas even though the anthropogenic impact has been evoked to explain an absence of the general increase of mineralization from upstream to downstream in this urban area in contradiction to the usual conceptual model however previous work has shown a variation in saprolite thickness related to weathering ancient weathering system 10 20 m thick derived from the degradation of lateritic systems and a more recent weathering 2 3 m thick developed on the fresh rock bon et al 2016a 2021 spatial and vertical variations in the physical soil type and hydraulic hydraulic conductivity properties of the saprolite were observed in the study area these properties coupled with the concavo convex structure of the bedrock roof may result in geochemical ec and hpi contrasts between less distant dug wells 50 m suggesting compartmentalization of the shallow aquifer on a small scale compared to other studies the hydrodynamic conditions and therefore of mineralization are generally similar to those described in hard rock aquifers ayraud et al 2008 perrin et al 2011 alazard et al 2015 due to a piezometric structure of the aquifer in great concordance with the topography the composite aquifer may show a vertical hydrogeochemical stratification both in the saprolite and in the fractured fissured zone lachassagne et al 2021 the groundwater studied is part of the active water cycle where shallow aquifers rarely reflect true natural concentration levels while deep aquifers may be free of anthropogenic impacts muller et al 2006 de caro et al 2017 water rock interaction processes prevail and may be associated with paleo recharge as is the case for the hyper recharged coastal aquifers nlend et al 2020 the physical compartmentalization of the aquifer is a common characteristic of hard rock aquifers this seems weak in porous saprolite unlike the active zone of the aquifer fractured zone where the distance between boreholes varies from 100 m to 500 m perrin et al 2011 alazard et al 2015 the results presented in this study are not sufficient to include the block geometry of the aquifer in this model and to propose an accurate conceptualization of groundwater recharge this study hypothesizes the existence of the temporal component of groundwater flow systems rapid and slow responses to recharge also occur at a local scale it would also be important to clarify the hydrogeological processes in the fractured part of the aquifer 6 conclusion the work carried out in this study illustrates the hydrogeological characteristics of a shallow hard rock aquifer in an urban context the main conclusions are the hydrochemical facies were predominantly camg cl camg hco3 nak hco3 ca cl and nak cl the multivariate analysis suggested the omnipresence of the effect of geogenic and anthropogenic processes in the study area factors which are mostly common in urban the hilly topography was favorable to a stratification of mineralization and the development of hierarchically nested groundwater flow systems nevertheless we noted the predominance of local flows more easily affected by surface contaminants regarding heavy metals the median hpi value was greater than the critical pollution index value of 100 indicating a high level of heavy metal pollution in addition hpi exhibited a behavior similar to electrical conductivity with values starting near the critical value at very high levels in the short distance urban area this suggests a physical compartmentalization of the shallow aquifer on a small scale the estimation of nbl and tv or of tif from a reference dug well showed the importance of pb mo and ni in groundwater toxicity and can thus help public authorities to efficiently evaluate the chemical state of groundwater and to implement a better management in general this study constitutes a first approach and improves the conceptual understanding of hard rock hydrogeological systems with generally complex geological and morphological characteristics it provides a knowledge base of hydrogeochemical processes and environmental levels of heavy metals useful for the sustainable management of groundwater resources in this urban part yaoundé cameroon of sub saharan africa the approach and analysis can be used as an example to attempt to characterize

8152,study region this study focused mainly on burkina faso in west africa study focus this study aims to identify environmental variables that best explain the geographic variations of the flow intermittency regime focusing on intermittency duration discharge data from 49 gauging stations were considered mostly over large rivers the mean number of dry months n d r y was used as a predictor to define four classes of flow intermittency for which the potential explanatory environmental variables were assessed based on correlation analysis and principal component analysis pca new hydrological insights for the region the first two components pcs account for 82 of the total variance with pc1 52 and most of the catchments with similar flow intermittency are ordered according to pc2 30 predominantly related to catchment permeability moreover permeability was highly correlated with n d r y r 0 75 results suggest that catchment permeability and catchment areas are the most critical variables in determining flow intermittency classes in burkina faso as the effect of precipitation can be overruled by the ones of permeability catchment area and strahler order this study is a first step in understanding the controls of river intermittency in data scarce and poorly gauged regions of west africa the identified variables could be used as input in statistical models to predict and map river intermittency and provide valuable information for stream conservation keywords intermittent streams ephemeral streams aquifer permeability catchment area flow regime principal component analysis 1 introduction intermittent rivers are rivers that stop flowing or go dry at some points in space and time while perennial rivers under normal conditions sustain a continuous flow throughout the year acuna et al 2014 gonzález ferreras and barquín 2017 most hydrological studies have long focused on perennial rivers rather than intermittent rivers meerveld et al 2020 still the latter also play an important role and deserve the same attention leigh et al 2016 intermittent rivers may account for more than 50 of all the world s rivers skoulikidis et al 2017 and make up a large proportion of headwater rivers ward et al 2020 in recent years they have been the subject of growing interest especially in their ecological functioning datry et al 2011 wilding et al 2018 they are involved in the upstream to downstream transport of sediment and organic matter required for feeding fish and other aquatic species reid and ziemer 1994 stubbington et al 2019 regulation of floods morin et al 2009 water quality processes dodds and oakes 2008 and in the share of greenhouse gas emissions datry et al 2018 faced with climate change challenges many studies predict an increase in the number of intermittent rivers in many parts of the world for the coming years de wit and stankiewicz 2006 jaeger et al 2014 in west africa senegal and mauritania may experience an increase in intermittency while intermittency may be relieved further east döll and schmied 2012 as a result of contrasting precipitation changes between the western and eastern parts of sahel over the 21st century gaetani et al 2020 these climatic trends could be modified by intense anthropogenic pressure on water resources especially in arid and semi arid environments of west africa leading to an increased threat to biodiversity and water supply in arid and semi arid regions most rivers are intermittent and are often the only significant water source for consumptive use jacobson and jacobson 2013 wekesa et al 2020 in these regions they are considered the primary groundwater recharge sources koïta et al 2017 shanafield and cook 2014 people heavily depend on them for instance for local irrigation acuna et al 2014 haile ghebremariam and van steenbergen 2006 the hydrological classification of rivers or catchments according to the characteristics of their flow regime is therefore critical especially in these regions where the well being of populations depends on the ability to manage water scarcity for food production castelli et al 2018 gebrehiwot et al 2011 zouré et al 2019 in africa and west africa in particular hydrological studies are hampered by data scarcity and poor gauging especially about streamflow discharge rabba et al 2018 this is a serious methodological challenge and may explain the low number of studies berhanu et al 2015 brousseau et al 2010 gebrehiwot et al 2011 perez saez et al 2017 rivers moore et al 2020 schacht 2019 which focused on the classification of the hydrological regime of catchments in africa a range of hydrological indices has been used to classify catchments according to their flow regimes the main components described by these indices are the magnitude timing duration rate of change and frequency of flow events poff and ward 1989 richter et al 1996 as smakhtin 2001 described intermittent and ephemeral streams are characterized by naturally extended periods of zero flow which may generally be perceived as the lower bound of low flow in hydrology the indices related to the duration and frequency of flow e g mean median percent and frequency of the number of days months with flow or zero flow per year season are the most important to assess flow intermittency and are commonly used in the literature costigan et al 2017 larned et al 2010 among these indices the duration of zero flow is of particular relevance as an indicator of water availability it is also an essential characteristic for river ecosystems and is considered a significant indicator of the potential aquatic species distribution and persistence that may inhabit a given environment datry et al 2012 leigh and datry 2017 vardakas et al 2017 for example snelder et al 2013 used hydrological indices to assess flow intermittency in france based solely on the mean annual frequency of zero flow periods and the mean duration of zero flow periods in the literature intermittent streams are referred to by various names such as temporary ephemeral irregular non permanent non perennial episodic seasonal interrupted such profusion of terms can be confusing as noted by uys and o keeffe 1997 in this way busch et al 2020 suggest using only the terms non perennial intermittent and ephemeral to characterize these streams the classification of streamflow intermittency in databases such as the nhd national hydrography dataset in the usa mainly focuses on field surveys and interviews with residents but in situ flow observations often disagree with this classification hafen et al 2020 the quantitative criteria used to classify the streams vary among authors hedman and osterkamp 1982 for example classified streams as perennial intermittent and ephemeral when flowing water is present annually more than 80 10 80 and less than 10 respectively reynolds et al 2015 categorized rivers as strongly intermittent when the mean number of zero flow days year 20 weakly intermittent when the mean number of zero flow days year 20 and perennial when the mean number of zero flow days year equals zero yu et al 2018 defined perennial streams as those that ceased flowing 10 of the year 0 1 month weakly intermittent as those that ceased flowing 10 70 of the year 2 8 months and strongly intermittent as those that ceased flowing 70 of the year 8 months despite a handful of studies conducted in several regions regarding the identification and classification of intermittent rivers an adequate understanding of the drivers controlling intermittency is still lacking costigan et al 2015 tooth 2000 we can cite several studies throughout the world that focused on identifying flow indices and potential environmental variables that best explain the different aspects of the flow regime alcázar and palau 2010 assani et al 2006 bejarano et al 2010 d ambrosio et al 2017 gallart gallego et al 2012 gebrehiwot et al 2011 kennard et al 2010 lane et al 2017 moliere et al 2009 oueslati et al 2015 however few studies have focused on assessing the main drivers of flow intermittency godsey and kirchner 2014 in their study assani et al 2006 assessed the factors influencing the spatial variability of annual minimum flow characteristics in the southern part of the st lawrence river watershed in quebec they showed that the spatial difference of annual minimum flow characteristics between the north and south shore is mainly due to climatic factors particularly annual precipitation reynolds et al 2015 found that the most influential landscape drivers of flow intermittency and low flows are precipitation snowfall potential evapotranspiration soil type and drainage area according to trancoso et al 2017 the controlling factors of zero flow ratio proportion of zero flows in the full flow record across different regions were aridity index and precipitation however they also pointed out that precipitation does not seem to impact the zero flow ratio in some tropical areas which are more sensitive to groundwater recharge and baseflow processes overall it appears that the spatial and temporal variation of streamflow intermittency results from the interaction between several environmental variables at the global and regional scale climatic variables especially the aridity index are likely to be the first order control of river flow intermittency costigan et al 2017 trancoso et al 2017 however river flow intermittency is also controlled by processes acting at smaller scales than climate drivers snelder et al 2013 local factors such as geology topography and land use land cover are important variables that also control the river intermittency and operate at different spatial and temporal scales buttle et al 2012 costigan et al 2016 kennard et al 2010 williams 2006 in west africa there have been very few studies specifically dedicated to assessing the controlling factors of flow intermittency understanding the potential drivers of river intermittency should lead to better water resources management through effective water allocations following climate induced pressures on the intermittent flow regime this study aimed to investigate the role of climate lithology and topographic controls on geographical variations in the hydrological regime of rivers in burkina faso with a particular focus on the duration of intermittency periods with zero flow to achieve this objective the following research goals were carried out i define a classification framework applied to river gauging observations in order to identify patterns in flow intermittency classes ii evaluate the role of lithology topography and climate on flow intermittency classes through multivariate analysis iii discuss their interactions and understand the spatial variability of flow intermittency 2 data and methods 2 1 study area located in central west africa burkina faso is a landlocked country covering an area of 274 200 km2 the altitude over half of the country ranges between 250 and 350 m above the sea level whereas the highest values do not exceed 750 m making the topography relatively flat the country area is divided into three principal watersheds comoe 17 590 km2 niger 83 642 km2 and volta 172 968 km2 fig 1 a the volta in burkina faso is subdivided into two sub watersheds mouhoun and nakanbe fig 1 b the study area is characterized by two alternating and contrasting seasons influenced by the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz where the humid wind coming from the atlantic ocean in the south monsoon meets the warm dry wind coming from the sahara in the north harmattan ibrahim 2012 of the two seasons there is a long dry season with almost no rainfall from october to may and a short rainy season from june to september rainfall is consequently highly seasonal with a peak generally occurring in august pana 2007 there is a climatic south north gradient of decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature and aridity across the country three climatic zones are commonly identified in the country based on the average annual precipitation jalloh et al 2013 pana 2007 the sahelian zone in the north average annual rainfall less than 600 mm the sudano sahelian zone in the central region average annual rainfall between 600 and 900 mm and the sudanian zone in the south average annual rainfall between 900 and 1200 mm fig 1a these various climatic settings make the country a representative regional case study to investigate and understand the factors that control flow intermittency 2 2 hydrological and environmental data discharge data from 36 gauged stations 16 stations with daily data and 19 stations with monthly data were provided by the dgre direction générale des ressources en eau in burkina faso over the period 1955 2017 in order to have more gauges some global and regional hydrological databases were used to supplement the gauging stations obtained from dgre and then provide additional information on gauging stations located in neighboring countries niger ghana and ivory coast to this end we used monthly data from the global runoff data center grdc 2019 for 45 gauged stations over the period 1951 1991 as well as daily data from the sierem système d informations environnementales sur les ressources en eau et leur modélisation database boyer et al 2006 for 80 gauging stations over the period 1952 2006 the complete dataset was checked and processed according to the following four criteria i gauged stations with less than 5 daily missing discharge records values per month were considered and averaged to monthly values ii for each gauge station only the years with complete data 12 months were considered iii for duplicate gauged stations featured in different databases only the one with the most extended record period was retained iv finally gauged stations with at least four years of complete monthly data were considered monthly time steps are often used to characterize river flow regimes gallart gallego et al 2012 yu et al 2018 particularly in data scarce areas perez saez et al 2017 a set of 58 gauged stations over the period 1952 2017 was finally constituted for further analysis a period of drought and desertification strongly affected west africa in the 1970s and 1980s fig 2a thus many studies pointed out a change in rainfall patterns from the year 1970 with a recovery around the 1990s barbé and lebel 1997 ouedraogo et al 2002 over the 58 gauges stations the maximum number of available gauging stations per year is observed between 1955 and 1990 fig 2 b from 1985 the number of available gauging stations had sharply decreased mostly restricted to large rivers to avoid the anthropic influence of numerous dams constructed since the 1980s cecchi et al 2007 a pre development period 1955 1985 was considered so that the river regimes are considered weakly altered the period 1955 1985 can be subdivided into two sub periods a normal period 1955 1969 followed by a drought period 1970 1985 over the period 1955 1985 49 gauging stations with at least four years of complete monthly data were considered for this study discharge data have an average availability of 14 years and the majority of gauges 61 22 have at least ten years of data fig 1a of supplemental material sm the river network used in this study was derived from the bndt database in burkina faso igb 2012 at a scale of 1 200 000 the strahler s order of the river network strahler 1957 was determined using the rivex tool hornby 2020 under esri arcgis software version 10 6 1 catchments delineated from each gauging station were derived from hydrosheds lehner et al 2008 digital elevation model dem with 3 approximately 90 m resolution the process was implemented in the r language r core team 2019 with an interface to grass gis the delineated catchment areas were compared with the information of catchment areas provided in the grdc and dgre databases thus 43 catchments are compared and showed similar areas r2 0 99 p value 0 001 sm fig 1b the catchments studied cover 87 of the country s surface area of which more than 50 have a surface area between 1000 10000 km2 sm fig 2 the permeability estimate in the study area was derived from lithological information rock type in burkina faso the information on the main lithological formations an updated version 2018 of castaing et al 2003 map was acquired from the bumigeb service bureau des mines et de la géologie du burkina faso at a scale of 1 1000000 to take into account the lithological information of some catchments that have a part of their area outside burkina faso we used the glim lithological layer hartmann and moosdorf 2012 which is the most recent global layer available at the scale of 1 3750000 however to ensure the nomenclature compatibility between the two databases for each lithology type defined at the country scale in the bumigeb database correspondence and reclassification criteria with the glim database were defined this allowed taking advantage of the lithological precision of the geological map of bumigeb scale 1 1 000 000 compared to those of the global glim database scale 1 3750000 sm fig 3 then a permeability map was derived from the lithological map by assigning a single permeability value for each lithology type as detailed in the supplementary material sm section 2 the value of each lithology type is based from the permeability range by sediment or rock type chapter 6 of maidment 1993 and on the fact that for a given climate and slope prior research has found higher drainage densities in areas with lower permeability schneider et al 2017 for each catchment the average permeability is obtained by weighting the permeabilities obtained for each lithology type by the area occupied by each lithology type in the catchment to investigate the impact of dams on river intermittency we used information on available dams from 1947 to 1985 sm section 3 as extracted from the grand database lehner et al 2011 over the period 1947 1985 the two most important dams are the lery dam 250 mm3 built in 1976 for agricultural purposes in the mouhoun watershed with 4 studied gauges downstream of the dam and the kompienga dam 2000 mm3 in the nakanbe watershed built in 1984 for hydroelectric purposes with only one studied station on the river far upstream of the dam sm fig 7 a significant proportion of small dams 1 mm3 are not listed in the grand database however all small dams together account for less than 4 of national storage capacity cecchi et al 2009 and represent about 60 7 of all dams in 1986 piquemal 1991 2 3 flow index and intermittency classification generally the flow duration is the primary descriptor of different stream classification fritz et al 2020 kaplan et al 2019 given the monthly time step chosen and for the sake of parsimony the mean number of dry months per year n d r y which represents the duration of intermittency is the flow index selected in this study to assess intermittency and is widely used in the literature a dry month is defined as a month for which all flows are equal to zero n d r y is a key metric relevant to river ecology vadher et al 2018 and is calculated according to eq 1 1 n d r y i n n d r y i n where ndry i is the number of dry months in a given year i and n is the number of considered years in this study based on terminologies established by uys and o keeffe 1997 rivers were categorized into four classes according to their mean number of dry months per year n d r y table 1 to get a long enough data record to characterize the spatial patterns of river flow intermittency in the study area with a consistent number of gauges throughout the period the monthly time step was preferred to the daily time step and the flow intermittency classes obtained when comparing the common gauges 5 with daily and monthly time step data over the study period are similar sm section 4 sm table 2 2 4 assessment of the potential factors of intermittency a range of variables describing environmental attributes table 2 was considered as potential explanatory factors of intermittency these variables were selected from the literature for their possible relevance in assessing the perennial or intermittent behavior of river streams d ambrosio et al 2017 kennard et al 2010 moliere et al 2009 snelder et al 2013 and also based on the availability and temporal resolution of the data these include topography 5 variables climate 5 variables and lithology bedrock permeability 1 variable land use land cover lulc data were not included because no dataset could be found over the studied period 1955 1985 the oldest dataset of the national land use database called bdot base de données d occupation des terres corresponds to the year 1992 and was shown to be of poor quality by cecchi et al 2009 anthropogenic factors might also influence the timing magnitude and duration of river flow hughes 2005 skoulikidis 2009 the evolution of flow intermittency classes for the 20 gauge stations common to the normal 1955 1969 and drought 1970 1985 sub periods shows that only 30 of these gauges exhibit a shift of flow class from the normal to the drought period besides this shift is modest as it consists of only one intermittency class fig 3 sm section 3 this analysis indicates a weak influence of both dams and drought on the evolution of intermittency classes and led us to neglect dams as potential explanatory factors all environmental variables were averaged for the catchments upstream of the gauging stations except for strahler order which is estimated at the gauging station location the set of environmental variables was further reduced to avoid multicollinearity by minimizing statistical redundancy among variables through a pearson correlation matrix at this stage for pairs of variables with a correlation above the threshold r 0 75 considered to indicate a high level of correlation only one was retained sm fig 8 the retained variable is the one that is also correlated with multiple others i e the variable with the highest absolute mean correlation with the other variables and therefore allows a set of highly correlated variables to be reduced it must be noted that evaporation related variables including the aridity index although often considered in similar studies were not kept in this process since they show a strong correlation with precipitation sm section 5 a final reduced set of four significant environmental variables independent variables included in further analyses are presented in table 2 in bold the principal component analysis pca is a multivariate statistical method for reducing large dataset dimensionality increasing interpretability while minimizing information loss jolliffe and cadima 2016 in this study it was used to i explore the relationship between significant environmental variables to show how they correlated to or deviated from each other ii identify patterns in catchments with similar flow intermittency classes iii analyze the relationship between the duration of intermittency n d r y and significant environmental variable pca was performed using xlstat addinsoft 2015 based on the set of 49 catchments and four 4 environmental variables in bold in table 2 before performing the pca the input variables were standardized to z score values so that all variables have the same weight van den berg et al 2006 the number of meaningful principal components pcs was determined using kaiser s criterion kaiser 1960 by selecting all components with eigenvalues greater than 1 assani et al 2006 the contribution of environmental variables to the explanation of a pc was considered significant if their loading value was at least 25 the duration of intermittency n d r y was introduced as a supplementary quantitative variable once the pca has been constructed this supplementary quantitative variable is not included in the calculation of distances between individuals it should facilitate the interpretation of the results and help detect the environmental variables that have the most significant impact on intermittency duration 3 results 3 1 flow intermittency classes all studied stations fall on medium to large rivers with a strahler order between 4 and 8 fig 4 a four flow intermittency classes were considered to categorize rivers in terms of intermittency section 2 3 it appears that 26 5 of gauge stations are perennial 16 are weakly intermittent 26 5 are highly intermittent and 30 are ephemeral table 1 fig 4a the perennial and weakly intermittent gauge stations are mostly located in the south western part of the country mouhoun and comoe basins fig 4a fig 5 a where intermittent gauges are only found in upstream reaches with medium strahler orders 4 5 in contrast the eastern part of the country nakanbe and niger basins shows a huge majority of highly intermittent and ephemeral gauges whichever the stream order fig 4a fig 5a fig 5b shows that the classification based on the mean number of dry months per year remains effective at the annual timescale since the number of dry months per individual year markedly increases from the perennial to the ephemeral class among the 49 gauging stations studied over the period 1955 1985 20 gauging stations are shared between the normal 1955 1969 and drought 1970 1985 periods among these 20 stations only six have a different intermittency class over the two periods with a shift of only one class towards the ephemeral side in response to the drought in particular three perennial gauges stations on medium rivers located in the south west of the country become weakly intermittent fig 4b c overall the intermittency patterns depicted by the three sets of stations over the full normal and dry periods fig 4 are very similar and we preferred to work on the full set 1955 1985 to better sample the spatial variability of the potential intermittency drivers the analysis of the percentage of dry months fig 6 a the average of monthly discharge fig 6b and the average of monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration regime fig 6c d of the country shows a marked distinction of values between classes a difference can be noted in the dry month percentage per flow class timing duration and magnitude the ephemeral class is characterized by a lower percentage of dry months and a peak discharge in august fig 6a b when the maximum monthly average precipitation is observed for all classes fig 6c this synchronicity of peak flow and peak precipitation is suggestive of a strong dependence of the ephemeral rivers on the annual precipitation regime in contrast for the three other classes peak flow occurs in september i e one month later than the maximum monthly precipitation the highly intermittent weakly intermittent and perennial classes are also characterized throughout the year by a lower percentage of dry months than the ephemeral class the lag time can be defined as the time between the center of mass of the precipitation excess and the peak discharge askew 1970 fang et al 2005 this higher time lag between peak precipitation and peak flow than in the ephemeral class is probably explained by contrasting hydrological processes in the catchments of the different classes especially given the large similarity of precipitation timing and intensity in all four classes the lag time depends on the catchment properties such as catchment surface area land use land cover geology soil type and slope dingman 2015 generally calculated with a finer time step than monthly a lag time can be determined in each catchment by analyzing the cross correlation between the monthly average precipitation and the monthly average discharge dettinger and diaz 2000 in this framework the lag time is the time lag here in months maximizing the correlation coefficient between the lagged monthly precipitation and monthly discharge fig 7 shows a decrease in the mean value of the lag time from the perennial class to the ephemeral class and confirms that the most intermittent classes highly intermittent and ephemeral have shorter lag times than the other classes weakly intermittent and perennial this shorter lag time for the ephemeral and highly intermittent class can be related to several catchment characteristics such as catchment area and permeability indeed the thickness of the plotted lines in fig 6 is proportional to the average catchment area per class revealing its decrease from the perennial class to the ephemeral class most ephemeral and highly intermittent rivers are located in catchments of low permeability sm fig 4 which may result in lower storage of water and a high runoff coefficient in these catchments pfister et al 2017 fig 6b also shows that highly intermittent and ephemeral classes produce discharge from early may to late november up to december for a highly intermittent class however the perennial and weakly intermittent classes display a significant flow discharge throughout the year probably due to groundwater contributions to streamflow sm fig 4 sm fig 6 this is consistent with buttle et al 2012 who observe that the short duration response of ephemeral streamflow to precipitation inputs can be expected to produce relatively steep falling limbs of the hydrograph compared to perennial basins where groundwater inputs support flow differences in storage properties permeability contributing area strahler order between catchment drained by perennial versus ephemeral streams may also manifest in catchment response the maximum periods of potential evapotranspiration fig 6 d coincide with low precipitation periods fig 6 c especially from december to may the highest values of the percentage of dry months and the lowest discharge values are also observed from december to may this period is favorable for the intermittency of rivers 3 2 principal component analysis pca the pca carried out with the most significant environmental variables p k area and strahler order showed that only the first two components have an eigenvalue greater than 1 sm table 3 these first two components account for 82 of the total variance fig 8 the first component pc1 accounts for 52 of the total variance and is related to catchment topography and climate variables pc1 axis is mainly explained by strahler order 37 followed by precipitation 28 and catchment surface area 27 sm fig 10 the second component pc2 accounts for 30 of the total variance and is dominated by catchment permeability and catchment surface area which contribute to the variance of the pc2 axis at 55 and 27 respectively sm fig 10 the flow index n d r y added to pca as a supplementary variable shows a high and negative correlation with permeability r 0 75 fig 8 sm fig 8 pc2 r 0 85 and pc1 r 0 08 fig 8 sm table 4 the pc2 axis is more related to flow intermittency classes than the pc1 axis suggesting that permeability and catchment area are the most critical environmental variables in discriminating flow intermittency classes in burkina faso fig 8 also shows the positioning of the 49 catchments with their intermittency classes in the plane formed by the first two components pc1 pc2 catchments with higher values of strahler order surface area permeability or annual precipitation values are more likely to be classified into the perennial or weakly intermittent classes fig 8 sm figure 11 on the other hand highly intermittent and ephemeral classes correlate with lower values of strahler order surface area permeability or annual precipitation one interesting result is an apparent clustering of catchments located on the first two quadrants above the first axis compared to those located on the third and fourth quadrants fig 8 thus the catchments with positive pc2 values thus high permeability are more likely to be perennial or weakly intermittent two exceptions the douna and niofila catchments display high permeability and very high rainfall values resp 1163 and 1166 mm yr but belong to the highly intermittent and ephemeral classes some studies have shown that streams located upstream of the river network are likely to have flow intermittently due to their size beaufort et al 2018 wohl 2017 conversely catchments with negative pc2 values low permeability are more likely to be highly intermittent or ephemeral 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with previous studies in the present study there is a consistent geographical variation in the intermittency classes with stations that tend to be perennial mostly located in the south western part of the country a previous study of perez saez et al 2017 focuses on modeling the dynamics of waterborne diseases in burkina faso based on hydrological classification and stream ephemerality prediction an unsupervised clustering approach based on the number of zero flow months per year and for each gauge was used to determine the number of intermittency classes comparing the results obtained with those of perez saez et al 2017 on flow intermittency classes in burkina faso reveals a strong consistency although the number of classes defined and classification methods remain different fig 9 in general no more than one intermittency class difference is observed between the two maps fig 9 the significant differences lie in the number of gauged stations taken into account perez saez et al 2017 only consider gauges stations 58 with at least three years of data whereas in the present study the selected stations 49 have at least four years of data the period investigated is also different 1955 1985 in this study 1960 1990 in perez saez et al 2017 these numerous elements listed above are probably at the origin of the discrepancies between fig 9a and b in perez saez et al 2017 study the variables selected as input for ephemerality controls in the statistical model gradient boosting tree were limited to aridity index annual discharge and remote sensing based vegetation characteristics however no hydrogeological variable was considered which constrained the conclusion that the most important driving variable of ephemerality was mean annual discharge outside of burkina faso hammond et al 2021 showed that climate particularly the aridity index is the dominant controlling factor of stream intermittency at the continental scale of the usa for both human impacted and non impacted gauges stations the effect of physiographic variables such as permeability and catchment area emerges more at a smaller scale similar conclusions can be drawn from the large scale study of sauquet et al 2021 encompassing australia europe and the usa the aridity index emerges as the climatic variable that best discriminates the different flow intermittency classes although the control of physiographic variables on flow intermittency classes was not investigated in the present study we did not keep the aridity index as an explanatory factor as it is strongly correlated to precipitation sm fig 8 so we only kept the latter to reduce the number of autocorrelated variables see section 2 4 4 2 link between intermittency and catchment hydrology one of the main results of the present study is that the geographical variation of intermittency classes in burkina faso shows a significant spatial coherence the perennial and weakly intermittent classes are mostly located in the comoe and mouhoun catchments in contrast the highly intermittent and ephemeral classes are mainly located in the nakanbe and niger catchments fig 4a fig 5a the upper mouhoun catchment is entirely based on a sedimentary zone and 86 water sources are identified 77 sources are perennial dakoure 2003 indicating a strong groundwater contribution to baseflows among these sources there is a famous source called nasso guinguette which is the most important water source in west africa huneau et al 2011 the comoe catchment is partly sedimentary about 20 of its surface area and more than 100 perennial sources were identified dakoure 2003 many other studies showed the importance of spring flow rates in the sedimentary zone as contributing to the mouhoun and comoe rivers baseflow and their tributaries kouanda et al 2018 koussoube 2010 ouédraogo 1994 sauret 2013 tirogo et al 2016 kouanda et al 2018 estimated at 45 the contribution of the average groundwater discharges to the total flow of samendeni river a tributary of mouhoun river during the rainy season in 2017 during the dry season the mouhoun and comoe rivers are essentially fed by substantial inflows of baseflow pavelic et al 2012 explaining their high probability of being perennial or weakly intermittent nakanbe and niger catchments in burkina faso are mainly located on metamorphic rocks therefore some studies mahe 2009 yameogo 1988 have shown that the aquifer in the nakanbe catchment is a fractured aquifer and very deep to be connected to the river these distinct hydrogeological conditions between the mouhoun and comoe catchments compared to the nakanbe and niger catchments could explain this observed geographical variation in flow intermittency classes the distribution of intermittent and perennial streams among the gauged rivers is not strongly dependent on the average annual precipitation because as shown by the large proportion of perennial streams found in arid and semi arid climates sahelian and sudano sahelian zones fig 10 there the precipitation effect is overruled by the mean catchment permeability the catchment area and strahler order this result is consistent with those obtained by carlier et al 2018 in the swiss plateau and prealpes who suggested that catchments with relatively permeable geological units have a high buffering potential on precipitation and therefore a significant water storage dynamic our results also suggest that the catchments belonging to the ephemeral class have a shorter lag time than other classes which may be due to their size relatively small catchment area and low permeability compared to other classes among the non anthropogenic variables identified in this study as intermittency controls only precipitation is likely to change in the future the other variables being relatively static the comparison between the normal and drought sub periods shows little sensitivity of intermittency classes to substantial variations of mean annual precipitation fig 3 fig 10 also shows that mean annual precipitation is not the primary factor explaining the distribution of perennial streams in the country which means that rivers display a certain resilience against persistent droughts as also evidenced by the similar spatial distribution of intermittency between the normal and dry sub periods figs 3 4 the intermittency classes for 8 gauges stations common to the period 1955 1985 and the period 1986 2017 with at least 4 years of data for each period also shows little variation with 2 gauges stations that shift one from weakly intermittent to perennial and the other from highly intermittent to weakly intermittent sm section 8 which can be explained by the recovery from the drought period lebel and ali 2009 this low sensitivity of rivers to annual rainfall amounts may be related to the very high seasonality of rainfall in the country by default river flow is seasonal too whichever annual mean precipitation unless particular catchment processes here groundwater flow make it perennial this implies that the evolutions of the rainy season length and groundwater recharge processes may be more important for the evolution of intermittency in burkina faso than the ones of annual mean precipitation future climate projections in west africa suggest an increase of precipitation in the central and eastern parts and a decrease in the western parts with no clear indication about a possible shift in the length of the rainy season biasutti 2019 gaetani et al 2020 although uncertainties increase when we zoom in the above studies may imply a significant increase of precipitation in the eastern part of burkina faso in this area of low permeability this may not affect a lot the evolution of intermittency which does not depend strongly on total precipitation over the 1955 1985 period and also does not show significant changes at current gauges analyzed but some changes may not be detectable at the monthly time step nevertheless this contrasts with the results of döll and schmied 2012 who predicted a shift of river flow regimes from intermittent to perennial in this eastern part of west africa due to increasing precipitation under climate change however the increase of precipitation may lead to increased floods as already observed in the sahelian part of the niger basin casse et al 2016 4 3 limitation of the study and potential applications in this present study it is crucial to be aware that many shortcomings remain firstly land use land cover lulc were not considered as potential explanatory variables due to lulc data s unavailability over the study period other studies also neglected their potential influence beaufort et al 2019 snelder et al 2013 while kaplan et al 2020 found they were not dominant explanatory variables of no flow metrics in a small catchment of luxembourg dams which are a form of lulc alteration were also overlooked in our study as we have shown that their influence on flow intermittency classes seems to be weak during the 1955 1985 study period sm section 3 but their effects may not necessarily be reflected at the monthly time scale in burkina faso the primary function of dams is to store water to make up for shortages during the dry season their effect might be felt at the beginning of the rainy season when downstream flow is reduced but once they are full water flows through the spillway until the end of the rainy season only stations located downstream of huge dams could be influenced beyond the beginning of the rainy season and become either more intermittent due to storage or less intermittent if the dams are used for hydropower additionally the reclassification of geological information from the bumigeb database to the glim s nomenclature has undoubtedly led to some loss of information because certain types of lithologies have been grouped into one nevertheless the use in burkina faso of the bumigeb lithological map at the scale of 1 1 000 000 to the complement of the glim map at the scale of 1 3750000 is a better alternative to the single use of glim map hartmann and moosdorf 2012 which has a very coarse scale and lacks precision compared to the local bumigeb map the permeability map is derived from this final lithology map using permeability values within a range depending on rock type and observed drainage density these assumptions potentially introduce uncertainty to the estimation of permeability although the estimated permeability map shows some similarities with the british geological survey s bgs aquifer type productivity map sm section 2 where areas mapped as having high aquifer productivity also generally exhibit high permeability the estimated permeability remains uncertain because it is derived from coarse geologic maps in arid and semi arid regions where intermittent streams are assumed to be predominant gallo et al 2020 stations tend to be located on large streams zimmer et al 2020 so our study is not representative of the majority of rivers in the country smaller and assumed to be intermittent by the local authorities fovet et al 2021 the lack of hydrological data makes it impossible to estimate intermittency indices in ungauged catchments data loggers with sensors are technologies to measure the absence or presence of water continuously and are less expensive than traditional gauging stations to survey flow intermittency bhamjee et al 2016 kaplan et al 2019 peirce and lindsay 2015 they can help to better monitor headwater streams in numerous ungauged areas of west africa these new data can make it possible to study river flow intermittency at much smaller scales as a perspective the identified flow intermittency controls in this study can notably be used in flow regionalization processes or as predictive variables to produce intermittency maps as performed by snelder et al 2013 however particular care should be taken when extrapolating these control factors outside the study area where other factors may be dominant 5 conclusion this study highlighted the control of several environmental variables on flow intermittency in burkina faso selected among the components that are climate lithology and topography significant differences are observed in the geographic variation of flow intermittency classes with perennial and weakly intermittent gauges stations mostly located on comoe and mouhoun catchments meanwhile highly intermittent and ephemeral stations are mostly located on nakanbe and niger catchment the main feature discriminating these river catchments comes from their lithology and permeability this is consistent with the finding that rivers classified as ephemeral in burkina faso have shorter lag times than other flow intermittency classes despite the importance of annual precipitation and strahler order in discriminating intermittent rivers this study suggests that catchment permeability and surface area explain the geographical variation of flow intermittency class in burkina faso we also showed that if the spatial variations of precipitation contribute to the patterns of flow intermittency the long term contrasts of precipitation between the normal and dry sub periods may have a weak influence on intermittency classes which could indicate a substantial resilience of rivers in the country further studies are needed to understand better the other factors and hydrological processes controlling intermittency in arid and semi arid environments in sahel since the 1990s there is some evidence of recovery from the drought lebel and ali 2009 large dams have been built and land conversion for agriculture has increased yonaba et al 2021 with the increasing availability of data notably from remote sensing the influence of these anthropogenic factors could now be considered although the number of river gauging stations has decreased other environmental variables could be also investigated such as the dry season length or the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index vicente serrano et al 2010 which was strongly related to the annual and seasonal zero flow day occurrence in many stations of europe and mediterranean countries outside europe tramblay et al 2020 eventually the identified control variables could be used to develop predictive models to provide a comprehensive spatial distribution of river intermittency throughout the country retrospectively and in the future author statement axel patindé belemtougri conceptualization methodology formal

8152,study region this study focused mainly on burkina faso in west africa study focus this study aims to identify environmental variables that best explain the geographic variations of the flow intermittency regime focusing on intermittency duration discharge data from 49 gauging stations were considered mostly over large rivers the mean number of dry months n d r y was used as a predictor to define four classes of flow intermittency for which the potential explanatory environmental variables were assessed based on correlation analysis and principal component analysis pca new hydrological insights for the region the first two components pcs account for 82 of the total variance with pc1 52 and most of the catchments with similar flow intermittency are ordered according to pc2 30 predominantly related to catchment permeability moreover permeability was highly correlated with n d r y r 0 75 results suggest that catchment permeability and catchment areas are the most critical variables in determining flow intermittency classes in burkina faso as the effect of precipitation can be overruled by the ones of permeability catchment area and strahler order this study is a first step in understanding the controls of river intermittency in data scarce and poorly gauged regions of west africa the identified variables could be used as input in statistical models to predict and map river intermittency and provide valuable information for stream conservation keywords intermittent streams ephemeral streams aquifer permeability catchment area flow regime principal component analysis 1 introduction intermittent rivers are rivers that stop flowing or go dry at some points in space and time while perennial rivers under normal conditions sustain a continuous flow throughout the year acuna et al 2014 gonzález ferreras and barquín 2017 most hydrological studies have long focused on perennial rivers rather than intermittent rivers meerveld et al 2020 still the latter also play an important role and deserve the same attention leigh et al 2016 intermittent rivers may account for more than 50 of all the world s rivers skoulikidis et al 2017 and make up a large proportion of headwater rivers ward et al 2020 in recent years they have been the subject of growing interest especially in their ecological functioning datry et al 2011 wilding et al 2018 they are

number of intermittent rivers in many parts of the world for the coming years de wit and stankiewicz 2006 jaeger et al 2014 in west africa senegal and mauritania may experience an increase in intermittency while intermittency may be relieved further east döll and schmied 2012 as a result of contrasting precipitation changes between the western and eastern parts of sahel over the 21st century gaetani et al 2020 these climatic trends could be modified by intense anthropogenic pressure on water resources especially in arid and semi arid environments of west africa leading to an increased threat to biodiversity and water supply in arid and semi arid regions most rivers are intermittent and are often the only significant water source for consumptive use jacobson and jacobson 2013 wekesa et al 2020 in these regions they are considered the primary groundwater recharge sources koïta et al 2017 shanafield and cook 2014 people heavily depend on them for instance for local irrigation acuna et al 2014 haile ghebremariam and van steenbergen 2006 the hydrological classification of rivers or catchments according to the characteristics of their flow regime is therefore critical especially in these regions where the well being of populations depends on the ability to manage water scarcity for food production castelli et al 2018 gebrehiwot et al 2011 zouré et al 2019 in africa and west africa in particular hydrological studies are hampered by data scarcity and poor gauging especially about streamflow discharge rabba et al 2018 this is a serious methodological

classification of the hydrological regime of catchments in africa a range of hydrological indices has been used to classify catchments according to their flow regimes the main components described by these indices are the magnitude timing duration rate of change and frequency of flow events poff and ward 1989 richter et al 1996 as smakhtin 2001 described intermittent and ephemeral streams are characterized by naturally extended periods of zero flow which may generally be perceived as the lower bound of low flow in hydrology the indices related to the duration and frequency of flow e g mean median percent and frequency of the number of days months with flow or zero flow per year season are the most important to assess flow intermittency and are commonly used in the literature costigan et al 2017 larned et al 2010 among these indices the duration of zero flow is of particular relevance as an indicator of water availability it is also an essential characteristic for river ecosystems and is considered a significant indicator of the potential aquatic species distribution and persistence that may inhabit a given environment datry et al 2012 leigh and datry 2017 vardakas et al 2017 for example snelder et al 2013 used hydrological indices to assess flow intermittency in france based solely on the mean annual frequency of zero flow periods and the mean duration of zero flow periods in the literature intermittent streams are referred to by various names such as temporary ephemeral irregular non permanent non perennial episodic seasonal interrupted such profusion of terms can be confusing as noted by uys and o keeffe 1997 in this way busch et al 2020 suggest using only the terms non perennial intermittent and ephemeral to characterize these streams the classification of streamflow intermittency in databases such as the nhd national hydrography dataset in the usa mainly focuses on field surveys and interviews with residents but in situ flow observations often disagree with this classification hafen et al 2020 the quantitative criteria used to classify the streams vary among authors hedman and osterkamp 1982 for example classified streams as perennial intermittent and ephemeral when flowing water is present annually more than 80 10 80 and less than 10 respectively reynolds et al 2015 categorized rivers as strongly intermittent when the mean number of zero flow days year 20 weakly intermittent when the mean number of zero flow days year 20 and perennial when the mean number of zero flow days year equals zero yu et al 2018 defined perennial streams as those that ceased flowing 10 of the year 0 1 month weakly intermittent as those that ceased flowing 10 70 of the year 2 8 months and strongly intermittent as those that ceased flowing 70 of the year 8 months despite a handful of studies conducted in several regions regarding the identification and classification of intermittent rivers an adequate understanding of the drivers controlling intermittency is still lacking costigan et al 2015 tooth 2000 we can cite several studies throughout the world that focused on identifying flow indices and potential environmental variables that best explain the different aspects of the flow regime alcázar and palau 2010 assani et al 2006 bejarano et al 2010 d ambrosio et al 2017 gallart gallego et al 2012 gebrehiwot et al 2011 kennard et al 2010 lane et al 2017 moliere et al 2009 oueslati et al 2015 however few studies have focused on assessing the main drivers of flow intermittency godsey and kirchner 2014 in their study assani et al 2006 assessed the factors influencing the spatial variability of annual minimum flow characteristics in the southern part of the st lawrence river watershed in quebec they showed that the spatial difference of annual minimum flow characteristics between the north and south shore is mainly due to climatic factors particularly annual precipitation reynolds et al 2015 found that the most influential landscape drivers of flow intermittency and low flows are precipitation snowfall potential evapotranspiration soil type and drainage area according to trancoso et al 2017 the controlling factors of zero flow ratio proportion of zero flows in the full flow record across different regions were aridity index and precipitation however they also pointed out that precipitation does not seem to impact the zero flow ratio in some tropical areas which are more sensitive to groundwater recharge and baseflow processes overall it appears that the spatial and temporal variation of streamflow intermittency results from the interaction between several environmental variables at the global and regional scale climatic variables especially the aridity index are likely to be the first order control of river flow intermittency costigan et al 2017 trancoso et al 2017 however river flow intermittency is also controlled by processes acting at smaller scales than climate drivers snelder et al 2013 local factors such as geology topography and land use land cover are important variables that also control the river intermittency and operate at different spatial and temporal scales buttle et al 2012 costigan et al 2016 kennard et al 2010 williams 2006 in west africa there have been very few studies specifically dedicated to assessing the controlling factors of flow intermittency understanding the potential drivers of river intermittency should lead to better water resources management through effective water allocations following climate induced pressures on the intermittent flow regime this study aimed to investigate the role of climate lithology and topographic controls on geographical variations in the hydrological regime of rivers in burkina faso with a particular focus on the duration of intermittency periods with zero flow to achieve this objective the following research goals were carried out i define a classification framework applied to river gauging observations in order to identify patterns in flow intermittency classes ii evaluate the role of lithology topography and climate on flow intermittency classes through multivariate analysis iii discuss their interactions and understand the spatial variability of flow intermittency 2 data and methods 2 1 study area located in central west africa burkina faso is a landlocked country covering an area of 274 200 km2 the altitude over half of the country ranges between 250 and 350 m above the sea level whereas the highest values do not exceed 750 m making the topography relatively flat the country area is divided into three principal watersheds comoe 17 590 km2 niger 83 642 km2 and volta 172 968 km2 fig 1 a the volta in burkina faso is subdivided into two sub watersheds mouhoun and nakanbe fig 1 b the study area is characterized by two alternating and contrasting seasons influenced by the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz where the humid wind coming from the atlantic ocean in the south monsoon meets the warm dry wind coming from the sahara in the north harmattan ibrahim 2012 of the two seasons there is a long dry season with almost no rainfall from october to may and a short rainy season from june to september rainfall is consequently highly seasonal with a peak generally occurring in august pana 2007 there is a climatic south north gradient of decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature and aridity across the country three climatic zones are commonly identified in the country based on the average annual precipitation jalloh et al 2013 pana 2007 the sahelian zone in the north average annual rainfall less than 600 mm the sudano sahelian zone in the central region average annual rainfall between 600 and 900 mm and the sudanian zone in the south average annual rainfall between 900 and 1200 mm fig 1a these various climatic settings make the country a representative regional case study to investigate and understand the factors that control flow intermittency 2 2 hydrological and environmental data discharge data from 36 gauged stations 16 stations with daily data and 19 stations with monthly data were provided by the dgre direction générale des ressources en eau in burkina faso over the period 1955 2017 in order to have more gauges some global and regional hydrological databases were used to supplement the gauging stations obtained from dgre and then provide additional information on gauging stations located in neighboring countries niger ghana and ivory coast to this end we used monthly data from the global runoff data center grdc 2019 for 45 gauged stations over the period 1951 1991 as well as daily data from the sierem système d informations environnementales sur les ressources en eau et leur modélisation database boyer et al 2006 for 80 gauging stations over the period 1952 2006 the complete dataset was checked and processed according to the following four criteria i gauged stations with less than 5 daily missing discharge records values per month were considered and averaged to monthly values ii for each gauge station only the years with complete data 12 months were considered iii for duplicate gauged stations featured in different databases only the one with the most extended record period was retained iv finally gauged stations with at least four years of complete monthly data were considered monthly time steps are often used to characterize river flow regimes gallart gallego et al 2012 yu et al 2018 particularly in data scarce areas perez saez et al 2017 a set of 58 gauged stations over the period 1952 2017 was finally constituted for further analysis a period of drought and desertification strongly affected west africa in the 1970s and 1980s fig 2a thus many studies pointed out a change in rainfall patterns from the year 1970 with a recovery around the 1990s barbé and lebel 1997 ouedraogo et al 2002 over the 58 gauges stations the maximum number of available gauging stations per year is observed between 1955 and 1990 fig 2 b from 1985 the number of available gauging stations had sharply decreased mostly restricted to large rivers to avoid the anthropic influence of numerous dams constructed since the 1980s cecchi et al 2007 a pre development period 1955 1985 was considered so that the river regimes are considered weakly altered the period 1955 1985 can be subdivided into two sub periods a normal period 1955 1969 followed by a drought period 1970 1985 over the period 1955 1985 49 gauging stations with at least four years of complete monthly data were considered for this study discharge data have an average availability of 14 years and the majority of gauges 61 22 have at least ten years of data fig 1a of supplemental material sm the river network used in this study was derived from the bndt database in burkina faso igb 2012 at a scale of 1 200 000 the strahler s order of the river network strahler 1957 was determined using the rivex tool hornby 2020 under esri arcgis software version 10 6 1 catchments delineated from each gauging station were derived from hydrosheds lehner et al 2008 digital elevation model dem with 3 approximately 90 m resolution the process was implemented in the r language r core team 2019 with an interface to grass gis the delineated catchment areas were compared with the information of catchment areas provided in the grdc and dgre databases thus 43 catchments are compared and showed similar areas r2 0 99 p value 0 001 sm fig 1b the catchments studied cover 87 of the country s surface area of which more than 50 have a surface area between 1000 10000 km2 sm fig 2 the permeability estimate in the study area was derived from lithological information rock type in burkina faso the information on the main lithological formations an updated version 2018 of castaing et al 2003 map was acquired from the bumigeb service bureau des mines et de la géologie du burkina faso at a scale of 1 1000000 to take into account the lithological information of some catchments that have a part of their area outside burkina faso we used the glim lithological layer hartmann and moosdorf 2012 which is the most recent global layer available at the scale of 1 3750000 however to ensure the nomenclature compatibility between the two databases for each lithology type defined at the country scale in the bumigeb database correspondence and reclassification criteria with the glim database were defined this allowed taking advantage of the lithological precision of the geological map of bumigeb scale 1 1 000 000 compared to those of the global glim database scale 1 3750000 sm fig 3 then a permeability map was derived from the lithological map by assigning a single permeability value for each lithology type as detailed in the supplementary material sm section 2 the value of each lithology type is based from the permeability range by sediment or rock type chapter 6 of maidment 1993 and on the fact that for a given climate and slope prior research has found higher drainage densities in areas with lower permeability schneider et al 2017 for each catchment the average permeability is obtained by weighting the permeabilities obtained for each lithology type by the area occupied by each lithology type in the catchment to investigate the impact of dams on river intermittency we used information on available dams from 1947 to 1985 sm section 3 as extracted from the grand database lehner et al 2011 over the period 1947 1985 the two most important dams are the lery dam 250 mm3 built in 1976 for agricultural purposes in the mouhoun watershed with 4 studied gauges downstream of the dam and the kompienga dam 2000 mm3 in the nakanbe watershed built in 1984 for hydroelectric purposes with only one studied station on the river far upstream of the dam sm fig 7 a significant proportion of small dams 1 mm3 are not listed in the grand database however all small dams together account for less than 4 of national storage capacity cecchi et al 2009 and represent about 60 7 of all dams in 1986 piquemal 1991 2 3 flow index and intermittency classification generally the flow duration is the primary descriptor of different stream classification fritz et al 2020 kaplan et al 2019 given the monthly time step chosen and for the sake of parsimony the mean number of dry months per year n d r y which represents the duration of intermittency is the flow index selected in this study to assess intermittency and is widely used in the literature a dry month is defined as a month for which all flows are equal to zero n d r y is a key metric relevant to river ecology vadher et al 2018 and is calculated according to eq 1 1 n d r y i n n d r y i n where ndry i is the number of dry months in a given year i and n is the number of considered years in this study based on terminologies established by uys and o keeffe 1997 rivers were categorized into four classes according to their mean number of dry months per year n d r y table 1 to get a long enough data record to characterize the spatial patterns of river flow intermittency in the study area with a consistent number of gauges throughout the period the monthly time step was preferred to the daily time step and the flow intermittency classes obtained when comparing the common gauges 5 with daily and monthly time step data over the study period are similar sm section 4 sm table 2 2 4 assessment of the potential factors of intermittency a range of variables describing environmental attributes table 2 was considered as potential explanatory factors of intermittency these variables were selected from the literature for their possible relevance in assessing the perennial or intermittent behavior of river streams d ambrosio et al 2017 kennard et al 2010 moliere et al 2009 snelder et al 2013 and also based on the availability and temporal resolution of the data these include topography 5 variables climate 5 variables and lithology bedrock permeability 1 variable land use land cover lulc data were not included because no dataset could be found over the studied period 1955 1985 the oldest dataset of the national land use database called bdot base de données d occupation des terres corresponds to the year 1992 and was shown to be of poor quality by cecchi et al 2009 anthropogenic factors might also influence the timing magnitude and duration of river flow hughes 2005 skoulikidis 2009 the evolution of flow intermittency classes for the 20 gauge stations common to the normal 1955 1969 and drought 1970 1985 sub periods shows that only 30 of these gauges exhibit a shift of flow class from the normal to the drought period besides this shift is modest as it consists of only one intermittency class fig 3 sm section 3 this analysis indicates a weak influence of both dams and drought on the evolution of intermittency classes and led us to neglect dams as potential explanatory factors all environmental variables were averaged for the catchments upstream of the gauging stations except for strahler order which is estimated at the gauging station location the set of environmental variables was further reduced to avoid multicollinearity by minimizing statistical redundancy among variables through a pearson correlation matrix at this stage for pairs of variables with a correlation above the threshold r 0 75 considered to indicate a high level of correlation only one was retained sm fig 8 the retained variable is the one that is also correlated with multiple others i e the variable with the highest absolute mean correlation with the other variables and therefore allows a set of highly correlated variables to be reduced it must be noted that evaporation related variables including the aridity index although often considered in similar studies were not kept in this process since they show a strong correlation with precipitation sm section 5 a final reduced set of four significant environmental variables independent variables included in further analyses are presented in table 2 in bold the principal component analysis pca is a multivariate statistical method for reducing large dataset dimensionality increasing interpretability while minimizing information loss jolliffe and cadima 2016 in this study it was used to i explore the relationship between significant environmental variables to show how they correlated to or deviated from each other ii identify patterns in catchments with similar flow intermittency classes iii analyze the relationship between the duration of intermittency n d r y and significant environmental variable pca was performed using xlstat addinsoft 2015 based on the set of 49 catchments and four 4 environmental variables in bold in table 2 before performing the pca the input variables were standardized to z score values so that all variables have the same weight van den berg et al 2006 the number of meaningful principal components pcs was determined using kaiser s criterion kaiser 1960 by selecting all components with eigenvalues greater than 1 assani et al 2006 the contribution of environmental variables to the explanation of a pc was considered significant if their loading value was at least 25 the duration of intermittency n d r y was introduced as a supplementary quantitative variable once the pca has been constructed this supplementary quantitative variable is not included in the calculation of distances between individuals it should facilitate the interpretation of the results and help detect the environmental variables that have the most significant impact on intermittency duration 3 results 3 1 flow intermittency classes all studied stations fall on medium to large rivers with a strahler order between 4 and 8 fig 4 a four flow intermittency classes were considered to categorize rivers in terms of intermittency section 2 3 it appears that 26 5 of gauge stations are perennial 16 are weakly intermittent 26 5 are highly intermittent and 30 are ephemeral table 1 fig 4a the perennial and weakly intermittent gauge stations are mostly located in the south western part of the country mouhoun and comoe basins fig 4a fig 5 a where intermittent gauges are only found in upstream reaches with medium strahler orders 4 5 in contrast the eastern part of the country nakanbe and niger basins shows a huge majority of highly intermittent and ephemeral gauges whichever the stream order fig 4a fig 5a fig 5b shows that the classification based on the mean number of dry months per year remains effective at the annual timescale since the number of dry months per individual year markedly increases from the perennial to the ephemeral class among the 49 gauging stations studied over the period 1955 1985 20 gauging stations are shared between the normal 1955 1969 and drought 1970 1985 periods among these 20 stations only six have a different intermittency class over the two periods with a shift of only one class towards the ephemeral side in response to the drought in particular three perennial gauges stations on medium rivers located in the south west of the country become weakly intermittent fig 4b c overall the intermittency patterns depicted by the three sets of stations over the full normal and dry periods fig 4 are very similar and we preferred to work on the full set 1955 1985 to better sample the spatial variability of the potential intermittency drivers the analysis of the percentage of dry months fig 6 a the average of monthly discharge fig 6b and the average of monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration regime fig 6c d of the country shows a marked distinction of values between classes a difference can be noted in the dry month percentage per flow class timing duration and magnitude the ephemeral class is characterized by a lower percentage of dry months and a peak discharge in august fig 6a b when the maximum monthly average precipitation is observed for all classes fig 6c this synchronicity of peak flow and peak precipitation is suggestive of a strong dependence of the ephemeral rivers on the annual precipitation regime in contrast for the three other classes peak flow occurs in september i e one month later than the maximum monthly precipitation the highly intermittent weakly intermittent and perennial classes are also characterized throughout the year by a lower percentage of dry months than the ephemeral class the lag time can be defined as the time between the center of mass of the precipitation excess and the peak discharge askew 1970 fang et al 2005 this higher time lag between peak precipitation and peak flow than in the ephemeral class is probably explained by contrasting hydrological processes in the catchments of the different classes especially given the large similarity of precipitation timing and intensity in all four classes the lag time depends on the catchment properties such as catchment surface area land use land cover geology soil type and slope dingman 2015 generally calculated with a finer time step than monthly a lag time can be determined in each catchment by analyzing the cross correlation between the monthly average precipitation and the monthly average discharge dettinger and diaz 2000 in this framework the lag time is the time lag here in months maximizing the correlation coefficient between the lagged monthly precipitation and monthly discharge fig 7 shows a decrease in the mean value of the lag time from the perennial class to the ephemeral class and confirms that the most intermittent classes highly intermittent and ephemeral have shorter lag times than the other classes weakly intermittent and perennial this shorter lag time for the ephemeral and highly intermittent class can be related to several catchment characteristics such as catchment area and permeability indeed the thickness of the plotted lines in fig 6 is proportional to the average catchment area per class revealing its decrease from the perennial class to the ephemeral class most ephemeral and highly intermittent rivers are located in catchments of low permeability sm fig 4 which may result in lower storage of water and a high runoff coefficient in these catchments pfister et al 2017 fig 6b also shows that highly intermittent and ephemeral classes produce discharge from early may to late november up to december for a highly intermittent class however the perennial and weakly intermittent classes display a significant flow discharge throughout the year probably due to groundwater contributions to streamflow sm fig 4 sm fig 6 this is consistent with buttle et al 2012 who observe that the short duration response of ephemeral streamflow to precipitation inputs can be expected to produce relatively steep falling limbs of the hydrograph compared to perennial basins where groundwater inputs support flow differences in storage properties permeability contributing area strahler order between catchment drained by perennial versus ephemeral streams may also manifest in catchment response the maximum periods of potential evapotranspiration fig 6 d coincide with low precipitation periods fig 6 c especially from december to may the highest values of the percentage of dry months and the lowest discharge values are also observed from december to may this period is favorable for the intermittency of rivers 3 2 principal component analysis pca the pca carried out with the most significant environmental variables p k area and strahler order showed that only the first two components have an eigenvalue greater than 1 sm table 3 these first two components account for 82 of the total variance fig 8 the first component pc1 accounts for 52 of the total variance and is related to catchment topography and climate variables pc1 axis is mainly explained by strahler order 37 followed by precipitation 28 and catchment surface area 27 sm fig 10 the second component pc2 accounts for 30 of the total variance and is dominated by catchment permeability and catchment surface area which contribute to the variance of the pc2 axis at 55 and 27 respectively sm fig 10 the flow index n d r y added to pca as a supplementary variable shows a high and negative correlation with permeability r 0 75 fig 8 sm fig 8 pc2 r 0 85 and pc1 r 0 08 fig 8 sm table 4 the pc2 axis is more related to flow intermittency classes than the pc1 axis suggesting that permeability and catchment area are the most critical environmental variables in discriminating flow intermittency classes in burkina faso fig 8 also shows the positioning of the 49 catchments with their intermittency classes in the plane formed by the first two components pc1 pc2 catchments with higher values of strahler order surface area permeability or annual precipitation values are more likely to be classified into the perennial or weakly intermittent classes fig 8 sm figure 11 on the other hand highly intermittent and ephemeral classes correlate with lower values of strahler order surface area permeability or annual precipitation one interesting result is an apparent clustering of catchments located on the first two quadrants above the first axis compared to those located on the third and fourth quadrants fig 8 thus the catchments with positive pc2 values thus high permeability are more likely to be perennial or weakly intermittent two exceptions the douna and niofila catchments display high permeability and very high rainfall values resp 1163 and 1166 mm yr but belong to the highly intermittent and ephemeral classes some studies have shown that streams located upstream of the river network are likely to have flow intermittently due to their size beaufort et al 2018 wohl 2017 conversely catchments with negative pc2 values low permeability are more likely to be highly intermittent or ephemeral 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with previous studies in the present study there is a consistent geographical variation in the intermittency classes with stations that tend to be perennial mostly located in the south western part of the country a previous study of perez saez et al 2017 focuses on modeling the dynamics of waterborne diseases in burkina faso based on hydrological classification and stream ephemerality prediction an unsupervised clustering approach based on the number of zero flow months per year and for each gauge was used to determine the number of intermittency classes comparing the results obtained with those of perez saez et al 2017 on flow intermittency classes in burkina faso reveals a strong consistency although the number of classes defined and classification methods remain different fig 9 in general no more than one intermittency class difference is observed between the two maps fig 9 the significant differences lie in the number of gauged stations taken into account perez saez et al 2017 only consider gauges stations 58 with at least three years of data whereas in the present study the selected stations 49 have at least four years of data the period investigated is also different 1955 1985 in this study 1960 1990 in perez saez et al 2017 these numerous elements listed above are probably at the origin of the discrepancies between fig 9a and b in perez saez et al 2017 study the variables selected as input for ephemerality controls in the statistical model gradient boosting tree were limited to aridity index annual discharge and remote sensing based vegetation characteristics however no hydrogeological variable was considered which constrained the conclusion that the most important driving variable of ephemerality was mean annual discharge outside of burkina faso hammond et al 2021 showed that climate particularly the aridity index is the dominant controlling factor of stream intermittency at the continental scale of the usa for both human impacted and non impacted gauges stations the effect of physiographic variables such as permeability and catchment area emerges more at a smaller scale similar conclusions can be drawn from the large scale study of sauquet et al 2021 encompassing australia europe and the usa the aridity index emerges as the climatic variable that best discriminates the different flow intermittency classes although the control of physiographic variables on flow intermittency classes was not investigated in the present study we did not keep the aridity index as an explanatory factor as it is strongly correlated to precipitation sm fig 8 so we only kept the latter to reduce the number of autocorrelated variables see section 2 4 4 2 link between intermittency and catchment hydrology one of the main results of the present study is that the geographical variation of intermittency classes in burkina faso shows a significant spatial coherence the perennial and weakly intermittent classes are mostly located in the comoe and mouhoun catchments in contrast the highly intermittent and ephemeral classes are mainly located in the nakanbe and niger catchments fig 4a fig 5a the upper mouhoun catchment is entirely based on a sedimentary zone and 86 water sources are identified 77 sources are perennial dakoure 2003 indicating a strong groundwater contribution to baseflows among these sources there is a famous source called nasso guinguette which is the most important water source in west africa huneau et al 2011 the comoe catchment is partly sedimentary about 20 of its surface area and more than 100 perennial sources were identified dakoure 2003 many other studies showed the importance of spring flow rates in the sedimentary zone as contributing to the mouhoun and comoe rivers baseflow and their tributaries kouanda et al 2018 koussoube 2010 ouédraogo 1994 sauret 2013 tirogo et al 2016 kouanda et al 2018 estimated at 45 the contribution of the average groundwater discharges to the total flow of samendeni river a tributary of mouhoun river during the rainy season in 2017 during the dry season the mouhoun and comoe rivers are essentially fed by substantial inflows of baseflow pavelic et al 2012 explaining their high probability of being perennial or weakly intermittent nakanbe and niger catchments in burkina faso are mainly located on metamorphic rocks therefore some studies mahe 2009 yameogo 1988 have shown that the aquifer in the nakanbe catchment is a fractured aquifer and very deep to be connected to the river these distinct hydrogeological conditions between the mouhoun and comoe catchments compared to the nakanbe and niger catchments could explain this observed geographical variation in flow intermittency classes the distribution of intermittent and perennial streams among the gauged rivers is not strongly dependent on the average annual precipitation because as shown by the large proportion of perennial streams found in arid and semi arid climates sahelian and sudano sahelian zones fig 10 there the precipitation effect is overruled by the mean catchment permeability the catchment area and strahler order this result is consistent with those obtained by carlier et al 2018 in the swiss plateau and prealpes who suggested that catchments with relatively permeable geological units have a high buffering potential on precipitation and therefore a significant water storage dynamic our results also suggest that the catchments belonging to the ephemeral class have a shorter lag time than other classes which may be due to their size relatively small catchment area and low permeability compared to other classes among the non anthropogenic variables identified in this study as intermittency controls only precipitation is likely to change in the future the other variables being relatively static the comparison between the normal and drought sub periods shows little sensitivity of intermittency classes to substantial variations of mean annual precipitation fig 3 fig 10 also shows that mean annual precipitation is not the primary factor explaining the distribution of perennial streams in the country which means that rivers display a certain resilience against persistent droughts as also evidenced by the similar spatial distribution of intermittency between the normal and dry sub periods figs 3 4 the intermittency classes for 8 gauges stations common to the period 1955 1985 and the period 1986 2017 with at least 4 years of data for each period also shows little variation with 2 gauges stations that shift one from weakly intermittent to perennial and the other from highly intermittent to weakly intermittent sm section 8 which can be explained by the recovery from the drought period lebel and ali 2009 this low sensitivity of rivers to annual rainfall amounts may be related to the very high seasonality of rainfall in the country by default river flow is seasonal too whichever annual mean precipitation unless particular catchment processes here groundwater flow make it perennial this implies that the evolutions of the rainy season length and groundwater recharge processes may be more important for the evolution of intermittency in burkina faso than the ones of annual mean precipitation future climate projections in west africa suggest an increase of precipitation in the central and eastern parts and a decrease in the western parts with no clear indication about a possible shift in the length of the rainy season biasutti 2019 gaetani et al 2020 although uncertainties increase when we zoom in the above studies may imply a significant increase of precipitation in the eastern part of burkina faso in this area of low permeability this may not affect a lot the evolution of intermittency which does not depend strongly on total precipitation over the 1955 1985 period and also does not show significant changes at current gauges analyzed but some changes may not be detectable at the monthly time step nevertheless this contrasts with the results of döll and schmied 2012 who predicted a shift of river flow regimes from intermittent to perennial in this eastern part of west africa due to increasing precipitation under climate change however the increase of precipitation may lead to increased floods as already observed in the sahelian part of the niger basin casse et al 2016 4 3 limitation of the study and potential applications in this present study it is crucial to be aware that many shortcomings remain firstly land use land cover lulc were not considered as potential explanatory variables due to lulc data s unavailability over the study period other studies also neglected their potential influence beaufort et al 2019 snelder et al 2013 while kaplan et al 2020 found they were not dominant explanatory variables of no flow metrics in a small catchment of luxembourg dams which are a form of lulc alteration were also overlooked in our study as we have shown that their influence on flow intermittency classes seems to be weak during the 1955 1985 study period sm section 3 but their effects may not necessarily be reflected at the monthly time scale in burkina faso the primary function of dams is to store water to make up for shortages during the dry season their effect might be felt at the beginning of the rainy season when downstream flow is reduced but once they are full water flows through the spillway until the end of the rainy season only stations located downstream of huge dams could be influenced beyond the beginning of the rainy season and become either more intermittent due to storage or less intermittent if the dams are used for hydropower additionally the reclassification of geological information from the bumigeb database to the glim s nomenclature has undoubtedly led to some loss of information because certain types of lithologies have been grouped into one nevertheless the use in burkina faso of the bumigeb lithological map at the scale of 1 1 000 000 to the complement of the glim map at the scale of 1 3750000 is a better alternative to the single use of glim map hartmann and moosdorf 2012 which has a very coarse scale and lacks precision compared to the local bumigeb map the permeability map is derived from this final lithology map using permeability values within a range depending on rock type and observed drainage density these assumptions potentially introduce uncertainty to the estimation of permeability although the estimated permeability map shows some similarities with the british geological survey s bgs aquifer type productivity map sm section 2 where areas mapped as having high aquifer productivity also generally exhibit high permeability the estimated permeability remains uncertain because it is derived from coarse geologic maps in arid and semi arid regions where intermittent streams are assumed to be predominant gallo et al 2020 stations tend to be located on large streams zimmer et al 2020 so our study is not representative of the majority of rivers in the country smaller and assumed to be intermittent by the local authorities fovet et al 2021 the lack of hydrological data makes it impossible to estimate intermittency indices in ungauged catchments data loggers with sensors are technologies to measure the absence or presence of water continuously and are less expensive than traditional gauging stations to survey flow intermittency bhamjee et al 2016 kaplan et al 2019 peirce and lindsay 2015 they can help to better monitor headwater streams in numerous ungauged areas of west africa these new data can make it possible to study river flow intermittency at much smaller scales as a perspective the identified flow intermittency controls in this study can notably be used in flow regionalization processes or as predictive variables to produce intermittency maps as performed by snelder et al 2013 however particular care should be taken when extrapolating these control factors outside the study area where other factors may be dominant 5 conclusion this study highlighted the control of several environmental variables on flow intermittency in burkina faso selected among the components that are climate lithology and topography significant differences are observed in the geographic variation of flow intermittency classes with perennial and weakly intermittent gauges stations mostly located on comoe and mouhoun catchments meanwhile highly intermittent and ephemeral stations are mostly located on nakanbe and niger catchment the main feature discriminating these river catchments comes from their lithology and permeability this is consistent with the finding that rivers classified as ephemeral in burkina faso have shorter lag times than other flow intermittency classes despite the importance of annual precipitation and strahler order in discriminating intermittent rivers this study suggests that catchment permeability and surface area explain the geographical variation of flow intermittency class in burkina faso we also showed that if the spatial variations of precipitation contribute to the patterns of flow intermittency the long term contrasts of precipitation between the normal and dry sub periods may have a weak influence on intermittency classes which could indicate a substantial resilience of rivers in the country further studies are needed to understand better the other factors and hydrological processes controlling intermittency in arid and semi arid environments in sahel since the 1990s there is some evidence of recovery from the drought lebel and ali 2009 large dams have been built and land conversion for agriculture has increased yonaba et al 2021 with the increasing availability of data notably from remote sensing the influence of these anthropogenic factors could now be considered although the number of river gauging stations has decreased other environmental variables could be also investigated such as the dry season length or the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index vicente serrano et al 2010 which was strongly related to the annual and seasonal zero flow day occurrence in many stations of europe and mediterranean countries outside europe tramblay et al 2020 eventually the identified control variables could be used to develop predictive models to provide a comprehensive spatial distribution of river intermittency throughout the country retrospectively and in the future author statement axel patindé belemtougri conceptualization methodology formal

8153,study region eastern nepal the himalayas study focus this research is aimed at delineating groundwater potential zones in a hard rock aquifer himalayan watershed integrating geo spatial and field exploration techniques a customized indicator based weighting method consisting of six indicators was developed and applied in the study watershed spatially distributed maps for the indicators were produced based on information from primary as well as secondary sources the indicators were further aggregated and groundwater potential map was prepared using relative weights derived from analytical hierarchy process with inputs from key hydrogeology experts the map was then validated using observed data of springs as well as results from electrical resistivity tomography ert new hydrological insights the novelty of this study lies in the application of two step validation using springs data from the field and ert of the groundwater potential mapping approach which demonstrates the robustness of the overall methodology for data scarce regions and paves way for its wider applicability in decision support for groundwater exploration activities further this is one of the very few groundwater potential studies in the nepal himalaya hydrogeological setting keywords groundwater potential hard rock aquifer nepal himalaya electrical resistivity tomography ert analytical hierarchy process ahp gis rs 1 introduction global water demand is continuously increasing and projected to rise by 55 by 2050 wwap 2015 groundwater which supports lives and livelihoods of about two billion people worldwide misi et al 2018 continues to play a dominant role in supplying water to meet the growing demands drilling tubewells is the most common intervention to extract this resource unfortunately limited understanding of the complex groundwater system has resulted in lower success rates of drilling for the groundwater production wells particularly in the developing countries serele et al 2020 wrrdc 2017 the understanding of aquifer systems is further complicated in hard rock aquifers such as in the nepal himalaya which is characterized by wide ranging lithological units from unconsolidated alluvial deposits to high grade metamorphic rocks dhital 2015 furthermore development of appropriate groundwater simulation models is limited in the absence of groundwater monitoring data groundwater which is available through springs and seepages in the hills and mountains buffers surface water shortages in many instances sharma et al 2016 however problems of springs drying up in recent times poudel and duex 2017 for various reasons such as improper road construction are expected to worsen in view of demographic conditions and changing climate this will ultimately impact a large part of the population in the hills of nepal who are currently meeting their domestic irrigation and small scale industrial water demand through groundwater although significantly important exploring groundwater and its potential in this geographical region is not getting adequate attention several conventional and relatively costly methods such as geological hydrogeological geophysical and photogeological techniques are available for studying groundwater potential lillesand et al 2015 shahid et al 2000 on the other hand cost effective approaches for groundwater potential assessment used widely across the globe are primarily based on information of geology lithology land use cover lineaments slope geomorphology drainage density soil and rainfall abdalla 2012 chihi et al 2015 hammouri et al 2012 naidu et al 2015 although some of this information can be obtained through visual inspection it is time consuming prone to high manual errors and applicable only to easily accessible areas furthermore studies show that the estimation of groundwater potential requires accurate continuous and spatially distributed data sinha et al 2018 remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis are proven to be efficient techniques for such analyses with significant recent technological advancements ghimire et al 2019 andualem and demeke 2019 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 oikonomidis et al 2015 serele et al 2020 arshad et al 2020 integrated gis with analytical hierarchy process ahp to map recharge potential zones in agricultural and urban areas lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 delineated groundwater recharge potential zones using a gis based weighted overlay method guided by ahp in a semi arid region patra et al 2017 applied a similar gis rs ahp method to identify dominant parameters for groundwater potential in the ganges alluvial plains similarly oikonomidis et al 2015 used an integrated gis rs method based on ahp to assess the groundwater potential areas in the european context gwrdb 2015 pathak and shrestha 2016 wrrdc 2017 and pradhan et al 2020 adopted an indicator based approach by integrating various factors responsible for controlling the groundwater occurrences in hilly and mountainous terrains of nepal the commonality of all these studies is the application of indicator based weighted overlay method using gis rs and recommendation of wider replicability of the method with some customization whereas the differences being in the scale of application hydrogeology of the area choice of weighted parameters and method of validation most groundwater potential assessment studies have utilized borelogs and well data for validation berhanu and hatiye 2020 serele et al 2020 however in rugged terrains and areas difficult to access this information might not be always available or could be misleading therefore considering springs data could result in a better estimation and validation of the method and findings furthermore geophysical tests such as electrical resistivity tomography ert can be an alternative for assessing groundwater potential the overarching objective of this research is to customize and test a methodology for groundwater potential assessment integrating an indicator based gis rs technique with a simplistic validation strategy serele et al 2020 through a combination of ert and field exploration of springs in a hard rock aquifer himalayan watershed located in nepal there is a high degree of complexity in the inaccessible himalayan mountainous region to carry out subsurface studies like drilling and geophysical survey therefore this study attempts to analyze groundwater potential with limited surface data and key indicators and then validate the results using location and primary discharge data of springs as well as ert results thus the novelty of this research lies in the application of two step validation springs data from the field and ert of the overall approach moreover this is one among the very limited studies in the hard rock aquifers in the nepal himalaya results demonstrate the robustness of the overall methodology and paves way for its wider applicability in similar hydrogeological settings the outcome is expected to be useful for water users practitioners planners and policy makers for understanding and evaluating the current status of groundwater resources in the study area and also for identifying potential sites for future groundwater development 2 study area this study has been carried out in the andherikhola watershed drainage area of 21 8 km2 located in eastern nepal fig 1 in the central hindu kush himalayan hkh region the andherikhola watershed is portrayed by steep and rugged terrain with variation in elevation from 428 to 1872 m above sea level masl the watershed has the highest elevation at the north west corner and the lowest at the north east corner where andheri khola khola meaning small river in the dialect of nepal plunges into the sunkoshi river figs 1 and 2 geomorphology of the andherikhola watershed is characterised by colluvial with patches of alluvial deposits along the streams lithologically the watershed is dominated by gneiss and schist along with granitic and pegmatitic intrusions number of springs in the rock mass and colluvium demonstrate the watershed potential for groundwater fig 3 the study area has a sub tropical type climate with mean annual temperature varying from 8 to 24 c and an average annual rainfall of about 2500 mm dhm et al 2013 as can be seen from fig 1 andheri khola originates from the southern side of the watershed and flows in the north east direction to its confluence with sunkoshi river exhibiting a dendritic drainage pattern the average channel slope of the watershed is 0 139 m m length of the longest flow path is 10 26 km and the time of concentration is approximately 50 min the study watershed is predominantly rural with a sparse distribution of 3400 residents cbs 2011 sixty two percent of the watershed is covered by forest while 36 is cultivated land icimod 2013 and most parts are accessible by earthen roads our field survey shows that although some rural water supply schemes are present locally reliable utility water supply from the government is not available and thus people are facing water shortages a few springs have been tapped with local initiatives in recent years to meet the increasing domestic water demand but with limited yield 3 methodology and data this study has adopted an indicator based weighting method consisting of six indicators for groundwater potential assessment of a hard rock aquifer in a himalayan watershed integrating geo spatial and field exploration techniques spatially distributed maps for the indicators were produced based on information from primary as well as secondary sources the indicators were further aggregated using relative weights derived from ahp with inputs from key hydrogeology experts to prepare the groundwater potential map this map was then validated using observed data of springs as well as ert results the overall methodological framework is presented in fig 4 and the details are described subsequently 3 1 selection of indicators based on the review of a considerable number of relevant literature on groundwater potential presented in supplementary material s 1 from different regions across the globe ten most influencing indicators namely drainage density lineament density geology or lithology slope land use cover lulc geomorphology soil rainfall proximity to drainage or surface water and recharge potential or amount were shortlisted in the first step fig 5 after extensive consultation with hydro geological experts having an in depth understanding of the local context of hard rock aquifers in the mountainous regions of nepal along with the experience of the study team six indicators drainage density lulc lineament density lithology slope and soil composition were finally selected for the groundwater potential study of the andherikhola watershed although rainfall plays an important role in recharge however this study is not focused on quantification rather on the qualitative investigation and relative comparison of potential zones studies have shown that the variability of precipitation within an area of interest is useful for comparative assessment of the groundwater potential particularly if the study area is quite large arshad et al 2020 oikonomidis et al 2015 patra et al 2017 in our case there is only one observed precipitation station in the vicinity of the study area and moreover the watershed area is too small to see a notable variation of precipitation within it hence precipitation and its variation has been excluded in this study 3 2 data and sources primary as well as secondary data were collected from various sources including field survey table 1 the digital elevation model dem was prepared using the contour and spot heights published by the department of survey government of nepal gon into a 30m 30m raster file the lulc data available at a spatial resolution of 30m 30m was downloaded from icimod 2013 information related to lithology soil composition and distribution of water sources springs in particular was collected during field survey conducted by the study team lineament density was extracted from sentinel 2 msi satellite imagery locations coordinates of water sources were collected using a global positioning system gps receiver while their discharges were measured with the help of bucket measuring cylinder and stop watch 3 3 preparation of thematic layers after selection of the indicators thematic layer of each indicator was prepared using gis drainage network was derived from dem and was further processed to prepare a drainage density map using a search radius of 1 km the drainage density of the andherikhola watershed was found to be in the range of 0 8 1 km km2 fig 6 a the land use cover adopted from icimod 2013 was reclassified into four classes agriculture area forest grassland and shrubland most of the areas of the study watershed is covered by forest 61 2 and agriculture area 35 9 grassland 2 1 and shrubland 0 8 are found as patches fig 6b preparation of the lineament density map initially involved derivation of lineaments from the lithological map these lineaments were overlaid on satellite image and finer lineaments were extracted by visual inspection to produce a final lineament map based on which lineament density map was prepared using a search radius of 1 km the lineament density of the study watershed was found varying between 0 and 6 41 km km2 fig 6c lithological map was prepared based on data from the field survey information of different lithological units was collected and mapped by traversing through rivers and foot trails lithological contact identified in the field was extended to the entire watershed the watershed comprised of three types of rocks gneiss 56 4 schist 39 and granite pegmatite 4 6 fig 6d slope of the watershed was derived from the dem and varies from flat near to zero to 55 3 fig 6e soil mass dominated by gravel and larger sized particles observed during the field survey was categorized as gravel dominated soil soil mass of which grain could be distinguished in the field but particles were smaller than gravel was categorized as sand dominated similarly the soil mass was categorized as clay dominated if its grain could not be distinguished in the field areas without soil mass were demarcated as bedrock the study watershed was found to be pre dominantly gravelly 77 1 followed by sand dominated soil 12 5 clay dominated soil 9 5 and bedrock 0 9 as shown in fig 6f all the thematic layers were resampled to 30m 30m spatial resolution raster grids for further processing 3 4 assigning weights the ahp method saaty 1980 was adopted for assigning the weights to each indicator ahp is a method to identify the most influential factors for complex systems such as groundwater based on qualitative expert judgement this is a convenient way to compare decision elements which are difficult to otherwise quantify experts in the field of hydrogeology having an in depth understanding of the local context of hard rock aquifers in the mountainous regions of nepal were requested to provide pair wise comparison of the selected indicators based on a scale of values ranging from 1 to 9 saaty 2001 this method relies on building a hierarchy of decision elements and then making pairwise comparisons in a matrix form eq 1 this hierarchy incorporates the experience and judgement of the decision maker 1 a 1 a 12 a 13 a 1 n 1 a 12 1 a 23 a 2 n 1 a 13 1 a 23 1 a 3 n 1 a 1 n 1 a 2 n 1 a 3 n 1 where a is a n x n comparison matrix in which aij are the alternatives with respect a given criteria aij 0 1 i n 1 j n and n is the number of parameters being compared the new normalized matrix was obtained by dividing each element of the comparison matrix by normalized relative weight sum of its column table 2 principal eigen value λ m a x was computed to be 6 16 from the summation of the products between normalized eigen vector from the normalized matrix and normalized relative weight from the initial reciprocal matrix the consistency index c i was calculated by eq 2 2 c i λ m a x n n 1 where n is the number of parameters 6 thus c i was calculated to be 0 032 finally the consistency ratio c r was calculated by eq 3 3 c r c i r i where ri is the random consistency index dependent on the number of parameters being evaluated saaty 1980 and is 1 24 for n 6 thus consistency ratio c r was calculated to be 0 026 pair wise comparison is consistent only if c r 10 the computed c r value 2 6 meets the consistency criteria ratifying the assumptions made to build the pair wise matrix therefore maximum weightage has been assigned to lithology 31 followed by lineament density 22 soil composition 17 drainage density 14 slope 12 and land use cover 4 3 5 aggregated index and groundwater potential zones delineation classifying the selected indicators is always a challenge as different researchers have put forward a variety of diverse arguments nevertheless we have adopted a classification schema based on our past experience of comparable works in similar physical settings drainage is the path of surface flow and thus retards infiltration hence higher drainage density is inversely proportional to the groundwater potential jenifer and jha 2017 naidu et al 2015 plants require water for germination and also occurrence of a variety of plant species indicate water availability particularly groundwater hence it can be anticipated that barren land has less groundwater potential compared to forest and cultivated land lamichhane and shakya 2019 2020 ouyang et al 2019 generally lineaments consist of linear and curvilinear features of the earth surface like faults joints crustal fractures having high permeability that indicate groundwater potential in terms of recharge storage and discharge berhanu and hatiye 2020 dar et al 2020 pradhan 2009 so higher the lineaments density higher will be the probability of groundwater occurrence the topographic gradient plays a considerable role in groundwater storage flow rate depth of availability along with geology lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 naidu et al 2015 the composition domination by grain size in the soil has a significant contribution on surface as well as subsurface hydrodynamic phenomenon gravel and sand bearing soil have higher chance of infiltration than clay dominated soil because low permeability of clay dominated soil enhances surface runoff zomlot et al 2015 based on the aforementioned arguments each indicator was classified for relative scoring from 1 to 3 larger value representing higher influence to groundwater potential and vice versa table 3 choice of segregating the indicators into three classes was further strengthened by consultation with experts who are well acquainted with the hydrogeology of the study area and our observations and judgement gathered from past experience of working in similar geo physical conditions raster datasets of each input indicator were prepared according to the finalized classes at a horizontal resolution of 30m 30m groundwater potential index gwpi was computed as the weighted sum of the scores of the indicators using the raster datasets in gis the pixel wise gwpi was calculated as follows 4 g w p i t i 1 6 w i s i where gwpi is the groundwater potential index at any pixel t within the watershed i represents the number of indicators used 1 i 6 integer value only wi represents the weight in percentage for a particular indicator i at the tth pixel si represents the relative score for the ith indicator at the tth pixel 1 si 3 integer value only then finally groundwater potential zones were classified into three categories low gwpi 185 medium 185 gwpi 230 and high gwpi 230 to prepare the groundwater potential map choice of segregating groundwater potential into three classes and the relative score range of each class was primarily decided upon the observations made by the study team during the field survey and our judgement based on similar previous studies it was further augmented by consultation with experts who are very much familiar with the hydrogeology of the study area and its geo physical settings it is to be noted here that the magnitudes of gwpi in absolute terms have no direct physical significance and are to be considered for relative comparison only 3 6 validation of groundwater potential map a two step simplistic validation strategy was adopted for evaluating the performance of the implemented methodology fig 4 first level evaluation of the groundwater potential map was carried out using the spring distribution map as presence of springs corroborate the reliability of the results berhanu and hatiye 2020 pradhan et al 2020 distribution of springs along with their discharges one time measurement were mapped using data from field investigation this map was overlaid on the generated groundwater potential map if higher groundwater potential areas correspond to the presence of larger number of springs or higher yield the generated map was considered reasonable at this level because presence of springs is a clear indication of the availability of groundwater in that area since ert is widely used in groundwater prospecting arsène et al 2018 gyeltshen et al 2020 the second level evaluation was made based on the results of ert survey at two sites the electrical resistivity of earthen materials primarily depends on the resistivity of minerals and the fluid contained within the pores of the material ert accounts the difference of electrical resistivity of two particular surveyed points if electric current is introduced into the medium it will flow variably giving rise to a potential difference between the surveyed points depending upon its electrical resistance in ert electrical current of very low frequency is passed and the resistivity data is collected with the help of electrodes by covering the line of investigation continuously in general ert is conducted by various arrangements of four electrodes two current electrodes and two potential electrodes for this study wenner configuration was chosen with electrode spacing of 5 m wenner configuration is a special type of four electrode arrangement in which current and potential electrode pairs have a common mid point and the distances between adjacent electrodes are equal lowrie 2007 geomative gd 10 machine which provides the apparent resistivity of the survey profile was used for data collection apparent resistivity was then converted to true resistivity with the aid of res2dinv version 3 53 g software as ert is a resource intensive and expensive method we could limit it to two sites only in the study watershed within the scope of this research 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of thematic layers groundwater potential zones were delineated based on six thematic layers as discussed in section 3 they are briefly described hereunder 4 1 1 drainage density drainage density of the andherikhola watershed was grouped into three classes class 1 1 0 km km2 class 2 1 2 km km2 and class 3 2 km km2 table 4 fig 7 a indicating high moderate and low effects on groundwater potential respectively classes 1 2 and 3 respectively cover 58 4 27 5 and 14 1 of the watershed area 4 1 2 land use cover lulc lulc was grouped into three classes class 1 grassland class 2 forest shrubland and class 3 agriculture area table 4 fig 7b representing low medium and high effects on groundwater potential respectively they respectively cover 2 1 62 0 and 35 9 of the watershed area 4 1 3 lineament density andherikhola watershed was categorized into class 1 1 0 km km2 class 2 1 0 2 0 km km2 and class 3 2 0 km km2 table 4 fig 7c denoting possible low moderate and high effects respectively of lineament density on groundwater potential classes 1 2 and 3 cover 14 6 38 0 and 47 4 of the watershed area respectively 4 1 4 lithology the study watershed was divided into 3 categories class 1 schist class 2 gneiss and class 3 granite and pegmatite indicating low moderate and high effects of lithology on groundwater potential respectively these occupy 39 0 56 4 and 4 6 respectively of the watershed area table 4 fig 7d 4 1 5 slope the watershed slope was classified into three class 1 10 class 2 10 35 and class 3 35 indicating high moderate and low impact respectively on groundwater potential class 1 covers 11 5 class 2 66 8 and class 3 21 7 of the watershed area table 4 fig 7e showing that andherikhola is a steep watershed 4 1 6 soil composition for groundwater potential zonation the study watershed was classified into three soil classes class 1 clay dominated 10 4 of the watershed area class 2 sand dominated 12 5 and class 3 gravel dominated 77 1 indicating low moderate and high effects on groundwater potential respectively table 4 fig 7f 4 2 groundwater potential zones based on the normalized gwpi values a groundwater potential map was prepared delineating it into three zones low medium and high results show that 21 4 5 km2 of the watershed area falls in the low 36 7 8 km2 in the high and 43 9 5 km2 in the medium groundwater potential zone indicating that the study area has a good groundwater prospect fig 8 it is evident from the figure that central and southern regions of the watershed have high groundwater potentials areas on the northeast have lower potential whereas medium potential areas are found distributed throughout the watershed low groundwater potential zone consists of areas having less water bearing lithological units such as schist medium to high groundwater potential areas are distributed over the region having granite pegmatite and gneiss in addition to areas having granular soil the gneissic lithological regions consisting of coarse gravelly to sandy soil and high density of lineaments with moderate slope south western part of the watershed lie in the high to medium groundwater potential zones these areas also include a large share of agricultural land which could be an indication of the choice of land for agriculture traditionally considering the availability of groundwater for irrigation granite and pegmatite rock dominant central portion of the watershed lies in high to medium groundwater potential zones with several springs having high discharge 10 l per minute lpm most originating through fractured rock aquifers occurrence of high drainage density along the valley regions indicate a lesser potential of groundwater thus strong influence of the geomorphological set up is distinctly visible in the groundwater potential zones delineated in this study in addition to lithology soil composition and slope are also found to influence the groundwater potential but to a lesser extent lithology has been reported as the most influential parameter for groundwater potential and recharge assessment for example in upper blue nile basin andualem and demeke 2019 semi arid region in botswana lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 and high relief area in greece oikonomidis et al 2015 similarly patra et al 2017 showed geology to have the strongest influence on groundwater potential in the alluvial plains of india results of all the aforementioned studies are concurrent with our findings therefore it can be surmised that geological factors play the most important role in groundwater potential zonation and the adopted methodology is found to be satisfactory for application in complex rugged hilly and mountainous terrains with hard rock aquifer systems 4 3 validation of groundwater potential map validation of groundwater potential is always a challenging task especially if the study area is rugged inaccessible and data scarce the challenge is even more pronounced in mountainous regions where people fulfill their household and small scale irrigation demands from spring sources and streams rather than dug wells or boreholes in this study the groundwater potential map was validated using a two step simplistic strategy in which the first step consisted of field exploration the second step involved the application of ert at two locations in different groundwater potential zones within the study watershed field work was carried out during the dry pre monsoon period and surprisingly several springs had significant discharge based on their discharge all the identified springs were classified into five different categories namely high medium low seepage and dry springs having discharge greater than or equal to 10 lpm were classified as high those with 1 10 lpm were classified as medium and those with discharge less than 1 lpm were denoted as low likewise spring sources located in moist areas and or slightly dripping were categorized as seepage those springs which were dry during the field visit but based on the information from the local people that yield up to several months during the monsoon and post monsoon period were categorized as dry details of the visited spring sources are provided in supplementary material s 2 among the identified 61 springs 43 had yield data 7 were seepage and 11 were dry fig 8 out of the 43 spring sources having yield 22 were in the high 11 in the medium and ten in the low groundwater potential zone since more than 50 of surveyed springs lie in the high groundwater potential zone it is found to be in good agreement with the prepared groundwater potential map cross validation analysis is a simple and effective tool to evaluate the groundwater potential map based on available springs data berhanu and hatiye 2020 for this purpose the total number of spring sources in each groundwater potential zone was compared with the number of spring sources having high medium and low discharges table 5 it was seen that there is an agreement of 53 among the two considered variables another criteria was set based on the total yield in each groundwater potential zone versus yield by high medium and low spring discharges table 5 which further showed very good results 75 agreement thus the first level validation of the gw potential zones delineated in this study was found to be satisfactory in representing the groundwater condition of the study watershed ert survey was done at two selected locations fig 8 as the second level validation of the groundwater potential map the first site ab was chosen in a high to medium whereas the second site cd was considered in a low groundwater potential zone profile results of the ert showed that the top layer varies in terms of its composition and thickness along ab fig 9 it can be seen that the northern part has a 20 m thick unsaturated gravel layer the middle part has a 20 m thick saturated gravel layer while the southern part has a 10 m thick clay layer the layer immediately below consists of a layer of saturated sand and gravel with an average thickness of about 25 m layers having higher groundwater potential is observed in the southern part which is in good agreement with the groundwater potential zones of the groundwater potential map the vertical profile of cd shows that the top layer of clay has an average thickness of about 15 m from the east to the west and is slightly squeezed in the middle fig 9 the underlying layer consists of uniformly distributed saturated gravel with an average thickness of about 5 m the third layer of weathered bedrock is approximately 5 m thick and rests above the 20 m thick basal bedrock hence from the ert results this section can be interpreted as a low groundwater potential area synchronous with the desk based findings of the study 5 conclusion this study applied a customized indicator based methodology for delineating groundwater potential zones in a hard rock aquifer watershed of nepal himalaya the groundwater potential map was evaluated using a two step simplistic validation strategy the first step was based on cross validation using the existing springs data location and discharge and the second level validation was done by conducting ert at two locations results from the desk study were found to be in good agreement with the observed field information and thus the devised methodology and findings are considered satisfactorily validated it can be concluded that six indicators namely lithology lineament density soil composition drainage density slope and land use cover can adequately characterize groundwater potential zones in the andherikhola watershed with varying levels of influence higher weightages of 31 and 22 are suitable for lithology and lineament density respectively similarly respective moderate weightages of 17 14 and 12 for soil composition drainage density and slope whereas a low weight of 4 for land use cover is proposed for such hard rock aquifers in a himalayan watershed additionally 36 of the total watershed area under high and 43 under medium groundwater potential zones signify it has a good prospect for detailed future studies related to groundwater development projects furthermore qualitative validation with springs data and ert has been found to be satisfactory for evaluating groundwater potential assessment in data scarce watersheds during the field study one time spring data and 2d ert survey at two locations were conducted due to limited resources authors have a view that collection of year round spring data and conduction of ert survey with cross profile at more locations spatially distributed within the study watershed will further strengthen the validation process in light of the limitations of this study future research direction of groundwater development could be in the quantification of groundwater volume and recharge assessment of recharge zones by adopting latest technologies such as isotopes or tracers and estimation of safe yield such operation research could provide direct inputs to implementation of shallow deep boring systems in these terrains to cater the current as well as future water supply needs the tested methodology can be conveniently replicated in similar settings with some

8153,study region eastern nepal the himalayas study focus this research is aimed at delineating groundwater potential zones in a hard rock aquifer himalayan watershed integrating geo spatial and field exploration techniques a customized indicator based weighting method consisting of six indicators was developed and applied in the study watershed spatially distributed maps for the indicators were produced based on information from primary as well as secondary sources the indicators were further aggregated and groundwater potential map was prepared using relative weights derived from analytical hierarchy process with inputs from key hydrogeology experts the map was then validated using observed data of springs as well as results from electrical resistivity tomography ert new hydrological insights the novelty of this study lies in the application of two step validation using springs data from the field and ert of the groundwater potential mapping approach which demonstrates the robustness of the overall methodology for data scarce regions and paves way for its wider applicability in decision support for groundwater exploration activities further this is one of the very few groundwater potential studies in the nepal himalaya hydrogeological setting keywords groundwater potential hard rock aquifer nepal himalaya electrical resistivity tomography ert analytical hierarchy process ahp gis rs 1 introduction global water demand is continuously increasing and projected to rise by 55 by 2050 wwap 2015 groundwater which supports lives and livelihoods of about two billion people worldwide misi et al 2018 continues to play a dominant role in supplying water to meet the growing demands drilling tubewells is the most common intervention to extract this resource unfortunately limited understanding of the complex groundwater system has resulted in lower success rates of drilling for the groundwater production wells particularly in the developing countries serele et al 2020 wrrdc 2017 the understanding of aquifer systems is further complicated in hard rock aquifers such as in the nepal himalaya which is characterized by wide ranging lithological units from unconsolidated alluvial deposits to high grade metamorphic rocks dhital 2015 furthermore development of appropriate groundwater simulation models is limited in the absence of groundwater monitoring data groundwater which is available through springs and seepages in the hills and mountains buffers surface water shortages in many instances sharma et al 2016 however problems of springs drying up in recent times poudel and duex 2017 for various reasons such as improper road construction are expected to worsen in view of demographic conditions and changing climate this will ultimately impact a large part of the population in the hills of nepal who are currently meeting their domestic irrigation and small scale industrial water demand through groundwater although significantly important exploring groundwater and its potential in this geographical region is not getting adequate attention several conventional and relatively costly methods such as geological hydrogeological geophysical and photogeological techniques are available for studying groundwater potential lillesand et al 2015 shahid et al 2000 on the other hand cost effective approaches for groundwater potential assessment used widely across the globe are primarily based on information of geology lithology land use cover lineaments slope geomorphology drainage density soil and rainfall abdalla 2012 chihi et al 2015 hammouri et al 2012 naidu et al 2015 although some of this information can be obtained through visual inspection it is time consuming prone to high manual errors and applicable only to easily accessible areas furthermore studies show that the estimation of groundwater potential requires accurate continuous and spatially distributed data sinha et al 2018 remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis are proven to be efficient techniques for such analyses with significant recent technological advancements ghimire et al 2019 andualem and demeke 2019 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 oikonomidis et al 2015 serele et al 2020 arshad et al 2020 integrated gis with analytical hierarchy process ahp to map recharge potential zones in agricultural and urban areas lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 delineated groundwater recharge potential zones using a gis based weighted overlay method guided by ahp in a semi arid region patra et al 2017 applied a similar gis rs ahp method to identify dominant parameters for groundwater potential in the ganges alluvial plains similarly oikonomidis et al 2015 used an integrated gis rs method based on ahp to assess the groundwater potential areas in the european context gwrdb 2015 pathak and shrestha 2016 wrrdc 2017 and pradhan et al 2020 adopted an indicator based approach by integrating various factors responsible for controlling the groundwater occurrences in hilly and mountainous terrains of nepal the commonality of all these studies is the application of indicator based weighted overlay method using gis rs and recommendation of wider replicability of the method with some customization whereas the differences being in the scale of application hydrogeology of the area choice of weighted parameters and method of validation most groundwater potential assessment studies have utilized borelogs and well data for validation berhanu and hatiye 2020 serele et al 2020 however in rugged terrains and areas difficult to access this information might not be always available or could be misleading therefore considering springs data could result in a better estimation and validation of the method and findings furthermore geophysical tests such as electrical resistivity tomography ert can be an alternative for assessing groundwater potential the overarching objective of this research is to customize and test a methodology for groundwater potential assessment integrating an indicator based gis rs technique with a simplistic validation strategy serele et al 2020 through a combination of ert and field exploration of springs in a hard rock aquifer himalayan watershed located in nepal there is a high degree of complexity in the inaccessible himalayan mountainous region to carry out subsurface studies like drilling and geophysical survey therefore this study attempts to analyze groundwater potential with limited surface data and key indicators and then validate the results using location and primary discharge data of springs as well as ert results thus the novelty of this research lies in the application of two step validation springs data from the field and ert of the overall approach moreover this is one among the very limited studies in the hard rock aquifers in the nepal himalaya results demonstrate the robustness of the overall methodology and paves way for its wider applicability in similar hydrogeological settings the outcome is expected to be useful for water users practitioners planners and policy makers for understanding and evaluating the current status of groundwater resources in the study area and also for identifying potential sites for future groundwater development 2 study area this study has been carried out in the andherikhola watershed drainage area of 21 8 km2 located in eastern nepal fig 1 in the central hindu kush himalayan hkh region the andherikhola watershed is portrayed by steep and rugged terrain with variation in elevation from 428 to 1872 m above sea level masl the watershed has the highest elevation at the north west corner and the lowest at the north east corner where andheri khola khola meaning small river in the dialect of nepal plunges into the sunkoshi river figs 1 and 2 geomorphology of the andherikhola watershed is characterised by colluvial with patches of alluvial deposits along the streams lithologically the watershed is dominated by gneiss and schist along with granitic and pegmatitic intrusions number of springs in the rock mass and colluvium demonstrate the watershed potential for groundwater fig 3 the study area has a sub tropical type climate with mean annual temperature varying from 8 to 24 c and an average annual rainfall of about 2500 mm dhm et al 2013 as can be seen from fig 1 andheri khola originates from the southern side of the watershed and flows in the north east direction to its confluence with sunkoshi river exhibiting a dendritic drainage pattern the average channel slope of the watershed is 0 139 m m length of the longest flow path is 10 26 km and the time of concentration is approximately 50 min the study watershed is predominantly rural with a sparse distribution of 3400 residents cbs 2011 sixty two percent of the watershed is covered by forest while 36 is cultivated land icimod 2013 and most parts are accessible by earthen roads our field survey shows that although some rural water supply schemes are present locally reliable utility water supply from the government is not available and thus people are facing water shortages a few springs have been tapped with local initiatives in recent years to meet the increasing domestic water demand but with limited yield 3 methodology and data this study has adopted an indicator based weighting method consisting of six indicators for groundwater potential assessment of a hard rock aquifer in a himalayan watershed integrating geo spatial and field exploration techniques spatially distributed maps for the indicators were produced based on information from primary as well as secondary sources the indicators were further aggregated using relative weights derived from ahp with inputs from key hydrogeology experts to prepare the groundwater potential map this map was then validated using observed data of springs as well as ert results the overall methodological framework is presented in fig 4 and the details are described subsequently 3 1 selection of indicators based on the review of a considerable number of relevant literature on groundwater potential presented in supplementary material s 1 from different regions across the globe ten most influencing indicators namely drainage density lineament density geology or lithology slope land use cover lulc geomorphology soil rainfall proximity to drainage or surface water and recharge potential or amount were shortlisted in the first step fig 5 after extensive consultation with hydro geological experts having an in depth understanding of the local context of hard rock aquifers in the mountainous regions of nepal along with the experience of the study team six indicators drainage density lulc lineament density lithology slope and soil composition were finally selected for the groundwater potential study of the andherikhola watershed although rainfall plays an important role in recharge however this study is not focused on quantification rather on the qualitative investigation and relative comparison of potential zones studies have shown that the variability of precipitation within an area of interest is useful for comparative assessment of the groundwater potential particularly if the study area is quite large arshad et al 2020 oikonomidis et al 2015 patra et al 2017 in our case there is only one observed precipitation station in the vicinity of the study area and moreover the watershed area is too small to see a notable variation of precipitation within it hence precipitation and its variation has been excluded in this study 3 2 data and sources primary as well as secondary data were collected from various sources including field survey table 1 the digital elevation model dem was prepared using the contour and spot heights published by the department of survey government of nepal gon into a 30m 30m raster file the lulc data available at a spatial resolution of 30m 30m was downloaded from icimod 2013 information related to lithology soil composition and distribution of water sources springs in particular was collected during field survey conducted by the study team lineament density was extracted from sentinel 2 msi satellite imagery locations coordinates of water sources were collected using a global positioning system gps receiver while their discharges were measured with the help of bucket measuring cylinder and stop watch 3 3 preparation of thematic layers after selection of the indicators thematic layer of each indicator was prepared using gis drainage network was derived from dem and was further processed to prepare a drainage density map using a search radius of 1 km the drainage density of the andherikhola watershed was found to be in the range of 0 8 1 km km2 fig 6 a the land use cover adopted from icimod 2013 was reclassified into four classes agriculture area forest grassland and shrubland most of the areas of the study watershed is covered by forest 61 2 and agriculture area 35 9 grassland 2 1 and shrubland 0 8 are found as patches fig 6b preparation of the lineament density map initially involved derivation of lineaments from the lithological map these lineaments were overlaid on satellite image and finer lineaments were extracted by visual inspection to produce a final lineament map based on which lineament density map was prepared using a search radius of 1 km the lineament density of the study watershed was found varying between 0 and 6 41 km km2 fig 6c lithological map was prepared based on data from the field survey information of different lithological units was collected and mapped by traversing through rivers and foot trails lithological contact identified in the field was extended to the entire watershed the watershed comprised of three types of rocks gneiss 56 4 schist 39 and granite pegmatite 4 6 fig 6d slope of the watershed was derived from the dem and varies from flat near to zero to 55 3 fig 6e soil mass dominated by gravel and larger sized particles observed during the field survey was categorized as gravel dominated soil soil mass of which grain could be distinguished in the field but particles were smaller than gravel was categorized as sand dominated similarly the soil mass was categorized as clay dominated if its grain could not be distinguished in the field areas without soil mass were demarcated as bedrock the study watershed was found to be pre dominantly gravelly 77 1 followed by sand dominated soil 12 5 clay dominated soil 9 5 and bedrock 0 9 as shown in fig 6f all the thematic layers were resampled to 30m 30m spatial resolution raster grids for further processing 3 4 assigning weights the ahp method saaty 1980 was adopted for assigning the weights to each indicator ahp is a method to identify the most influential factors for complex systems such as groundwater based on qualitative expert judgement this is a convenient way to compare decision elements which are difficult to otherwise quantify experts in the field of hydrogeology having an in depth understanding of the local context of hard rock aquifers in the mountainous regions of nepal were requested to provide pair wise comparison of the selected indicators based on a scale of values ranging from 1 to 9 saaty 2001 this method relies on building a hierarchy of decision elements and then making pairwise comparisons in a matrix form eq 1 this hierarchy incorporates the experience and judgement of the decision maker 1 a 1 a 12 a 13 a 1 n 1 a 12 1 a 23 a 2 n 1 a 13 1 a 23 1 a 3 n 1 a 1 n 1 a 2 n 1 a 3 n 1 where a is a n x n comparison matrix in which aij are the alternatives with respect a given criteria aij 0 1 i n 1 j n and n is the number of parameters being compared the new normalized matrix was obtained by dividing each element of the comparison matrix by normalized relative weight sum of its column table 2 principal eigen value λ m a x was computed to be 6 16 from the summation of the products between normalized eigen vector from the normalized matrix and normalized relative weight from the initial reciprocal matrix the consistency index c i was calculated by eq 2 2 c i λ m a x n n 1 where n is the number of parameters 6 thus c i was calculated to be 0 032 finally the consistency ratio c r was calculated by eq 3 3 c r c i r i where ri is the random consistency index dependent on the number of parameters being evaluated saaty 1980 and is 1 24 for n 6 thus consistency ratio c r was calculated to be 0 026 pair wise comparison is consistent only if c r 10 the computed c r value 2 6 meets the consistency criteria ratifying the assumptions made to build the pair wise matrix therefore maximum weightage has been assigned to lithology 31 followed by lineament density 22 soil composition 17 drainage density 14 slope 12 and land use cover 4 3 5 aggregated index and groundwater potential zones delineation classifying the selected indicators is always a challenge as different researchers have put forward a variety of diverse arguments nevertheless we have adopted a classification schema based on our past experience of comparable works in similar physical settings drainage is the path of surface flow and thus retards infiltration hence higher drainage density is inversely proportional to the groundwater potential jenifer and jha 2017 naidu et al 2015 plants require water for germination and also occurrence of a variety of plant species indicate water availability particularly groundwater hence it can be anticipated that barren land has less groundwater potential compared to forest and cultivated land lamichhane and shakya 2019 2020 ouyang et al 2019 generally lineaments consist of linear and curvilinear features of the earth surface like faults joints crustal fractures having high permeability that indicate groundwater potential in terms of recharge storage and discharge berhanu and hatiye 2020 dar et al 2020 pradhan 2009 so higher the lineaments density higher will be the probability of groundwater occurrence the topographic gradient plays a considerable role in groundwater storage flow rate depth of availability along with geology lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 naidu et al 2015 the composition domination by grain size in the soil has a significant contribution on surface as well as subsurface hydrodynamic phenomenon gravel and sand bearing soil have higher chance of infiltration than clay dominated soil because low permeability of clay dominated soil enhances surface runoff zomlot et al 2015 based on the aforementioned arguments each indicator was classified for relative scoring from 1 to 3 larger value representing higher influence to groundwater potential and vice versa table 3 choice of segregating the indicators into three classes was further strengthened by consultation with experts who are well acquainted with the hydrogeology of the study area and our observations and judgement gathered from past experience of working in similar geo physical conditions raster datasets of each input indicator were prepared according to the finalized classes at a horizontal resolution of 30m 30m groundwater potential index gwpi was computed as the weighted sum of the scores of the indicators using the raster datasets in gis the pixel wise gwpi was calculated as follows 4 g w p i t i 1 6 w i s i where gwpi is the groundwater potential index at any pixel t within the watershed i represents the number of indicators used 1 i 6 integer value only wi represents the weight in percentage for a particular indicator i at the tth pixel si represents the relative score for the ith indicator at the tth pixel 1 si 3 integer value only then finally groundwater potential zones were classified into three categories low gwpi 185 medium 185 gwpi 230 and high gwpi 230 to prepare the groundwater potential map choice of segregating groundwater potential into three classes and the relative score range of each class was primarily decided upon the observations made by the study team during the field survey and our judgement based on similar previous studies it was further augmented by consultation with experts who are very much familiar with the hydrogeology of the study area and its geo physical settings it is to be noted here that the magnitudes of gwpi in absolute terms have no direct physical significance and are to be considered for relative comparison only 3 6 validation of groundwater potential map a two step simplistic validation strategy was adopted for evaluating the performance of the implemented methodology fig 4 first level evaluation of the groundwater potential map was carried out using the spring distribution map as presence of springs corroborate the reliability of the results berhanu and hatiye 2020 pradhan et al 2020 distribution of springs along with their discharges one time measurement were mapped using data from field investigation this map was overlaid on the generated groundwater potential map if higher groundwater potential areas correspond to the presence of larger number of springs or higher yield the generated map was considered reasonable at this level because presence of springs is a clear indication of the availability of groundwater in that area since ert is widely used in groundwater prospecting arsène et al 2018 gyeltshen et al 2020 the second level evaluation was made based on the results of ert survey at two sites the electrical resistivity of earthen materials primarily depends on the resistivity of minerals and the fluid contained within the pores of the material ert accounts the difference of electrical resistivity of two particular surveyed points if electric current is introduced into the medium it will flow variably giving rise to a potential difference between the surveyed points depending upon its electrical resistance in ert electrical current of very low frequency is passed and the resistivity data is collected with the help of electrodes by covering the line of investigation continuously in general ert is conducted by various arrangements of four electrodes two current electrodes and two potential electrodes for this study wenner configuration was chosen with electrode spacing of 5 m wenner configuration is a special type of four electrode arrangement in which current and potential electrode pairs have a common mid point and the distances between adjacent electrodes are equal lowrie 2007 geomative gd 10 machine which provides the apparent resistivity of the survey profile was used for data collection apparent resistivity was then converted to true resistivity with the aid of res2dinv version 3 53 g software as ert is a resource intensive and expensive method we could limit it to two sites only in the study watershed within the scope of this research 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of thematic layers groundwater potential zones were delineated based on six thematic layers as discussed in section 3 they are briefly described hereunder 4 1 1 drainage density drainage density of the andherikhola watershed was grouped into three classes class 1 1 0 km km2 class 2 1 2 km km2 and class 3 2 km km2 table 4 fig 7 a indicating high moderate and low effects on groundwater potential respectively classes 1 2 and 3 respectively cover 58 4 27 5 and 14 1 of the watershed area 4 1 2 land use cover lulc lulc was grouped into three classes class 1 grassland class 2 forest shrubland and class 3 agriculture area table 4 fig 7b representing low medium and high effects on groundwater potential respectively they respectively cover 2 1 62 0 and 35 9 of the watershed area 4 1 3 lineament density andherikhola watershed was categorized into class 1 1 0 km km2 class 2 1 0 2 0 km km2 and class 3 2 0 km km2 table 4 fig 7c denoting possible low moderate and high effects respectively of lineament density on groundwater potential classes 1 2 and 3 cover 14 6 38 0 and 47 4 of the watershed area respectively 4 1 4 lithology the study watershed was divided into 3 categories class 1 schist class 2 gneiss and class 3 granite and pegmatite indicating low moderate and high effects of lithology on groundwater potential respectively these occupy 39 0 56 4 and 4 6 respectively of the watershed area table 4 fig 7d 4 1 5 slope the watershed slope was classified into three class 1 10 class 2 10 35 and class 3 35 indicating high moderate and low impact respectively on groundwater potential class 1 covers 11 5 class 2 66 8 and class 3 21 7 of the watershed area table 4 fig 7e showing that andherikhola is a steep watershed 4 1 6 soil composition for groundwater potential zonation the study watershed was classified into three soil classes class 1 clay dominated 10 4 of the watershed area class 2 sand dominated 12 5 and class 3 gravel dominated 77 1 indicating low moderate and high effects on groundwater potential respectively table 4 fig 7f 4 2 groundwater potential zones based on the normalized gwpi values a groundwater potential map was prepared delineating it into three zones low medium and high results show that 21 4 5 km2 of the watershed area falls in the low 36 7 8 km2 in the high and 43 9 5 km2 in the medium groundwater potential zone indicating that the study area has a good groundwater prospect fig 8 it is evident from the figure that central and southern regions of the watershed have high groundwater potentials areas on the northeast have lower potential whereas medium potential areas are found distributed throughout the watershed low groundwater potential zone consists of areas having less water bearing lithological units such as schist medium to high groundwater potential areas are distributed over the region having granite pegmatite and gneiss in addition to areas having granular soil the gneissic lithological regions consisting of coarse gravelly to sandy soil and high density of lineaments with moderate slope south western part of the watershed lie in the high to medium groundwater potential zones these areas also include a large share of agricultural land which could be an indication of the choice of land for agriculture traditionally considering the availability of groundwater for irrigation granite and pegmatite rock dominant central portion of the watershed lies in high to medium groundwater potential zones with several springs having high discharge 10 l per minute lpm most originating through fractured rock aquifers occurrence of high drainage density along the valley regions indicate a lesser potential of groundwater thus strong influence of the geomorphological set up is distinctly visible in the groundwater potential zones delineated in this study in addition to lithology soil composition and slope are also found to influence the groundwater potential but to a lesser extent lithology has been reported as the most influential parameter for groundwater potential and recharge assessment for example in upper blue nile basin andualem and demeke 2019 semi arid region in botswana lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 and high relief area in greece oikonomidis et al 2015 similarly patra et al 2017 showed geology to have the strongest influence on groundwater potential in the alluvial plains of india results of all the aforementioned studies are concurrent with our findings therefore it can be surmised that geological factors play the most important role in groundwater potential zonation and the adopted methodology is found to be satisfactory for application in complex rugged hilly and mountainous terrains with hard rock aquifer systems 4 3 validation of groundwater potential map validation of groundwater potential is always a challenging task especially if the study area is rugged inaccessible and data scarce the challenge is even more pronounced in mountainous regions where people fulfill their household and small scale irrigation demands from spring sources and streams rather than dug wells or boreholes in this study the groundwater potential map was validated using a two step simplistic strategy in which the first step consisted of field exploration the second step involved the application of ert at two locations in different groundwater potential zones within the study watershed field work was carried out during the dry pre monsoon period and surprisingly several springs had significant discharge based on their discharge all the identified springs were classified into five different categories namely high medium low seepage and dry springs having discharge greater than or equal to 10 lpm were classified as high those with 1 10 lpm were classified as medium and those with discharge less than 1 lpm were denoted as low likewise spring sources located in moist areas and or slightly dripping were categorized as seepage those springs which were dry during the field visit but based on the information from the local people that yield up to several months during the monsoon and post monsoon period were categorized as dry details of the visited spring sources are provided in supplementary material s 2 among the identified 61 springs 43 had yield data 7 were seepage and 11 were dry fig 8 out of the 43 spring sources having yield 22 were in the high 11 in the medium and ten in the low groundwater potential zone since more than 50 of surveyed springs lie in the high groundwater potential zone it is found to be in good agreement with the prepared groundwater potential map cross validation analysis is a simple and effective tool to evaluate the groundwater potential map based on available springs data berhanu and hatiye 2020 for this purpose the total number of spring sources in each groundwater potential zone was compared with the number of spring sources having high medium and low discharges table 5 it was seen that there is an agreement of 53 among the two considered variables another criteria was set based on the total yield in each groundwater potential zone versus yield by high medium and low spring discharges table 5 which further showed very good results 75 agreement thus the first level validation of the gw potential zones delineated in this study was found to be satisfactory in representing the groundwater condition of the study watershed ert survey was done at two selected locations fig 8 as the second level validation of the groundwater potential map the first site ab was chosen in a high to medium whereas the second site cd was considered in a low groundwater potential zone profile results of the ert showed that the top layer varies in terms of its composition and thickness along ab fig 9 it can be seen that the northern part has a 20 m thick unsaturated gravel layer the middle part has a 20 m thick saturated gravel layer while the southern part has a 10 m thick clay layer the layer immediately below consists of a layer of saturated sand and gravel with an average thickness of about 25 m layers having higher groundwater potential is observed in the southern part which is in good agreement with the groundwater potential zones of the groundwater potential map the vertical profile of cd shows that the top layer of clay has an average thickness of about 15 m from the east to the west and is slightly squeezed in the middle fig 9 the underlying layer consists of uniformly distributed saturated gravel with an average thickness of about 5 m the third layer of weathered bedrock is approximately 5 m thick and rests above the 20 m thick basal bedrock hence from the ert results this section can be interpreted as a low groundwater potential area synchronous with the desk based findings of the study 5 conclusion this study applied a customized indicator based methodology for delineating groundwater potential zones in a hard rock aquifer watershed of nepal himalaya the groundwater potential map was evaluated using a two step simplistic validation strategy the first step was based on cross validation using the existing springs data location and discharge and the second level validation was done by conducting ert at two locations results from the desk study were found to be in good agreement with the observed field information and thus the devised methodology and findings are considered satisfactorily validated it can be concluded that six indicators namely lithology lineament density soil composition drainage density slope and land use cover can adequately characterize groundwater potential zones in the andherikhola watershed with varying levels of influence higher weightages of 31 and 22 are suitable for lithology and lineament density respectively similarly respective moderate weightages of 17 14 and 12 for soil composition drainage density and slope whereas a low weight of 4 for land use cover is proposed for such hard rock aquifers in a himalayan watershed additionally 36 of the total watershed area under high and 43 under medium groundwater potential zones signify it has a good prospect for detailed future studies related to groundwater development projects furthermore qualitative validation with springs data and ert has been found to be satisfactory for evaluating groundwater potential assessment in data scarce watersheds during the field study one time spring data and 2d ert survey at two locations were conducted due to limited resources authors have a view that collection of year round spring data and conduction of ert survey with cross profile at more locations spatially distributed within the study watershed will further strengthen the validation process in light of the limitations of this study future research direction of groundwater development could be in the quantification of groundwater volume and recharge assessment of recharge zones by adopting latest technologies such as isotopes or tracers and estimation of safe yield such operation research could provide direct inputs to implementation of shallow deep boring systems in these terrains to cater the current as well as future water supply needs the tested methodology can be conveniently replicated in similar settings with some

8154,study region upper blue nile basin ethiopia study focus this study was conducted at the koga irrigation scheme in the upper blue nile basin ethiopia to investigate the influence of irrigation activity on the groundwater system representative samples of six shallow wells in the irrigated fields and four shallow wells in the adjacent non irrigated rain fed agricultural lands were selected dipmeter and hand gps garmin 60 were used for the monitoring of water table depth and fixing the location of the wells respectively arc gis 10 5 has been applied for interpolation of water table depth wtd water samples were collected and analyzed in the laboratory following international standards new hydrological insights for the region the result shows that irrigation contributed to the water table rises of wells located in the irrigated fields which range from 0 77 m to 0 52 m and water table drops were observed in wells located in the non irrigated fields investigations on the groundwater quality gwq indicated that no significant effect was observed in the irrigated and non irrigated fields the study shows that good irrigation water management continuous follow up of the groundwater table and its physico chemical properties are essential for the sustainability of the koga irrigation scheme keywords water table groundwater quality koga nutrient concentration 1 introduction the world is confronted with limited water resources and food safety and the agricultural sector is mainly under pressure around the world because of an increase in demand climate change and frequent droughts misra 2014 in line with this ethiopia has continuously been affected by frequent droughts and induced food insecurity the ethiopian government has responded to this drought and famine through the construction of small medium and large scale irrigation schemes awulachew et al 2005 irrigation development is regarded as the best alternative in the country for reliable and sustainable food security income generation and livelihood improvement awulachew et al 2007 however the irrigation system in ethiopia has remained to be traditional and the performances of the traditional surface irrigation schemes are very low due to poor irrigation water management and agricultural extension efficient and well managed irrigation water practice including quantifying the groundwater table depth and monitoring water quality is of utmost importance for decision makers growers and experts agide et al 2016 human activities have become a major topic for groundwater research including prevention of groundwater pollution and the rehabilitation of polluted groundwater bodies kovalevsky et al 2004 qualitative and quantitative characterization of groundwater recharge

2018 a study conducted in northern mexico and north platte river valley usa confirmed that canal and field seepage increases water tables which causes a rise in local groundwater tables under farms during the irrigation seasons fernald et al 2007 harvey and sibray 2001 seepage from irrigation canals is an important source for recharging shallow groundwater aquifers and contributes more than half of groundwater recharge and they reported that the depth of the groundwater table was raised from 0 35 to 0 4 m due to irrigation activity arumi et al 2009 a study conducted in colorado state usa showed that surface irrigation raised the groundwater table to 0 65 m as compared to pumping wells irrigation system due to the strong causal relationship between pumping and shallow water tables wei and bailey 2019 the development of irrigated agriculture has multi directional benefits however it has also negative consequences including environmental effects and social instability for instance in the middle and lower awash valleys in ethiopia more than 20 000 ha of irrigated lands amibara dofan dufti malka sadi malka warar matahara have been degraded due to salinity problems and poor irrigation agricultural management alamirew 2002 awulachew et al 2007 girma and seleshi 2007 chemical fertilizers are used extensively in modern agriculture to improve crop yield but it has a severe impact on surface and groundwater quality contamination divya and belagali 2012 inappropriate water and fertilizer management in irrigated agriculture have environmental problems including groundwater pollution siyal et al 2012 excessive and improper application of nitrogenous fertilizers leads to an increase in nitrate concentration in the ground and surface water siyal et al 2012 for instance the quality of soils ground and surface water is at risk in the rift valley region of ethiopia due to the poor agricultural system siyal et al 2012 furrow irrigation is a major source of nitrate leaching mitchell et al 1994 and groundwater pollution wylie et al 1994 flood irrigation is a poor irrigation system that initiates runoff that results from water table rise than drip and sprinkler irrigation leng et al 2017 the livelihood system in the study district is mostly dependent on cattle production trade and rain fed and irrigation farming systems the source of water in this area is shallow groundwater hand dug well for household consumption and reservoir water for irrigation consumption however in recent years most shallow well users in the non irrigated areas are facing challenges of water shortage at the end of the dry season april as the hand dug wells run dry or face excessive drops of the water table on the contrary from local people s interviews and personal observations owing to the commencement of the irrigation the depths of hand dug wells in the irrigated field are becoming shallow and the emergence of new spring water source was observed in the northern part of the koga irrigation command area monitoring of water table and the development of a monitoring network is important for effective groundwater resource management zhou et al 2013 the irrigation system of the koga irrigation scheme consists of a network of main secondary and tertiary irrigation canals responsible for water delivery night storage reservoirs drainage canals and service roads eriksson 2012 the irrigation method of the koga scheme is a furrow and flood irrigation system and the irrigation water is exposed to artificial fertilizer and animal manure before it starts to percolate horgby and larson 2013 in the koga irrigation scheme farmers apply frequent and excess irrigation water than the crop water requirement therefore such irrigation events may impact the groundwater recharge and groundwater quality of the scheme therefore this study aimed at evaluating the impact of irrigation on the depth of the water table and its quality in the koga irrigation scheme 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study area this research has been conducted at the koga irrigation project located northwest of ethiopia fig 1 it is found at 11 22 to 11 32 northing 37 01 to 37 09 easting and from 1 880 to 2 020 m a s l altitude the irrigation system has been commissioned in 2010 to irrigate 7004 ha of land the koga dam reservoir feeds 12 irrigation blocks and 11 night storage reservoirs agide et al 2016 the rainfall characteristic is uni modal occurring from may to october the average annual rainfall of the area as per the data of 20 years 2000 2019 was about 1430 9 mm the mean maximum and minimum temperatures are 26 8 c and 9 7 c respectively 2 2 data collection representative sample sites of shallow wells were selected by considering soil type water source and topographic conditions in both the irrigated and none irrigated fields farmers shallow wells hand dug wells were used to monitor the effect of irrigation on water table fluctuations and groundwater quality a sample of 10 wells at two locations i e six wells in the irrigated field w21 to w26 and four wells w11 to w14 in the non irrigated field were selected fig 1 and table 1 wells selected outside the irrigation scheme were located in the southwestern and southeastern parts of the irrigation scheme and were considerably far 2 7 km on ground from the irrigation command area fig 1 this distance helps to minimize the biasness of the samples from possible groundwater movements and interference the depth of the wells and location latitude longitude and altitude of the studied wells have been collected using a dipmeter and a hand held garmin 60 gps respectively the reading of the water table depth was measured from the surface of the well top to the water table and recorded each day at 6 00 p m the water table depth monitoring was started in september 2019 and continued until the end of february 2020 for the groundwater quality monitoring samples were collected from the selected wells in may 2020 using 300 ml clear plastic bottles and then transported to the laboratory within 24 h for analysis the collected water samples have been analyzed for chemical properties including nitrate no3 phosphate po4 3 sulfate so4 2 potassium k calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 and ph 2 3 data analysis and interpretation the water table depth map of shallow hand dug wells was analyzed using arcview 10 5 gis tool the map was developed using mean daily monitored data within the irrigation and outside the scheme rain fed system the universal kriging uk interpolation method was used to evaluate the spatial fluctuation of the groundwater table the uk interpolation method is the geo statistical kriging technique that provides a statistical method for spatial interpolation and it is an unbiased predictor of whether or not the data is normally distributed kumar and ahmed 2003 gundogdu and guney 2007 nowadays the kriging methods are popular and are used for water table or elevation interpolation the measured water table data were used to establish the area wide average values for the other areas where measurements were not done the groundwater quality test comprises collecting and analyzing water quality from sampled wells the collected samples had been mixed with reagents before measuring each parameter the groundwater quality parameters of interest investigated in this study were nitrates no3 phosphate po4 3 sulfate so4 2 potassium k calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 and ph the concentrations of nitrate phosphate sulfate potassium calcium and magnesium was determined by molecular spectrophotometry while ph was determined using a ph meter the chemical concentration of the sampled water was analyzed using standard test procedures who 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of irrigation on groundwater depth in the study area the sources of groundwater recharge were irrigation drainage canals night storage reservoirs and rainfall in the rainy season groundwater levels at irrigated and non irrigated fields were monitored to explore the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge water table depth measurements showed that the maximum mean water table depth of 6 02 m was recorded in november 2019 while the lowest mean water table depth of 2 53 m was recorded in september 2019 from wells located in the irrigated field irrigation activities in the study area started in mid november and continued to the end of may the temporal analysis of the mean water table in the irrigated field showed that a drop in the water table was observed from september to december in 2019 but raised after december and continued to rise until the end of february 2020 fig 3 similarly the change in water table depth which was estimated as the difference between the averages of two consecutive months difference of current month and previous month water table depths in the irrigated field showed a declining trend starting from september to december negative sign but a rise positive sign from december to the end of february for instance the water table depth of w21 in september was 2 81 m while it was 3 58 m in october which is equivalent to a reduction change in water table of 0 77 m related to the previous month table 2 in the irrigated land the water table slightly declined at the end of february fig 3 probably this is related to the high evapotranspiration and temperature during these months in the area the mean maximum temperature of the study period was 25 8 26 8 26 9 26 8 27 1 and 29 1 c for september october november december january and february respectively fig 2 a study confirmed that temperature and evapotranspiration have a contribution to temporal groundwater fluctuations abera et al 2019 the seasonal water table depth increment for wells w21 w22 w23 w24 w5 and w26 was 0 8 m 1 55 m 1 93 m 1 06 m 1 89 m and 0 98 m respectively table 2 a higher rise of the groundwater table was observed in w25 while the lower rise was observed in well w21 the total relative drops of water table until the response of irrigation water started for wells w21 w22 w23 and w24 w25 and w26 were 1 62 m 3 20 m 3 47 m 2 93 m 2 27 m 0 99 m and 2 33 m respectively table 2 the mean rise of the water table depth due to irrigation was 0 41 m 0 78 m 0 97 m 0 35 m 0 63 m and 0 45 m for wells w21 w22 w23 w24 w25 and w26 respectively the mean rise of the water table depth due to irrigation varied from 0 97 m maximum to 0 41 m minimum after the beginning of irrigation operation table 2 generally all the sampled wells located inside the irrigated fields showed a rise in the water table after december this result indicated that the irrigation activity in the study area has an identifiable contribution to groundwater recharge this result is in line with the findings of many authors abera et al 2019 ochoa et al 2012 2013 bethune et al 2008 who showed that irrigation has its recognizable contribution to the rise of the water table the water table depth monitoring samples were also taken outside non irrigated the command areas the non irrigated field wells showed that there were dramatic declines in the water table starting from september 2019 to the end of february 2020 fig 4 this indicates that wells located in the non irrigated area have minimal or no groundwater recharge sources during the dry season the changes in water table depth in the non irrigated field were all negative table 3 which is interpreted as a continuous drop of the water table in this field the total seasonal water table drops for wells w11 w12 w13 and w14 were 3 83 m 3 77 m 7 30 m and 3 68 m respectively table 3 the higher drop of the water table was observed in w13 while the lower drop was found in w14 since w14 is located near to the natural drainage than well w13 fig 1 this study revealed that irrigation has its recognizable contribution to the groundwater recharge in the irrigated field the contribution of irrigation activity to the water table varied from 0 77 m to 0 52 m rise of the water table after the beginning of irrigation operation table 2 3 2 impact of rainfall on water table depth the annual rainfall of the area in the study period 2019 20 was 1985 9 mm fig 2 mostly the irrigation activity in koga irrigation scheme starts in mid november and irrigation activities continue until the end of may the water table depth analysis showed a drop in the water table september to the end of february in the non irrigated field while it starts to rise after december in the irrigated field bouwer 1987 also found that shallow wells rapidly respond to water table rise as the percolation time of water from irrigated fields to groundwater increases with increasing depth to groundwater the result revealed that the impact of rainfall on both locations irrigated and non irrigated fields showed non substantial initiation for the rise of the water table during the study months september to end of february fig 5 as indicated in fig 2 the amount of rainfall in this period is about 200 mm likewise referring to the project study document macdonald 2006 the irrigation water that is applied to the irrigation fields amounts to 465 mm this shows that the irrigation water applied is far more than the rainfall and comparatively the rainfall has far less impact on the water table than irrigation in this period this means that the contribution of irrigation to the water table rise was higher than rainfall during the study period similar studies showed that the recharge of groundwater is influenced by applied irrigation amount groundwater table depth seasonal temperature variations irrigation application efficiency and crop growth stages abera et al 2019 3 3 spatial and temporal variation of water table depth the spatial variation of water table depth wtd has been analyzed using arc gis and the map has been established from the average values of the wtd the result showed that the mean water table depth has reached up to 3 1 m downstream in the north and up to 7 9 m at the middle of the command area on the other hand it has reached up to 18 m 20 m upstream in the south of the irrigation command area fig 6 the temporal mean wtd response of 10 sampled wells in the study area was mapped in september end of rainy season february mid of irrigation season and the average of the monitoring period sep 2019 feb 2020 from the map the wtd varied from 2 5 to 3 6 m september and from 2 5 to 4 6 m february at the north of the study site figs 7 and 8 on the southern part the wtd varied from 7 1 to 9 2 m in september and from 10 8 to 12 9 m in february figs 7 and 8 generally the wtd of the area has high spatial and temporal variability the northern part of the irrigation scheme has relatively shallow groundwater depth whereas the southeastern part is relatively deeper which is in line with the topographic feature fig 9 and the stream network towards the surface water flow direction fig 1 of the study area this result revealed that the water table depth of the study area shows spatial variations similar studies at the koga irrigation scheme showed that the water table reached the surface in the north viksten 2016 the topographical condition of the sampling area and the distance of the wells to drainage ditches have been attributed to this variation the depth of the groundwater table fluctuates seasonally and annually in response to a variation of precipitation climate change rate of irrigation and pumping conditions dinka et al 2013 it is also affected by external factors climate and human activities and is often a hydrological indicator of the state of the ecology of the region dinka et al 2013 3 4 impact of irrigation on groundwater quality in the study area farmers use urea dap diammonium phosphate nps b nitrogen phosphorous sulfur boron blended fertilizer insecticides and pesticides for the production of different field crops therefore these elements can be the source for pollution of the groundwater in addition to the natural source the groundwater quality analysis results sampled from the irrigated and non irrigated field are represented in tables 4 and 5 the result showed that the concentration of phosphate potassium and calcium were higher in the non irrigated field than in the irrigated field the concentration of calcium in the irrigated land was much smaller than in the non irrigated field the geological nature and source of calcium must be at the base of this variation the concentration of nitrate sulfate and magnesium in the groundwater showed that a higher concentration was observed in the irrigated field compared to the non irrigated field one tailed paired t test statistics were conducted to analyze the impact of irrigation activity on groundwater quality for no3 po4 3 so4 2 k ca2 mg2 and ph levels before the test the data were checked for normal distribution and similar assumptions using shapiro wilk test the normality test shows that the data follows a normal distribution hence the one tailed paired t test shows that the mean concentration of all nutrients has no significant difference α 5 between irrigated and non irrigated fields table 6 this phenomenon may come from the sampling period perception of farmers to use fertilizer solubility nature of the fertilizer and other factors therefore it is not allowed to conclude that the concentration of nitrate and other parameters are higher in the irrigated field than in non irrigated land as the concentration of this nutrient may vary due to spatial temporal conditions the natural process and the amount of fertilizer applied in the area in line with our study enyew 2019 reported that the mean concentration january to december of nitrate in the groundwater at koga irrigation scheme was higher in the irrigated field 2 47 mg l 1 than in the non irrigated field 1 72 mg l 1 the previous studies at the koga irrigation scheme show wells located in the non irrigated field have a higher concentration of phosphate 1 87 mg l 1 than wells located in the irrigated field 1 68 mg l 1 enyew 2019 eriksson 2012 reported that the concentration of nitrate was 0 012 mg l 1 while phosphate was 0 54 mg l 1 in the groundwater at the koga irrigation scheme the concentration of sulfate in the groundwater was 3 37 mg l 1 horgby and larson 2013 this result revealed that irrigation activity does not affect the concentration of nitrate phosphate potassium and calcium in the study area complete chemistry of the irrigation water was not analyzed in this study however a few samples were taken from the source irrigation water to check the concentration of nitrate phosphate and sulfate in the surface water the concentration of these parameters was 2 9 mg l 1 1 0 mg l 1 and 44 0 mg l 1 respectively densaw et al 2016 found that the concentration of nitrate phosphate and sulfate of koga irrigation water source was 1 7 mg l 1 1 8 mg l 1 and 53 0 mg l 1 respectively the results revealed that the concentration of these parameters was relatively high in the irrigation water than in the groundwater only three parameters were analyzed for the irrigation water in this study which may not give a full picture of the quality of the irrigation water and hence it is important to highlight those foreseen studies in the area need to consider the full chemistry of the irrigation water for a better understanding of the influence of irrigated water on the groundwater of the area generally farmers in the study area apply fertilizers pesticides and insecticides and consequently the reservoir water that is being used for irrigation is expected to have different chemical constituents that would be expected to show up in the groundwater the concentration of nitrate during the rainy season is greater than the dry season due to the draining of domestic sewerage and agricultural runoff oljira 2015 therefore the sampling period is affected by the movement of nutrients in the soil media and subsoil to reach the groundwater table generally these studies showed that the quality of the water is good and falls within the who limits for drinking water purposes who 2004 4 conclusion this study presents the impact of surface water irrigation system on groundwater recharge and quality in the koga irrigation project in northwest ethiopia the groundwater monitoring analysis showed that a rise of the water table in the irrigated field was observed while a decline of the water table in the non irrigated field was observed during the study periods from september to february the effect of irrigation water on the water table depth resulted in a rise of the water table with a range of 0 52 m 0 77 m after the beginning of irrigation there was a high spatial and temporal variation of water table depth during the study periods the concentration of nitrate sulfate and magnesium showed that wells located inside the irrigated fields have a higher concentration than wells located in the non irrigated land however the mean concentration of all nutrients has no significant difference α 5 between irrigated and non irrigated fields table 6 besides the quality of these nutrients in the groundwater was within the world health organization limit for drinking water purposes this indicates that irrigation activity in this study has an identifiable contribution to the groundwater recharge but it had no substantial effect on the quality of groundwater in the scheme during this study period the raised water table depth in the irrigated field indicated that there was an excess application of irrigation water in the study area further studies would be needed to obtain full data on the seasonal impact of irrigation on groundwater quality in

8154,study region upper blue nile basin ethiopia study focus this study was conducted at the koga irrigation scheme in the upper blue nile basin ethiopia to investigate the influence of irrigation activity on the groundwater system representative samples of six shallow wells in the irrigated fields and four shallow wells in the adjacent non irrigated rain fed agricultural lands were selected

wtd water samples were collected and analyzed in the laboratory following international standards new hydrological insights for the region the result shows that irrigation contributed to the water table rises of wells located in the irrigated fields which range from 0 77 m to 0 52 m and water table drops were observed in wells located in the non irrigated fields investigations on the groundwater quality gwq indicated that no significant effect was observed in the irrigated and non irrigated fields the study shows that good irrigation water management continuous follow up of the groundwater table and its physico chemical properties are essential for the sustainability of the koga irrigation scheme keywords water table groundwater quality koga nutrient concentration 1 introduction the world is confronted with limited water resources and food safety and the agricultural sector is mainly under pressure around the world because of an increase in demand climate change and frequent droughts misra 2014 in line with this ethiopia has continuously been affected by frequent droughts and induced food insecurity the ethiopian government has responded to this drought and famine through the construction of small medium and large scale irrigation schemes awulachew et al 2005 irrigation development is regarded as the best alternative in the country for reliable and sustainable food security income generation and livelihood improvement awulachew et al 2007 however the irrigation system in ethiopia has remained to be traditional and the performances of the traditional surface irrigation schemes are very low due to poor irrigation water management and agricultural extension efficient and well managed irrigation water practice including quantifying the

impact of irrigation on groundwater depth in the study area the sources of groundwater recharge were irrigation drainage canals night storage reservoirs and rainfall in the rainy season groundwater levels at irrigated and non irrigated fields were monitored to explore the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge water table depth measurements showed that the maximum mean water table depth of 6 02 m was recorded in november 2019 while the lowest mean water table depth of 2 53 m was recorded in september 2019 from wells located in the irrigated field irrigation activities in the study area started in mid november and continued to the end of may the temporal analysis of the mean water table in the irrigated field showed that a drop in the water table was observed from september to december in 2019 but raised after december and continued to rise until the end of february 2020 fig 3 similarly the change in water table depth which was estimated as the difference between the averages of two consecutive months difference of current month and previous month water table depths in the irrigated field showed a declining trend starting from september to december negative sign but a rise positive sign from december to the end of february for instance the water table depth of w21 in september was 2 81 m while it was 3 58 m in october which is equivalent to a reduction change in water table of 0 77 m related to the previous month table 2 in the irrigated land the water table slightly declined at the end of february fig 3 probably this is related to the high

wells w11 w12 w13 and w14 were 3 83 m 3 77 m 7 30 m and 3 68 m respectively table 3 the higher drop of the water table was observed in w13 while the lower drop was found in w14 since w14 is located near to the natural drainage than well w13 fig 1 this study revealed that irrigation has its recognizable contribution to the groundwater recharge in the irrigated field the contribution of irrigation activity to the water table varied from 0 77 m to 0 52 m rise of the water table after the beginning of irrigation operation table 2 3 2 impact of rainfall on water table depth the annual rainfall of the area in the study period 2019 20 was 1985 9 mm fig 2 mostly the irrigation activity in koga irrigation scheme starts in mid november and irrigation activities continue until the end of may the water table depth analysis showed a drop in the water table september to the end of february in the non irrigated field while it starts to rise after december in the irrigated field bouwer 1987 also found that shallow wells rapidly respond to water table rise as the percolation time of water from irrigated fields to groundwater increases with increasing depth to groundwater the result revealed that the impact of rainfall on both locations irrigated and non irrigated fields showed non substantial initiation for the rise of the water table during the study months september to end of february fig 5 as indicated in fig 2 the amount of rainfall in this period is about 200 mm likewise referring to the project study document macdonald 2006 the irrigation water that is applied to the irrigation fields amounts to 465 mm this shows that the irrigation water applied is far more than the rainfall and comparatively the rainfall has far less impact on the water table than irrigation in this period this means that the contribution of irrigation to the water table rise was higher than rainfall during the study period similar studies showed that the recharge of groundwater is influenced by applied irrigation amount groundwater table depth seasonal temperature variations irrigation application efficiency and crop growth stages abera et al 2019 3 3 spatial and temporal variation of water table depth the spatial variation of water table depth wtd has been analyzed using arc gis and the map has been established from the average values of the wtd the result showed that the mean water table depth has reached up to 3 1 m downstream in the north and up to 7 9 m at the middle of the command area on the other hand it has reached up to 18 m 20 m upstream in the south of the irrigation command area fig 6 the temporal mean wtd response of 10 sampled wells in the study area was mapped in september end of rainy season february mid of irrigation season and the average of the monitoring period sep 2019 feb 2020 from the map the wtd varied from 2 5 to 3 6 m september and from 2 5 to 4 6 m february at the north of the study site figs 7 and 8 on the southern part the wtd varied from 7 1 to 9 2 m in september and from 10 8 to 12 9 m in february figs 7 and 8 generally the wtd of the area has high spatial and temporal variability the northern part of the irrigation scheme has relatively shallow groundwater depth whereas the southeastern part is relatively deeper which is in line with the topographic feature fig 9 and the stream network towards the surface water flow direction fig 1 of the study area this result revealed that the water table depth of the study area shows spatial variations similar studies at the koga irrigation scheme showed that the water table reached the surface in the north viksten 2016 the topographical condition of the sampling area and the distance of the wells to drainage ditches have been attributed to this variation the depth of the groundwater table fluctuates seasonally and annually in response to a variation of precipitation climate change rate of irrigation and pumping conditions dinka et al 2013 it is also affected by external factors climate and human activities and is often a hydrological indicator of the state of the ecology of the region dinka et al 2013 3 4 impact of irrigation on groundwater quality in the study area farmers use urea dap diammonium phosphate nps b nitrogen phosphorous sulfur boron blended fertilizer insecticides and pesticides for the production of different field crops therefore these elements can be the source for pollution of the groundwater in addition to the natural source the groundwater quality analysis results sampled from the irrigated and non irrigated field are represented in tables 4 and 5 the result showed that the concentration of phosphate potassium and calcium were higher in the non irrigated field than in the irrigated field the concentration of calcium in the irrigated land was much smaller than in the non irrigated field the geological nature and source of calcium must be at the base of this variation the concentration of nitrate sulfate and magnesium in the groundwater showed that a higher concentration was observed in the irrigated field compared to the non irrigated field one tailed paired t test statistics were conducted to analyze the impact of irrigation activity on groundwater quality for no3 po4 3 so4 2 k ca2 mg2 and ph levels before the test the data were checked for normal distribution and similar assumptions using shapiro wilk test the normality test shows that the data follows a normal distribution hence the one tailed paired t test shows that the mean concentration of all nutrients has no significant difference α 5 between irrigated and non irrigated fields table 6 this phenomenon may come from the sampling period perception of farmers to use fertilizer solubility nature of the fertilizer and other factors therefore it is not allowed to conclude that the concentration of nitrate and other parameters are higher in the irrigated field than in non irrigated land as the concentration of this nutrient may vary due to spatial temporal conditions the natural process and the amount of fertilizer applied in the area in line with our study enyew 2019 reported that the mean concentration january to december of nitrate in the groundwater at koga irrigation scheme was higher in the irrigated field 2 47 mg l 1 than in the non irrigated field 1 72 mg l 1 the previous studies at the koga irrigation scheme show wells located in the non irrigated field have a higher concentration of phosphate 1 87 mg l 1 than wells located in the irrigated field 1 68 mg l 1 enyew 2019 eriksson 2012 reported that the concentration of nitrate was 0 012 mg l 1 while phosphate was 0 54 mg l 1 in the groundwater at the koga irrigation scheme the concentration of sulfate in the groundwater was 3 37 mg l 1 horgby and larson 2013 this result revealed that irrigation activity does not affect the concentration of nitrate phosphate potassium and calcium in the study area complete chemistry of the irrigation water was not analyzed in this study however a few samples were taken from the source irrigation water to check the concentration of nitrate phosphate and sulfate in the surface water the concentration of these parameters was 2 9 mg l 1 1 0 mg l 1 and 44 0 mg l 1 respectively densaw et al 2016 found that the concentration of nitrate phosphate and sulfate of koga irrigation water source was 1 7 mg l 1 1 8 mg l 1 and 53 0 mg l 1 respectively the results revealed that the concentration of these parameters was relatively high in the irrigation water than in the groundwater only three parameters were analyzed for the irrigation water in this study which may not give a full picture of the quality of the irrigation water and hence it is important to highlight those foreseen studies in the area need to consider the full chemistry of the irrigation water for a better understanding of the influence of irrigated water on the groundwater of the area generally farmers in the study area apply fertilizers pesticides and insecticides and consequently the reservoir water that is being used for irrigation is expected to have different chemical constituents that would be expected to show up in the groundwater the concentration of nitrate during the rainy season is greater than the dry season due to the draining of domestic sewerage and agricultural runoff oljira 2015 therefore the sampling period is affected by the movement of nutrients in the soil media and subsoil to reach the groundwater table generally these studies showed that the quality of the water is good and falls within the who limits for drinking water purposes who 2004 4 conclusion this study presents the impact of surface water irrigation system on groundwater recharge and quality in the koga irrigation project in northwest ethiopia the groundwater monitoring analysis showed that a rise of the water table in the irrigated field was observed while a decline of the water table in the non irrigated field was observed during the study periods from september to february the effect of irrigation water on the water table depth resulted in a rise of the water table with a range of 0 52 m 0 77 m after the beginning of irrigation there was a high spatial and temporal variation of water table depth during the study periods the concentration of nitrate sulfate and magnesium showed that wells located inside the irrigated fields have a higher concentration than wells located in the non irrigated land however the mean concentration of all nutrients has no significant difference α 5 between irrigated and non irrigated fields table 6 besides the quality of these nutrients in the groundwater was within the world health organization limit for drinking water purposes this indicates that irrigation activity in this study has an identifiable contribution to the groundwater recharge but it had no substantial effect on the quality of groundwater in the scheme during this study period the raised water table depth in the irrigated field indicated that there was an excess application of irrigation water in the study area further studies would be needed to obtain full data on the seasonal impact of irrigation on groundwater quality in
