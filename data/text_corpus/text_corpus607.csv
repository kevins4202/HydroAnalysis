3035,thermal conditions such as stratification and mixing characteristics are important for water quality and ecology in lakes and reservoirs the prevailing strong stratification is a major factor contributing to global algal blooms underscoring the need to understand the thermal regime and driving mechanisms the thermal conditions of riverine canyon type reservoirs and tributaries are distinct from those of other districts and hydrological connectivity and meteorological forcing play an important role in stratification and mixing to test this concept and analyse how hydrological and meteorological conditions affect the thermal regime of xiangxi bay xxb one of the largest tributaries at the head of the three gorges reservoir tgr in china we conducted approximately one year of field monitoring the results indicate that xxb is a typical subtropical continuous warm polymictic water body affected by the regulation of the tgr the water level of xxb fluctuated up to 30 m the stratification started in march and reached its maximum during the flood season with reservoir storage in september the stratified structure gradually collapsed the combination of lower water level increased shortwave radiation sw and warmer air temperature at enhanced the stratification intensity n vertical mixing produced by meteorological forcing was limited turbulent mixing in the near surface was dominated by the convection velocity w rather than the frictional velocity u w and high wind speeds enhanced the convection effect during the heating period the peak u w lagged behind w by approximately 3 h and near surface stratification suppressed wind induced turbulence in addition no temporal heterogeneity was observed during the cooling period the heat budget was mainly controlled by the intrusive discharge of the mainstream of the tgr and the annual water level fluctuation was the main factor affecting the heat imbalance δ q t δ q m however in the near surface of the water column heat distribution indicator mld was mainly dominated by the water air heat flux q net r 0 833 p 0 01 n 323 and the difference in the cooling rate between the mainstream of the tgr and xxb induced a diurnal heat imbalance the results of this study the first long term muti parameter field monitoring effort in xxb provide new insights into the thermal regime of riverine reservoirs and their influencing factors while offering a thermodynamic perspective on eutrophication and algal blooms in reservoir tributaries keywords three gorges reservoir thermal and mixing regime meteorological and hydrological conditions heat budget 1 introduction with the continuous development of the social economy the global environment on which human beings depend is undergoing unprecedented challenges the interaction of the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere under climate change has become a research hot spot for scientists abdollahi et al 2021 ostad ali askari 2022 ostad ali askari and shayan 2021 thermal regimes of the hydrosphere such as the water temperature structure stratification and mixing control water quality and material cycling in ecosystems barrett et al 2018 fatahi nafchi et al 2021 li et al 2018 the stratification and mixing of the water column are important physical processes in lakes and reservoirs jones et al 2008 and vertical mixing affects processes such as the exchange of vertical substances klump et al 2010 lu and li 2014 phytoplankton growth macintyre 1993 wu et al 2019 gas exchange at the water air interface engle and melack 2000 and the spatial distribution of the fish community in addition the changed thermal state of lakes and reservoirs affects the vertical distribution of local water temperatures and the downstream riverbed and ecological environment due to changes in the temperature of outflow caused by the discharge mode of sluices and dams long et al 2019a nafchi et al 2021 nafchi et al 2022 with climate change and increased human activity the occurrence of thermal extremes will increase and water stratification will continue to intensify in the future javadinejad et al 2021 ostad ali askari et al 2019 woolway et al 2021 in the context of global warming the thermal regime of lakes and reservoirs has received considerable attention many factors influence the thermal conditions of the water column first the geographical and morphological characteristics of water bodies largely determine their stratification and mixing processes and strong diurnal stratification is universal in tropical lakes macintyre et al 2002 a stable thermocline may form in lakes with a water depth greater than 6 m augusto silva et al 2019 and a seasonal thermocline can be observed in subtropical and even arctic lakes saber et al 2020 shallow lakes show less seasonal variation in the stratification intensity and more intense short term stratification and mixing yang et al 2018b second the thermal regimes of lakes and reservoirs are closely related to meteorological forcing early studies suggested that the input and output of thermal budget were mainly governed by the shortwave radiation longwave radiation latent heat flux and sensible heat flux of the water air interface james and kerfoot 2007 lorenzzetti et al 2015 many one dimensional vertical models that are based on this assumption have been successfully applied to lakes momii and ito 2008 spence et al 2003 third for lakes or reservoirs with inflows and outflows meteorological forcing is no longer the only heat source xie xie et al 2018 found that the temperature change converted from heat flux was less than the actual temperature change in canyon type reservoirs implying a heat imbalance in addition for reservoirs with tributary confluence the difference in the water temperature of the tributary and that of the mainstream of the reservoir is another source of heat råman vinnå et al 2018 xing et al 2012 the water temperature of inflow affects reservoir dynamics ishikawa et al 2021 and for lakes with dominant inflows and outflows advective heat transport may account for a greater proportion of the heat balance compared to the net heat flux from meteorology xing et al 2012 the three gorges reservoir tgr has large discharge variations and water level fluctuations within each year and the reservoir tributaries occupy 1 3 of the surface area of the mainstream cheng et al 2018 previous studies on the tgr have mainly focused on the intrusion modes between the mainstream and the tributaries e g overflow interflow and underflow and their impacts on eutrophication and algal blooms long et al 2019b xu et al 2021 only a few studies have assessed the changes in the local and downstream water temperatures and heat budget caused by the construction of dams tao et al 2020 and most studies have not considered the effects of the heat budget on stratification and mixing both of which are vital for the growth and decline of microalgae due to the limitations of waterway regulation and long term data the heat budget and its role in the long term evolution of water temperatures have not been studied the purposes of this paper are 1 to analyse the evolution of thermal regimes of xxb under changes in meteorology and hydrology 2 to identify the factors that dominate the near surface vertical mixing of xxb and its influencing mechanism and 3 to calculate the change in the heat budget of xxb under the action of hydrological connectivity and analyse the possible reasons of heat imbalance the results of this study provide new insights into the thermal regime of riverine reservoirs and their influencing factors while offering a thermodynamic perspective on eutrophication and algal blooms in reservoir tributaries 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site xxb is the first major tributary of the upper reach of the tgr fig 1 b c with a watershed area of 3099 km2 and a mainstream length of 94 km xxb originates in the shennongjia forest region in northwestern hubei province and flows southwards through xingshan and zigui counties and then empties into the tgr in the town of xiangxi 32 km from the three gorges dam tgd during the flood season from june to august the discharge of the tgr increases and a relatively low water level is maintained to reserve the flood storage capacity during the dry season from october to february the discharge of the tgr gradually decreases and the water level is raised the annual water level fluctuation of the tgr forms a permanent backwater area in xxb from the town of gaoyang to the confluence of xxb and the tgr li et al 2022 as shown in fig 1 c and the unique intrusive mode of the density current affects the temperature and hydrodynamic situation of xxb ji et al 2017 this study was mainly based on a field monitoring platform in the middle reach of the xxb fig 1 c s2 represents the overall situation of xxb where the water depth rises and falls between 19 and 49 m throughout the year and the flow conditions are relatively stable compared to the mainstream of the tgr 2 2 field measurements due to reservoir regulations xxb experiences large water level fluctuations every year to obtain a more complete profile of the water temperature the vertical thermal structure of xxb was measured at s2 using two temperature chains the first chain was deployed from the top surface layer and the second was deployed from the bay bottom with a sampling interval of 5 s for both the upstream inflow temperature of xxb and the temperature of the mainstream of the tgr were recorded at s1 and s3 respectively details on the deployment of the thermistor are shown in table 1 and the surface water temperature swt is obtained from the thermistor at 0 m a depth sensor rbr solo3d rbr canada was deployed at the bay bottom to correct the water depth of each thermistor based on its relative position and the water temperature data at s2 were averaged into 1 h interval for subsequent calculations air temperature at shortwave radiation sw wind speed ws air pressure ap relative humidity rh and rainfall rf data were provided by the national basic weather station in xingshan county upstream water level and flow discharge data were obtained from the official website of the bureau of water resources and lakes of yichang https shj yichang gov cn while water level and flow discharge data for the mainstream of the tgr were obtained from the official website of the china three gorges corporation https www ctg com cn both types of hydrological data were recorded four times per day 2 00 8 00 14 00 and 20 00 underwater radiation was measured at s2 at 10 00 am each day using a zds 10 w 1d photometric sensor the sensor was slowly lowered from the top layer at 0 5 m intervals until the real time data were less than or equal to 1 of the top layer data and the linear relationship between radiation intensity and water depth was interpolated to obtain the euphotic depth at which 1 of the data were located 2 3 heat fluxes and thermal parameters the surface heat flux balance is one of the most dominant physical processes controlling near surface mixing dynamics henderson sellers 1986 all heat formulas were positive for heat absorption by the water column which was calculated as follows woolway et al 2015 q net q swnet q l w n e t q h q e where q swnet and q l w n e t are the net shortwave and net longwave heat fluxes w m2 respectively q h is the sensitive heat flux w m2 and q e is the latent heat flux w m2 the amount of shortwave radiation that penetrates the water after reflection at the water surface is given by q swnet q sw 1 α sw where q sw is the measured incoming shortwave radiation w m2 and α sw is the shortwave albedo which is estimated from fresnel s equation woolway et al 2015 approximately 55 of the net shortwave heat flux is absorbed directly within the top 1 m of the water column and the remaining radiation decays underwater along the depth following beers law i z 1 55 q swnet e k d z cortés and macintyre 2020 where k d is the diffuse attenuation coefficient of water when the underwater light intensity

heat capacity of water t z t is the temperature of the specific thermometer corresponding to time t δ t t 2 t 1 is the time interval and a 6 h moving average was used as a low pass filter the depth of light penetration in xxb varied relatively little during the year compared to the water depth 7 26 2 90 m the light penetration layer was shallower in summer due to flooding and algal blooms li et al 2021 and deeper in winter but all values were generally within 14 m indicating that δ q m did not directly affect the water column below 14 m throughout the year the buoyancy frequency n which indicates the stability and stratification intensity of the water column was calculated as follows n 3600 2 π g ρ 0 d ρ dz 1 2 where g is the gravity acceleration ρ 0 is the mean density of the profile and ρ is the water density at water level z the unit of the buoyancy frequency is circles per hour cph and negative values which characterize unstable states were replaced by 0 cph n 2 5 10 5 and 5 10 4 s 2 n 4 05 and 12 81 in cph unit were extensively used as the thresholds between well mixed conditions weak stratification and strong stratification yang et al 2012 the water level where the buoyancy frequency is located was taken as the average of the water levels of the adjacent probes in addition the mixed layer depth mld was defined as the layer with a 0 5 difference from the surface water temperature 2 4 turbulence scales based on the assumption that the wind shear stress is equal on both sides of the water air interface augusto silva et al 2019 the shear stress was calculated as follows τ ρ a c d u z 2 ρ a u 2 ρ w u w 2 where c d is the neutral transfer coefficient 1 0 10 3 u is the air side friction velocity and u w is the water side friction velocity the

hydrological conditions and the temperature profile in xxb the meteorological hydrological and water temperature conditions of xxb from 20 march 2019 to 1 march 2020 are shown in fig 2 both the air temperature at and the surface water temperature swt showed obvious diurnal characteristics compared with the swt the at fluctuated more on the diurnal scale swt 20 96 4 83 at 18 15 8 57 specifically from march to late september 2019 the daytime at was generally greater than the swt while the night time at was lower than the swt from october 2019 to march 2020 the swt gradually decreased and the diurnal variation became less pronounced additionally the at was generally lower than the swt fig 2 a as an important component of heat exchange changes in the water air temperature difference significantly affect the heat budget over the entire monitoring period ws did not show significant seasonal characteristics but during the daily cycle the mornings and nights were generally breezy with an average wind speed of 1 27 0 97 m s while high winds prevailed in the afternoon with an average value of 2 21 1 65 m s and a maximum value of up to 11 1 m s 2 august 2019 15 00 seen in fig s1 the hydrological conditions of the tgr were markedly seasonal fig 2 c and the water level fluctuated by up to 30 m throughout the year the water level of the tgr varied frequently during the flood period june august the maximum difference in the water level was more than 10 m from 18 july to 8 august 2019 while the water level rose rapidly and returned to its maximum state 175 m after the impounding period september october due to an increased net flow discharge xxb was found to be a double mixed type of water body i e complete water mixing occurred twice a year february march and november significant diurnal stratification was observed especially from mid august to mid september 2019 and the diurnal mixed layer depth mld was approximately 10 m stratification began in march 2019 and the intensity of near surface stratification reached 15 cph accompanied by a gradual increase in the intensity of stratification in the upper layer as the water level dropped during the regressing period january may the water level varied frequently during the flood period which promoted water mixing to some extent but stratification still reached its strongest intensity approximately 80 cph after the impounding period with the water level rising and the temperature continuing to decrease the amount of water mixing strengthened the water temperature tended to be identical and the vertical stratification structure gradually collapsed moreover from may to october 2019 a lower temperature was evident at the bottom of xxb and stratification persisted by comparing the water temperature upstream s1 midstream s2 and downstream s3 of xxb a lower temperature inflow upstream led to strong stratification at the bottom of s2 seen in fig s2 resulting in a unique double thermocline structure in the vertical profile the intensity of stratification in the bottom boundary layer ranged from 5 62 to 20 50 cph 3 2 heat fluxes at the water air interface various components of the water air heat fluxes were estimated as shown in fig 3 throughout the monitoring period q swnet was 127 49 189 40 w m2 which was the main source of heating within the water column and significant seasonal differences were observed for example q swnet was greater in spring and summer than in autumn and winter the heat loss at the water air interface was mainly composed of two components q e and q h where q e was negative throughout most of the monitoring period and peaked in the summer and autumn the mean values were 42 31 52 28 w m2 and 52 28 52 28 w m2 respectively after september the heat loss contributed by q lwnet increased and gradually predominated the heat loss during the autumn and winter fig 3 a q ef showed the same trend as q net and the specific seasonal variations are shown in table 2 overall the daily averaged q net demonstrated heat absorption from 20 march to 16 september 2019 while after 16 september 2019 q net gradually shifted into heat loss with a negative increase in q e and q h based on the temporal evolution of q net the entire period was divided into a heating period and a cooling period for the convenience of description and the boundary was set on 16 september 3 3 turbulent fluxes and turbulence velocity the turbulent velocity u w and w turbulent kinetic energy flux fq and active mixed layer depth amld at the water air interface are shown in fig 4 the water friction velocity u w and convective velocity w exhibited significant diurnal cycle characteristics throughout the monitoring period in general u w was generally stronger than w during the daytime while w was absolutely dominant at night during the heating and cooling periods the variation characteristics were also different during the heating period u w and w were 0 19 0 14 cm s and 0 13 0 18 cm s respectively u w changed with the wind speed u w gradually increased starting around midday peaking in the afternoon during windy periods while w gradually increased at night peaking in the early dawn the convective effect of the water column was usually the strongest at 6 00 am fig 4 a in addition during high wind periods in the afternoon w increased gradually in response to the increasing u w but a lag of approximately 3 h was observed u w was comparable to w during the night while w was approximately twice as large as u w in the early morning from 1 00 am to 7 00 am during the cooling period u w and w were 0 16 0 14 cm s and 0 62 0 4 cm s respectively compared to the heating period and w was significantly enhanced averaging approximately 3 8 times u w w was always greater than 0 08 cm s within the confidence interval indicating that the water column was in a persistent convective mixing state during the cooling period during the daytime the mean w increased rapidly with the increasing u w between 12 00 and 16 00 r 0 83 p 0 01 and the increase in the wind speed promoted a significant overturning of the water column w was still stronger in the early morning and during the night than during the daytime u w was smaller than at the same time during the heating period and had fewer diurnal fluctuations fig 4 b by means of categorical statistics fq was decomposed into two components the flux induced by the wind stress fq wind and that induced by the penetrated convection fq conv the linear relationship between fq conv and amld was clearly good in both the heating and the cooling periods heating period r2 0 48 p 0 01 cooling period r2 0 76 p 0 01 and the relationship was stronger in the cooling period the turbulent kinetic energy introduced by convection explained the variation in amld well in both the summer stratified state and the mixed state u w however did not show a satisfactory linear correlation with the mixed layer depth heating period r2 0 03 p 0 01 cooling period r2 0 00 p 0 01 u w was not significantly enhanced or diminished as the water column shifted from the heating period to the cooling period and it maintained its usual characteristics of a diurnal pattern the temporal heterogeneity of w and u w showed that in the afternoon when there was strong stratification the wind speed was not high enough to promote the convection of near surface water and increase amld but it was different in the cooling period the intensity of stratification was weak and the increase in fq conv effectively promoted convection and increased amld in the cooling period 3 4 heat content the heat content and heat balance of the water column are shown in fig 5 the variation in the heat content of the water column throughout the entire period ranged from 1 65 109 4 30 109j m2 and the correlation between the heat content of the water column and the water level was significant r 0 83 p 0 01 during most of the time δ q t differed significantly from δ q m the difference between δ q t and δ q m represented the fact that the heat of the entire water column was imbalanced and the heat exchange from the water air interface accounted for only a small part of the total heat budget over the entire monitoring period an analysis of the linear regression between the longitudinal heat transport δ q t δ q m and the water level fluctuations fig 6 showed that longitudinal heat transport was closely related to the water level fluctuations with an r2 of 0 74 indicating that longitudinal heat transport dominated the heat budget 3 5 heat balance in the near surface water column with the understanding that changes in the seasonal water level regulate the heat changes in xxb we explored the heat balance characteristics of the near surface water column the selected time period was the transition between the heating period and the cooling period changes in the water level and temperature were obvious and the euphotic depth was relatively stable not more than 8 m not shown the mean water temperature in the mainstream of the tgr during this period was consistently lower than the mean water temperature in the tributary fig s3 and the change in the water level of the tgr was mainly influenced by the increased inflow which fluctuate between 145 52 and 162 m fig 7 a the average heat budget δ q t in the upper water column 8 m varied between 2 33 106 and 1 88 106 j m2 throughout the entire period and the average water air heat budget δ q m varied between 1 03 106 and 2 03 106 j m2 δ q t was slightly smaller than δ q m during the daytime as the water level rose δ q t became progressively smaller the water temperature stratification gradually weakened 16 september 28 september and the water temperatures in both the mainstream of the tgr and xxb showed differential cooling however due to the difference in the cooling rate δ t δ t tgr δ t δ t xxb between the mainstream of the tgr and xxb the δ t δ t value of the mainstream was lower than that of xxb during the daytime and the difference in the averaged water temperature t tgr t xxb between the mainstream of the tgr and xxb decreased at night δ t δ t tgr was higher than that of xxb and t tgr t xxb increased the heat loss in the water column was greater at night than during the day resulting in a greater difference between δ q t and δ q m the largest difference occurred on 17 august at 2 15 106 j m2 after 16 september the difference in δ t δ t tgr δ t δ t xxb and t tgr t xxb gradually decreased leading to a further decrease in δ q t the large difference in the amount of change in δ q t and δ q m under scenarios 1 and 2 is notable resulting in a pattern that was different from that of the other days in scenario 1 from 27 to 29 august the upstream water temperature decreased from 24 01 c to 19 28 c and the discharge of the upstream of xxb increased to 68 60 m3 s the averaged value was only 28 58 m3 s resulting in a well mixed state in s2 in addition δ q t was significantly smaller than δ q m in scenario 2 from 14 to 21 september the water level of the tgr continued to rise accompanied by a decrease in the water temperature in the upper reaches of xxb the water temperature and the intensity of stratification in xxb decreased rapidly and δ q t was significantly smaller than δ q m as in scenarios 1 fig 7 d in general scenario 1 occurred less frequently within a year reflecting the impact of small upstream floods but the upstream runoff form of xxb was still dominated by cold underflow long et al 2019b scenario 2 generally occurred when the runoff of the watershed increased at this time the water level of the tgr rose significantly which promoted an increase in the cold inflow in the upstream of xxb 3 6 relationships between various background factors and n previous studies have shown that the meteorological and hydrological conditions in xxb affect the stratification of the water column in different seasons liu et al 2012 to further determine the key factors in xxb on an intra annual scale we selected a series of potentially important factors for linear regression analysis with the mean buoyancy frequency n of the entire water column the results are shown in fig 8 the stratification intensity of xxb underwent a complete transition from mixing to strong stratification state and back to a mixing state within one year ultimately the water level r2 0 59 p 0 01 n 8132 upstream water temperature r2 0 56 p 0 01 n 7819 and at r2 0 65 p 0 01 n 8187 were the key parameters that significantly influenced the thermal regime of xxb indicating that the mixing and stratification of xxb were influenced by both meteorological and hydrological conditions it is worth noting that δ q m q net and the mainstream water temperature were also significantly correlated with n but the r2 values were low at 0 19 0 16 and 0 21 respectively δ q t and the wind speed had almost no effect on n some indicators are not listed because they did not correlate with n and were not considered statistically significant 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of the thermal regime and its influencing factors in xxb the reservoir thermal regime is an important indicator of the water environment and affects the water quality of the reservoir as well as the downstream water ecology in previous studies the seasonal evolution of the water temperature in xxb has been widely cited as one of the main factors affecting algal growth liu et al 2012 yang et al 2018b this study was the first to investigate the complete high frequency water temperature in the tributary of the tgr and the results reveal additional diurnal details the tgr is a typical riverine deep water reservoir its mainstream velocity is rapid and the vertical water temperature structure is hardly significantly stratified long et al 2016 strong stratification is usually observed in the tributaries of the tgr due to weak hydrodynamics li et al 2020b according to lewis classification guidelines lewis 1996 the thermal regime can be classified as typical continuous warm polymictic with two complete vertical overturn events within a year thermal stratification in xxb began in late march 2019 and increased in intensity from spring to summer the flood period was the strongest period of water temperature stratification fig 2 e after mid september the mixing state of xxb intensified and the vertical structure tended to become homothermic a unique thermal regime was observed in xxb and strong stratification existed in the upper and benthic parts of the water column creating a double thermocline structure along the vertical profile for the stratification of the upper part especially during the flood season from 17 july to 21 august 2019 the stratification in the upper 8 m of the water column was consistently strong and the maximum n value exceeded 70 cph which is even higher than that in shallow tropical reservoirs araújo et al 2017 in addition to the enhanced q net the water exchange pattern between xxb and the mainstream of the tgr or the pathway of intrusion from the mainstream of the tgr which is driven by the thermal density current long et al 2019b may be another reason for this finding specifically during the flood season the water temperature of s3 was between the surface and bottom water temperatures of s2 fig s2 predictably the mainstream intruded into xxb in the form of upper interflow and the thin near surface layer of xxb was topped by this intrusive flow which inhibited vertical convection and thus created a long residence time and strong stratification in the near surface layer this forced stratification caused by backwater jacking has also been identified in another tributary tangxi river of the tgr li et al 2020a another stratification occurred at the bottom of xxb and was caused by the intrusion of low temperature water from upstream the upstream of xxb is fed by meltwater from the shennongjia forest area and the water temperature was lower year round seen in fig s1 the evolution of lake reservoir stratification whether due to thermal effects or environmental influences is a worthwhile research focus in xxb even if mld did not extend to the entire water column most of the time incomplete vertical mixing diurnal stratification and thermal regimes were controlled by heat transfer at the water air interface which is driven by meteorological factors compared to other subtropical reservoirs xxb showed even greater negative values in november and december approximately 50 w m2 ishikawa et al 2021 indicating a greater impact on heat loss and an overturn effect of the water column after reservoir impounding in addition the stratification duration of xxb was longer than that of deep high altitude dimictic lakes at the same latitude wang et al 2020 and approximately 2 months longer than that of subtropical reservoirs at the same latitude liu et al 2018 these differences in the thermal regime are mainly controlled by different influencing factors specifically the thermal regime and energy balance of the water column are influenced by the lake morphology rahaghi et al 2019 and the lake size and evaporation play a dominant role in the heat distribution lei et al 2021 oswald and rouse 2004 however in riverine reservoirs such as the tgr where lateral heat exchange is often neglected due to excessive aspect ratios the two main factors throughflow along the channel density current intrusion and water air heat fluxes play an important role in the total heat balance and the advective heat exchange induced by hydrological connectivity is a nonnegligible source of heat fig 9 these two factors are discussed further below 4 2 stratification and mixing characteristics within the near surface water column under diurnal meteorological variation the intensity of stratification in the near surface water column was strongly linked to meteorological conditions the seasonal and diurnal mld values of xxb were significantly influenced by the water air heat flux q net r 0 833 p 0 01 n 323 as with other tributaries of riverine canyon type reservoirs however the mixing effect was limited during the daytime especially during the heating period and mld did not extend throughout the entire water column 4 33 3 60 m therefore this part mainly centered on the near surface water column above the euphotic layer on a diurnal scale the heat flux gradually increased from the morning onwards in xxb and the gentle breeze and gradually increasing q sw caused the heat to accumulate in the surface layer ws generally peaked in the afternoon and the prevailing high wind promoted the transfer of heat deeper into the water column increasing the buoyancy of the near surface water column after the evening the temperature difference between the water and the air increased the heat flux changed from positive to negative and the water column began to lose stability with cooler surface water sinking down and causing vertical mixing bouffard and wüest 2018 wind events are often key drivers of the shift from a stratified to an unstable state of the water column coogan et al 2020 mi et al 2018 a high ws also drove the lake circulation mccombs et al 2014 however in xxb wind driven turbulence was dominant during the daytime but produced a limited cooling effect to counteract strong stratification fig 4 a squalls at night promoted vertical mixing in the water column but the convection velocity w was stronger during the heat loss process averaging twice the water friction velocity u w during the cooling period fig 4 b which is more common in riverine canyon type reservoirs vidal et al 2010 the temporal variability of the peaks between u w the daily pattern of wind and w resulted in these two main physical driving mechanisms playing different roles in the near surface heat distribution which is why the turbulent kinetic flux represented by the wind stress had little to do with changes in amld for both the heating and the cooling periods fig 4 c d in addition due to the temporal heterogeneity of the peaks u w and w the effect of the wind speed may depend on the stratification strength we attempted to summarize the role of the wind stress in the stratification and mixing process using fig 10 the widely recognized threshold line for stratification and mixing delineated the buoyancy frequency n and the fluxes of turbulent kinetic energy f q into three parts in region ⅰ the near surface water column was in a completely mixed state and f q increased with the wind speed in contrast in region iii as the stratification of the water column intensified f q hardly exceeded 2 106 m3 s3 despite the high wind stress values indicating that in a strongly stratified state during the daytime the stratification could not be counteracted despite the increased weight of the wind stress in the context of general stratification turbulence generated by wind stress received extensive suppression pernica et al 2014 in contrast to wind stress convection due to water air temperature differences may be the key to heat loss in the water column 4 3 advective heat transport between xxb and the mainstream of the tgr as one of the largest tributaries at the head of the tgr the water exchange and energy transfer process between xxb and the mainstream of the tgr was strongly influenced by flow discharge and water level regulation corresponding to the mainstream of the tgr the water level fluctuated by up to 30 m in xxb throughout the year in addition no statistically significant effect of the stratification intensity n on δ q m or q net was observed fig 8 b d r2 0 19 and 0 16 respectively however in shallow lakes due to almost no extra discharge mld is strictly affected by the wind speed and solar radiation yang et al 2018 indicating that the factors influencing the vertical mixing of the water column were not only from meteorological aspects different flow paths formed a variety of unique flow circulation patterns in xxb long et al 2019b and the influence of the longitudinal flow between the upstream and downstream the mainstream of the tgr on the thermal stratification and mixing regime cannot be ignored the fluctuation of the water level affected the change in the water volume and heat in xxb causing a long term imbalance in the net heat balance δ q t of the entire water column and δ q m for example a 2 5 m rise in the water level during the impoundment period increased the average daily δ q t by 9 17 106 j m2 fig 5 b the main reason was that the water level varied frequently and the rising water level led to a rapid increase in the water volume of xxb in contrast when the water level decreased a decrease in the water volume caused a decrease in the heat content in a study of the heat content of another tributary of the tgr meixi river cheng cheng et al 2018 found that the influence from the mainstream dominated the heat balance of the tributary and the heat from the fluctuations in the water level even exceeded 70 of the heat budget of the tributary in reservoirs with significant seasonal daily scale water level regulations temperature changes and metalimnetic deepening rates are significantly influenced by flow discharge andrés stated that due to the nonsignificant intra annual differences in the atmospheric heating rate river inflows affect reservoir temperature changes and the heat balance more strongly than atmospheric forcing posada bedoya et al 2021 furthermore our results show that after stripping the influence of water level variations on the heat content the qt and qm values within the euphotic layer were unequal which meant that the difference in the cooling rate δ t δ t between xxb and the tgr exerted an effect on the heat imbalance during the transition of the heating and cooling periods second the influence from the upstream of xxb also changed the benthic thermal regime the upwards entrainment by the near bottom cold flow was another possible factor altering the water temperature structure and heat balance of the water column augusto silva et al 2019 xing et al 2012 however the upstream inflow was much less than the mainstream runoff of the tgr not shown 28 58 22 86 m3 s in the entire water column changes in the water level were the key factor leading to the heat imbalance qt q m of xxb even though a more detailed analysis of the along stream heat change was not carried out in this study our results still show that the δ t or δ t δ t values and the water level variation introduced by reservoir regulations changed the heat balance in xxb when additional heat input is available e g rainfall flooding the magnitudes of δ q m and δ q t will differ significantly δ t was also usually unequal seasonally due to differences in the volume and heat capacity specifically when the water temperature in the mainstem was greater than that in xxb xxb was thermally supplied by the mainstream which usually occurred in winter as shown in fig 2 d where the air temperature was consistently lower but the water temperature was consistently higher than the air temperature as a result of the thermal supplementation of the water temperature in xxb by the mainstream fig s3 similarly in the mixing zone shown in fig 10 a higher wind speed and a lower f q were observed in this period indicating that at this stage with a large volume of mainstream water being pumped into xxb the water temperature variation in xxb was dominated by the mainstream water temperature rather than the vertical heat transfer from meteorological forcing in contrast in summer the water temperature in the mainstream was lower than that in xxb and water exchange between the mainstream and xxb was achieved through density currents induced by temperature differences which were mostly overflow in winter and upper interflow in summer ji et al 2017 xu et al 2021 in addition the interflow enhanced the stratification of the tributary fig 2 d previous studies have mostly focused on lakes reservoirs without external inflow araújo et al 2017 lei et al 2021 and the research on thermal stratification and its influencing factors for waters with large amounts of runoff and frequent regulations is inadequate in depth future research is necessary 5 conclusions this study assessed the characteristics of the thermal regime and their response patterns under the influence of hydrological and meteorological conditions in xxb from 2019 to 2020 identified the key processes affecting turbulent mixing in the near surface water column and the role played by the wind speed and analysed the influence of hydrological connectivity on the heat balance and the possible causes of heat imbalance in the water column the results indicate that xxb is a typical subtropical continuous warm polymictic water body that is affected by the regulation of the tgr the water level of xxb fluctuated by up to 30 m the stratification started in march and reached its maximum during the flood season with reservoir storage in september the stratified structure gradually collapsed the combination of a lower water level increased shortwave radiation sw and a warmer air temperature at enhanced the stratification intensity n vertical mixing produced by meteorological forcing was limited turbulent mixing in the near surface was dominated by convection velocity w rather than frictional velocity u w and high wind speeds enhanced the convection effect during the heating period the peak u w lagged behind w by approximately 3 h near surface stratification suppressed wind induced turbulence and no temporal heterogeneity was observed during the cooling period the heat budget was mainly controlled by the intrusive discharge of the mainstream of the tgr and water level fluctuation on an annual scale was the main factor of the heat imbalance δ q t δ q m however in the near surface of the water column the heat distribution indicator mld was mainly dominated by the water air heat flux q net r 0 833 p 0 01 n 323 and the difference in the cooling rate between the mainstream of the tgr and xxb induced a diurnal heat imbalance this study was the first long term muti parameter field monitoring effort in xxb the results provide new insights into the thermal regime of riverine reservoirs and their influencing factors

3035,thermal conditions such as stratification and mixing characteristics are important for water quality and ecology in lakes and reservoirs the prevailing strong stratification is a major factor contributing to global algal blooms underscoring the need to understand the thermal regime and driving mechanisms the thermal conditions of riverine canyon type reservoirs and tributaries are distinct from those of other districts and hydrological connectivity and meteorological forcing play an important role in stratification and mixing to test this concept and analyse how hydrological and meteorological conditions affect the thermal regime of xiangxi bay xxb one of the largest tributaries at the head of the three gorges reservoir tgr in china we conducted approximately one year of field monitoring the results indicate that xxb is a typical subtropical continuous warm polymictic water body affected by the regulation of the tgr the water level of xxb fluctuated up to 30 m the stratification started in march and reached its maximum during the flood season with reservoir storage in september the stratified structure gradually collapsed the combination of lower water level increased shortwave radiation sw and warmer air temperature at enhanced the stratification intensity n vertical mixing produced by meteorological forcing was limited turbulent mixing in the near surface was dominated by the convection velocity w rather than the frictional velocity u w and high wind speeds enhanced the convection effect during the heating period the peak u w lagged behind w by approximately 3 h and near surface stratification suppressed wind induced turbulence in addition no temporal heterogeneity was observed during the cooling period the heat budget was mainly controlled by the intrusive discharge of the mainstream of the tgr and the annual water level fluctuation was the main factor affecting the heat imbalance δ q t δ q m however in the near surface of the water column heat distribution indicator mld was mainly dominated by the water air heat flux q net r 0 833 p 0 01 n 323 and the difference in the cooling rate between the mainstream of the tgr and xxb induced a diurnal heat imbalance the results of this study the first long term muti parameter field monitoring effort in xxb provide new insights into the thermal regime of riverine reservoirs and their influencing factors while offering a thermodynamic perspective on eutrophication and algal blooms in reservoir tributaries keywords three gorges reservoir thermal and mixing regime meteorological and hydrological conditions heat budget 1 introduction with the continuous development of the social economy the global environment on which human beings depend is undergoing unprecedented challenges the interaction of the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere under climate change has become a research hot spot for scientists abdollahi et al 2021 ostad ali askari 2022 ostad ali askari and shayan 2021 thermal regimes of the hydrosphere such as the water temperature structure stratification and mixing control water quality and material cycling in ecosystems barrett et al 2018 fatahi nafchi et al 2021 li et al 2018 the stratification and mixing of the water column are important physical processes in lakes and reservoirs jones et al 2008 and vertical mixing affects processes such as the exchange of vertical substances klump et al 2010 lu and li 2014 phytoplankton growth macintyre 1993 wu et al 2019 gas exchange at the water air interface engle and melack 2000 and the spatial distribution of the fish community in addition the changed thermal state of lakes and reservoirs affects the vertical distribution of local water temperatures and the downstream riverbed and ecological environment due to changes in the temperature of outflow caused by the discharge mode of sluices and dams long et al 2019a nafchi et al 2021 nafchi et al 2022 with climate change and increased human activity the occurrence of thermal extremes will increase and water stratification will continue to intensify in the future javadinejad et al 2021 ostad ali askari et al 2019 woolway et al 2021 in the context of global warming the thermal regime of lakes and reservoirs has received considerable attention many factors influence the thermal conditions of the water column first the geographical and morphological characteristics of water bodies largely determine their stratification and mixing processes and strong diurnal stratification is universal in tropical lakes macintyre et al 2002 a stable thermocline may form in lakes with a water depth greater than 6 m augusto silva et al 2019 and a seasonal thermocline can be observed in subtropical and even arctic lakes saber et al 2020 shallow lakes show less seasonal variation in the stratification intensity and more intense short term stratification and mixing yang et al 2018b second the thermal regimes of lakes and reservoirs are closely related to meteorological forcing early studies suggested that the input and output of thermal budget were mainly governed by the shortwave radiation longwave radiation latent heat flux and sensible heat flux of the water air interface james and kerfoot 2007 lorenzzetti et al 2015 many one dimensional vertical models that are based on this assumption have been successfully applied to lakes momii and ito 2008 spence et al 2003 third for lakes or reservoirs with inflows and outflows meteorological forcing is no longer the only heat source xie xie et al 2018 found that the temperature change converted from heat flux was less than the actual temperature change in canyon type reservoirs implying a heat imbalance in addition for reservoirs with tributary confluence the difference in the water temperature of the tributary and that of the mainstream of the reservoir is another source of heat råman vinnå et al 2018 xing et al 2012 the water temperature of inflow affects reservoir dynamics ishikawa et al 2021 and for lakes with dominant inflows and outflows advective heat transport may account for a greater proportion of the heat balance compared to the net heat flux from meteorology xing et al 2012 the three gorges reservoir tgr has large discharge variations and water level fluctuations within each year and the reservoir tributaries occupy 1 3 of the surface area of the mainstream cheng et al 2018 previous studies on the tgr have mainly focused on the intrusion modes between the mainstream and the tributaries e g overflow interflow and underflow and their impacts on eutrophication and algal blooms long et al 2019b xu et al 2021 only a few studies have assessed the changes in the local and downstream water temperatures and heat budget caused by the construction of dams tao et al 2020 and most studies have not considered the effects of the heat budget on stratification and mixing both of which are vital for the growth and decline of microalgae due to the limitations of waterway regulation and long term data the heat budget and its role in the long term evolution of water temperatures have not been studied the purposes of this paper are 1 to analyse the evolution of thermal regimes of xxb under changes in meteorology and hydrology 2 to identify the factors that dominate the near surface vertical mixing of xxb and its influencing mechanism and 3 to calculate the change in the heat budget of xxb under the action of hydrological connectivity and analyse the possible reasons of heat imbalance the results of this study provide new insights into the thermal regime of riverine reservoirs and their influencing factors while offering a thermodynamic perspective on eutrophication and algal blooms in reservoir tributaries 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site xxb is the first major tributary of the upper reach of the tgr fig 1 b c with a watershed area of 3099 km2 and a mainstream length of 94 km xxb originates in the shennongjia forest region in northwestern hubei province and flows southwards through xingshan and zigui counties and then empties into the tgr in the town of xiangxi 32 km from the three gorges dam tgd during the flood season from june to august the discharge of the tgr increases and a relatively low water level is maintained to reserve the flood storage capacity during the dry season from october to february the discharge of the tgr gradually decreases and the water level is raised the annual water level fluctuation of the tgr forms a permanent backwater area in xxb from the town of gaoyang to the confluence of xxb and the tgr li et al 2022 as shown in fig 1 c and the unique intrusive mode of the density current affects the temperature and hydrodynamic situation of xxb ji et al 2017 this study was mainly based on a field monitoring platform in the middle reach of the xxb fig 1 c s2 represents the overall situation of xxb where the water depth rises and falls between 19 and 49 m throughout the year and the flow conditions are relatively stable compared to the mainstream of the tgr 2 2 field measurements due to reservoir regulations xxb experiences large water level fluctuations every year to obtain a more complete profile of the water temperature the vertical thermal structure of xxb was measured at s2 using two temperature chains the first chain was deployed from the top surface layer and the second was deployed from the bay bottom with a sampling interval of 5 s for both the upstream inflow temperature of xxb and the temperature of the mainstream of the tgr were recorded at s1 and s3 respectively details on the deployment of the thermistor are shown in table 1 and the surface water temperature swt is obtained from the thermistor at 0 m a depth sensor rbr solo3d rbr canada was deployed at the bay bottom to correct the water depth of each thermistor based on its relative position and the water temperature data at s2 were averaged into 1 h interval for subsequent calculations air temperature at shortwave radiation sw wind speed ws air pressure ap relative humidity rh and rainfall rf data were provided by the national basic weather station in xingshan county upstream water level and flow discharge data were obtained from the official website of the bureau of water resources and lakes of yichang https shj yichang gov cn while water level and flow discharge data for the mainstream of the tgr were obtained from the official website of the china three gorges corporation https www ctg com cn both types of hydrological data were recorded four times per day 2 00 8 00 14 00 and 20 00 underwater radiation was measured at s2 at 10 00 am each day using a zds 10 w 1d photometric sensor the sensor was slowly lowered from the top layer at 0 5 m intervals until the real time data were less than or equal to 1 of the top layer data and the linear relationship between radiation intensity and water depth was interpolated to obtain the euphotic depth at which 1 of the data were located 2 3 heat fluxes and thermal parameters the surface heat flux balance is one of the most dominant physical processes controlling near surface mixing dynamics henderson sellers 1986 all heat formulas were positive for heat absorption by the water column which was calculated as follows woolway et al 2015 q net q swnet q l w n e t q h

radiation that penetrates the water after reflection at the water surface is given by q swnet q sw 1 α sw where q sw is the measured incoming shortwave radiation w m2 and α sw is the shortwave albedo which is estimated from fresnel s equation woolway et al 2015 approximately 55 of the net shortwave heat flux is absorbed directly within the top 1 m of the water column and the remaining radiation decays underwater along the depth following beers law i z 1 55 q swnet e k d z cortés and macintyre 2020 where k d is the diffuse attenuation coefficient of water when the underwater light intensity

heat capacity of water t z t is the temperature of the specific thermometer corresponding to time t δ t t 2 t 1 is the time interval and a 6 h moving average was used as a low pass filter the depth of light penetration in xxb varied relatively little during the year compared to the water depth 7 26 2 90 m the light penetration layer was shallower in summer due to flooding and algal blooms li et al 2021 and deeper in winter but all values were generally within 14 m indicating that δ q m did not directly affect the water column below 14 m throughout the year the buoyancy frequency n which indicates the stability and stratification intensity of the water column was calculated as follows n 3600 2 π g ρ 0 d ρ dz 1 2 where g is the gravity acceleration ρ 0 is the mean density of the profile and ρ is the water density at water level z the unit of the buoyancy frequency is circles per hour cph and negative values which characterize unstable states were replaced by 0 cph n 2 5 10 5 and 5 10 4 s 2 n 4 05 and 12 81 in cph unit were extensively used as the thresholds between well mixed conditions weak stratification and strong stratification yang et al 2012 the water level where the buoyancy frequency is located was taken as the average of the water levels of the adjacent probes in addition the mixed layer depth mld was defined as the layer with a 0 5 difference from the surface water temperature 2 4 turbulence scales based on the assumption that the wind shear stress is equal on both sides of the water air interface augusto silva et al 2019 the shear stress was calculated as follows τ ρ a c d u z 2 ρ a u 2 ρ w u w 2 where c d is the neutral transfer coefficient 1 0 10 3 u is the air side friction velocity and u w is the water side friction velocity the

hydrological conditions and the temperature profile in xxb the meteorological hydrological and water temperature conditions of xxb from 20 march 2019 to 1 march 2020 are shown in fig 2 both the air temperature at and the surface water temperature swt showed obvious diurnal characteristics compared with the swt the at fluctuated more on the diurnal scale swt 20 96 4 83 at 18 15 8 57 specifically from march to late september 2019 the daytime at was generally greater than the swt while the night time at was lower than the swt from october 2019 to march 2020 the swt gradually decreased and the diurnal variation became less pronounced additionally the at was generally lower than the swt fig 2 a as an important component of heat exchange changes in the water air temperature difference significantly affect the heat budget over the entire monitoring period ws did not show significant seasonal characteristics but during the daily cycle the mornings and nights were generally breezy with an average wind speed of 1 27 0 97 m s while high winds prevailed in the afternoon with an average value of 2 21 1 65 m s and a maximum value of up to 11 1 m s 2 august 2019 15 00 seen in fig s1 the hydrological conditions of the tgr were markedly seasonal fig 2 c and the water level fluctuated by up to 30 m throughout the year the water level of the tgr varied frequently during the flood period june august the maximum difference in the water level was more than 10 m from 18 july to 8 august 2019 while the water level rose rapidly and returned to its maximum state 175 m after the impounding period september october due to an increased net flow discharge xxb was found to be a double mixed type of water body i e complete water mixing occurred twice a year february march and november significant diurnal stratification was observed especially from mid august to mid september 2019 and the diurnal mixed layer depth mld was approximately 10 m stratification began in march 2019 and the intensity of near surface stratification reached 15 cph accompanied by a gradual increase in the intensity of stratification in the upper layer as the water level dropped during the regressing period january may the water level varied frequently during the flood period which promoted water mixing to some extent but stratification still reached its strongest intensity approximately 80 cph after the impounding period with the water level rising and the temperature continuing to decrease the amount of water mixing strengthened the water temperature tended to be identical and the vertical stratification structure gradually collapsed moreover from may to october 2019 a lower temperature was evident at the bottom of xxb and stratification persisted by comparing the water temperature upstream s1 midstream s2 and downstream s3 of xxb a lower temperature inflow upstream led to strong stratification at the bottom of s2 seen in fig s2 resulting in a unique double thermocline structure in the vertical profile the intensity of stratification in the bottom boundary layer ranged from 5 62 to 20 50 cph 3 2 heat fluxes at the water air interface various components of the water air heat fluxes were estimated as shown in fig 3 throughout the monitoring period q swnet was 127 49 189 40 w m2 which was the main source of heating within the water column and significant seasonal differences were observed for example q swnet was greater in spring and summer than in autumn and winter the heat loss at the water air interface was mainly composed of two components q e and q h where q e was negative throughout most of the monitoring period and peaked in the summer and autumn the mean values were 42 31 52 28 w m2 and 52 28 52 28 w m2 respectively after september the heat loss contributed by q lwnet increased and gradually predominated the heat loss during the autumn and winter fig 3 a q ef showed the same trend as q net and the specific seasonal variations are shown in table 2 overall the daily averaged q net demonstrated heat absorption from 20 march to 16 september 2019 while after 16 september 2019 q net gradually shifted into heat loss with a negative increase in q e and q h based on the temporal evolution of q net the entire period was divided into a heating period and a cooling period for the convenience of description and the boundary was set on 16 september 3 3 turbulent fluxes and turbulence velocity the turbulent velocity u w and w turbulent kinetic energy flux fq and active mixed layer depth amld at the water air interface are shown in fig 4 the water friction velocity u w and convective velocity w exhibited significant diurnal cycle characteristics throughout the monitoring period in general u w was generally stronger than w during the daytime while w was absolutely dominant at night during the heating and cooling periods the variation characteristics were also different during the heating period u w and w were 0 19 0 14 cm s and 0 13 0 18 cm s respectively u w changed with the wind speed u w gradually increased starting around midday peaking in the afternoon during windy periods while w gradually increased at night peaking in the early dawn the convective effect of the water column was usually the strongest at 6 00 am fig 4 a in addition during high wind periods in the afternoon w increased gradually in response to the increasing u w but a lag of approximately 3 h was observed u w was comparable to w during the night while w was approximately twice as large as u w in the early morning from 1 00 am to 7 00 am during the cooling period u w and w were 0 16 0 14 cm s and 0 62 0 4 cm s respectively compared to the heating period and w was significantly enhanced averaging approximately 3 8 times u w w was always greater than 0 08 cm s within the confidence interval indicating that the water column was in a persistent convective mixing state during the cooling period during the daytime the mean w increased rapidly with the increasing u w between 12 00 and 16 00 r 0 83 p 0 01 and the increase in the wind speed promoted a significant overturning of the water column w was still stronger in the early morning and during the night than during the daytime u w was smaller than at the same time during the heating period and had fewer diurnal fluctuations fig 4 b by means of categorical statistics fq was decomposed into two components the flux induced by the wind stress fq wind and that induced by the penetrated convection fq conv the linear relationship between fq conv and amld was clearly good in both the heating and the cooling periods heating period r2 0 48 p 0 01 cooling period r2 0 76 p 0 01 and the relationship was stronger in the cooling period the turbulent kinetic energy introduced by convection explained the variation in amld well in both the summer stratified state and the mixed state u w however did not show a satisfactory linear correlation with the mixed layer depth heating period r2 0 03 p 0 01 cooling period r2 0 00 p 0 01 u w was not significantly enhanced or diminished as the water column shifted from the heating period to the cooling period and it maintained its usual characteristics of a diurnal pattern the temporal heterogeneity of w and u w showed that in the afternoon when there was strong stratification the wind speed was not high enough to promote the convection of near surface water and increase amld but it was different in the cooling period the intensity of stratification was weak and the increase in fq conv effectively promoted convection and increased amld in the cooling period 3 4 heat content the heat content and heat balance of the water column are shown in fig 5 the variation in the heat content of the water column throughout the entire period ranged from 1 65 109 4 30 109j m2 and the correlation between the heat content of the water column and the water level was significant r 0 83 p 0 01 during most of the time δ q t differed significantly from δ q m the difference between δ q t and δ q m represented the fact that the heat of the entire water column was imbalanced and the heat exchange from the water air interface accounted for only a small part of the total heat budget over the entire monitoring period an analysis of the linear regression between the longitudinal heat transport δ q t δ q m and the water level fluctuations fig 6 showed that longitudinal heat transport was closely related to the water level fluctuations with an r2 of 0 74 indicating that longitudinal heat transport dominated the heat budget 3 5 heat balance in the near surface water column with the understanding that changes in the seasonal water level regulate the heat changes in xxb we explored the heat balance characteristics of the near surface water column the selected time period was the transition between the heating period and the cooling period changes in the water level and temperature were obvious and the euphotic depth was relatively stable not more than 8 m not shown the mean water temperature in the mainstream of the tgr during this period was consistently lower than the mean water temperature in the tributary fig s3 and the change in the water level of the tgr was mainly influenced by the increased inflow which fluctuate between 145 52 and 162 m fig 7 a the average heat budget δ q t in the upper water column 8 m varied between 2 33 106 and 1 88 106 j m2 throughout the entire period and the average water air heat budget δ q m varied between 1 03 106 and 2 03 106 j m2 δ q t was slightly smaller than δ q m during the daytime as the water level rose δ q t became progressively smaller the water temperature stratification gradually weakened 16 september 28 september and the water temperatures in both the mainstream of the tgr and xxb showed differential cooling however due to the difference in the cooling rate δ t δ t tgr δ t δ t xxb between the mainstream of the tgr and xxb the δ t δ t value of the mainstream was lower than that of xxb during the daytime and the difference in the averaged water temperature t tgr t xxb between the mainstream of the tgr and xxb decreased at night δ t δ t tgr was higher than that of xxb and t tgr t xxb increased the heat loss in the water column was greater at night than during the day resulting in a greater difference between δ q t and δ q m the largest difference occurred on 17 august at 2 15 106 j m2 after 16 september the difference in δ t δ t tgr δ t δ t xxb and t tgr t xxb gradually decreased leading to a further decrease in δ q t the large difference in the amount of change in δ q t and δ q m under scenarios 1 and 2 is notable resulting in a pattern that was different from that of the other days in scenario 1 from 27 to 29 august the upstream water temperature decreased from 24 01 c to 19 28 c and the discharge of the upstream of xxb increased to 68 60 m3 s the averaged value was only 28 58 m3 s resulting in a well mixed state in s2 in addition δ q t was significantly smaller than δ q m in scenario 2 from 14 to 21 september the water level of the tgr continued to rise accompanied by a decrease in the water temperature in the upper reaches of xxb the water temperature and the intensity of stratification in xxb decreased rapidly and δ q t was significantly smaller than δ q m as in scenarios 1 fig 7 d in general scenario 1 occurred less frequently within a year reflecting the impact of small upstream floods but the upstream runoff form of xxb was still dominated by cold underflow long et al 2019b scenario 2 generally occurred when the runoff of the watershed increased at this time the water level of the tgr rose significantly which promoted an increase in the cold inflow in the upstream of xxb 3 6 relationships between various background factors and n previous studies have shown that the meteorological and hydrological conditions in xxb affect the stratification of the water column in different seasons liu et al 2012 to further determine the key factors in xxb on an intra annual scale we selected a series of potentially important factors for linear regression analysis with the mean buoyancy frequency n of the entire water column the results are shown in fig 8 the stratification intensity of xxb underwent a complete transition from mixing to strong stratification state and back to a mixing state within one year ultimately the water level r2 0 59 p 0 01 n 8132 upstream water temperature r2 0 56 p 0 01 n 7819 and at r2 0 65 p 0 01 n 8187 were the key parameters that significantly influenced the thermal regime of xxb indicating that the mixing and stratification of xxb were influenced by both meteorological and hydrological conditions it is worth noting that δ q m q net and the mainstream water temperature were also significantly correlated with n but the r2 values were low at 0 19 0 16 and 0 21 respectively δ q t and the wind speed had almost no effect on n some indicators are not listed because they did not correlate with n and were not considered statistically significant 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of the thermal regime and its influencing factors in xxb the reservoir thermal regime is an important indicator of the water environment and affects the water quality of the reservoir as well as the downstream water ecology in previous studies the seasonal evolution of the water temperature in xxb has been widely cited as one of the main factors affecting algal growth liu et al 2012 yang et al 2018b this study was the first to investigate the complete high frequency water temperature in the tributary of the tgr and the results reveal additional diurnal details the tgr is a typical riverine deep water reservoir its mainstream velocity is rapid and the vertical water temperature structure is hardly significantly stratified long et al 2016 strong stratification is usually observed in the tributaries of the tgr due to weak hydrodynamics li et al 2020b according to lewis classification guidelines lewis 1996 the thermal regime can be classified as typical continuous warm polymictic with two complete vertical overturn events within a year thermal stratification in xxb began in late march 2019 and increased in intensity from spring to summer the flood period was the strongest period of water temperature stratification fig 2 e after mid september the mixing state of xxb intensified and the vertical structure tended to become homothermic a unique thermal regime was observed in xxb and strong stratification existed in the upper and benthic parts of the water column creating a double thermocline structure along the vertical profile for the stratification of the upper part especially during the flood season from 17 july to 21 august 2019 the stratification in the upper 8 m of the water column was consistently strong and the maximum n value exceeded 70 cph which is even higher than that in shallow tropical reservoirs araújo et al 2017 in addition to the enhanced q net the water exchange pattern between xxb and the mainstream of the tgr or the pathway of intrusion from the mainstream of the tgr which is driven by the thermal density current long et al 2019b may be another reason for this finding specifically during the flood season the water temperature of s3 was between the surface and bottom water temperatures of s2 fig s2 predictably the mainstream intruded into xxb in the form of upper interflow and the thin near surface layer of xxb was topped by this intrusive flow which inhibited vertical convection and thus created a long residence time and strong stratification in the near surface layer this forced stratification caused by backwater jacking has also been identified in another tributary tangxi river of the tgr li et al 2020a another stratification occurred at the bottom of xxb and was caused by the intrusion of low temperature water from upstream the upstream of xxb is fed by meltwater from the shennongjia forest area and the water temperature was lower year round seen in fig s1 the evolution of lake reservoir stratification whether due to thermal effects or environmental influences is a worthwhile research focus in xxb even if mld did not extend to the entire water column most of the time incomplete vertical mixing diurnal stratification and thermal regimes were controlled by heat transfer at the water air interface which is driven by meteorological factors compared to other subtropical reservoirs xxb showed even greater negative values in november and december approximately 50 w m2 ishikawa et al 2021 indicating a greater impact on heat loss and an overturn effect of the water column after reservoir impounding in addition the stratification duration of xxb was longer than that of deep high altitude dimictic lakes at the same latitude wang et al 2020 and approximately 2 months longer than that of subtropical reservoirs at the same latitude liu et al 2018 these differences in the thermal regime are mainly controlled by different influencing factors specifically the thermal regime and energy balance of the water column are influenced by the lake morphology rahaghi et al 2019 and the lake size and evaporation play a dominant role in the heat distribution lei et al 2021 oswald and rouse 2004 however in riverine reservoirs such as the tgr where lateral heat exchange is often neglected due to excessive aspect ratios the two main factors throughflow along the channel density current intrusion and water air heat fluxes play an important role in the total heat balance and the advective heat exchange induced by hydrological connectivity is a nonnegligible source of heat fig 9 these two factors are discussed further below 4 2 stratification and mixing characteristics within the near surface water column under diurnal meteorological variation the intensity of stratification in the near surface water column was strongly linked to meteorological conditions the seasonal and diurnal mld values of xxb were significantly influenced by the water air heat flux q net r 0 833 p 0 01 n 323 as with other tributaries of riverine canyon type reservoirs however the mixing effect was limited during the daytime especially during the heating period and mld did not extend throughout the entire water column 4 33 3 60 m therefore this part mainly centered on the near surface water column above the euphotic layer on a diurnal scale the heat flux gradually increased from the morning onwards in xxb and the gentle breeze and gradually increasing q sw caused the heat to accumulate in the surface layer ws generally peaked in the afternoon and the prevailing high wind promoted the transfer of heat deeper into the water column increasing the buoyancy of the near surface water column after the evening the temperature difference between the water and the air increased the heat flux changed from positive to negative and the water column began to lose stability with cooler surface water sinking down and causing vertical mixing bouffard and wüest 2018 wind events are often key drivers of the shift from a stratified to an unstable state of the water column coogan et al 2020 mi et al 2018 a high ws also drove the lake circulation mccombs et al 2014 however in xxb wind driven turbulence was dominant during the daytime but produced a limited cooling effect to counteract strong stratification fig 4 a squalls at night promoted vertical mixing in the water column but the convection velocity w was stronger during the heat loss process averaging twice the water friction velocity u w during the cooling period fig 4 b which is more common in riverine canyon type reservoirs vidal et al 2010 the temporal variability of the peaks between u w the daily pattern of wind and w resulted in these two main physical driving mechanisms playing different roles in the near surface heat distribution which is why the turbulent kinetic flux represented by the wind stress had little to do with changes in amld for both the heating and the cooling periods fig 4 c d in addition due to the temporal heterogeneity of the peaks u w and w the effect of the wind speed may depend on the stratification strength we attempted to summarize the role of the wind stress in the stratification and mixing process using fig 10 the widely recognized threshold line for stratification and mixing delineated the buoyancy frequency n and the fluxes of turbulent kinetic energy f q into three parts in region ⅰ the near surface water column was in a completely mixed state and f q increased with the wind speed in contrast in region iii as the stratification of the water column intensified f q hardly exceeded 2 106 m3 s3 despite the high wind stress values indicating that in a strongly stratified state during the daytime the stratification could not be counteracted despite the increased weight of the wind stress in the context of general stratification turbulence generated by wind stress received extensive suppression pernica et al 2014 in contrast to wind stress convection due to water air temperature differences may be the key to heat loss in the water column 4 3 advective heat transport between xxb and the mainstream of the tgr as one of the largest tributaries at the head of the tgr the water exchange and energy transfer process between xxb and the mainstream of the tgr was strongly influenced by flow discharge and water level regulation corresponding to the mainstream of the tgr the water level fluctuated by up to 30 m in xxb throughout the year in addition no statistically significant effect of the stratification intensity n on δ q m or q net was observed fig 8 b d r2 0 19 and 0 16 respectively however in shallow lakes due to almost no extra discharge mld is strictly affected by the wind speed and solar radiation yang et al 2018 indicating that the factors influencing the vertical mixing of the water column were not only from meteorological aspects different flow paths formed a variety of unique flow circulation patterns in xxb long et al 2019b and the influence of the longitudinal flow between the upstream and downstream the mainstream of the tgr on the thermal stratification and mixing regime cannot be ignored the fluctuation of the water level affected the change in the water volume and heat in xxb causing a long term imbalance in the net heat balance δ q t of the entire water column and δ q m for example a 2 5 m rise in the water level during the impoundment period increased the average daily δ q t by 9 17 106 j m2 fig 5 b the main reason was that the water level varied frequently and the rising water level led to a rapid increase in the water volume of xxb in contrast when the water level decreased a decrease in the water volume caused a decrease in the heat content in a study of the heat content of another tributary of the tgr meixi river cheng cheng et al 2018 found that the influence from the mainstream dominated the heat balance of the tributary and the heat from the fluctuations in the water level even exceeded 70 of the heat budget of the tributary in reservoirs with significant seasonal daily scale water level regulations temperature changes and metalimnetic deepening rates are significantly influenced by flow discharge andrés stated that due to the nonsignificant intra annual differences in the atmospheric heating rate river inflows affect reservoir temperature changes and the heat balance more strongly than atmospheric forcing posada bedoya et al 2021 furthermore our results show that after stripping the influence of water level variations on the heat content the qt and qm values within the euphotic layer were unequal which meant that the difference in the cooling rate δ t δ t between xxb and the tgr exerted an effect on the heat imbalance during the transition of the heating and cooling periods second the influence from the upstream of xxb also changed the benthic thermal regime the upwards entrainment by the near bottom cold flow was another possible factor altering the water temperature structure and heat balance of the water column augusto silva et al 2019 xing et al 2012 however the upstream inflow was much less than the mainstream runoff of the tgr not shown 28 58 22 86 m3 s in the entire water column changes in the water level were the key factor leading to the heat imbalance qt q m of xxb even though a more detailed analysis of the along stream heat change was not carried out in this study our results still show that the δ t or δ t δ t values and the water level variation introduced by reservoir regulations changed the heat balance in xxb when additional heat input is available e g rainfall flooding the magnitudes of δ q m and δ q t will differ significantly δ t was also usually unequal seasonally due to differences in the volume and heat capacity specifically when the water temperature in the mainstem was greater than that in xxb xxb was thermally supplied by the mainstream which usually occurred in winter as shown in fig 2 d where the air temperature was consistently lower but the water temperature was consistently higher than the air temperature as a result of the thermal supplementation of the water temperature in xxb by the mainstream fig s3 similarly in the mixing zone shown in fig 10 a higher wind speed and a lower f q were observed in this period indicating that at this stage with a large volume of mainstream water being pumped into xxb the water temperature variation in xxb was dominated by the mainstream water temperature rather than the vertical heat transfer from meteorological forcing in contrast in summer the water temperature in the mainstream was lower than that in xxb and water exchange between the mainstream and xxb was achieved through density currents induced by temperature differences which were mostly overflow in winter and upper interflow in summer ji et al 2017 xu et al 2021 in addition the interflow enhanced the stratification of the tributary fig 2 d previous studies have mostly focused on lakes reservoirs without external inflow araújo et al 2017 lei et al 2021 and the research on thermal stratification and its influencing factors for waters with large amounts of runoff and frequent regulations is inadequate in depth future research is necessary 5 conclusions this study assessed the characteristics of the thermal regime and their response patterns under the influence of hydrological and meteorological conditions in xxb from 2019 to 2020 identified the key processes affecting turbulent mixing in the near surface water column and the role played by the wind speed and analysed the influence of hydrological connectivity on the heat balance and the possible causes of heat imbalance in the water column the results indicate that xxb is a typical subtropical continuous warm polymictic water body that is affected by the regulation of the tgr the water level of xxb fluctuated by up to 30 m the stratification started in march and reached its maximum during the flood season with reservoir storage in september the stratified structure gradually collapsed the combination of a lower water level increased shortwave radiation sw and a warmer air temperature at enhanced the stratification intensity n vertical mixing produced by meteorological forcing was limited turbulent mixing in the near surface was dominated by convection velocity w rather than frictional velocity u w and high wind speeds enhanced the convection effect during the heating period the peak u w lagged behind w by approximately 3 h near surface stratification suppressed wind induced turbulence and no temporal heterogeneity was observed during the cooling period the heat budget was mainly controlled by the intrusive discharge of the mainstream of the tgr and water level fluctuation on an annual scale was the main factor of the heat imbalance δ q t δ q m however in the near surface of the water column the heat distribution indicator mld was mainly dominated by the water air heat flux q net r 0 833 p 0 01 n 323 and the difference in the cooling rate between the mainstream of the tgr and xxb induced a diurnal heat imbalance this study was the first long term muti parameter field monitoring effort in xxb the results provide new insights into the thermal regime of riverine reservoirs and their influencing factors

3036,the magnitude of sediment yield from headwater catchments is controlled by the interactions among hydrology geomorphology and soil disturbance in montane regions like the sierra nevada snow is one of the main factors controlling the timing and magnitude of hydrological fluxes however the role of snow on modulating spatial and temporal variation of sediment yield remains unclear using 120 site years of sediment yield data from 10 headwater catchments drainage area 50 475 ha we examined the sediment yield characteristics across an elevational gradient 1 777 2 381 m elevation in the southern sierra nevada across space and time we calculated an average annual suspended sediment yield of 62 147 mg km2 in contrast the measured mean annual bedload yield from the study catchments was small 1 1 2 4 mg km2 a linear mixed effects model showed that maximum annual discharge alone can only explain 24 marginal r 2 0 24 of the variance in sediment yield similarly the hypsometric integral which is often used as a metric for erosion susceptibility showed no predictive power marginal r 2 0 005 as much as 65 of the variance in sediment yield can be explained by fixed effects when snow related drivers i e center of flow timing and aspect were included in the model along with maximum annual discharge suggesting a strong influence of snowmelt moreover the relationship between area normalized suspended sediment yield qs and unit discharge q was significantly different between rain and snow events p 0 001 both average slope α and exponent β terms of the q s α q β relationship across the ten catchments were higher for rainfall α 5 8 β 1 84 than those for snowmelt α 3 1 β 1 77 events as the erosion severity and power were higher during rainfall than the snowmelt events a shift in the precipitation form from snow to rain under a warming climate will likely increase sediment yield these results provide critical insights on background sediment yield in the southern sierra nevada and likely changes under future climate keywords sediment yield forest management paired catchment sierra nevada snow transition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forested and snow laden mountains of the sierra nevada provide more than 60 of california s developed water supply sierra nevada conservancy 2014 dams and reservoirs on the western slope of the sierra nevada play an integral role in bridging the timing mismatch between seasonal cycles of precipitation and water demand for california much of the mountain runoff on average 29 km3 dettinger and anderson 2015 is held behind dams during the rainy winter and early spring snowmelt before it is released to customers during the peak summer usage however these mountain streams across the united states are also major conduits for non point source water pollutants such as sediment and nutrients that cause degradation of instream habitat quality and reservoir capacity kemp et al 2011 podolak and doyle 2015 schleiss et al 2016 united states environmental protection agency 2016a united states environmental protection agency 2016b in the united states half of the assessed 1 787 918 km or 31 4 of the total waters rivers and streams are classified as either threatened or impaired united states environmental protection agency 2016a united states environmental protection agency 2016b in california nearly 90 of assessed rivers and streams 340 397 km or 33 of the total waters are classified as water quality impaired with temperature and sedimentation siltation as the top two causes nearly 60 of the assessed rivers and streams and 70 of reservoirs lakes and ponds in california require determination of new total maximum daily loads tmdl united states environmental protection agency 2016a united states environmental protection agency 2016b further many california reservoirs are losing water storage capacity minear and kondolf 2009 estimated as much as 2 1 109 m3 of sediment deposited in california reservoirs between 1890 and 2008 this represents a loss of 4 5 of the statewide total reservoir storage the cumulative sedimentation is predicted to reach 7 1 109 m3 by year 2200 which is 15 of statewide reservoir storage capacity this historic and future loss in reservoir storage alone is quite significant considering the removal cost and lack of flexibility for building additional storage lund 2011 2014 increased water demand curtailment of groundwater use and decreased snow storage during winter months due to climate change will result in increased reliance on reservoir storage these coarse scale estimates provide one view of sedimentation evaluating background sediment yield understanding site scale variability in sediment transport and identifying predictive variables for sediment yield such as geomorphology land use management and climatic controls could improve management of reservoir sedimentation and achieve water quality standards borah et al 2006 costa et al 2018 however the past literature reported mixed observations on drivers of erosion and sediment yield for example catchment lithology and relief were found to be key drivers of sediment yield in basins with size less than 103 km2 aalto et al 2006 andrews and antweiler 2012 but not in basins with size over 105 km2 syvitski and milliman 2007 in the rocky mountains mueller and pitlick 2013 found that the relative sediment supplies in basins ranging between 1 4 and 35 000 km2 were dominantly controlled by lithology and showed very little correlation to relief mean basin slope and drainage density stallman et al 2005 reported a sharp contrast in sediment production between the geologic terrains of older western cascades and relatively young high cascades where the former was represented by only 10 catchment area but accounted for 62 of the sediment yield similarly mueller et al 2016 showed a strong relationship between sediment composition i e suspended versus bedload and lithology the linkages between precipitation temperature and activation and cessation of runoff and sediment sources are also critical especially in mountainous regions impacted by changing climate mano et al 2009 costa et al 2018 the magnitude and intensity of sediment transfer associated with the snowmelt processes differ from rainfall driven events in the mediterranean region where the snowmelt controls a major part of the discharge during spring and summer season the transition in sediment regime from fine particle to coarser bedload was observed lana renault et al 2011 similarly changes in land cover from forest management activities and or wildfires can also alter the geomorphic regime safeeq et al 2020 limited studies exist on long term background sediment production rates in the sierra nevada riebe et al 2000 2001 investigated long term erosion rates in the southern sierra nevada using cosmogenic nuclide data and found no correlation with climate and concluded that inferring patterns of sediment delivery using hillslope gradient alone can be misleading at shorter time scales sediment inputs to lake tahoe in the central sierra nevada have been studied extensively and show strong spatial and temporal variability due to differences in climate geology and land use coats et al 2016 carl 1976 langlois et al 2005 reuter and miller 2000 simon et al 2003 studies in california s coast ranges go back to as early as the 1950s but focused mainly on documenting sediment yields associated with timber harvest and forest roads cafferata and reid 2013 lewis et al 2001 richardson et al 2020 numerous field studies on post disturbance specifically post fire sediment delivery rates are also scattered spatially throughout the state cole et al 2020 olsen et al 2021 robichaud et al 2013 2008 wohlgemuth et al 2001 however considering the range of variability in hydrology climate and geology in california these studies provide limited specific applicability beyond their local landscapes looking at the 1 300 km2 lake tahoe basin alone median suspended sediment yield varied by orders of magnitude between less than 0 5 mg km2 year to as much as 14 mg km2 year simon et al 2003 this variability was largely controlled by the differences in precipitation and the amount of upstream disturbance the variations in sediment yield over space and time were even larger when looking across the pacific coast region of the united states at the smaller forested catchment scale with area between 0 02 and 16 2 km2 reported sediment yields were found to vary by a factor of 104 0 05 550 mg km2 year gomi et al 2005 across larger catchments and geomorphic regimes o connor et al 2014 analyzed data from a range of basins in northern california and oregon with size ranging from 0 6 to 6906 km2 and reported bedload yields between 1 4 and 395 mg km2 year similarly czuba et al 2011 reported sediment yield variations between 1 3 and 584 mg km2 year from the major rivers draining into puget sound and its adjacent waters drainage area between 181 and 220 149 km2 looking at the sediment yield variations over time ambers 2001 reported sediment yield in the range of 38 and 244 mg km2 year with a long term average yield of 98 mg km2 year from the 686 km2 dorena lake watershed in the western oregon while the underlying hydrogeomorphic conditions in these studies are much different from those in the southern sierra nevada these studies provide a basis for documenting and understanding locally relevant background sediment production hydrologic landscapes of the sierra nevada are affected by climate drought and disease resulting in tree mortality wildfires and other forms of disturbance that can alter the sediment regime wildfires are becoming more frequent bigger and more severe bedsworth et al 2018 warmer temperatures and loss of snowpack in the sierra nevada fuel the fires and alter the hydrology with higher rain triggered winter peak flows safeeq et al 2016 westerling et al 2006 the recent 2020 creek fire 2020 north complex fire 2021 caldor fire and 2021 dixie fire are examples of wildfire destruction in the source watersheds of california this trend is projected to intensify in the future das et al 2013 huning and aghakouchak 2018 but its full range of geomorphic impacts is largely unclear with some indication that self organization of channels may buffer the influence of climate signal evident in discharge goudie 2006 phillips and jerolmack 2016 the amount of active forest and fuel management which is on the rise is also modifying the landscape significantly gomi et al 2005 north et al 2015 safeeq et al 2020 rachels et al 2020 quantified the effect of forest harvesting on sediment sources in oregon coast range headwater streams they discovered that sediment loss from the harvested area was 10 6 times greater than streambank and 4 5 times greater than unharvested areas bywater reyes et al 2017 2018 showed catchment lithology and physiography as dominant controls on suspended sediment yield with catchments underlying friable lithologies and steeper slopes being more susceptible to erosion after contemporary forest management wise and o connor 2016 developed a spatially explicit suspended sediment yield model for western oregon and found lithology and burned area along with precipitation explained 64 of the variability in suspended sediment yield olsen et al 2021 studied the effects of the 2013 rim fire and post fire salvage logging on rill connectivity and sediment yield in the sierra nevada however they did not find any significant change in mean rill density or log transformed normalized sediment yield between logged and control catchments soil disturbance related to road construction or maintenance timber harvest and forest thinning or other management can also alter the erosion and sediment delivery dynamics of headwater streams rachels et al 2020 however the impact of these anthropogenic and natural activities on landscape geomorphology varies with space and time the purpose of this research was to investigate long term suspended and bedload sediment yields and assess underlying geomorphic and climatic controls we analyzed suspended sediment concentration along with sediment load or yield due to their varying implications on aquatic and geomorphic processes we utilized a unique dataset with 120 site years 10 catchments 12 years of high resolution sediment and discharge data across an elevational gradient to answer the following research questions 1 how does the sediment concentration and yield vary in space and time 2 what are the key hydrogeomorphic and climatic controls on sediment yields in the sierra nevada and 3 to what extent do forest management treatments i e tree thinning and understory prescribed burns affect sediment yields 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kings river experimental watersheds krew established in 2002 are active research sites located within the kings river basin in the southern sierra nevada of california fig 1 krew arecomprised of eight primary and two integrating catchments ranging in size from 0 5 to 4 7 km2 table 1 three primary catchments nest within each integrating catchment p300 and b200 fig 1 the ten catchments are organized in two clusters across the

described as mediterranean with cold wet winters and warm dry summers long term 1981 2010 average annual precipitation across the 10 catchments ranged from 1 026 mm in p300 to 1 234 mm in t003 and the mean daily air temperatures varied between 8 c in b203 and 10 c in d102 daly et al 2008 the period of current research was 2004 2016 which includes the 2012 2015 drought supplementary fig s1 during

sugar pine pinus lambertiana and incense cedar calocedrus decurrens bull catchments contain a larger amount of red fir abies magnifica in the range of 19 44 hunsaker et al 2012 bare ground which is mostly rock outcrop in the bull catchments accounts for 0 4 of the land cover hypsometric or area altitude curves provide the relative area of a catchment to the relative elevation above the catchment mouth and can illustrate a range of conditions inequilibrium convex up landform associated with diffusive dominated catchments equilibrium original and monadnock concave up landform associated with fluvial dominated catchments strahler 1952 cohen et al 2008 vivoni et al 2008 these curves can also be described as toeless to subdued concave up or type i j shaped or type ii and convex up or type iii vachtman et al 2013 morphologically all the catchments except b201 show convex up mostly in the middle of the hypsometric curves indicating most erosion in the upper part of the catchment fig 2 b201 shows a concave up hypsometry suggesting more erosion in the middle part of the catchment the hypsometric integral hi is often used to quantitatively describe the geomorphic differences reflected in the hypsometric curve with higher hi values indicating more erosion susceptibility singh et al 2008 the hi values across the ten catchments range between 0 448 for b201 to 0 689 for p301 both providence and bull catchments can be classified as steep fig 2 with an average slope ranging between 21 in b204 to as much as 37 in d102 table 1 catchment aspect is dominated by south and west facing slopes estimated catchment drainage density varies between 4 6 km km2 in b203 to as high as 10 1 km km2 in d102 and generally increases with decreasing catchment elevation r 2 0 85 increasing slope r

implemented to assess the impacts of two forest management treatments with a goal to better understand their impact on hydrology and geomorphology the first phase of treatment was performed in the providence and bull catchments between july and november 2012 timber harvest and mechanical thinning using feller bunchers and hand felling combined with ground based skidding were performed in p301 d102 b201 and b204 table 1 lydersen et al 2019 in the second phase prescribed fire was applied in bull catchments b203 and b204 during fall 2013 the prescribed fire treatment was delayed in providence catchments p301 and p303 because of unfavorable weather and ignition conditions the subsequent prescribed burn in providence occurred in late 2016 but falls outside of our analysis period as a result catchment p303 remained untreated during our analysis catchments p304 and t003 were the controls for providence and bull respectively the forest management treatments at krew were not very intensive and had a negligible impact on basal area canopy cover and tree density lydersen et al 2019 the thinning intensities of providence and bull were 23 trees ha and 33 trees ha respectively further the thinning removed 4 5 m2 ha and 4 6 m2 ha basal areas from providence and bull catchments respectively lydersen et al 2019 however the treatments were not applied uniformly throughout the catchments in providence 71 area was undisturbed after thinning and 48 area was found unburned after prescribed fire similarly in bull 48 and 61 of the area were undisturbed and unburned after treatment respectively in terms of hydrologic response from these treatments bart et al 2021 found a statistically significant increase in streamflow in providence but not in bull 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 meteorology snow water equivalent swe was measured at upper providence up and upper bull ub at 15 minute intervals using rectangular snow pillows fig 1 each pillow consisted of four 1 2 1 5 m sections plumbed together and filled with non toxic antifreeze and connected to a sensotec pressure transducer honeywell inc columbus ohio the pressure of the snow was converted to an equivalent water depth swe daily average swe values were derived from 15 minute measurements safeeq and hunsaker 2016 2 3 2 streamflow streamflow was measured at 15 minute intervals using a combination of methods monitoring in the eight primary catchments began in fall 2003 the two integrating catchments p300 and b200 were added in 2005 and 2006 respectively all catchments except p300 b200 and t003 were equipped with dual parshall montana flumes constructed of structural fiberglass an upstream small flume 8 or 15 cm throat width 35 6 or 45 7 cm wall height measured low flows and a downstream large flume 30 61 91 or 122 cm throat width 91 5 cm wall height measured high flows fig 3 the distance between the two flumes varied from catchment to catchment and was less than 30 m p300 was equipped with a 120 degree v notch weir and t003 was gauged with a compound 90 degree v notch and rectangular weir the teakettle creek experimental forest was established in 1936 and the weir at t003 has been operational intermittently since 1938 kattelmann 1989 for b200 discharge was estimated using a rating curve at a natural cross section submersible pressure transducers manufactured by telog telog instruments victor new york solinst solinst canada ltd georgetown on or aquarod advanced measurements and controls inc camano island washington were installed inside a stilling well connected to the large flume where available otherwise placed directly in the stream similarly teledyne isco air bubbler modules teledyne isco lincoln nebraska were connected to small flumes where available otherwise placed directly in the stream manual discharge measurements were conducted using a sontek flowtracker acoustic doppler velocimeter flowtracker san diego california across a range of flows 0 0023 m3 s to 0 19 m3 s for developing the rating curve for b200 2 3 3 suspended sediment starting in fall 2006 stream water samples were collected at each site using teledyne isco model 6712 24 bottle sequential pump samplers teledyne isco lincoln nebraska water samples were retrieved for laboratory analysis on a bi weekly basis or sooner when necessary and weather permitted grab samples were also collected when possible however most of the water samples for the analysis came from the automated samplers stream stage was used to initiate sampling when the stage values rose to a pre specified level it triggered the pump sampler to begin sampling at a fixed time interval typically one sample every 15 30 min the trigger threshold values were manually adjusted frequently to account for seasonal changes in flow regime across all sites and years 2006 2016 1 267 water samples were collected and analyzed for suspended sediment concentration in the usda forestry sciences laboratory fresno ca however 41 samples were marked as erroneous due to negative suspended sediment concentration values and removed from the analysis all the water samples were processed within seven days of collection to avoid biological growth first all water samples were filtered using glass fiber filters 1 0 µm pore size and a vacuum pump astm d 3977 97 both filters and vacuum pump assemblies were rinsed using deionized water then filters were placed in an aluminum pan and oven dried at 105 c for 2 h oven dried filters were placed in a desiccator for overnight cooling before taking the dry weight and subsequent vacuum filtering of water samples materials greater than 6 mm in any dimension length or width were removed from the filter the filters with suspended sediment were oven heated to 105 c for at least 2 h before placing them again in a desiccator for overnight cooling and recording the dry weight the mass of suspended solids was calculated by subtracting the weight of the clean dry filter and aluminum pan from the total dry filter aluminum pan and sediment weight finally we divided the mass of suspended solids by the volume of water sample to calculate the suspended sediment concentration ssc mg l 2 3 4 bedload sediment sediment and organic matter deposits from the eight primary catchments were measured annually using lined settling ponds these settling ponds were in natural deposition areas of the channel immediately below the large flume fig 3 except at t003 where a permanent concrete walled weir pond with a storage capacity of 200 m3 was constructed in 1938 the settling ponds at the remaining sites were lined with 0 5 mm rubber pond liners and varied in storage capacity between 12 and 40 m3 for the annual bedload sediment collection streams were diverted settling ponds were drained and emptied the wet pond deposits were weighed in buckets to the nearest 0 5 kg volume proportional sub samples were collected for determining the dry mass percent organic matter and particle size distribution organic matter was separated into three different classes i large organic matter such as sticks 1 cm diameter and 10 cm length ii coarse organic matter such as twigs needles sticks bark cones size less than large organic matter but large enough to extract with tweezers iii fine organic matter such as wood fragments size equivalent to sediment large and coarse organic matter were separated from the pond material before the sediment was removed and the dry weight was determined in the laboratory the fine organic matter fraction was determined by loss on ignition 24 h at 500 c of an oven dried subsample of the sediment eagan et al 2007 hunsaker and neary 2012 particle size distribution was determined for representative samples of the oven dried mineral fraction following a standard sieve analysis using 2 1 0 5 0 25 0 125 and 0 065 mm sieve sizes eagan et al 2007 because of the difficulty in separating the deposited suspended sediment from the bedload sediment in the mineral fraction deposited in the ponds we assumed that all the mineral fraction was bedload sediment trapping efficiencies of these settling ponds were not measured but inferring from other studies it may have been as low as 50 during high discharge events richardson et al 2020 verstraeten and poesen 2001 further information on meteorological streamflow and sediment measurements and quality control are available in earlier publications hunsaker and safeeq 2017 safeeq and hunsaker 2016 wagenbrenner et al 2021a 2 4 sediment rating curves and yields suspended sediment rating curves were developed in the r environment r core team 2020 for each site by regressing the catchment area a normalized suspended sediment concentrations ssc a mg l km2 from the samples against a range of flow metrics as explanatory variables table 2 fig 4 ideally these rating curves should be developed separately for pre and post treatment periods to account for any shift in the relationship between sediment and explanatory variables due to treatments however we felt that the highly unbalanced sample size for pre and post treatment observed suspended sediment data was problematic for developing separate rating curves at individual sites supplementary fig s5 the explanatory variables included in the rating curves were corresponding discharge lagged discharge by 2 3 4 6 and 24 h l s day time of water year as a decimal starting october 1 mid night as zero and fourier sine and cosine series of sample date time using smwrbase package with k max 1 lorenz 2015 with the exceptions of day and fourier sine and cosine series all other explanatory variables were natural log transformed and centered cohn et al 1992 prior to building the model explanatory variable day was only centered and fourier sine and cosine series were used in the model without any data transformation also since automated and grab samples were instantaneous while discharge was recorded at 15 min intervals corresponding discharge values were extracted by linearly interpolating the two adjacent discharge values an initial subset of 12 models were developed nbest 3 nvmax 4 using the regsubsets function all possible subsets regression from the leaps package in r lumley and miller 2020 the nbest parameter identifies best performing top 3 in this case models and nvmax parameter sets the maximum number of variables in this case 4 that can be used in the model the best regression model was selected based on anova with statistical significance level p 0 05 adjusted coefficient of regression and akaike information criterion aic the relationship between ssc and q for each catchment can be described including all candidate variables as 1 ln ssc a a b ln q c ln q 2 d ln q 3 e ln q 4 f ln q 6 g ln q 24 h d a y i s

transformed date time describing one cycle of sine and cosine curves for each water year a j regression coefficients the above mentioned variables were used to take care of the annual seasonality sinday and cosday time trend day and flow dependence the most frequently significant predictors are shown in bold from this point onward ssca is used as the acronym for area normalized suspended sediment concentration mg l km2 overall predicted ssca using models developed from equation 1 explained 73 of the variability in measured suspended sediment concentration table 2 fig 4 at the individual catchment level adjusted coefficients of determination were between 0 53 for catchment d102 p301 and 0 75 for catchment t003 table 2 ssca was positively related to ln q suggesting an increase in one will lead to an increase in another and vice versa with few exceptions ssca was negatively related to the lagged discharge values that indicates a delayed response in which either ssca declined along the recession limb after a peak discharge or increased along the rising limb derived suspended sediment rating curves for each catchment were applied to 15 min discharge measurements and other related explanatory variables table 2 to create a continuous record of ssca area normalized suspended sediment yields mg km2 were calculated by first estimating the sediment flux q s mg s km2 by multiplying the ssca mg l km2 with the corresponding 15 min discharge q l s we then aggregated the 15 minute suspended sediment flux values by water year to derive annual suspended yields and added the corresponding annual bedload yields to derive annual total sediment yields for each catchment 2 5 climatic and hydrogeomorphic controls on sediment yields effects of climate and other hydrogeomorphic variables on suspended sediment and total sediment yields were analyzed using two approaches first we used the power law relationship between area normalized instantaneous suspended sediment flux qs and discharge q to compare the differences in the relationships between rain and snowmelt driven runoff events the qs was used as opposed to a more typical ssca q relationship to account for differences in dilution from disproportional peak and baseflow behavior between rain and snowmelt events power law relationships took the form 2 q s α q a β where q s mg s km2 is area normalized and flow weighted ssca q a is discharge per unit area l s km2 and α and β describe the erosion severity and erosive power respectively asselman 2000 the β parameter is usually greater than one indicating an exponential effect of q on sediment transport a typical range of β parameter for suspended sediment transport range from 1 42 to 2 96 in different physiographic settings morehead et al 2003 sediment samples were grouped between rain and snow using the snow water equivalent swe information from the two meteorological stations fig 1 storms and corresponding ssc samples were identified as rain when there was no measured snow water equivalent based on this criterion 502 out of 1 267 samples were identified as rain and 765 as snowmelt swe data from ub were used for bull catchments and up for classifying providence catchments we recognize that some of the ssc samples classified as snowmelt driven may also have included rainfall e g rain on snow events guan et al 2016 second we used a linear mixed effects model to explore the hydrogeomorphic controls on the total i e suspended and bedload sediment yield from the krew catchments prior to building the model annual total sediment yield data were log transformed to approximately normalize the error term fixed effects in the model were annual maximum discharge q max center of flow timing ct defined as the day of water year by which 50 of the annual flow had passed the gauge and catchment aspect aspect to capture the precipitation regime and variability in snow among catchments hypsometric integral hi was included as a geomorphic control catchment elevation relief slope drainage density and ndvi were also explored but none of these variables were statistically significant predictors of annual total sediment yield similarly annual minimum and average discharge were also explored but eventually left out in favor of q max catchment ids were treated as a random effect in the model we used the mumin package barton and barton 2015 in r for estimating coefficients of determination to describe marginal variation in sediment explained by the fixed effects and conditional variation in sediment explained by both fixed and random effects bywater reyes et al 2018 3 results 3 1 suspended sediment concentration the area normalized suspended sediment concentration ssca between 2007 and 2016 varied by at least three orders of magnitude at each location fig 5 the average ssca were lower in the high elevation bull catchments 39 92 mg l km2 as compared to low elevation providence catchments 98 195 mg l km2 looking at individual catchment groups the highest ssca in providence was in p304 followed by d102 and both were significantly greater than the other three providence catchments fig 5c at bull ssca was highest in b201 and significantly different from the rest of the catchments fig 5d the catchments at the bull site were more similar than the catchments within the providence site the integrating catchments in providence and bull p300 and b200 respectively had the lowest ssca and the ssca for p300 was significantly lower than all other providence catchments fig 5c both catchments received fall rain along with several rain on snow events throughout the winter wet season neiman et al 2008 discharge in bull mainly originated from snowmelt and peaked in mid may supplementary fig s2 in contrast the peak snowmelt discharge in providence was usually two weeks earlier the ssca in bull catchments were more variable from month to month than those in providence with two distinct peaks in october and january supplementary fig s3 both catchment groups showed relatively high ssca during early fall rain flush there was also a noticeable lag between the timing of peak ssca and peak discharge in bull but not in providence highest ssca in bull after the fall flush occurred in january as compared to peak discharge in mid may peak timing of the sediment flux q s ssca instantaneous discharge q in providence coincided with the average center of flow timing i e around march as opposed to coinciding with peak snowmelt discharge in bull supplementary fig s4 the sediment production characteristics in terms of erosion severity α and erosive power β were highly variable between and within the two catchment groups table 3 overall combining data from all catchments within each group the α parameter was higher in providence 5 92 as compared to bull 2 39 in contrast the β parameter in providence 1 67 was very similar to that in bull 1 68 however this pattern was not consistent in individual catchments suggesting a strong spatial variability within a catchment group looking at the α and β coefficients between rain and snowmelt flow types across all catchments we found a statistically significant difference p 0 001 based on one way anova in the intercept i e α of the sediment production discharge relationships 2 between rain and snowmelt events the difference in the slope of the linear regression β between rain and snowmelt events was not statistically significant p 0 66 at the individual catchment group level both slope and intercept of the linear regression were statistically similar p 0 22 between rain and snowmelt events in bull however the opposite was true for providence the α coefficients from the combined models in each catchment group ranged from 11 0 for rain to 2 8 for snowmelt in providence and 1 94 for rain and 1 29 for snowmelt in bull in contrast the β coefficient was 1 57 for rain and 1 85 for snowmelt in providence and 1 90 for rain and 1 79 for snowmelt in bull in all providence catchments the α coefficients were higher for rainfall and the β coefficients were higher for snowmelt this effect of storm type in bull was highly variable between catchments but in the regressions combining all bull catchments both α and β coefficients were greater for rainfall events table 3 3 2 total sediment yield the average annual total sediment yield in providence 85 mg km2 was twice as much as in bull 42 mg km2 annual total sediment yield was highly variable standard deviation 148 mg km2 across all sites and years fig 6 additionally as compared to bull standard deviation 61 mg km2 annual sediment yield in providence standard deviation 200 mg km2 was more variable from year to year during 2004 2016 the highest sediment yield 1 074 mg km2 was recorded in 2006 a relatively wet year supplementary fig s1 for p304 while the lowest sediment yield 0 1 mg km2 was recorded in p301 in 2015 during a multi year drought average annual total sediment yield ranged between a low of 11 7 t003 and a high of 240 8 mg km2 p304 across the 10 catchments table 4 the contribution of bedload to the total sediment yield was fairly small 0 4 p303 to 3 8 p304 mg km2 or 1 to 7 of total yield table 4 total sediment yield showed no significant statistical correlation p 0 05 with the selected geomorphic descriptors among the selected geomorphic descriptors catchment aspect and hypsometric integral hi showed the highest partial correlations with the total sediment yield 0 62 and 0 64 respectively catchment drainage density was a distant third with a partial correlation of 0 41 in terms of hydroclimatic descriptors total sediment yield was significantly correlated with annual maximum discharge q max and center of flow timing ct with partial correlations of 0 27 p 0 003 and 0 53 p 0 001 respectively table 5 the best mixed effects model based on aic qmax ct aspect was able to describe 77 of the variation in the annual total sediment yield model 8 in table 6 fig 7 the marginal and conditional r 2 explains the variance of mixed effects model by fixed effects and by both fixed and random effects respectively all three variables in the best model are associated with the sediment yield directly or indirectly the catchment aspect influences the energy flux of the landscape along with the soil moisture runoff and vegetation dynamics thus it has a strong impact on sediment yield estimation similarly ct was linked to the highest observed sediment flux in providence and 2 months lag was observed between ct and the highest observed sediment flux in the bull catchment supplementary fig s3 moreover as can be seen from the spread around 1 1 line fig 7 the mean absolute error 40 mg km2 was small with respect to the mean 60 mg km2 and standard deviation 148 mg km2 the model with q max model 1 in table 6 as the only predictor was able to explain 44 of the variation in the total sediment yield but only 24 of the variation was explained by the fixed effect the best single predictor model was for ct a metric of snowmelt which explained 68 of the total variance model 2 in table 6 combining q max and ct model 5 in table 6 resulted in the highest conditional r 2 with the two fixed effects explaining 55 of the variance in the total sediment yield adding the aspect increased the variance explained by the fixed effects from 55 in model 5 to 65 in this model model 8 in table 6 but marginally lowered the conditional r 2 surprisingly adding the hypsometric integral hi did not improve the conditional r2 of the q max and ct model model 5 in table 6 or of the best model based on aic model 8 in table 6 both hi and aspect are constant within a catchment thus variation of sediment yields due to these variables was accounted for by the random effect i e catchment specifying hi and aspect as fixed effects shifts some of the random effects over to the fixed portion of the model increasing the marginal but not the conditional r 2 e g compare models 8 and 9 with model 5 3 3 effects of forest management on sediment the association between forest management and area normalized suspended sediment concentrations ssc a were analyzed by adding a dummy variable pre treatment 0 and post treatment 1 and its interaction with discharge term ln q in equation 1 effects of forest management were evident in some catchments at both providence and bull sites supplementary table s1 in providence both the treatment term and its interaction with discharge were statistically significant p 0 05 for d102 and p300 for p301 only the interaction term was statistically significant in bull only the treatment term was statistically significant for b201 and b204 and just the interaction term was significant in b200 neither the treatment nor the interaction term was statistically significant p 0 05 for b203 that received prescribed fire treatment only as mentioned previously skewed sampling of ssc towards the post treatment period supplementary fig s5 may influence the robustness of our catchment level forest management impact analysis to overcome this we combined all the data by site i e providence and bull and performed linear mixed effects modeling starting with the same variables as in table 2 and adding a dummy treatment variable pre treatment 0 and post treatment 1 and its interaction with discharge ln q this site based analysis showed a statistically significant difference in ssca between pre and post treatment periods in providence but not in bull supplementary table s2 for providence we found that both the treatment term and its interaction with discharge were statistically significant p 0 05 however the negative coefficients suggest that the shift in the rating curve may have been driven by the drought rather than forest management under similar discharge conditions forest management is expected to increase sediment production from increased supply while drought would likely reduce sediment production effects of forest management on total annual sediment yield suspended and bedload were analyzed after adding the treatment impact as a dummy variable in the best mixed effects model model 8 adding the treatment as an additional explanatory variable of total annual sediment yield significantly improved the model fit x 2 14 19 p 0 001 suggesting a significant shift in the total sediment yield during the post treatment period the aic decreased by 12 2 with marginal and conditional r 2 values rising slightly to 0 68 and 0 78 respectively another technique to evaluate the treatment effects on sediment is to compare the slope of observed sediment yields for treated and control catchments during pre and post treatment years fig 8 table 7 regression slopes of treated versus control sediment yields increased after treatment suggesting an increase in post treatment sediment yield relative to control except for p303 which received no treatment also the shifts in slope for thinned catchments were small suggesting a greater influence of prescribed fire on sediment yield than thinning however none of these shifts in regression slope were statistically significant p 0 05 because of the drought in 2012 2015 post treatment sediment yields in the controls i e p304 and t003 were lower than their pre treatment yields with very little to no overlap in range fig 8 therefore it is possible that the slope shifts are merely indicative of non linear relationships and drought rather than being treatment effects in terms of changes observed post treatment sediment yields were higher by 27 d102 and 28 p300 table 7 relative to those estimated by the pre treatment regressions treated versus control in p301 post treatment observed sediment yield was 72 lower than those estimated by the pre treatment regression in bull catchments observed post treatment sediment yields were higher relative to those estimated by the pre treatment regression by 2 in b204 3 in b200 and 19 in b204 in b201 observed post treatment sediment yield was 36 lower than those estimated by the model it was interesting to see a substantial increase in the total sediment yield in p303 a catchment with no treatment also all of this increased sediment in p303 was generated in 2016 the first normal precipitation year after the 2012 2015 drought bales et al 2018 safeeq and hunsaker 2016 this further suggests that these changes in sediment yield may have been an artifact of the drought rather than the forest management treatments 4 discussion 4 1 total sediment yield the average annual total sediment yield value of 63 mg km2 from the krew catchments is within the range of reported values for forested catchments in california and other parts of the western u s anderson 1954 gomi et al 2005 patric et al 1984 in the sierra nevada average annual sediment yield from the lake tahoe basin ranged from 0 7 to 67 9 mg km2 nolan and hill 1991 catchments in the lake tahoe study are comprised of a mixture of volcanic metamorphic and granitic rocks with scattered unconsolidated sediments that are more erodible than the soils at krew one of the lake tahoe catchments general creek drainage area of 19 3 km2 has comparable geology granitic and climate average annual precipitation 1 270 mm and temperature 5 8 c to krew and generated 17 6 mg km2 1981 1987 and 10 4 mg km2 1984 1987 of annual suspended sediment yield nolan and hill 1991 approximately 28 and 17 of the mean value at krew respectively analyzing the datasets of richardson and wagenbrenner 2020 the average total sediment yield for the north fork of caspar creek was found to be 43 mg km2 however caspar creek is rain dominated mean annual precipitation 1200 mm and relatively warmer than krew catchments with underlying marine sandstone and shale cafferata and reid 2013 richardson et al 2020 snowmelt driven systems produce less hillslope erosion and as a result lower sediment overall the only krew catchment that substantially exceeded the range for the sierra nevada was p304 which is a baseflow dominated stream safeeq and hunsaker 2016 eagan et al 2007 and has a mining history also the presence of channel bedrock is more dominant in the other krew catchments safeeq and hunsaker 2016 turowski et al 2011 suggest that even a small amount of bedrock exposure can make a stream act like a bedrock channel other factors such as low rock fraction in topsoil low proportion of exposed granite and ongoing down cutting of channels have been reported as possible mechanisms for higher sediment yields in p304 stacy et al 2015 hunsaker and neary 2012 eagan et al 2007 martin et al 2009 p304 had the highest by a factor of 4 coarse sediment or bedload yield among the studied catchments providing the necessary tool for channel incision in granitic catchments of the sierra nevada callahan et al 2019 despite the high sediment yield in p304 which is one of the two smallest catchments we found no relationship between suspended or total sediment yield and catchment area r2 0 03 p 0 6 catchment area and sediment yield are generally known to have a negative correlation griffiths et al 2006 however a positive correlation was also observed between turbidity and drainage area for 28 streams of the coast range of northern california klein et al 2012 a similar finding between sediment yield and area was observed in the north fork of caspar creek before the disturbance in the experimental catchments lewis et al 2001 the varying nature of this correlation is due to its dependency on multiple catchment variables i e slope vegetation cover and soil type bedload yield at krew was marginally correlated with the catchment area but statistically not significant r2 0 24 p 0 21 lack of correlation between sediment yield and drainage area at krew suggests that erosion processes at this scale are highly complex the transport limitation seems apparent when looking at the two integrating catchments b200 and p300 average annual total sediment yields from these two integrating catchments were only one third of the total sediment yield generated by the upstream catchments this shows a significant loss in sediment transport capacity as one moves downstream to lower elevation with less steep slopes while looking into individual catchments the total sediment yields of p301 and p303 are lesser than the p300 due to their lean flow conditions the ratio of steeper slopes to flat areas generally decreases with increasing catchment area as indicated by lower hi values for p300 and b200 table 1 fig 2 4 2 sediment yield and snow our results indicate a strong control of precipitation phase i e rain vs snow on measured ssca suspended sediment flux qs ssca instantaneous discharge q and total suspended and bedload sediment yield effects of the precipitation phase on ssca analyzed using a linear mixed effects model after adding a dummy variable snow 0 and rain 1 and its interaction with discharge ln q to the list of variables included in the sediment rating curve 1 showed a statistically significant p 0 05 positive association with the precipitation phase supplementary table s2 in terms of sediment fluxes measured qs for rainfall events were significantly p 0 001 higher than those for snow events under similar discharge this was also evident in the values of α and β 2 between rainfall and snowmelt events higher values of α for rainfall events in providence suggest higher erosion severity when compared with snowmelt driven events however snowmelt driven events have higher erosive power indicated by higher values of β when compared with rainfall events in contrast snow dominated bull catchments showed both higher erosion severity and erosive power during rainfall events except for β in b204 indicated by higher α and β values for rainfall driven events than those under snowmelt further it was observed that the measured suspended sediment fluxes were lower during april june the peak snowmelt season in bull site particularly supplementary fig s4 these findings suggest a likely increase in ssca and qs as the catchments transition from more snow to rain however the overall impact on the total annual sediment yield will depend on the future runoff regime both the magnitude and intermittency of runoff along with the availability of sediment currently persistent higher discharge during the snowmelt season contributed on average 51 range 43 in p301 and 60 in p301 and 63 range 56 in b200 and 72 in b204 of the total suspended sediment yield in providence and bull sites respectively in the future the extent of shifts in both runoff regime and sediment sources availability remains highly uncertain as discussed earlier annual total sediment yield was positively correlated with qmax and ct based on the historical observation an earlier shift in ct would imply a reduction in annual total sediment yield however an increase in q max through more extreme precipitation or increased rain on snow events along with enhanced sediment supply between rainfall events as the catchments go through wetting and dry cycles can lead to an overall increase in total sediment yield similar findings have been reported in other mediterranean high mountain catchments of spain lana renault et al 2011 mano et al 2009 also stated the important role of snowmelt in transporting most of the suspended sediment i e 50 in mediterranean watersheds lana renault et al 2011 also found the absence of bedload during snowmelt events due to insufficient energy of snowmelt runoff to move particle sizes greater than 2 mm hunsaker and neary 2012 compared the bedload rates and changes in channel morphology and found as much as twenty times more sediment originating from streambanks than those from headcuts prolonged and consistent high flows diurnal fluctuations and increased turbulence during the snowmelt season are more likely to destabilize streambanks scour the channel and transport the solids in the water column or along the bed anderson et al 2000 than short lived rain driven discharge events of similar magnitude as mentioned previously the providence catchments are in the rain snow transition zone and precipitation phase at this location is highly sensitive to temperature klos et al 2014 safeeq et al 2016 soils in these catchments contain a significant portion of gravel johnson et al 2011 which along with sand currently dominate the composition of the bedload hunsaker and neary 2012 in bull catchments the average gravel and sand content was 6 31 and 67 88 whereas for providence catchments they varied in the range of 3 16 and 76 81 respectively hunsaker and neary 2012 however the average silt content of most of these catchments was less than 10 except for b201 12 p303 12 and p304 16 an increase in temperature will lead to more prevalent rain initiated runoff events which in turn will likely mobilize more coarse sediment this will also shift the timing of the sediment transport as the runoff timing shifts earlier in the season similar results also have been reported in an alpine catchment costa et al 2018 that the temporal shift in temperature changes the driving force of suspended sediment from ice melt and snowmelt to rainfall the lack of snow on the ground surface increases the chance of erosion during heavy rainfall events annual bedload of providence is better correlated with flood flows q max r 2 between 0 88 and 0 94 than average annual flows q mean r 2 between 0 75 and 0 91 or flow timing ct r 2 between 0 13 and 0 45 suggesting discharge pulses from snowmelt were incapable of moving coarse sediment downstream this may be driven by a lack of supply as the bankfull discharge common during the snowmelt season generally exceeded the effective discharge nolan et al 1987 as the snowmelt contribution to runoff diminishes sediment production will be concentrated within the rainy season typically between october april safeeq and hunsaker 2016 4 3 effect of forest management our study found that the impacts of forest management on total sediment yield were confounded by the drought despite the observed changes in post treatment runoff in providence bart et al 2021 changes in sediment yield with respect to control were within the same range as those observed in untreated catchment p303 the intensity of the treatments at krew was relatively low and the impacts were distant from streams lydersen et al 2019 several catchments showed up to a 28 increase in estimated sediment yield with respect to their control catchments but these changes may have been an artifact of the 2012 2015 drought that coincided with the post treatment period in years soon after treatment when treatment impacts are generally highest many streams had low streamflow safeeq and hunsaker 2016 and had very little capacity to mobilize sediment forest management activities with ground disturbance such as the mechanical thinning and prescribed burning at krew were expected to increase sediment production gomi et al 2005 higher post management sediment yields are often associated with an increase in sediment supply from excessive ground disturbance safeeq et al 2020 and extreme rainfall events bathurst and iroumé 2014 grant and wolff 1991 rainato et al 2017 robichaud et al 2016 swank et al 2001 mechanical thinning in krew was performed using a combination of feller bunchers hand felling and ground based skidding that was likely to disturb the soil and change soil physical properties solgi et al 2016 mechanical equipment was not allowed within 30 m of the stream bank trees could be felled within 15 m of the stream and dragged out prescribed fire can also remove ground cover and alter soil properties like infiltration leading to increased erosion certini 2005 debano 1991 it is likely that the lack of hydrologic drivers during prolonged drought allowed our catchments to recover from management related physical changes in the landscape similar results have been shown in post wildfire conditions where drought after fires resulted in minimal response florsheim et al 2017 mayor et al 2007 wagenbrenner et al 2021b 4 4 uncertainty implementation constraints associated with field experiments and monitoring can introduce uncertainty and are worth highlighting among these the one with the largest impact on the results of this study involved sampling of suspended sediment first although stream discharge measurements in primary catchments started in 2003 suspended sediment sampling did not begin until late 2006 additionally due to logistical and staffing constraints twice as many samples were collected between 2013 and 2016 than in the preceding six years with no sampling in water years 2011 and 2012 supplementary fig s5 this unbalanced sampling may have influenced our rating curves towards drought years having fewer samples during the pre treatment period also limited our ability to develop separate pre and post treatment rating curves at the individual catchment level second the discharge range for suspended sediment samples across all catchments 0 00027 1 6 m3 s was well below the maximum observed discharge from krew catchments supplementary fig s5 except at b204 the highest sampled discharge values had recurrence intervals of less than 2 5 years although measured discharges above the upper limit of suspended sediment sampling were less than 1 5 of all the 15 minute discharge records their contributions to total suspended sediment yields were in some cases substantial the percentage of suspended sediment yield generated from discharge above the upper limit of sampled discharge for suspended sediment ranged from 15 in d102 to 58 in p300 and 18 in t003 to 43 in b201 these high discharge events are often short lived hence challenging to sample although the automated isco samplers were set to trigger during high streamflow a maximum of 12 samples could be taken during a high flow event nonetheless considering the non linear relationship between sediment flux and discharge 2 a paucity of sediment samples during these high discharge events may have caused underestimation of suspended sediment yields additionally as mentioned earlier the lower trapping efficiency of sediment ponds during high flows may have caused underestimation of bedload yield verstraeten and poesen 2001 third suspended sediment for integrating catchments b200 and p300 may have been under reported from the flow disruption by the instream flumes and settling of fine sediments in the upstream sediment ponds pond deposited sediment which includes some fraction of the suspended sediment richardson et al 2020 stacy et al 2015 from the stream network above p300 and b200 were removed each year the fraction of clay and silt in the bedload sediment upstream from p300 ranged between 56 in p303 and 71 in p304 similarly 39 b203 44 b204 and 74 b201 of the sediment materials upstream from b200 were clay and silt stacy et al 2015 however considering the other sources of uncertainty e g laboratory analysis rating curves sampling as discussed earlier and the overall small contribution of bedload sediment to the total sediment yield the influence of upstream sediment ponds probably was minimal 5 conclusions continuous discharge and sediment data from 10 headwater catchments in the southern sierra nevada allowed us to quantify the magnitude and spatio temporal variability in background sediment yield and assess potential changes under future climate and forest management conditions we showed that the background sediment yields in these catchments are comparable to reported values for forested catchments in california and other parts of the western united states although the headwater catchments were selected to have similar landscape characteristics and are adjacent to each other within the two sites we found their average annual total sediment yields to be highly variable ranging between 12 mg km2 and 241 mg km2 we also found the contribution of bedload sediment to the total sediment yield to be negligible an undisturbed catchment in the teakettle experimental forest t003 part of the bull site had an estimated mean annual sediment yield of 12 mg km2 range 1 5 30 mg km2 and can serve as a reference for background sediment yields in the southern sierra nevada the area normalized measured suspended sediment concentrations of bull and providence were in the range of 39 92 mg l km2 and 98 195 mg l km2 respectively catchment aspect annual maximum discharge and center of flow timing together were able to explain 77 variance of the total suspended and bedload annual sediment yield a statistically significant effect of precipitation phase rain vs snow on the sediment discharge relationship was also found loss of snowpack under a warming climate may increase the contribution of bedload sediment as the streams become flashier effects of forest management treatments were not significant and were confounded within the drought signal our study illustrated the challenges in paired catchment based attribution analysis under varying climate conditions such as extreme droughts this study provides the first long term 10 years suspended and bedload sediment results for multiple catchments with varying land use and management conditions in the southern sierra nevada additional research is needed to further improve our understanding of forest management impacts on erosion and sediment delivery at varying spatial and temporal scales and under different weather climate patterns credit authorship

3036,the magnitude of sediment yield from headwater catchments is controlled by the interactions among hydrology geomorphology and soil disturbance in montane regions like the sierra nevada snow is one of the main factors controlling the timing and magnitude of hydrological fluxes however the role of snow on modulating spatial and temporal variation of sediment yield remains unclear using 120 site years of sediment yield data from 10 headwater catchments drainage area 50 475 ha we examined the sediment yield characteristics across an elevational gradient 1 777 2 381 m elevation in the southern sierra nevada across space and time we calculated an average annual suspended sediment yield of 62 147 mg km2 in contrast the measured mean annual bedload yield from the study catchments was small 1 1 2 4 mg km2 a linear mixed effects model showed that maximum annual discharge alone can only explain 24 marginal r 2 0 24 of the variance in sediment yield similarly the hypsometric integral which is often used as a metric for erosion susceptibility showed no predictive power marginal r 2 0 005 as much as 65 of the variance in sediment yield can be explained by fixed effects when snow related drivers i e center of flow timing and aspect were included in the model along with maximum annual discharge suggesting a strong influence of snowmelt moreover the relationship between area normalized suspended sediment yield qs and unit discharge q was significantly different between rain and snow events p 0 001 both average slope α and exponent β terms of the q s α q β relationship across the ten catchments were higher for rainfall α 5 8 β 1 84 than those for snowmelt α 3 1 β 1 77 events as the erosion severity and power were higher during rainfall than the snowmelt events a shift in the precipitation form from snow to rain under a warming climate will likely increase sediment yield these results provide critical insights on background sediment yield in the southern sierra nevada and likely changes under future climate keywords sediment yield forest management paired catchment sierra nevada snow transition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forested and snow laden mountains of the sierra nevada provide more than 60 of california s developed water supply sierra nevada conservancy 2014 dams and reservoirs on the western slope of the sierra nevada play an integral role in bridging the timing mismatch between seasonal cycles of precipitation and water demand for california much of the mountain runoff on average 29 km3 dettinger and anderson 2015 is held behind dams during the rainy winter and early spring snowmelt before it is released to customers during the peak summer usage however these mountain streams across the united states are also major conduits for non point source water pollutants such as sediment and nutrients that cause degradation of instream habitat quality and reservoir capacity kemp et al 2011 podolak and doyle 2015 schleiss et al 2016 united states environmental protection agency 2016a united states environmental protection agency 2016b in the united states half of the assessed 1 787 918 km or 31 4 of the total waters rivers and streams are classified as either threatened or impaired united states environmental protection agency 2016a united states environmental protection agency 2016b in california nearly 90 of assessed rivers and streams 340 397 km or 33 of the total waters are classified as water quality impaired with temperature and sedimentation siltation as the top two causes nearly 60 of the assessed rivers and streams and 70 of reservoirs lakes and ponds in california require determination of new total maximum daily loads tmdl united states environmental protection agency 2016a united states environmental protection agency 2016b further many california reservoirs are losing water storage capacity minear and kondolf 2009 estimated as much as 2 1 109 m3 of sediment deposited in california reservoirs between 1890 and 2008 this represents a loss of 4 5 of the statewide total reservoir storage the cumulative sedimentation is predicted to reach 7 1 109 m3 by year 2200 which is 15 of statewide reservoir storage capacity this historic and future loss in reservoir storage alone is quite significant considering the removal cost and lack of flexibility for building additional storage lund 2011 2014 increased water demand curtailment of groundwater use and decreased snow storage during winter months due to climate change will result in increased reliance on reservoir storage these coarse scale estimates provide one view of sedimentation evaluating background sediment yield understanding site scale variability in sediment transport and identifying predictive variables for sediment yield such as geomorphology land use management and climatic controls could improve management of reservoir sedimentation and achieve water quality standards borah et al 2006 costa et al 2018 however the past literature reported mixed observations on drivers of erosion and sediment yield for example catchment lithology and relief were found to be key drivers of sediment yield in basins with size less than 103 km2 aalto et al 2006 andrews and antweiler 2012 but not in basins with size over 105 km2 syvitski and milliman 2007 in the rocky mountains mueller and pitlick 2013 found that the relative sediment supplies in basins ranging between 1 4 and 35 000 km2 were dominantly controlled by lithology and showed very little correlation to relief mean basin slope and drainage density stallman et al 2005 reported a sharp contrast in sediment production between the geologic terrains of older western cascades and relatively young high cascades where the former was represented by only 10 catchment area but accounted for 62 of the sediment yield similarly mueller et al 2016 showed a strong relationship between sediment composition i e suspended versus bedload and lithology the linkages between precipitation temperature and activation and cessation of runoff and sediment sources are also critical especially in mountainous regions impacted by changing climate mano et al 2009 costa et al 2018 the magnitude and intensity of sediment transfer associated with the snowmelt processes differ from rainfall driven events in the mediterranean region where the snowmelt controls a major part of the discharge during spring and summer season the transition in sediment regime from fine particle to coarser bedload was observed lana renault et al 2011 similarly changes in land cover from forest management activities and or wildfires can also alter the geomorphic regime safeeq et al 2020 limited studies exist on long term background sediment production rates in the sierra nevada riebe et al 2000 2001 investigated long term erosion rates in the southern sierra nevada using cosmogenic nuclide data and found no correlation with climate and concluded that inferring patterns of sediment delivery using hillslope gradient alone can be misleading at shorter time scales sediment inputs to lake tahoe in the central sierra nevada have been studied extensively and show strong spatial and temporal variability due to differences in climate geology and land use coats et al 2016 carl 1976 langlois et al 2005 reuter and miller 2000 simon et al 2003 studies in california s coast ranges go back to as early as the 1950s but focused mainly on documenting sediment yields associated with timber harvest and forest roads cafferata and reid 2013 lewis et al 2001 richardson et al 2020 numerous field studies on post disturbance specifically post fire sediment delivery rates are also scattered spatially throughout the state cole et al 2020 olsen et al 2021 robichaud et al 2013 2008 wohlgemuth et al 2001 however considering the range of variability in hydrology climate and geology in california these studies provide limited specific applicability beyond their local landscapes looking at the 1 300 km2 lake tahoe basin alone median suspended sediment yield varied by orders of magnitude between less than 0 5 mg km2 year to as much as 14 mg km2 year simon et al 2003 this variability was largely controlled by the differences in precipitation and the amount of upstream disturbance the variations in sediment yield over space and time were even larger when looking across the pacific coast region of the united states at the smaller forested catchment scale with area between 0 02 and 16 2 km2 reported sediment yields were found to vary by a factor of 104 0 05 550 mg km2 year gomi et al 2005 across larger catchments and geomorphic regimes o connor et al 2014 analyzed data from a range of basins in northern california and oregon with size ranging from 0 6 to 6906 km2 and reported bedload yields between 1 4 and 395 mg km2 year similarly czuba et al 2011 reported sediment yield variations between 1 3 and 584 mg km2 year from the major rivers draining into puget sound and its adjacent waters drainage area between 181 and 220 149 km2 looking at the sediment yield variations over time ambers 2001 reported sediment yield in the range of 38 and 244 mg km2 year with a long term average yield of 98 mg km2 year from the 686 km2 dorena lake watershed in the western oregon while the underlying hydrogeomorphic conditions in these studies are much different from those in the southern sierra nevada these studies provide a basis for documenting and understanding locally relevant background sediment production hydrologic landscapes of the sierra nevada are affected by climate drought and disease resulting in tree mortality wildfires and other forms of disturbance that can alter the sediment regime wildfires are becoming more frequent bigger and more severe bedsworth et al 2018 warmer temperatures and loss of snowpack in the sierra nevada fuel the fires and alter the hydrology with higher rain triggered winter peak flows safeeq et al 2016 westerling et al 2006 the recent 2020 creek fire 2020 north complex fire 2021 caldor fire and 2021 dixie fire are examples of wildfire destruction in the source watersheds of california this trend is projected to intensify in the future das et al 2013 huning and aghakouchak 2018 but its full range of geomorphic impacts is largely unclear with some indication that self organization of channels may buffer the influence of climate signal evident in discharge goudie 2006 phillips and jerolmack 2016 the amount of active forest and fuel management which is on the rise is also modifying the landscape significantly gomi et al 2005 north et al 2015 safeeq et al 2020 rachels et al 2020 quantified the effect of forest harvesting on sediment sources in oregon coast range headwater streams they discovered that sediment loss from the harvested area was 10 6 times greater than streambank and 4 5 times greater than unharvested areas bywater reyes et al 2017 2018 showed catchment lithology and physiography as dominant controls on suspended sediment yield with catchments underlying friable lithologies and steeper slopes being more susceptible to erosion after contemporary forest management wise and o connor 2016 developed a spatially explicit suspended sediment yield model for western oregon and found lithology and burned area along with precipitation explained 64 of the variability in suspended sediment yield olsen et al 2021 studied the effects of the 2013 rim fire and post fire salvage logging on rill connectivity and sediment yield in the sierra nevada however they did not find any significant change in mean rill density or log transformed normalized sediment yield between logged and control catchments soil disturbance related to road construction or maintenance timber harvest and forest thinning or other management can also alter the erosion and sediment delivery dynamics of headwater streams rachels et al 2020 however the impact of these anthropogenic and natural activities on landscape geomorphology varies with space and time the purpose of this research was to investigate long term suspended and bedload sediment yields and assess underlying geomorphic and climatic controls we analyzed suspended sediment concentration along with sediment load or yield due to their varying implications on aquatic and geomorphic processes we utilized a unique dataset with 120 site years 10 catchments 12 years of high resolution sediment and discharge data across an elevational gradient to answer the following research questions 1 how does the sediment concentration and yield vary in space and time 2 what are the key hydrogeomorphic and climatic controls on sediment yields in the sierra nevada and 3 to what extent do forest management treatments i e tree thinning and understory prescribed burns affect sediment yields 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kings river experimental watersheds krew established in 2002 are active research sites located within the kings river basin in the southern sierra nevada of california fig 1 krew arecomprised of eight primary and two integrating catchments ranging in size from 0 5 to 4 7 km2 table 1 three primary catchments nest within each integrating catchment p300 and b200 fig 1 the ten catchments are organized in two clusters across the rain snow transition zone consisting of the lower elevation providence and higher elevation bull sites fig 2 catchments at the providence site drain to the pine flat reservoir through big creek except for teakettle t003 catchments at the bull site drain to the north fork of the kings river through dinkey creek t003 drains directly to the north fork of the kings river further upstream the climate is described as mediterranean with cold wet winters and warm dry summers long term 1981 2010 average annual precipitation across the 10 catchments ranged from 1 026 mm in p300 to 1 234 mm in t003 and the mean daily air temperatures varied between 8 c in b203 and 10 c in d102 daly et al 2008 the period of current research was 2004 2016 which includes the 2012 2015 drought supplementary fig s1 during the study period mean annual precipitation of bull and providence was 1314 mm and 1208 mm whereas the mean annual air temperature was 10 c and 7 c respectively however during drought years 2012 2015 the mean annual precipitation was 755 mm and 866 mm which is 46 and 44 less than the non drought years 2004 2011 and 2016 for providence and bull respectively the krew catchments are underlain by mesozoic granitic rocks in providence and early proterozoic to cretaceous mixed rocks mostly schist and gneiss in bull jennings et al 2010 regolith thickness is highest in providence and constrained by temperature at higher elevations o geen et al 2018 much of the kings river basin was glaciated during the pliocene and early pleistocene gillespie and clark 2011 gillespie and zehfuss 2004 kaufman et al 2003 well drained shaver and gerle cagwin soils hydrologic soil group b dominate the lower elevation providence and highly drained cagwin soils hydrologic soil group a dominate the higher elevation bull catchments hunsaker et al 2012 the vegetation is characterized by mixed conifer forest primarily white fir abies concolor ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa jeffrey pine pinus jeffreyi sugar pine pinus lambertiana and incense cedar calocedrus decurrens bull catchments contain a larger amount of red fir abies magnifica in the range of 19 44 hunsaker et al 2012 bare ground which is mostly rock outcrop in the bull catchments accounts for 0 4 of the land cover hypsometric or area altitude curves provide the relative area of a catchment to the relative elevation above the catchment mouth and can illustrate a range of conditions inequilibrium convex up landform associated with diffusive dominated catchments equilibrium original and monadnock concave up landform associated with fluvial dominated catchments strahler 1952 cohen et al 2008 vivoni et al 2008 these curves can also be described as toeless to subdued concave up or type i j shaped or type ii and convex up or type iii vachtman et al 2013 morphologically all the catchments except b201 show convex up mostly in the middle of the hypsometric curves indicating most erosion in the upper part of the catchment fig 2 b201 shows a concave up hypsometry suggesting more erosion in the middle part of the catchment the hypsometric integral hi is often used to quantitatively describe the geomorphic differences reflected in the hypsometric curve with higher hi values indicating more erosion susceptibility singh et al 2008 the hi values across the ten catchments range between 0 448 for b201 to 0 689 for p301 both providence and bull catchments can be classified as steep fig 2 with an average slope ranging between 21 in b204 to as much as 37 in d102 table 1 catchment aspect is dominated by south and west facing slopes estimated catchment drainage density varies between 4 6 km km2 in b203 to as high as 10 1 km km2 in d102 and generally increases with decreasing catchment elevation r 2 0 85 increasing slope r 2 0 54 and increasing vegetation cover r 2 0 64 as inferred from the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi table 1 2 2 forest management treatments the paired watershed design of krew was implemented to assess the impacts of two forest management treatments with a goal to better understand their impact on hydrology and geomorphology the first phase of treatment was performed in the providence and bull catchments between july and november 2012 timber harvest and mechanical thinning using feller bunchers and hand felling combined with ground based skidding were performed in p301 d102 b201 and b204 table 1 lydersen et al 2019 in the second phase prescribed fire was applied in bull catchments b203 and b204 during fall 2013 the prescribed fire treatment was delayed in providence catchments p301 and p303 because of unfavorable weather and ignition conditions the subsequent prescribed burn in providence occurred in late 2016 but falls outside of our analysis period as a result catchment p303 remained untreated during our analysis catchments p304 and t003 were the controls for providence and bull respectively the forest management treatments at krew were not very intensive and had a negligible impact on basal area canopy cover and tree density lydersen et al 2019 the thinning intensities of providence and bull were 23 trees ha and 33 trees ha respectively further the thinning removed 4 5 m2 ha and 4 6 m2 ha basal areas from providence and bull catchments respectively lydersen et al 2019 however the treatments were not applied uniformly throughout the catchments in providence 71 area was undisturbed after thinning and 48 area was found unburned after prescribed fire similarly in bull 48 and 61 of the area were undisturbed and unburned after treatment respectively in terms of hydrologic response from these treatments bart et al 2021 found a statistically significant increase in streamflow in providence but not in bull 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 meteorology snow water equivalent swe was measured at upper providence up and upper bull ub at 15 minute intervals using rectangular snow pillows fig 1 each pillow consisted of four 1 2 1 5 m sections plumbed together and filled with non toxic antifreeze and connected to a sensotec pressure transducer honeywell inc columbus ohio the pressure of the snow was converted to an equivalent water depth swe daily average swe values were derived from 15 minute measurements safeeq and hunsaker 2016 2 3 2 streamflow streamflow was measured at 15 minute intervals using a combination of methods monitoring in the eight primary catchments began in fall 2003 the two integrating catchments p300 and b200 were added in 2005 and 2006 respectively all catchments except p300 b200 and t003 were equipped with dual parshall montana flumes constructed of structural fiberglass an upstream small flume 8 or 15 cm throat width 35 6 or 45 7 cm wall height measured low flows and a downstream large flume 30 61 91 or 122 cm throat width 91 5 cm wall height measured high flows fig 3 the distance between the two flumes varied from catchment to catchment and was less than 30 m p300 was equipped with a 120 degree v notch weir and t003 was gauged with a compound 90 degree v notch and rectangular weir the teakettle creek experimental forest was established in 1936 and the weir at t003 has been operational intermittently since 1938 kattelmann 1989 for b200 discharge was estimated using a rating curve at a natural cross section submersible pressure transducers manufactured by telog telog instruments victor new york solinst solinst canada ltd georgetown on or aquarod advanced measurements and controls inc camano island washington were installed inside a stilling well connected to the large flume where available otherwise placed directly in the stream similarly teledyne isco air bubbler modules teledyne isco lincoln nebraska were connected to small flumes where available otherwise placed directly in the stream manual discharge measurements were conducted using a sontek flowtracker acoustic doppler velocimeter flowtracker san diego california across a range of flows 0 0023 m3 s to 0 19 m3 s for developing the rating curve for b200 2 3 3 suspended sediment starting in fall 2006 stream water samples were collected at each site using teledyne isco model 6712 24 bottle sequential pump samplers teledyne isco lincoln nebraska water samples were retrieved for laboratory analysis on a bi weekly basis or sooner when necessary and weather permitted grab samples were also collected when possible however most of the water samples for the analysis came from the automated samplers stream stage was used to initiate sampling when the stage values rose to a pre specified level it triggered the pump sampler to begin sampling at a fixed time interval typically one sample every 15 30 min the trigger threshold values were manually adjusted frequently to account for seasonal changes in flow regime across all sites and years 2006 2016 1 267 water samples were collected and analyzed for suspended sediment concentration in the usda forestry sciences laboratory fresno ca however 41 samples were marked as erroneous due to negative suspended sediment concentration values and removed from the analysis all the water samples were processed within seven days of collection to avoid biological growth first all water samples were filtered using glass fiber filters 1 0 µm pore size and a vacuum pump astm d 3977 97 both filters and vacuum pump assemblies were rinsed using deionized water then filters were placed in an aluminum pan and oven dried at 105 c for 2 h oven dried filters were placed in a desiccator for overnight cooling before taking the dry weight and subsequent vacuum filtering of water samples materials greater than 6 mm in any dimension length or width were removed from the filter the filters with suspended sediment were oven heated to 105 c for at least 2 h before placing them again in a desiccator for overnight cooling and recording the dry weight the mass of suspended solids was calculated by subtracting the weight of the clean dry filter and aluminum pan from the total dry filter aluminum pan and sediment weight finally we divided the mass of suspended solids by the volume of water sample to calculate the suspended sediment concentration ssc mg l 2 3 4 bedload sediment sediment and organic matter deposits from the eight primary catchments were measured annually using lined settling ponds these settling ponds were in natural deposition areas of the channel immediately below the large flume fig 3 except at t003 where a permanent concrete walled weir pond with a storage capacity of 200 m3 was constructed in 1938 the settling ponds at the remaining sites were lined with 0 5 mm rubber pond liners and varied in storage capacity between 12 and 40 m3 for the annual bedload sediment collection streams were diverted settling ponds were drained and emptied the wet pond deposits were weighed in buckets to the nearest 0 5 kg volume proportional sub samples were collected for determining the dry mass percent organic matter and particle size distribution organic matter was separated into three different classes i large organic matter such as sticks 1 cm diameter and 10 cm length ii coarse organic matter such as twigs needles sticks bark cones size less than large organic matter but large enough to extract with tweezers iii fine organic matter such as wood fragments size equivalent to sediment large and coarse organic matter were separated from the pond material before the sediment was removed and the dry weight was determined in the laboratory the fine organic matter fraction was determined by loss on ignition 24 h at 500 c of an oven dried subsample of the sediment eagan et al 2007 hunsaker and neary 2012 particle size distribution was determined for representative samples of the oven dried mineral fraction following a standard sieve analysis using 2 1 0 5 0 25 0 125 and 0 065 mm sieve sizes eagan et al 2007 because of the difficulty in separating the deposited suspended sediment from the bedload sediment in the mineral fraction deposited in the ponds we assumed that all the mineral fraction was bedload sediment trapping efficiencies of these settling ponds were not measured but inferring from other studies it may have been as low as 50 during high discharge events richardson et al 2020 verstraeten and poesen 2001 further information on meteorological streamflow and sediment measurements and quality control are available in earlier publications hunsaker and safeeq 2017 safeeq and hunsaker 2016 wagenbrenner et al 2021a 2 4 sediment rating curves and yields suspended sediment rating curves were developed in the r environment r core team 2020 for each site by regressing the catchment area a normalized suspended sediment concentrations ssc a mg l km2 from the samples against a range of flow metrics as explanatory variables table 2 fig 4 ideally these rating curves should be developed separately for pre and post treatment periods to account for any shift in the relationship between sediment and explanatory variables due to treatments however we felt that the highly unbalanced sample size for pre and post treatment observed suspended sediment data was problematic for developing separate rating curves at individual sites supplementary fig s5 the explanatory variables included in the rating curves were corresponding discharge lagged discharge by 2 3 4 6 and 24 h l s day time of water year as a decimal starting october 1 mid night as zero and fourier sine and cosine series of sample date time using smwrbase package with k max 1 lorenz 2015 with the exceptions of day and fourier sine and cosine series all other explanatory variables were natural log transformed and centered cohn et al 1992 prior to building the model explanatory variable day was only centered and fourier sine and cosine series were used in the model without any data transformation also since automated and grab samples were instantaneous while discharge was recorded at 15 min intervals corresponding discharge values were extracted by linearly interpolating the two adjacent discharge values an initial subset of 12 models were developed nbest 3 nvmax 4 using the regsubsets function all possible subsets regression from the leaps package in r lumley and miller 2020 the nbest parameter identifies best performing top 3 in this case models and nvmax parameter sets the maximum number of variables in this case 4 that can be used in the model the best regression model was selected based on anova with statistical significance level p 0 05 adjusted coefficient of regression and akaike information criterion aic the relationship between ssc and q for each catchment can be described including all candidate variables as 1 ln ssc a a b ln q c ln q 2 d ln q 3 e ln q 4 f ln q 6 g ln q 24 h d a y i s

sinday and cosday time trend day and flow dependence the most frequently significant predictors are shown in bold from this point onward ssca is used as the acronym for area normalized suspended sediment concentration mg l km2 overall predicted ssca using models developed from equation 1 explained 73 of the variability in measured suspended sediment concentration table 2 fig 4 at the individual catchment level adjusted coefficients of determination were between 0 53 for catchment d102 p301 and 0 75 for catchment t003 table 2 ssca was positively related to ln q suggesting an increase in one will lead to an increase in another and vice versa with few exceptions ssca was negatively related to the lagged discharge values that indicates a delayed response in which either ssca declined along the recession limb after a peak discharge or increased along the rising limb derived suspended sediment rating curves for each catchment were applied to 15 min discharge measurements and other related explanatory variables table 2 to create a continuous record of ssca area normalized suspended sediment yields mg km2 were calculated by first estimating the sediment flux q s mg s km2 by multiplying the ssca mg l km2 with the corresponding 15 min discharge q l s we then aggregated the 15 minute suspended sediment flux values by water year to derive annual suspended yields and added the corresponding annual bedload yields to derive annual total sediment yields for each catchment 2 5 climatic and hydrogeomorphic controls on sediment yields effects of climate and other hydrogeomorphic variables on suspended sediment and total sediment yields were analyzed using two approaches first we used the power law relationship between area normalized instantaneous suspended sediment flux qs and discharge q to compare the differences in the relationships between rain and snowmelt driven runoff events the qs was used as opposed to a more typical ssca q relationship to account for differences in dilution from disproportional peak and baseflow behavior between rain and snowmelt events power law relationships took the form 2 q s α q a β where q s mg s km2 is area normalized and flow weighted ssca q a is discharge per unit area l s km2 and α and β describe the erosion severity and erosive power respectively asselman 2000 the β parameter is usually greater than one indicating an exponential effect of q on sediment transport a typical range of β parameter for suspended sediment transport range from 1 42 to 2 96 in different physiographic settings morehead et al 2003 sediment samples were grouped between rain and snow using the snow water equivalent swe information from the two meteorological stations fig 1 storms and corresponding ssc samples were identified as rain when there was no measured snow water equivalent based on this criterion 502 out of 1 267 samples were identified as rain and 765 as snowmelt swe data from ub were used for bull catchments and up for classifying providence catchments we recognize that some of the ssc samples classified as snowmelt driven may also have included rainfall e g rain on snow events guan et al 2016 second we used a linear mixed effects model to explore the hydrogeomorphic controls on the total i e suspended and bedload sediment yield from the krew catchments prior to building the model annual total sediment yield data were log transformed to approximately normalize the error term fixed effects in the model were annual maximum discharge q max center of flow timing ct defined as the day of water year by which 50 of the annual flow had passed the gauge and catchment aspect aspect to capture the precipitation regime and variability in snow among catchments hypsometric integral hi was included as a geomorphic control catchment elevation relief slope drainage density and ndvi were also explored but none of these variables were statistically significant predictors of annual total sediment yield similarly annual minimum and average discharge were also explored but eventually left out in favor of q max catchment ids were treated as a random effect in the model we used the mumin package barton and barton 2015 in r for estimating coefficients of determination to describe marginal variation in sediment explained by the fixed effects and conditional variation in sediment explained by both fixed and random effects bywater reyes et al 2018 3 results 3 1 suspended sediment concentration the area normalized suspended sediment concentration ssca between 2007 and 2016 varied by at least three orders of magnitude at each location fig 5 the average ssca were lower in the high elevation bull catchments 39 92 mg l km2 as compared to low elevation providence catchments 98 195 mg l km2 looking at individual catchment groups the highest ssca in providence was in p304 followed by d102 and both were significantly greater than the other three providence catchments fig 5c at bull ssca was highest in b201 and significantly different from the rest of the catchments fig 5d the catchments at the bull site were more similar than the catchments within the providence site the integrating catchments in providence and bull p300 and b200 respectively had the lowest ssca and the ssca for p300 was significantly lower than all other providence catchments fig 5c both catchments received fall rain along with several rain on snow events throughout the winter wet season neiman et al 2008 discharge in bull mainly originated from snowmelt and peaked in mid may supplementary fig s2 in contrast the peak snowmelt discharge in providence was usually two weeks earlier the ssca in bull catchments were more variable from month to month than those in providence with two distinct peaks in october and january supplementary fig s3 both catchment groups showed relatively high ssca during early fall rain flush there was also a noticeable lag between the timing of peak ssca and peak discharge in bull but not in providence highest ssca in bull after the fall flush occurred in january as compared to peak discharge in mid may peak timing of the sediment flux q s ssca instantaneous discharge q in providence coincided with the average center of flow timing i e around march as opposed to coinciding with peak snowmelt discharge in bull supplementary fig s4 the sediment production characteristics in terms of erosion severity α and erosive power β were highly variable between and within the two catchment groups table 3 overall combining data from all catchments within each group the α parameter was higher in providence 5 92 as compared to bull 2 39 in contrast the β parameter in providence 1 67 was very similar to that in bull 1 68 however this pattern was not consistent in individual catchments suggesting a strong spatial variability within a catchment group looking at the α and β coefficients between rain and snowmelt flow types across all catchments we found a statistically significant difference p 0 001 based on one way anova in the intercept i e α of the sediment production discharge relationships 2 between rain and snowmelt events the difference in the slope of the linear regression β between rain and snowmelt events was not statistically significant p 0 66 at the individual catchment group level both slope and intercept of the linear regression were statistically similar p 0 22 between rain and snowmelt events in bull however the opposite was true for providence the α coefficients from the combined models in each catchment group ranged from 11 0 for rain to 2 8 for snowmelt in providence and 1 94 for rain and 1 29 for snowmelt in bull in contrast the β coefficient was 1 57 for rain and 1 85 for snowmelt in providence and 1 90 for rain and 1 79 for snowmelt in bull in all providence catchments the α coefficients were higher for rainfall and the β coefficients were higher for snowmelt this effect of storm type in bull was highly variable between catchments but in the regressions combining all bull catchments both α and β coefficients were greater for rainfall events table 3 3 2 total sediment yield the average annual total sediment yield in providence 85 mg km2 was twice as much as in bull 42 mg km2 annual total sediment yield was highly variable standard deviation 148 mg km2 across all sites and years fig 6 additionally as compared to bull standard deviation 61 mg km2 annual sediment yield in providence standard deviation 200 mg km2 was more variable from year to year during 2004 2016 the highest sediment yield 1 074 mg km2 was recorded in 2006 a relatively wet year supplementary fig s1 for p304 while the lowest sediment yield 0 1 mg km2 was recorded in p301 in 2015 during a multi year drought average annual total sediment yield ranged between a low of 11 7 t003 and a high of 240 8 mg km2 p304 across the 10 catchments table 4 the contribution of bedload to the total sediment yield was fairly small 0 4 p303 to 3 8 p304 mg km2 or 1 to 7 of total yield table 4 total sediment yield showed no significant statistical correlation p 0 05 with the selected geomorphic descriptors among the selected geomorphic descriptors catchment aspect and hypsometric integral hi showed the highest partial correlations with the total sediment yield 0 62 and 0 64 respectively catchment drainage density was a distant third with a partial correlation of 0 41 in terms of hydroclimatic descriptors total sediment yield was significantly correlated with annual maximum discharge q max and center of flow timing ct with partial correlations of 0 27 p 0 003 and 0 53 p 0 001 respectively table 5 the best mixed effects model based on aic qmax ct aspect was able to describe 77 of the variation in the annual total sediment yield model 8 in table 6 fig 7 the marginal and conditional r 2 explains the variance of mixed effects model by fixed effects and by both fixed and random effects respectively all three variables in the best model are associated with the sediment yield directly or indirectly the catchment aspect influences the energy flux of the landscape along with the soil moisture runoff and vegetation dynamics thus it has a strong impact on sediment yield estimation similarly ct was linked to the highest observed sediment flux in providence and 2 months lag was observed between ct and the highest observed sediment flux in the bull catchment supplementary fig s3 moreover as can be seen from the spread around 1 1 line fig 7 the mean absolute error 40 mg km2 was small with respect to the mean 60 mg km2 and standard deviation 148 mg km2 the model with q max model 1 in table 6 as the only predictor was able to explain 44 of the variation in the total sediment yield but only 24 of the variation was explained by the fixed effect the best single predictor model was for ct a metric of snowmelt which explained 68 of the total variance model 2 in table 6 combining q max and ct model 5 in table 6 resulted in the highest conditional r 2 with the two fixed effects explaining 55 of the variance in the total sediment yield adding the aspect increased the variance explained by the fixed effects from 55 in model 5 to 65 in this model model 8 in table 6 but marginally lowered the conditional r 2 surprisingly adding the hypsometric integral hi did not improve the conditional r2 of the q max and ct model model 5 in table 6 or of the best model based on aic model 8 in table 6 both hi and aspect are constant within a catchment thus variation of sediment yields due to these variables was accounted for by the random effect i e catchment specifying hi and aspect as fixed effects shifts some of the random effects over to the fixed portion of the model increasing the marginal but not the conditional r 2 e g compare models 8 and 9 with model 5 3 3 effects of forest management on sediment the association between forest management and area normalized suspended sediment concentrations ssc a were analyzed by adding a dummy variable pre treatment 0 and post treatment 1 and its interaction with discharge term ln q in equation 1 effects of forest management were evident in some catchments at both providence and bull sites supplementary table s1 in providence both the treatment term and its interaction with discharge were statistically significant p 0 05 for d102 and p300 for p301 only the interaction term was statistically significant in bull only the treatment term was statistically significant for b201 and b204 and just the interaction term was significant in b200 neither the treatment nor the interaction term was statistically significant p 0 05 for b203 that received prescribed fire treatment only as mentioned previously skewed sampling of ssc towards the post treatment period supplementary fig s5 may influence the robustness of our catchment level forest management impact analysis to overcome this we combined all the data by site i e providence and bull and performed linear mixed effects modeling starting with the same variables as in table 2 and adding a dummy treatment variable pre treatment 0 and post treatment 1 and its interaction with discharge ln q this site based analysis showed a statistically significant difference in ssca between pre and post treatment periods in providence but not in bull supplementary table s2 for providence we found that both the treatment term and its interaction with discharge were statistically significant p 0 05 however the negative coefficients suggest that the shift in the rating curve may have been driven by the drought rather than forest management under similar discharge conditions forest management is expected to increase sediment production from increased supply while drought would likely reduce sediment production effects of forest management on total annual sediment yield suspended and bedload were analyzed after adding the treatment impact as a dummy variable in the best mixed effects model model 8 adding the treatment as an additional explanatory variable of total annual sediment yield significantly improved the model fit x 2 14 19 p 0 001 suggesting a significant shift in the total sediment yield during the post treatment period the aic decreased by 12 2 with marginal and conditional r 2 values rising slightly to 0 68 and 0 78 respectively another technique to evaluate the treatment effects on sediment is to compare the slope of observed sediment yields for treated and control catchments during pre and post treatment years fig 8 table 7 regression slopes of treated versus control sediment yields increased after treatment suggesting an increase in post treatment sediment yield relative to control except for p303 which received no treatment also the shifts in slope for thinned catchments were small suggesting a greater influence of prescribed fire on sediment yield than thinning however none of these shifts in regression slope were statistically significant p 0 05 because of the drought in 2012 2015 post treatment sediment yields in the controls i e p304 and t003 were lower than their pre treatment yields with very little to no overlap in range fig 8 therefore it is possible that the slope shifts are merely indicative of non linear relationships and drought rather than being treatment effects in terms of changes observed post treatment sediment yields were higher by 27 d102 and 28 p300 table 7 relative to those estimated by the pre treatment regressions treated versus control in p301 post treatment observed sediment yield was 72 lower than those estimated by the pre treatment regression in bull catchments observed post treatment sediment yields were higher relative to those estimated by the pre treatment regression by 2 in b204 3 in b200 and 19 in b204 in b201 observed post treatment sediment yield was 36 lower than those estimated by the model it was interesting to see a substantial increase in the total sediment yield in p303 a catchment with no treatment also all of this increased sediment in p303 was generated in 2016 the first normal precipitation year after the 2012 2015 drought bales et al 2018 safeeq and hunsaker 2016 this further suggests that these changes in sediment yield may have been an artifact of the drought rather than the forest management treatments 4 discussion 4 1 total sediment yield the average annual total sediment yield value of 63 mg km2 from the krew catchments is within the range of reported values for forested catchments in california and other parts of the western u s anderson 1954 gomi et al 2005 patric et al 1984 in the sierra nevada average annual sediment yield from the lake tahoe basin ranged from 0 7 to 67 9 mg km2 nolan and hill 1991 catchments in the lake tahoe study are comprised of a mixture of volcanic metamorphic and granitic rocks with scattered unconsolidated sediments that are more erodible than the soils at krew one of the lake tahoe catchments general creek drainage area of 19 3 km2 has comparable geology granitic and climate average annual precipitation 1 270 mm and temperature 5 8 c to krew and generated 17 6 mg km2 1981 1987 and 10 4 mg km2 1984 1987 of annual suspended sediment yield nolan and hill 1991 approximately 28 and 17 of the mean value at krew respectively analyzing the datasets of richardson and wagenbrenner 2020 the average total sediment yield for the north fork of caspar creek was found to be 43 mg km2 however caspar creek is rain dominated mean annual precipitation 1200 mm and relatively warmer than krew catchments with underlying marine sandstone and shale cafferata and reid 2013 richardson et al 2020 snowmelt driven systems produce less hillslope erosion and as a result lower sediment overall the only krew catchment that substantially exceeded the range for the sierra nevada was p304 which is a baseflow dominated stream safeeq and hunsaker 2016 eagan et al 2007 and has a mining history also the presence of channel bedrock is more dominant in the other krew catchments safeeq and hunsaker 2016 turowski et al 2011 suggest that even a small amount of bedrock exposure can make a stream act like a bedrock channel other factors such as low rock fraction in topsoil low proportion of exposed granite and ongoing down cutting of channels have been reported as possible mechanisms for higher sediment yields in p304 stacy et al 2015 hunsaker and neary 2012 eagan et al 2007 martin et al 2009 p304 had the highest by a factor of 4 coarse sediment or bedload yield among the studied catchments providing the necessary tool for channel incision in granitic catchments of the sierra nevada callahan et al 2019 despite the high sediment yield in p304 which is one of the two smallest catchments we found no relationship between suspended or total sediment yield and catchment area r2 0 03 p 0 6 catchment area and sediment yield are generally known to have a negative correlation griffiths et al 2006 however a positive correlation was also observed between turbidity and drainage area for 28 streams of the coast range of northern california klein et al 2012 a similar finding between sediment yield and area was observed in the north fork of caspar creek before the disturbance in the experimental catchments lewis et al 2001 the varying nature of this correlation is due to its dependency on multiple catchment variables i e slope vegetation cover and soil type bedload yield at krew was marginally correlated with the catchment area but statistically not significant r2 0 24 p 0 21 lack of correlation between sediment yield and drainage area at krew suggests that erosion processes at this scale are highly complex the transport limitation seems apparent when looking at the two integrating catchments b200 and p300 average annual total sediment yields from these two integrating catchments were only one third of the total sediment yield generated by the upstream catchments this shows a significant loss in sediment transport capacity as one moves downstream to lower elevation with less steep slopes while looking into individual catchments the total sediment yields of p301 and p303 are lesser than the p300 due to their lean flow conditions the ratio of steeper slopes to flat areas generally decreases with increasing catchment area as indicated by lower hi values for p300 and b200 table 1 fig 2 4 2 sediment yield and snow our results indicate a strong control of precipitation phase i e rain vs snow on measured ssca suspended sediment flux qs ssca instantaneous discharge q and total suspended and bedload sediment yield effects of the precipitation phase on ssca analyzed using a linear mixed effects model after adding a dummy variable snow 0 and rain 1 and its interaction with discharge ln q to the list of variables included in the sediment rating curve 1 showed a statistically significant p 0 05 positive association with the precipitation phase supplementary table s2 in terms of sediment fluxes measured qs for rainfall events were significantly p 0 001 higher than those for snow events under similar discharge this was also evident in the values of α and β 2 between rainfall and snowmelt events higher values of α for rainfall events in providence suggest higher erosion severity when compared with snowmelt driven events however snowmelt driven events have higher erosive power indicated by higher values of β when compared with rainfall events in contrast snow dominated bull catchments showed both higher erosion severity and erosive power during rainfall events except for β in b204 indicated by higher α and β values for rainfall driven events than those under snowmelt further it was observed that the measured suspended sediment fluxes were lower during april june the peak snowmelt season in bull site particularly supplementary fig s4 these findings suggest a likely increase in ssca and qs as the catchments transition from more snow to rain however the overall impact on the total annual sediment yield will depend on the future runoff regime both the magnitude and intermittency of runoff along with the availability of sediment currently persistent higher discharge during the snowmelt season contributed on average 51 range 43 in p301 and 60 in p301 and 63 range 56 in b200 and 72 in b204 of the total suspended sediment yield in providence and bull sites respectively in the future the extent of shifts in both runoff regime and sediment sources availability remains highly uncertain as discussed earlier annual total sediment yield was positively correlated with qmax and ct based on the historical observation an earlier shift in ct would imply a reduction in annual total sediment yield however an increase in q max through more extreme precipitation or increased rain on snow events along with enhanced sediment supply between rainfall events as the catchments go through wetting and dry cycles can lead to an overall increase in total sediment yield similar findings have been reported in other mediterranean high mountain catchments of spain lana renault et al 2011 mano et al 2009 also stated the important role of snowmelt in transporting most of the suspended sediment i e 50 in mediterranean watersheds lana renault et al 2011 also found the absence of bedload during snowmelt events due to insufficient energy of snowmelt runoff to move particle sizes greater than 2 mm hunsaker and neary 2012 compared the bedload rates and changes in channel morphology and found as much as twenty times more sediment originating from streambanks than those from headcuts prolonged and consistent high flows diurnal fluctuations and increased turbulence during the snowmelt season are more likely to destabilize streambanks scour the channel and transport the solids in the water column or along the bed anderson et al 2000 than short lived rain driven discharge events of similar magnitude as mentioned previously the providence catchments are in the rain snow transition zone and precipitation phase at this location is highly sensitive to temperature klos et al 2014 safeeq et al 2016 soils in these catchments contain a significant portion of gravel johnson et al 2011 which along with sand currently dominate the composition of the bedload hunsaker and neary 2012 in bull catchments the average gravel and sand content was 6 31 and 67 88 whereas for providence catchments they varied in the range of 3 16 and 76 81 respectively hunsaker and neary 2012 however the average silt content of most of these catchments was less than 10 except for b201 12 p303 12 and p304 16 an increase in temperature will lead to more prevalent rain initiated runoff events which in turn will likely mobilize more coarse sediment this will also shift the timing of the sediment transport as the runoff timing shifts earlier in the season similar results also have been reported in an alpine catchment costa et al 2018 that the temporal shift in temperature changes the driving force of suspended sediment from ice melt and snowmelt to rainfall the lack of snow on the ground surface increases the chance of erosion during heavy rainfall events annual bedload of providence is better correlated with flood flows q max r 2 between 0 88 and 0 94 than average annual flows q mean r 2 between 0 75 and 0 91 or flow timing ct r 2 between 0 13 and 0 45 suggesting discharge pulses from snowmelt were incapable of moving coarse sediment downstream this may be driven by a lack of supply as the bankfull discharge common during the snowmelt season generally exceeded the effective discharge nolan et al 1987 as the snowmelt contribution to runoff diminishes sediment production will be concentrated within the rainy season typically between october april safeeq and hunsaker 2016 4 3 effect of forest management our study found that the impacts of forest management on total sediment yield were confounded by the drought despite the observed changes in post treatment runoff in providence bart et al 2021 changes in sediment yield with respect to control were within the same range as those observed in untreated catchment p303 the intensity of the treatments at krew was relatively low and the impacts were distant from streams lydersen et al 2019 several catchments showed up to a 28 increase in estimated sediment yield with respect to their control catchments but these changes may have been an artifact of the 2012 2015 drought that coincided with the post treatment period in years soon after treatment when treatment impacts are generally highest many streams had low streamflow safeeq and hunsaker 2016 and had very little capacity to mobilize sediment forest management activities with ground disturbance such as the mechanical thinning and prescribed burning at krew were expected to increase sediment production gomi et al 2005 higher post management sediment yields are often associated with an increase in sediment supply from excessive ground disturbance safeeq et al 2020 and extreme rainfall events bathurst and iroumé 2014 grant and wolff 1991 rainato et al 2017 robichaud et al 2016 swank et al 2001 mechanical thinning in krew was performed using a combination of feller bunchers hand felling and ground based skidding that was likely to disturb the soil and change soil physical properties solgi et al 2016 mechanical equipment was not allowed within 30 m of the stream bank trees could be felled within 15 m of the stream and dragged out prescribed fire can also remove ground cover and alter soil properties like infiltration leading to increased erosion certini 2005 debano 1991 it is likely that the lack of hydrologic drivers during prolonged drought allowed our catchments to recover from management related physical changes in the landscape similar results have been shown in post wildfire conditions where drought after fires resulted in minimal response florsheim et al 2017 mayor et al 2007 wagenbrenner et al 2021b 4 4 uncertainty implementation constraints associated with field experiments and monitoring can introduce uncertainty and are worth highlighting among these the one with the largest impact on the results of this study involved sampling of suspended sediment first although stream discharge measurements in primary catchments started in 2003 suspended sediment sampling did not begin until late 2006 additionally due to logistical and staffing constraints twice as many samples were collected between 2013 and 2016 than in the preceding six years with no sampling in water years 2011 and 2012 supplementary fig s5 this unbalanced sampling may have influenced our rating curves towards drought years having fewer samples during the pre treatment period also limited our ability to develop separate pre and post treatment rating curves at the individual catchment level second the discharge range for suspended sediment samples across all catchments 0 00027 1 6 m3 s was well below the maximum observed discharge from krew catchments supplementary fig s5 except at b204 the highest sampled discharge values had recurrence intervals of less than 2 5 years although measured discharges above the upper limit of suspended sediment sampling were less than 1 5 of all the 15 minute discharge records their contributions to total suspended sediment yields were in some cases substantial the percentage of suspended sediment yield generated from discharge above the upper limit of sampled discharge for suspended sediment ranged from 15 in d102 to 58 in p300 and 18 in t003 to 43 in b201 these high discharge events are often short lived hence challenging to sample although the automated isco samplers were set to trigger during high streamflow a maximum of 12 samples could be taken during a high flow event nonetheless considering the non linear relationship between sediment flux and discharge 2 a paucity of sediment samples during these high discharge events may have caused underestimation of suspended sediment yields additionally as mentioned earlier the lower trapping efficiency of sediment ponds during high flows may have caused underestimation of bedload yield verstraeten and poesen 2001 third suspended sediment for integrating catchments b200 and p300 may have been under reported from the flow disruption by the instream flumes and settling of fine sediments in the upstream sediment ponds pond deposited sediment which includes some fraction of the suspended sediment richardson et al 2020 stacy et al 2015 from the stream network above p300 and b200 were removed each year the fraction of clay and silt in the bedload sediment upstream from p300 ranged between 56 in p303 and 71 in p304 similarly 39 b203 44 b204 and 74 b201 of the sediment materials upstream from b200 were clay and silt stacy et al 2015 however considering the other sources of uncertainty e g laboratory analysis rating curves sampling as discussed earlier and the overall small contribution of bedload sediment to the total sediment yield the influence of upstream sediment ponds probably was minimal 5 conclusions continuous discharge and sediment data from 10 headwater catchments in the southern sierra nevada allowed us to quantify the magnitude and spatio temporal variability in background sediment yield and assess potential changes under future climate and forest management conditions we showed that the background sediment yields in these catchments are comparable to reported values for forested catchments in california and other parts of the western united states although the headwater catchments were selected to have similar landscape characteristics and are adjacent to each other within the two sites we found their average annual total sediment yields to be highly variable ranging between 12 mg km2 and 241 mg km2 we also found the contribution of bedload sediment to the total sediment yield to be negligible an undisturbed catchment in the teakettle experimental forest t003 part of the bull site had an estimated mean annual sediment yield of 12 mg km2 range 1 5 30 mg km2 and can serve as a reference for background sediment yields in the southern sierra nevada the area normalized measured suspended sediment concentrations of bull and providence were in the range of 39 92 mg l km2 and 98 195 mg l km2 respectively catchment aspect annual maximum discharge and center of flow timing together were able to explain 77 variance of the total suspended and bedload annual sediment yield a statistically significant effect of precipitation phase rain vs snow on the sediment discharge relationship was also found loss of snowpack under a warming climate may increase the contribution of bedload sediment as the streams become flashier effects of forest management treatments were not significant and were confounded within the drought signal our study illustrated the challenges in paired catchment based attribution analysis under varying climate conditions such as extreme droughts this study provides the first long term 10 years suspended and bedload sediment results for multiple catchments with varying land use and management conditions in the southern sierra nevada additional research is needed to further improve our understanding of forest management impacts on erosion and sediment delivery at varying spatial and temporal scales and under different weather climate patterns credit authorship

3037,the evolutionary stages of the different lakes in the badain jaran desert bjd are unknown and there is a need to elucidate the hydrological implications of the hydrodynamic environmental differences among these lakes in this study a stable isotope mass balance model incorporating the effect of evaporation from the lake basins was developed and the model was used to calculate the remaining water fraction f of 94 lakes relative to the high lake levels in the middle holocene as well as the groundwater recharge rate χ g to the lakes the results show that only 10 20 average of 15 of the original lake water remains one third of the lakes have become terminal lakes and half are still gradually drying if the climatic conditions remain unchanged the water levels of these lakes will drop by an average of 11 mm per year χ g has a certain degree of correlation with elevation suggesting the likely presence of more water recharge sources for the north lakes which may include the beida mountains and the zongnai mountains the total annual groundwater recharge to all of the lakes in the bjd is 1 63 107 m3 yr the δ18o evolution model of a typical lake cherigele lake reveals that humidity h and atmospheric vapor δa 18o play the leading role in the evolution of the lake δ18o suggesting that this model may serve as a tool for estimating lake evaporation and for reconstructing the paleoclimate the findings of this study provide support for analyzing the evolution and future trends of lakes in arid desert areas as well as deeper insights into the water cycle in the bjd

evaporation is an important process in the hydrologic cycle especially in arid inland areas where evaporation is an important pathway for the discharge of surface water and groundwater strong evaporation can lead to salinization of water bodies huang and pang 2012 for closed inland lakes evaporation leads to a reduced water volume decreased water level and mineral precipitation so it plays an important role in determining the lake morphology and the lake evolution bouchez et al 2016 therefore understanding the evaporation and salinization mechanisms yadav 1997 brooks et al 2014 of lakes in arid areas is beneficial to gaining insights into the evolution stages and future evolution trends of such lakes in addition lakes in arid areas are sensitive to climate change williams 1991 thereby making them good research objects for climate change studies the badain jaran desert bjd fig 1 a b china contains 100 small lakes which were freshwater lakes in the middle holocene based on shoreline deposits and freshwater snails yang et al 2003 in the middle holocene there was a pan lake period with high lake levels in the bjd wang et al 2016 in the late holocene the dry climate led to salinization of the lake water with the content of the total dissolved solids tds ranging from 1 to 450 g l yang et al 2003 wang and zhou 2018 the numerous saltwater lakes salt lakes and brine lakes are ideal natural test sites for studying lake salinization in arid areas insights into the salinization mechanism and knowledge of the remaining water volume are of great scientific significance for understanding the evolution of desert lakes and the changes in the paleoclimate in addition these lakes usually have no surface outflow with evaporation being almost the only pathway for lake water discharge while groundwater is the most important recharge source for the lakes jin et al 2018 therefore the investigation of the recharge rate and total recharge of the groundwater to these lakes is beneficial to gaining insights into desert water cycle however previous research on the bjd s water cycle has focused more on the sources of groundwater and has mostly considered one or more of the following four sources dong et al 2013 fig 1b 1 lateral runoff from nearby mountains ding and wang 2007 gates et al 2008 liu 2010 2 local precipitation yang et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 3 paleowater during the last glacial maximum ma and edmunds 2006 and 4 the tibetan plateau chen et al 2004 chen et al 2006 in addition the interaction between the groundwater and lakes is another research hotspot wang et al 2014 for example luo et al 2016 2017 calculated the groundwater recharge to sumujilin south lake sms badain east lake bde badain west lake bdw based on stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes radium isotopes and 222rn yi et al 2020 investigated the groundwater discharge from 17 lakes and the flushing times of the lakes using 228ra yang and williams 2003 argued that compared with the middle holocene only 20 of the lake water remains and the water area has shrunk by 97 estimated using sedimentary archives based on the remote sensing extraction of paleolake shorelines it has been estimated that the existing lake area is only 24 51 of the original area cao et al 2020 due to the limited number of lakes investigated these studies failed to reveal the differences in the hydrodynamic patterns of the different lakes thereby making it necessary to verify the groundwater discharge estimates in order to determine the remaining water volume and the intensity of the groundwater recharge to the bjd lakes in the salinization stage in this study an isotope mass balance model gonfiantini 1986 gibson et al 2016a gonfiantini et al 2018 was constructed by collecting water samples from 94 lakes analyzing the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of the water samples and measuring several water quality indicators first the remaining water fraction f of each lake relative to the high lake levels in the middle holocene wang et al 2016 after field investigation cao et al 2020 was calculated and the hydrodynamic states of the lakes and their future evolution trends were analyzed second the groundwater discharge rates and the total groundwater discharges of all of the lakes were calculated finally by taking cherigele lake crg as an example the evolution process of the lakes and the influencing factors were analyzed the results of this study improve our understanding of the recharge capacity of the groundwater to lakes in arid deserts and provide insights into water cycle processes moreover in this study reconstruction of the paleoclimate based on the evolution of stable isotopes in salt lakes was explored the findings of this study provide support for water resource management and ecological protection 2 study area the bjd is located in northwestern china fig 1a covering an area of 52 100 km2 and it is the second largest desert in china zhu et al 2010 it is bordered by the heli mountains and the beida mountains to the south the yabulai mountains ybl to the southeast which separates the bjd form the tengger desert the zongnai mountains to the east the gurinai grassland to the west and the guaizi lake wetland to the north fig 1b the elevation decreases from southeast to northwest the bjd has a typical continental arid climate with an annual precipitation of 50 150 mm wang et al 2013 cao et al 2021 and an annual evaporation of approximately 1 000 1 500 mm ke et al 2015 han et al 2019 the bjd contains 100 lakes wang et al 2016 with a maximum area of 1 65 km2 wu et al 2014 sand hills are distributed around the lakes which are 200 400 m high relative to the lake surfaces arp et al 1998 the lakes can be divided into two distribution zones according to the characteristics of the lake area and the tds content zhang 2018 yi et al 2020 the southern lake zone near the mountains and the northern lake zone in the desert hinterland fig 1c the two zones are separated by yikeli ovoo where there are cretaceous bedrock outcrops with maroon sandstone and muddy sandstone yang et al 2011 the northern lake zone consists of lakes with areas of 1 km2 and these lakes have tds contents of 10 g l in particular cherigele lake in the central part of the northern lake zone has an area of 1 12 km2 and a maximum water depth of 8 2 m fig 1d in contrast the lakes in the southern lake zone are generally small i e 0 2 km2 with maximum water depths of 2 m and tds contents of 1 to 3 g l luo et al 2017 wang et al 2019 3 samples and methods 3 1 sampling in july to august 2014 a hydrogeological survey was conducted in the study area including using gps to obtain lake level elevations and lake areas and collecting water samples from 94 lakes 21 in the south and 73 in the north water samples were collected from the lakes using 500 ml polyethylene bottles that were pre rinsed three times with raw lake water filtered through 0 5 μm filter membranes and stored in clean polyethylene bottles during the field sampling a ysi portable multi parameter water quality analyzer was used to measure the water temperature ph tds and other physical parameters in addition the hco3 concentration was determined in situ via titration portions of the water samples were taken back to the geological engineering laboratory of gansu province for analysis of the concentrations of other anions and cations via ion chromatography and atomic absorption spectrometry with measurement errors of 3 the stable isotope measurements were performed using the sampling mass spectrometer at the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology chinese academy of geological sciences the standard deviations of all samples and standards were smaller than 0 5 and 0 1 for δ2h and δ18o respectively the mineral saturation index si of lake water was calculated using the phreeqc program parkhurst and appelo 1999 3 2 isotope mass balance imb the change in the lake volume v can be expressed as 1 d v d t i q e where i is the water recharge to the lake consisting of rainfall p and groundwater recharge g to the lake namely i p g q is the lateral outflow of the lake or the seasonal surface overflow and e is evaporation based on the above water balance equation the bjd lakes have the following three typical hydrodynamic modes fig 2 horita 1990 luo et al 2017 wang and zhou 2018 a desiccating lakes b terminal lakes and c throughflow lakes moreover the total recharge rate to a lake is denoted as χ i 2 χ i χ p χ g i a l a k e where χ i is in m i is in m3 and a l a k e is the lake area in m2 and χ p is the annual rainfall χ g is the groundwater recharge rate to the lake also known as the groundwater discharge rate which is defined as the groundwater recharge per unit area of the lake 3 χ g g a l a k e i p a l a k e similarly χ e is the annual water surface evaporation 4 χ e e a l a k e a model based on isotopes mass balance imb gonfiantini 1986 gibson and reid 2014 isokangas et al 2015 skrzypek et al 2015 gibson et al 2016b gibson et al 2016a was adopted in this study for fully mixed lakes the temporal variation in the isotopic values of the lake water is expressed as follows gonfiantini 1986 5 v d δ δ d v d t i δ i q δ q e δ e where δ i is the weighted average isotopic value of multiple recharge sources namely δ i σ δ i i i σ i i δ g g δ p p g p and δ g a n d δ p are the isotopic values of the groundwater and precipitation respectively based on temperature and conductivity evidence thorough mixing occurs both vertically and horizontally in the bjd lakes luo et al 2016 li et al 2018 yi et al 2020 which proves the feasibility of the model since there is no isotopic fractionation the isotopic values of the lake discharge q can be assumed to be the same as the isotopic values of the lake water li et al 2018 namely δ q δ lake δ δ g is the mean isotopic value of the groundwater around the lake which is taken as δ g 18 o 3 27 in the southern lake zone and δ g 18 o 3 26 in the northern lake zone δ p is the 12 month weighted average isotopic value of the lake zone cao et al 2021 which is taken as δ p 18 o 8 01 in the southern lake zone and δ p 18 o 6 21 in the northern lake zone the isotopic value of the evaporated vapor is expressed as follows gonfiantini 1986 6 δ e 1 1 h a w δ ε δ γ α γ α h a w δ a δ ε where h is the relative humidity a w is the water activity α is the equilibrium fractionation coefficient γ is the ratio of the activity coefficients δ ε is the kinetic fractionation factor and δ a is the isotopic value of the atmosphere therefore the variation in the isotopic value of the lake water can be reformulated as 7 v d δ δ d v d t i δ i q δ e 1 h a w δ ε δ γ α γ α h a w δ a δ ε the above formula can be rewritten as 8 d δ d l n f 1 1 q e i δ i δ e a b δ where f is the remaining water fraction a and b are two coefficients which are calculated as follows 9a a h a w δ a δ ε α γ α 1 h a w δ ε 9b b h a w δ ε α γ α 1 h a w δ ε the water activity is calculated as follows robinson and stokes 1959 gonfiantini 1986 10 a w 0 000543 f 2 0 018521 f 1 0 99931 f 0 1 the equilibrium fractionation coefficient α is calculated as follows majoube 1971 gonfiantini 1986 11a α 2 h exp 24844 t 2 76 248 t 0 05261 11b α 18 o exp 1137 t 2 0 4156 t 0 00207 t is temperature in kelvin ε is the temperature dependent equilibrium isotopic fractionation factor which is defined as ε α 1 and its change δε is defined as the kinetic enrichment factor gonfiantini 1986 gibson and reid 2010 12 δ ε k 1 h a w 1000 here k is 12 5 and 14 2 for hydrogen and oxygen respectively the value of γ is 0 9996 for 2h and 1 for 18o sofer and gat 1975 finally the isotopic value of the lake water is 13 δ δ 0 δ i a x 1 b x f 1 b x 1 x y δ i a x 1 b x where x e i is the fraction of inflow water lost by evaporation and y q i is the fraction lost by isotopically non fractionating outflows f can be calculated using the following equation gonfiantini 1986 which is the remaining fraction of lake water compared to the water volume existing during the middle holocene 14 f m 0 1 x m i m 1 x m i 1 y 1 x where m and m 0 are the salinity of the present and initial lakes respectively and m i is the average salinity of the recharge water when the tds content is used to represent salinity m tds l measured in the laboratory the initial lakes in the middle holocene were freshwater lakes with high lake level wang et al 2016 and their tds contents are assumed to be the same as that of groundwater in the same period because the lakes were recharged by groundwater the tds content of the groundwater with the 14c dating results of 6 050 yr bp and 8 250 yr bp is about 0 5 g l wu et al 2017 which is similar to the tds of the present groundwater 1 g l zhang 2018 therefore m 0 tds 0 0 5 g l m i σ m i i i σ i i m g g m p p g p where m g and m p are the salinities of the groundwater and precipitation respectively m g tds g 0 5 g l m p tds p 0 05 g l the isotopic value of the water vapor is gibson and reid 2014 gibson et al 2016a zhu et al 2019 15 δ a δ p k ε 1 k ε where δ p is the isotopic value of the precipitation k is a coefficient which is allowed to vary from 0 6 to 1 0 at an interval of 0 0001 when calculating the slope of the local evaporation line lel using eq 16 until the difference between the calculated lel slope and the observed lel slope is minimal or k reaches the boundary value of 0 6 or 1 0 at which time the value of k is taken as its final value skrzypek et al 2015 in the bjd the actual lel slope was taken as 4 17 ma and yang 2008 jin et al 2018 16 s l e l h δ a δ p 1 δ p δ ε ε α h δ ε ε α h h δ a δ p 1 δ p δ ε ε α h δ ε ε α o for some lakes the isotopic value of the water vapor above the lake is affected by water vapor evaporation thereby making it necessary to consider the feedback effect of the atmospheric water vapor jasechko et al 2014 gibson et al 2016a in the bjd the lakes and the surrounding tall dunes form a relatively independent catchment area luo et al 2016 and a local microclimate zhang et al 2017 moreover the lake evaporation affects the isotopic values of the precipitation and water vapor in the lake basin cao et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to include the effect of the evaporation of each lake on the isotopic value of the water vapor in the model accordingly the isotopic value of the water vapor can be calculated as follows gibson et al 2016a 17 δ a 1 f δ a f δ e where δ a is the modified isotopic composition of the atmospheric admixture the isotopic value of the evaporated water vapor is ultimately expressed as 18 δ e 1 1 h a w δ ε δ γ α γ α h a w δ a δ ε since the effect of the salt on δ2h is not negligible but the effect of the salt on δ18o is insignificant gonfiantini 1986 gonfiantini et al 2018 li et al 2018 the model calculations are mainly based on δ18o meteorological factors were set as their annual mean values cao et al 2021 namely t 12 c h 37 annual precipitation χ p 100 mm and annual evaporation χ e 1000 mm wang et al 2019 using the model eqs 1 18 and the measured isotopic values of the lake water f and χ g can be calculated 4 results 4 1 hydrochemistry the lake elevation area tds content and other indicators show that the southern and northern lake zones fig 1c differ significantly from each other table 1 in the southern lake zone the lake elevation is above 1 200 m fig 3 a and the lake area is 0 1 km2 fig 3b with tds contents of generally 35 g l n 18 fig 3c and peaking at 270 08 g l in bdw in contrast the lake elevation is below 1 200 m fig 3a in the northern lake zone the average lake area is 0 24 km2 fig 3b with a maximum of 1 44 km2 and the tds content ranges from 10 to 450 g l mostly 100 300 g l fig 3c as the tds content increases cl and na concentrations of the lake water gradually increase fig 3c d the ca2 and mg2 concentrations gradually decrease and the saturation indexes sis of the calcium and magnesium minerals e g dolomite and calcite gradually increase fig 3f as is shown in table 1 the coefficients of variation cv of the ca2 and mg2 concentrations are lower in the southern lakes than in the northern lakes while the cvs of the other ions are higher in the southern lakes than in the northern lakes reflecting the difference between the two lake zones in terms of the discreteness of the concentration of the water chemistry constituents lake water chemistry can be divided into 18 types many of which exist in the southern lakes but they are predominantly cl so4 na type n 9 eleven types exist in the northern lakes predominantly cl na type n 37 and cl co3 na type n 12 fig 4 ion correlation analysis fig 5 revealed that the tds content has high correlation coefficients generally 0 8 with the concentration of each ion in the southern lakes while in the northern lakes the tds content is only strongly correlated with the concentrations of cl and na r 0 9 which is consistent with the fact that high tds lake water is mostly cl na type water 4 2 stable isotopes stable isotope analysis of the lake water revealed that the average δ2h and δ18o values of the southern lakes are 1 57 and 5 64 respectively and the isotopic values increase with increasing tds content fig 6 exhibiting a certain degree of correlation r 0 62 fig 5 in the northern lakes the average δ2h and δ18o values are 0 32 and 7 82 respectively but the isotopic values are relatively discrete with δ18o being generally 6 5 fig 6 and being weakly correlated r 0 4 with the tds content compared with the southern lakes the northern lakes have higher cvs for δ2h and lower cvs for δ18o the correlations between δ2h and δ18o and each ion are not high in both lake zones while the correlation between δ2h and δ18o is high in both lake zones with r of nearly 1 for the southern lakes and 0 89 for the northern lakes fig 5 the lels of the two lake zones are nearly parallel to each other fig 7 reflecting relatively independent evaporation environments in the two lake zones because the two lake zones with different elevation were separated by the yikeli ovoo of bedrock fig 1c 4 3 remaining water fraction f of lakes and groundwater discharge from the model the hydrodynamic types of the lakes can be judged according to their i e values with i e 1 indicating throughflow lakes i e 1 indicating terminal lakes and i e 1 indicating shrinking lakes gat 1995 gibson et al 2016a among all of the lakes in the study area 14 lakes have i e 1 all of which are in the southern lake zone 31 lakes have i e 1 0 99 and are in a state similar to that of terminal lakes accounting for one third of the total lakes the remaining lakes are still in a gradually drying state including 20 with i e 0 97 accounting for one half of the total lakes for the southern lakes f ranges from 0 07 to 0 29 with an average of 0 13 and a cv of 41 29 fig 8 a for the northern lakes f ranges from 0 05 to 0 29 with an average of 0 15 and a cv of 39 45 fig 8a the spatial distribution of f is illustrated in fig 9 a and it does not exhibit an obvious pattern for the southern lakes χ g ranges from 0 448 to 1 495 with an average of 0 985 and a cv of 28 86 fig 8b for the northern lakes χ g ranges from 0 390 to 0 897 with an average of 0 861 and a cv of 10 10 fig 8b the spatial distribution of χ g is illustrated in fig 9b and it does not exhibit an obvious pattern 5 discussion 5 1 evolution stage of the lakes relative to the high lake level period in the middle holocene wang et al 2016 f is mostly 0 10 0 20 with an average of 0 15 fig 8a 9a which is greater than the f of 3 hat was simply estimated according to the paleolake shores yang and williams 2003 f can be calculated and verified according to the topography of the lake basin for example the basin structure of cherigele lake can be expressed as follows zheng et al 2016 h c a n where h is the average lake depth m and a is the lake area km2 c and n are coefficients which are taken as 6 5132 and 1 9711 respectively according to the contour data for the cherigele lake basin fig 1e this results in the following expression for h h 6 5132 a 1 9711 r 2 0 9971 the lake area a is a 0 3865 h 0 5073 r 2 0 9971 the lake volume can be calculated using a and h v 0 h a d h 0 0002564 h 1 5073 by taking h as the current average depth 5 5 m of cherigele lake li et al 2018 and considering that the sediment hofmann and geyh 1998 yang and williams 2003 yang et al 2010 wang et al 2016 during the high lake level period was about 11 m above the modern lake level fig 1d e it was determined that f 0 19 while the imb model gives f 0 12 since the sediment that formed in the high lake level period may now be covered by aeolian sand yang and williams 2003 cao et al 2020 the f calculated using the lake basin data may be an overestimate it has been reported that bde is a riverine lake i e 1 52 bdw is a terminal lake i e 1 03 and sms is a shrinking lake i e 0 57 luo et al 2017 these i e values are generally consistent with the results of 1 245 0 996 and 0 971 respectively obtained in this study overall the imb model gives a reliable result that is the current volume of the desert lakes is only 15 of the original volume studies have shown that the modern lake levels are 10 m lower than the high lake levels yang and williams 2003 cao et al 2020 and the lake area only accounts for 20 of the original area in the middle holocene there is no significant correlation between f and tds for the lakes fig 9a but f is well correlated with δ18o fig 10 especially for the northern lakes with the relationship δ18o 73834x5 75874x4 30846x3 6263 3x2 660 42x 21 085 r2 0 99 compared with the relationship δ18o 5 783 ln x 17 607 r2 0 72 for the southern lakes therefore it is feasible to consider using δ18o to estimate f in order to gain insights into the different evolution stages of the desert lakes 5 2 groundwater discharge and water cycle indicators in the bjd the groundwater discharge rates of typical bjd lakes are listed in table 2 based on 228ra isotope values yi et al 2020 reported that the groundwater discharge g of 17 lakes was 0 03 to 77 23 106 m3 yr with a discharge of 55 02 106 m3 yr from crg the reported g value for crg is obviously an overestimate due to the absence of lateral outflow q because given that crg has an area of 1 12 km2 and an annual evaporation of 1 000 mm the lake level is estimated to rise by about 48 m per year which is inconsistent with the observed fluctuation of almost 0 mm per year in this study the groundwater discharge from crg was determined to be 0 99 106 m3 yr providing a better explanation of why crg is almost in a balanced water state based on radium isotope values luo et al 2016 2017 determined that the groundwater discharge rates from badain east lake badain west lake and sumujilin south lake in summer are 8 10 mm d 1 720 900 mm yr 1 within three months in summer 4 5 mm d 1 360 450 mm yr 1 within three months in summer and 7 8 mm d 1 630 720 mm yr 1 within three months in summer respectively and reported that the total groundwater discharge from all of the bjd lakes reaches 1 68 105 m3 d 1 based on the daily groundwater discharge from the bjd lakes in august 2013 reported by luo et al 2016 2017 and assuming that the precipitation is mainly concentrated in summer and the groundwater discharge mainly occurs in the 90 days of the three summer months we estimated that the total groundwater discharge from the bjd lakes is 1 51 107 m3 yr however based on the viewpoint that the groundwater discharge rate from the lakes is quite stable and does not exhibit strong seasonal variation wang et al 2019 estimated that the groundwater discharge rate from sumujilin south lake is χ g 2 33 mm d 1 χ g 853 mm yr 1 according to the lake level dynamics given the years in the balanced water state χ g was estimated to be 876 mm yr 1 and thereby the groundwater discharge g was estimated to be 1 09 106 m3 yr which are consistent with the estimated groundwater discharge data for sumujilin south lake in this study namely χ g 872 mm yr 1 g 1 08 106 m3 yr similar results of χ g 85 4 mm month 1 and g 1 27 106 m3 yr were reported by gong et al 2016 based on the lake level dynamics the groundwater discharge rates have previously been estimated wang et al 2020 to be 3 06 mm d 1 1121 7 mm yr 1 for boerzongtu lake 1 79 mm d 1 655 3 mm yr 1 for nuoertu lake 2 39 mm d 1 875 3 mm yr 1 for yihejigede lake and 898 1024 6 mm yr 1 for huhejilin lake our results for these four lakes are 389 mm yr 1 854 mm yr 1 883 mm yr 1 and 864 mm yr 1 respectively as can be seen the results for the first two lakes differ greatly between this study and the previous study which is likely due to the fact that these two lakes are closer to the ybl and thereby are subject to more variable hydrodynamic conditions fig 1c in contrast the results for the latter two lakes are within the range of the annual water level changes it should be noted that the results of wang et al 2020 are only based on the water level changes within one year while the results of this study reflect the long term state of the groundwater discharge from the lakes the total area of the bjd lakes is 18 61 km2 n 94 based on each lake s χ g and area it was estimated that the total groundwater discharge from all of the bjd lakes is 1 63 107 m3 yr falling between the estimates of the annual groundwater discharge table 2 reported by gong et al 2016 and luo et al 2017 and agreeing with the results of wang et al 2019 previous studies have mostly used the g values of single lakes to estimate the total annual groundwater discharge from all of the lakes however the desert s lakes are distributed over hundreds of kilometers which leads to variations in the hydrodynamic conditions of the lakes this is confirmed by the absence of an obvious spatial distribution pattern of χ g fig 9b therefore it is more reasonable to calculate the total groundwater discharge to all the lakes using the χ g of each lake the χ g of a given lake is independent of its area depth and evaporation wang et al 2020 while χ g exhibits a certain correlation with the lake elevation for most of the northern lakes fig 11 a whose elevations decrease from southeast to northwest fig 9b accordingly χ g generally increases from southeast to northwest in the study area suggesting that the northwestern lakes may be receiving water recharge from more sources than was previously thought which may include the beida mountains to the south and the zongnai mountains to the north fig 1b in the east of cherigele lake fig 1 the thickness of quaternary sand aquifer is 150 600 m and a single well water yield of groundwater reaches 1 000 1 400 m3 d meanwhile the groundwater depth in inter dune depressions is generally about 1 10 m with feeble confined water locally occurring to the west of the cherigele lake fig 1 the underlying bedrocks are uplifted and the thickness of quaternary sand aquifer is 150 m the groundwater depth is generally 10 m and the water yield grows poor with a single well water yield of 500 m3 d wang et al 2021 therefore this spatial heterogeneity in water recharge sources is rooted in the hydrogeological differences in the aquifers underlying the lakes jin et al 2018 wang et al 2020 regarding the future evolution trends of the bjd lakes in this study it was observed that the higher the tds content the larger the χ g fig 8b 11b and the closer the dv dt is to 0 indicating that the lakes with high tds content are nearly in a balanced water state wherein the recharge is close to the discharge this is confirmed by the variations in the precipitation and lake levels wang et al 2020 despite the rise in the water levels of some lakes in certain years in general the lake water volume tends to decrease annually jiao et al 2015 with the lake water level dropping by 11 mm per year compared with 1967 the total lake area was 5 smaller in 2010 zhang et al 2015 it is projected that these lakes will completely dry up in 150 years if the climatic conditions remain unchanged yang and williams 2003 5 3 evolution of lake water δ18o and controlling factors many of the input parameters of the imb model can affect the estimation of the δ18o mainly including the temperature humidity groundwater endmember δg 18o atmospheric δa 18o and groundwater discharge rate to explore the impacts of these factors on the estimation cherigele lake was chosen as a typical lake to analyze the evolution of δ18o under various factors the input model parameters for cherigele lake are temperature t 12 c relative humidity h 0 37 groundwater discharge rate χ g 0 882 m δ18o of groundwater δg 18o 3 27 and δ18o of the water vapor δa 18o 22 1 as is shown in fig 12 in which δ18o is plotted under various t h and χ g conditions while holding the other factors constant t changes the magnitude of δ18o when f is 0 1 0 95 where the f δ18o curves are nearly parallel fig 12a moreover the higher t is the lower magnitude of δ18o is with an average gradient of 0 06 c the impact of h on δ18o is as follows fig 12b when h is 0 2 0 4 the higher h is the lower δ18o is and when f is 0 1 0 9 the higher h is the higher the reduction rate of δ18o is when h 0 5 the f δ18o curves exhibit a significantly different pattern namely rapidly increasing to the maximum δ18o at f 0 95 and then rapidly decreasing to the minimum δ18o at f 0 1 in addition χ g affects how fast in terms of f δ18o reaches its maximum value fig 12c the larger χ g is the earlier δ18o reaches its maximum for example when χ g 0 88 δ18o reaches its maximum of 14 59 at f 0 925 whereas when χ g 0 8 δ18o reaches its maximum of 14 2 at f 0 775 in addition when f 0 775 the higher χ g is the higher δ18o is but the opposite trend occurs when f 0 775 i e the higher χ g is the lower δ18o is δg 18o has an impact similar to that of t fig 13 a δg 18o does not affect the shapes of the f δ18o curves with the curves being nearly parallel to each other when f is 0 1 0 95 however the higher δg 18o is the higher the lake water δ18o is the impact of δa 18o is generally similar to that of h fig 13b but there are also differences the f δ18o curves under different δa 18o conditions have an obvious intersection point at f 0 6 when f 0 6 the higher δa 18o is the lower δ18o is whereas when f 0 6 the higher δa 18o is the higher δ18o is as shown above h and δa 18o have more obvious impacts on the lake water δ18o than δg 18o does figs 12 13 demonstrating the dominant role of the water vapor isotopes in the evolution of the lake water isotopes in desert areas yadav 1997 the f δ18o curves of cherigele lake exhibit the following characteristics as f decreases δ18o initially rapidly increases f 0 9 and then it slowly decreases f 0 2 0 9 followed by a rapid decrease f 0 2 figs 12 13 although the environmental factors affect the value of δ18o they do not affect the overall trend of the f δ18o curve therefore this relationship model can be used to reconstruct and verify the evaporation stages of lakes and to investigate the paleoclimate in the late holocene especially the temperature and air humidity fig 14 shows the evolution of the relationship between δ2h and δ18o as a function of f with the relationship curves exhibiting a typical hook shape due to the isotopic fractionation in the hydration sphere of the ions fontes and gonfiantini 1967 gonfiantini 1986 this isotopic evolution process explains why lakes with higher tds contents are not richer in heavy isotopes another noteworthy issue is that previous studies used the same evaporation line for all the lakes when analyzing the evaporation of desert lakes based on stable isotope values ma and yang 2008 jin et al 2018 however the evaporation lines independently obtained in the two lake zones are nearly parallel to each other fig 7 with a slope of 4 87 for the southern lake zone and 4 74 for the northern lake zone comparison of the isotopic values of the groundwater and precipitation indicates that the lel of the southern lakes intersects with the gmwl at the data point corresponding to the annual mean δ2h and δ18o of the ybl and bde precipitation moreover the isotopic values of the groundwater are on the lel within a small range fig 7 indicating that the southern lakes and the surrounding groundwater mainly receive recharge water from the local precipitation and the lateral outflow of the ybl fig 1b because the sand aquifer in the southern lake zone is thin and even the bedrock is exposed near the badain east lake wang et al 2021 which is beneficial to the infiltration recharge furthermore the hydraulic gradient in this zone reaches 0 7 cao et al 2020 which promotes lateral runoff recharge in contrast the northern lakes and their surrounding groundwater have a wide range of isotopic values and the isotopic values of the precipitation deviate from the gmwl indicating that the northern lakes receive recharge water from multiple sources given that the lower the elevation the higher the χ g fig 11a it is possible that the downstream area receives a higher amount of mixed recharge water from both the beida mountains and the zongnai mountains than the upstream area fig 1b and the mixing of the paleowater dated in the middle holocene wang et al 2021 with the groundwater from the present recharge may occur in addition the variability of the impacts of the evaporation runoff and water rock interactions on the groundwater is more significant in the northern lake zone jin et al 2018 which shapes the present hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of groundwater 6 conclusions hydrochemical and stable isotope analysis were performed on water samples from 94 lakes in the bjd then a stable isotope mass balance model was established and used to calculate the remaining water fraction f of 94 lakes relative to the high lake levels in the middle holocene as well as the groundwater recharge rate χ g to the lakes the results indicated that the spatial distribution of f and χ g do not exhibit an obvious pattern additionally only 10 20 average of 15 of the original lake water remains while one third of the lakes have become terminal lakes and half are still gradually drying moreover the total annual groundwater recharge to all the lakes in the bjd is 1 63 107 m3 yr which accounts for 0 087 of the total discharge of desert groundwater obtained by the water balance method wang et al 2021 additionally the southern lakes are mainly recharged by local precipitation and lateral runoff of ybl however the recharge of the northern lakes is from more sources and there is more mixed recharge to shallow groundwater from beida mountains and zongnai mountains at the same time the paleowater infiltrated in the middle holocene may account for a larger proportion of the present groundwater especially the deep groundwater the distance from the mountain area the hydrogeological conditions of the aquifer and the water rock interactions cooperatively affect the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of the present groundwater next the δ18o evolution model of crg reveals that humidity h and atmospheric vapor δa 18o play the leading role in the evolution of the lake δ18o during the process of lake shrinkage the lake δ18o value initially increased rapidly f 0 9 and then decreased gradually f 0 9 our research results not only affords a useful reference to accurately calculate the amount of groundwater and reasonably manage groundwater resources of the bjd but also improves the understanding of desert water cycle in

3037,the evolutionary stages of the different lakes in the badain jaran desert bjd are unknown and there is a need to elucidate the hydrological implications of the hydrodynamic environmental differences among these lakes in this study a stable isotope mass balance model incorporating the effect of evaporation from the lake basins was developed and the model was used to calculate the remaining water fraction f of 94 lakes relative to the high lake levels in the middle holocene as well as the groundwater recharge rate χ g to the lakes the results show that only 10 20 average of 15 of the original lake water remains one third of the lakes have become terminal lakes and half are still gradually drying if the climatic conditions remain unchanged the water levels of these lakes will drop by an average of 11 mm per year χ g has a certain degree of correlation with elevation suggesting the likely presence of more water recharge sources for the north lakes which may include the beida mountains and the zongnai mountains the total annual groundwater recharge to all of the lakes in the bjd is 1 63 107 m3 yr the δ18o evolution model of a typical lake cherigele lake reveals that humidity h and atmospheric vapor δa 18o play the leading role in the evolution of the lake δ18o suggesting that this model may serve as a tool for estimating lake evaporation and for reconstructing the paleoclimate the findings of this study provide support for analyzing the evolution and future trends of lakes in arid desert areas as well as deeper insights into the water cycle in the bjd keywords stable isotope mass balance imb model evaporation lake shrinkage groundwater recharge badain jaran desert bjd data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evaporation is an important process in the hydrologic cycle especially in arid inland areas where evaporation is an important pathway for the discharge of surface water and groundwater strong evaporation can lead to salinization of water bodies huang and pang 2012 for closed inland lakes evaporation leads to a reduced water volume decreased water level and mineral precipitation so it plays an important role in determining the lake morphology and the lake evolution bouchez et al 2016 therefore understanding the evaporation and salinization mechanisms yadav 1997 brooks et al 2014 of lakes in arid areas is beneficial to gaining insights into the evolution stages and future evolution trends of such lakes in addition lakes in arid areas are sensitive to climate change williams 1991 thereby making them good research objects for climate change studies the badain jaran desert bjd fig 1 a b china contains 100 small lakes which were freshwater lakes in the middle holocene based on shoreline deposits and freshwater snails yang et al 2003 in the middle holocene there was a pan lake period with high lake levels in the bjd wang et al 2016 in the late holocene the dry climate led to salinization of the lake water with the content of the total dissolved solids tds ranging from 1 to 450 g l yang et al 2003 wang and zhou 2018 the numerous saltwater lakes salt lakes and brine lakes are ideal natural test sites for studying lake salinization in arid areas insights into the salinization mechanism and knowledge of the remaining water volume are of great scientific significance for understanding the evolution of desert lakes and the changes in the paleoclimate in addition these lakes usually have no surface outflow with evaporation being almost the only pathway for lake water discharge while groundwater is the most important recharge source for the lakes jin et al 2018 therefore the investigation of the recharge rate and total recharge of the groundwater to these lakes is beneficial to gaining insights into desert water cycle however previous research on the bjd s water cycle has focused more on the sources of groundwater and has mostly considered one or more of the following four sources dong et al 2013 fig 1b 1 lateral runoff from nearby mountains ding and wang 2007 gates et al 2008 liu 2010 2 local precipitation yang et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 3 paleowater during the last glacial maximum ma and edmunds 2006 and 4 the tibetan plateau chen et al 2004 chen et al 2006 in addition the interaction between the groundwater and lakes is another research hotspot wang et al 2014 for example luo et al 2016 2017 calculated the groundwater recharge to sumujilin south lake sms badain east lake bde badain west lake bdw based on stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes radium isotopes and 222rn yi et al 2020 investigated the groundwater discharge from 17 lakes and the flushing times of the lakes using 228ra yang and williams 2003 argued that compared with the middle holocene only 20 of the lake water remains and the water area has shrunk by 97 estimated using sedimentary archives based on the remote sensing extraction of paleolake shorelines it has been estimated that the existing lake area is only 24 51 of the original area cao et al 2020 due to the limited number of lakes investigated these studies failed to reveal the differences in the hydrodynamic patterns of the different lakes thereby making it necessary to verify the groundwater discharge estimates in order to determine the remaining water volume and the intensity of the groundwater recharge to the bjd lakes in the salinization stage in this study an isotope mass balance model gonfiantini 1986 gibson et al 2016a gonfiantini et al 2018 was constructed by collecting water samples from 94 lakes analyzing the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of the water samples and measuring several water quality indicators first the remaining water fraction f of each lake relative to the high lake levels in the middle holocene wang et al 2016 after field investigation cao et al 2020 was calculated and the hydrodynamic states of the lakes and their future evolution trends were analyzed second the groundwater discharge rates and the total groundwater discharges of all of the lakes were calculated finally by taking cherigele lake crg as an example the evolution process of the lakes and the influencing factors were analyzed the results of this study improve our understanding of the recharge capacity of the groundwater to lakes in arid deserts and provide insights into water cycle processes moreover in this study reconstruction of the paleoclimate based on the evolution of stable isotopes in salt lakes was explored the findings of this study provide support for water resource management and ecological protection 2 study area the bjd is located in northwestern china fig 1a covering an area of 52 100 km2 and it is the second largest desert in china zhu et al 2010 it is bordered by the heli mountains and the beida mountains to the south the yabulai mountains ybl to the southeast which separates the bjd form the tengger desert the zongnai mountains to the east the gurinai grassland to the west and the guaizi lake wetland to the north fig 1b the elevation decreases from southeast to northwest the bjd has a typical continental arid climate with an annual precipitation of 50 150 mm wang et al 2013 cao et al 2021 and an annual evaporation of approximately 1 000 1 500 mm ke et al 2015 han et al 2019 the bjd contains 100 lakes wang et al 2016 with a maximum area of 1 65 km2 wu et al 2014 sand hills are distributed around the lakes which are 200 400 m high relative to the lake surfaces arp et al 1998 the lakes can be divided into two distribution zones according to the characteristics of the lake area and the tds content zhang 2018 yi et al 2020 the southern lake zone near the mountains and the northern lake zone in the desert hinterland fig 1c the two zones are separated by yikeli ovoo where there are cretaceous bedrock outcrops with maroon sandstone and muddy sandstone yang et al 2011 the northern lake zone consists of lakes with areas of 1 km2 and these lakes have tds contents of 10 g l in particular cherigele lake in the central part of the northern lake zone has an area of 1 12 km2 and a maximum water depth of 8 2 m fig 1d in contrast the lakes in the southern lake zone are generally small i e 0 2 km2 with maximum water depths of 2 m and tds contents of 1 to 3 g l luo et al 2017 wang et al 2019 3 samples and methods 3 1 sampling in july to august 2014 a hydrogeological survey was conducted in the study area including using gps to obtain lake level elevations and lake areas and collecting water samples from 94 lakes 21 in the south and 73 in the north water samples were collected from the lakes using 500 ml polyethylene bottles that were pre rinsed three times with raw lake water filtered through 0 5 μm filter membranes and stored in clean polyethylene bottles during the field sampling a ysi portable multi parameter water quality analyzer was used to measure the water temperature ph tds and other physical parameters in addition the hco3 concentration was determined in situ via titration portions of the water samples were taken back to the geological engineering laboratory of gansu province for analysis of the concentrations of other anions and cations via ion chromatography and atomic absorption spectrometry with measurement errors of 3 the stable isotope measurements were performed using the sampling mass spectrometer at the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology chinese academy of geological sciences the standard deviations of all samples and standards were smaller than 0 5 and 0 1 for δ2h and δ18o respectively the mineral saturation index si of lake water was calculated using the phreeqc program parkhurst and appelo 1999 3 2 isotope mass balance imb the change in the lake volume v can be expressed as 1 d v d t i q e where i is the water recharge to the lake consisting of rainfall p and groundwater recharge g to the lake namely i p g q is the lateral outflow of the lake or the seasonal surface overflow and e is evaporation based on the above water balance equation the bjd lakes have the following three typical hydrodynamic modes fig 2 horita 1990 luo et al 2017 wang and zhou 2018 a desiccating lakes b terminal lakes and c throughflow lakes moreover the total recharge rate to a lake is denoted as χ i 2 χ i χ p χ g i a l a k e where χ i is in m i is in m3 and a l a k e is the lake area in m2 and χ p is the annual rainfall χ g is the groundwater recharge rate to the lake also known as the groundwater discharge rate which is defined as the groundwater

gibson and reid 2014 isokangas et al 2015 skrzypek et al 2015 gibson et al 2016b gibson et al 2016a was adopted in this study for fully mixed lakes the temporal variation in the isotopic values of the lake water is expressed as follows gonfiantini 1986 5 v d δ δ d v d t i δ i q δ q e δ e where δ i is the weighted average isotopic value of multiple recharge sources namely δ i σ δ i i i σ i i δ g g δ p p g p and δ g a n d δ p are the isotopic values of the groundwater and precipitation respectively based on temperature and conductivity evidence thorough mixing occurs both vertically and horizontally in the bjd lakes luo et al 2016 li et al 2018 yi et al 2020 which proves the feasibility of the model since there is no isotopic fractionation the isotopic values of the lake discharge q can be assumed to be the same as the isotopic values of the lake water li et al 2018 namely δ q δ lake δ δ g is the mean isotopic value of the groundwater around the lake which is taken as δ g 18 o 3 27 in the southern lake zone and δ g 18 o 3 26 in the northern lake zone δ p is the 12 month weighted average isotopic value of the lake zone cao et al 2021 which is taken as δ p 18 o 8 01 in the southern lake zone and δ p 18 o 6 21 in the northern lake zone the isotopic value of the evaporated vapor is expressed as follows gonfiantini 1986 6 δ e 1 1 h a w δ ε δ γ α γ α h a w δ a δ ε where h is the relative humidity a w is the water activity α is the equilibrium fractionation coefficient γ is the ratio of the activity coefficients δ ε is the kinetic fractionation factor and δ a is the isotopic value of the atmosphere therefore the variation in the isotopic value of the lake water can be reformulated as 7 v d δ δ d v d t i δ i q δ e 1 h a w δ ε δ γ α γ α h a w δ a δ ε the above formula can be rewritten as 8 d δ d l n f 1 1 q e i δ i δ e a b δ where f is the remaining water fraction a and b are two coefficients which are calculated as follows 9a a h a w δ a δ ε α γ α 1 h a w

dependent equilibrium isotopic fractionation factor which is defined as ε α 1 and its change δε is defined as the kinetic enrichment factor gonfiantini 1986 gibson and reid 2010 12 δ ε k 1 h a w 1000 here k is 12 5 and 14 2 for hydrogen and oxygen respectively the value of γ is 0 9996 for 2h and 1 for 18o sofer and gat 1975 finally the isotopic value of the lake water is 13 δ δ 0 δ i a x 1 b x f 1 b x 1 x y δ i a x 1 b x where x e i is the fraction of inflow water lost by evaporation and y q i is the fraction lost by isotopically non fractionating outflows f can be calculated using the following equation gonfiantini 1986 which is the remaining fraction of lake water compared to the water volume existing during the middle holocene 14 f m 0 1 x m i m 1 x m i 1 y 1 x where m and m 0 are the salinity of the present and initial lakes respectively and m i is the average salinity of the recharge water when the tds content is used to represent salinity m tds l measured in the laboratory the initial lakes in the middle holocene were freshwater lakes with high lake level wang et al 2016 and their tds contents are assumed to be the same as that of groundwater in the same period because the lakes were recharged by groundwater the tds content of the groundwater with the 14c dating results of 6 050 yr bp and 8 250 yr bp is about 0 5 g l wu et al 2017 which is similar to the tds of the present groundwater 1 g l zhang 2018 therefore m 0 tds 0 0 5 g l m i σ m i i i σ i i m g g m p p g p where m g and m p are the salinities of the groundwater and precipitation respectively m g tds g 0 5 g l m p tds p 0 05 g l the isotopic value of the water vapor is gibson and reid 2014 gibson et al 2016a zhu et al 2019 15 δ a δ p k ε 1 k ε where δ p is the isotopic value of the precipitation k is a coefficient which is allowed to vary from 0 6 to 1 0 at an interval of 0 0001 when calculating the slope of the local evaporation line lel using eq 16 until the difference between the calculated lel slope and the observed lel slope is minimal or k reaches the boundary value of 0 6 or 1 0 at which time the value of k is taken as its final value skrzypek et al 2015 in the bjd the actual lel slope was taken as 4 17 ma and yang 2008 jin et al 2018 16 s l e l h δ a δ p 1 δ p δ ε ε α h δ ε ε α h h δ a δ p 1 δ p δ ε ε α h δ ε ε α o for some lakes the isotopic value of the water vapor above the lake is affected by water vapor evaporation thereby making it necessary to consider the feedback effect of the atmospheric water vapor jasechko et al 2014 gibson et al 2016a in the bjd the lakes and the surrounding tall dunes form a relatively independent catchment area luo et al 2016 and a local microclimate zhang et al 2017 moreover the lake evaporation affects the isotopic values of the precipitation and water vapor in the lake basin cao et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to include the effect of the evaporation of each lake on the isotopic value of the water vapor in the model accordingly the isotopic value of the water vapor can be calculated as follows gibson et al 2016a 17 δ a 1 f δ a f δ e where δ a is the modified isotopic composition of the atmospheric admixture the isotopic value of the evaporated water vapor is ultimately expressed as 18 δ e 1 1 h a w δ ε δ γ α γ α h a w δ a δ ε since the effect of the salt on δ2h is not negligible but the effect of the salt on δ18o is insignificant gonfiantini 1986 gonfiantini et al 2018 li et al 2018 the model calculations are mainly based on δ18o meteorological factors were set as their annual mean values cao et al 2021 namely t 12 c h 37 annual precipitation χ p 100 mm and annual evaporation χ e 1000 mm wang et al 2019 using the model eqs 1 18 and the measured isotopic values of the lake water f and χ g can be calculated 4 results 4 1 hydrochemistry the lake elevation area tds content and other indicators show that the southern and northern lake zones fig 1c differ significantly from each other table 1 in the southern lake zone the lake elevation is above 1 200 m fig 3 a and the lake area is 0 1 km2 fig 3b with tds contents of generally 35 g l n 18 fig 3c and peaking at 270 08 g l in bdw in contrast the lake elevation is below 1 200 m fig 3a in the northern lake zone the average lake area is 0 24 km2 fig 3b with a maximum of 1 44 km2 and the tds content ranges from 10 to 450 g l mostly 100 300 g l fig 3c as the tds content increases cl and na concentrations of the lake water gradually increase fig 3c d the ca2 and mg2 concentrations gradually decrease and the saturation indexes sis of the calcium and magnesium minerals e g dolomite and calcite gradually increase fig 3f as is shown in table 1 the coefficients of variation cv of the ca2 and mg2 concentrations are lower in the southern lakes than in the northern lakes while the cvs of the other ions are higher in the southern lakes than in the northern lakes reflecting the difference between the two lake zones in terms of the discreteness of the concentration of the water chemistry constituents lake water chemistry can be divided into 18 types many of which exist in the southern lakes but they are predominantly cl so4 na type n 9 eleven types exist in the northern lakes predominantly cl na type n 37 and cl co3 na type n 12 fig 4 ion correlation analysis fig 5 revealed that the tds content has high correlation coefficients generally 0 8 with the concentration of each ion in the southern lakes while in the northern lakes the tds content is only strongly correlated with the concentrations of cl and na r 0 9 which is consistent with the fact that high tds lake water is mostly cl na type water 4 2 stable isotopes stable isotope analysis of the lake water revealed that the average δ2h and δ18o values of the southern lakes are 1 57 and 5 64 respectively and the isotopic values increase with increasing tds content fig 6 exhibiting a certain degree of correlation r 0 62 fig 5 in the northern lakes the average δ2h and δ18o values are 0 32 and 7 82 respectively but the isotopic values are relatively discrete with δ18o being generally 6 5 fig 6 and being weakly correlated r 0 4 with the tds content compared with the southern lakes the northern lakes have higher cvs for δ2h and lower cvs for δ18o the correlations between δ2h and δ18o and each ion are not high in both lake zones while the correlation between δ2h and δ18o is high in both lake zones with r of nearly 1 for the southern lakes and 0 89 for the northern lakes fig 5 the lels of the two lake zones are nearly parallel to each other fig 7 reflecting relatively independent evaporation environments in the two lake zones because the two lake zones with different elevation were separated by the yikeli ovoo of bedrock fig 1c 4 3 remaining water fraction f of lakes and groundwater discharge from the model the hydrodynamic types of the lakes can be judged according to their i e values with i e 1 indicating throughflow lakes i e 1 indicating terminal lakes and i e 1 indicating shrinking lakes gat 1995 gibson et al 2016a among all of the lakes in the study area 14 lakes have i e 1 all of which are in the southern lake zone 31 lakes have i e 1 0 99 and are in a state similar to that of terminal lakes accounting for one third of the total lakes the remaining lakes are still in a gradually drying state including 20 with i e 0 97 accounting for one half of the total lakes for the southern lakes f ranges from 0 07 to 0 29 with an average of 0 13 and a cv of 41 29 fig 8 a for the northern lakes f ranges from 0 05 to 0 29 with an average of 0 15 and a cv of 39 45 fig 8a the spatial distribution of f is illustrated in fig 9 a and it does not exhibit an obvious pattern for the southern lakes χ g ranges from 0 448 to 1 495 with an average of 0 985 and a cv of 28 86 fig 8b for the northern lakes χ g ranges from 0 390 to 0 897 with an average of 0 861 and a cv of 10 10 fig 8b the spatial distribution of χ g is illustrated in fig 9b and it does not exhibit an obvious pattern 5 discussion 5 1 evolution stage of the lakes relative to the high lake level period in the middle holocene wang et al 2016 f is mostly 0 10 0 20 with an average of 0 15 fig 8a 9a which is greater than the f of 3 hat was simply estimated according to the paleolake shores yang and williams 2003 f can be calculated and verified according to the topography of the lake basin for example the basin structure of cherigele lake can be expressed as follows zheng et al 2016 h c a n where h is the average lake depth m and a is the lake area km2 c and n are coefficients which are taken as 6 5132 and 1 9711 respectively according to the contour data for the cherigele lake basin fig 1e this results in the following expression for h h 6 5132 a 1 9711 r 2 0 9971 the lake area a is a 0 3865 h 0 5073 r 2 0 9971 the lake volume can be calculated using a and h v 0 h a d h 0 0002564 h 1 5073 by taking h as the current average depth 5 5 m of cherigele lake li et al 2018 and considering that the sediment hofmann and geyh 1998 yang and williams 2003 yang et al 2010 wang et al 2016 during the high lake level period was about 11 m above the modern lake level fig 1d e it was determined that f 0 19 while the imb model gives f 0 12 since the sediment that formed in the high lake level period may now be covered by aeolian sand yang and williams 2003 cao et al 2020 the f calculated using the lake basin data may be an overestimate it has been reported that bde is a riverine lake i e 1 52 bdw is a terminal lake i e 1 03 and sms is a shrinking lake i e 0 57 luo et al 2017 these i e values are generally consistent with the results of 1 245 0 996 and 0 971 respectively obtained in this study overall the imb model gives a reliable result that is the current volume of the desert lakes is only 15 of the original volume studies have shown that the modern lake levels are 10 m lower than the high lake levels yang and williams 2003 cao et al 2020 and the lake area only accounts for 20 of the original area in the middle holocene there is no significant correlation between f and tds for the lakes fig 9a but f is well correlated with δ18o fig 10 especially for the northern lakes with the relationship δ18o 73834x5 75874x4 30846x3 6263 3x2 660 42x 21 085 r2 0 99 compared with the relationship δ18o 5 783 ln x 17 607 r2 0 72 for the southern lakes therefore it is feasible to consider using δ18o to estimate f in order to gain insights into the different evolution stages of the desert lakes 5 2 groundwater discharge and water cycle indicators in the bjd the groundwater discharge rates of typical bjd lakes are listed in table 2 based on 228ra isotope values yi et al 2020 reported that the groundwater discharge g of 17 lakes was 0 03 to 77 23 106 m3 yr with a discharge of 55 02 106 m3 yr from crg the reported g value for crg is obviously an overestimate due to the absence of lateral outflow q because given that crg has an area of 1 12 km2 and an annual evaporation of 1 000 mm the lake level is estimated to rise by about 48 m per year which is inconsistent with the observed fluctuation of almost 0 mm per year in this study the groundwater discharge from crg was determined to be 0 99 106 m3 yr providing a better explanation of why crg is almost in a balanced water state based on radium isotope values luo et al 2016 2017 determined that the groundwater discharge rates from badain east lake badain west lake and sumujilin south lake in summer are 8 10 mm d 1 720 900 mm yr 1 within three months in summer 4 5 mm d 1 360 450 mm yr 1 within three months in summer and 7 8 mm d 1 630 720 mm yr 1 within three months in summer respectively and reported that the total groundwater discharge from all of the bjd lakes reaches 1 68 105 m3 d 1 based on the daily groundwater discharge from the bjd lakes in august 2013 reported by luo et al 2016 2017 and assuming that the precipitation is mainly concentrated in summer and the groundwater discharge mainly occurs in the 90 days of the three summer months we estimated that the total groundwater discharge from the bjd lakes is 1 51 107 m3 yr however based on the viewpoint that the groundwater discharge rate from the lakes is quite stable and does not exhibit strong seasonal variation wang et al 2019 estimated that the groundwater discharge rate from sumujilin south lake is χ g 2 33 mm d 1 χ g 853 mm yr 1 according to the lake level dynamics given the years in the balanced water state χ g was estimated to be 876 mm yr 1 and thereby the groundwater discharge g was estimated to be 1 09 106 m3 yr which are consistent with the estimated groundwater discharge data for sumujilin south lake in this study namely χ g 872 mm yr 1 g 1 08 106 m3 yr similar results of χ g 85 4 mm month 1 and g 1 27 106 m3 yr were reported by gong et al 2016 based on the lake level dynamics the groundwater discharge rates have previously been estimated wang et al 2020 to be 3 06 mm d 1 1121 7 mm yr 1 for boerzongtu lake 1 79 mm d 1 655 3 mm yr 1 for nuoertu lake 2 39 mm d 1 875 3 mm yr 1 for yihejigede lake and 898 1024 6 mm yr 1 for huhejilin lake our results for these four lakes are 389 mm yr 1 854 mm yr 1 883 mm yr 1 and 864 mm yr 1 respectively as can be seen the results for the first two lakes differ greatly between this study and the previous study which is likely due to the fact that these two lakes are closer to the ybl and thereby are subject to more variable hydrodynamic conditions fig 1c in contrast the results for the latter two lakes are within the range of the annual water level changes it should be noted that the results of wang et al 2020 are only based on the water level changes within one year while the results of this study reflect the long term state of the groundwater discharge from the lakes the total area of the bjd lakes is 18 61 km2 n 94 based on each lake s χ g and area it was estimated that the total groundwater discharge from all of the bjd lakes is 1 63 107 m3 yr falling between the estimates of the annual groundwater discharge table 2 reported by gong et al 2016 and luo et al 2017 and agreeing with the results of wang et al 2019 previous studies have mostly used the g values of single lakes to estimate the total annual groundwater discharge from all of the lakes however the desert s lakes are distributed over hundreds of kilometers which leads to variations in the hydrodynamic conditions of the lakes this is confirmed by the absence of an obvious spatial distribution pattern of χ g fig 9b therefore it is more reasonable to calculate the total groundwater discharge to all the lakes using the χ g of each lake the χ g of a given lake is independent of its area depth and evaporation wang et al 2020 while χ g exhibits a certain correlation with the lake elevation for most of the northern lakes fig 11 a whose elevations decrease from southeast to northwest fig 9b accordingly χ g generally increases from southeast to northwest in the study area suggesting that the northwestern lakes may be receiving water recharge from more sources than was previously thought which may include the beida mountains to the south and the zongnai mountains to the north fig 1b in the east of cherigele lake fig 1 the thickness of quaternary sand aquifer is 150 600 m and a single well water yield of groundwater reaches 1 000 1 400 m3 d meanwhile the groundwater depth in inter dune depressions is generally about 1 10 m with feeble confined water locally occurring to the west of the cherigele lake fig 1 the underlying bedrocks are uplifted and the thickness of quaternary sand aquifer is 150 m the groundwater depth is generally 10 m and the water yield grows poor with a single well water yield of 500 m3 d wang et al 2021 therefore this spatial heterogeneity in water recharge sources is rooted in the hydrogeological differences in the aquifers underlying the lakes jin et al 2018 wang et al 2020 regarding the future evolution trends of the bjd lakes in this study it was observed that the higher the tds content the larger the χ g fig 8b 11b and the closer the dv dt is to 0 indicating that the lakes with high tds content are nearly in a balanced water state wherein the recharge is close to the discharge this is confirmed by the variations in the precipitation and lake levels wang et al 2020 despite the rise in the water levels of some lakes in certain years in general the lake water volume tends to decrease annually jiao et al 2015 with the lake water level dropping by 11 mm per year compared with 1967 the total lake area was 5 smaller in 2010 zhang et al 2015 it is projected that these lakes will completely dry up in 150 years if the climatic conditions remain unchanged yang and williams 2003 5 3 evolution of lake water δ18o and controlling factors many of the input parameters of the imb model can affect the estimation of the δ18o mainly including the temperature humidity groundwater endmember δg 18o atmospheric δa 18o and groundwater discharge rate to explore the impacts of these factors on the estimation cherigele lake was chosen as a typical lake to analyze the evolution of δ18o under various factors the input model parameters for cherigele lake are temperature t 12 c relative humidity h 0 37 groundwater discharge rate χ g 0 882 m δ18o of groundwater δg 18o 3 27 and δ18o of the water vapor δa 18o 22 1 as is shown in fig 12 in which δ18o is plotted under various t h and χ g conditions while holding the other factors constant t changes the magnitude of δ18o when f is 0 1 0 95 where the f δ18o curves are nearly parallel fig 12a moreover the higher t is the lower magnitude of δ18o is with an average gradient of 0 06 c the impact of h on δ18o is as follows fig 12b when h is 0 2 0 4 the higher h is the lower δ18o is and when f is 0 1 0 9 the higher h is the higher the reduction rate of δ18o is when h 0 5 the f δ18o curves exhibit a significantly different pattern namely rapidly increasing to the maximum δ18o at f 0 95 and then rapidly decreasing to the minimum δ18o at f 0 1 in addition χ g affects how fast in terms of f δ18o reaches its maximum value fig 12c the larger χ g is the earlier δ18o reaches its maximum for example when χ g 0 88 δ18o reaches its maximum of 14 59 at f 0 925 whereas when χ g 0 8 δ18o reaches its maximum of 14 2 at f 0 775 in addition when f 0 775 the higher χ g is the higher δ18o is but the opposite trend occurs when f 0 775 i e the higher χ g is the lower δ18o is δg 18o has an impact similar to that of t fig 13 a δg 18o does not affect the shapes of the f δ18o curves with the curves being nearly parallel to each other when f is 0 1 0 95 however the higher δg 18o is the higher the lake water δ18o is the impact of δa 18o is generally similar to that of h fig 13b but there are also differences the f δ18o curves under different δa 18o conditions have an obvious intersection point at f 0 6 when f 0 6 the higher δa 18o is the lower δ18o is whereas when f 0 6 the higher δa 18o is the higher δ18o is as shown above h and δa 18o have more obvious impacts on the lake water δ18o than δg 18o does figs 12 13 demonstrating the dominant role of the water vapor isotopes in the evolution of the lake water isotopes in desert areas yadav 1997 the f δ18o curves of cherigele lake exhibit the following characteristics as f decreases δ18o initially rapidly increases f 0 9 and then it slowly decreases f 0 2 0 9 followed by a rapid decrease f 0 2 figs 12 13 although the environmental factors affect the value of δ18o they do not affect the overall trend of the f δ18o curve therefore this relationship model can be used to reconstruct and verify the evaporation stages of lakes and to investigate the paleoclimate in the late holocene especially the temperature and air humidity fig 14 shows the evolution of the relationship between δ2h and δ18o as a function of f with the relationship curves exhibiting a typical hook shape due to the isotopic fractionation in the hydration sphere of the ions fontes and gonfiantini 1967 gonfiantini 1986 this isotopic evolution process explains why lakes with higher tds contents are not richer in heavy isotopes another noteworthy issue is that previous studies used the same evaporation line for all the lakes when analyzing the evaporation of desert lakes based on stable isotope values ma and yang 2008 jin et al 2018 however the evaporation lines independently obtained in the two lake zones are nearly parallel to each other fig 7 with a slope of 4 87 for the southern lake zone and 4 74 for the northern lake zone comparison of the isotopic values of the groundwater and precipitation indicates that the lel of the southern lakes intersects with the gmwl at the data point corresponding to the annual mean δ2h and δ18o of the ybl and bde precipitation moreover the isotopic values of the groundwater are on the lel within a small range fig 7 indicating that the southern lakes and the surrounding groundwater mainly receive recharge water from the local precipitation and the lateral outflow of the ybl fig 1b because the sand aquifer in the southern lake zone is thin and even the bedrock is exposed near the badain east lake wang et al 2021 which is beneficial to the infiltration recharge furthermore the hydraulic gradient in this zone reaches 0 7 cao et al 2020 which promotes lateral runoff recharge in contrast the northern lakes and their surrounding groundwater have a wide range of isotopic values and the isotopic values of the precipitation deviate from the gmwl indicating that the northern lakes receive recharge water from multiple sources given that the lower the elevation the higher the χ g fig 11a it is possible that the downstream area receives a higher amount of mixed recharge water from both the beida mountains and the zongnai mountains than the upstream area fig 1b and the mixing of the paleowater dated in the middle holocene wang et al 2021 with the groundwater from the present recharge may occur in addition the variability of the impacts of the evaporation runoff and water rock interactions on the groundwater is more significant in the northern lake zone jin et al 2018 which shapes the present hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of groundwater 6 conclusions hydrochemical and stable isotope analysis were performed on water samples from 94 lakes in the bjd then a stable isotope mass balance model was established and used to calculate the remaining water fraction f of 94 lakes relative to the high lake levels in the middle holocene as well as the groundwater recharge rate χ g to the lakes the results indicated that the spatial distribution of f and χ g do not exhibit an obvious pattern additionally only 10 20 average of 15 of the original lake water remains while one third of the lakes have become terminal lakes and half are still gradually drying moreover the total annual groundwater recharge to all the lakes in the bjd is 1 63 107 m3 yr which accounts for 0 087 of the total discharge of desert groundwater obtained by the water balance method wang et al 2021 additionally the southern lakes are mainly recharged by local precipitation and lateral runoff of ybl however the recharge of the northern lakes is from more sources and there is more mixed recharge to shallow groundwater from beida mountains and zongnai mountains at the same time the paleowater infiltrated in the middle holocene may account for a larger proportion of the present groundwater especially the deep groundwater the distance from the mountain area the hydrogeological conditions of the aquifer and the water rock interactions cooperatively affect the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of the present groundwater next the δ18o evolution model of crg reveals that humidity h and atmospheric vapor δa 18o play the leading role in the evolution of the lake δ18o during the process of lake shrinkage the lake δ18o value initially increased rapidly f 0 9 and then decreased gradually f 0 9 our research results not only affords a useful reference to accurately calculate the amount of groundwater and reasonably manage groundwater resources of the bjd but also improves the understanding of desert water cycle in

3038,with climate warming and frequent extreme weather events the structure and function of grassland ecosystems have been significantly altered the qilian mountains are a wet island serving as an important ecological barrier in china and central asia it is highly sensitive and prone to climate change yet the vulnerability of grasslands to climate variability in this region remains unclear in this study based a ndvi dataset and meteorological data we evaluated the relative vulnerability of grassland ecosystems to short term climate variability by combining three indices exposure sensitivity and resilience and explored its relationship with water use efficiency wue the results show that the spatial distribution patterns of grassland vulnerability in the qilian mountains from 2000 to 2018 were largely determined by exposure and sensitivity is positively correlated with exposure and negatively correlated with resilience the vulnerability of alpine meadow and alpine steppe is higher than that of temperate typical steppe and temperate desert steppe climate and topography gradients together affect the degree of grassland vulnerability grasslands with higher vulnerability are mainly found at medium elevation 3200 4000 m area where the topography is flat the northern grasslands are primarily influenced by temperature while the western and southern parts are mainly affected by precipitation alpine meadow and alpine steppe are more vulnerable to temperature and temperate desert steppe is more vulnerable to changes in precipitation the higher the vulnerability the lower the wue of the grasslands this study provides a reference for assessing the impact of climate change on grassland ecosystems and developing grassland vegetation management strategies keywords climate change grassland ecosystems vulnerability qilian mountains data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction grasslands cover about 25 of the total global land area and are the main type of terrestrial ecosystems hui and jackson 2006 playing an essential role in climate regulation soil and water conservation windbreak and sand fixation and biodiversity conservation raiesi and riahi 2014 liu et al 2019 meanwhile as an important carbon sink grasslands are closely linked to the material and energy cycles of terrestrial ecosystems scurlock and hall 1998 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2020 there is increasing evidence that the composition structure and function of grassland ecosystems are substantially affected by global climate change craine et al 2013 hoover et al 2014 de boeck et al 2018 especially in alpine regions increasing climate variability and extreme events will generate higher ecological risks to grasslands zhang et al 2018 li et al 2019b wu et al 2021 therefore in order to mitigate the ecological economic and social consequences of future climate change we must understand and quantify the vulnerability of grassland ecosystems to short term climate variability the vulnerability of ecosystems has become a hot research topic in the field of climate change in recent years ipcc 2021 zarei et al 2021 currently studies on ecosystem vulnerability have been conducted at regional continental and global scales loarie et al 2009 pacifici et al 2015 fremout et al 2020 however these studies only consider an exposure to climate change when assessing ecosystem vulnerability dobrowski et al 2013 exposure describes the extent to which a species or ecosystem is likely to experience climate disturbance in the future loarie et al 2009 dobrowski et al 2013 the higher the exposure the more vulnerable the ecosystem to climate change brito morales et al 2020 further research found that ecosystems exposed to similar climate conditions may have different vulnerabilities due to differences in sensitivity and resilience li et al 2018a fremout et al 2020 sensitivity reflects the degree to which a species or ecosystem changes when disturbed de keersmaecker et al 2015 resilience refers to the ability of a species or ecosystem to recover to its initial state after disturbed hoover et al 2014 together higher sensitivity and weaker resilience would create a vulnerable system therefore integrating all three aspects of vulnerability exposure sensitivity and resilience may offer more comprehensive and spatially explicit adaptation strategies to reduce the impacts of climate change on ecosystems a recent study mapped the spatial patterns of terrestrial ecosystem vulnerability at a global scale li et al 2018a however some regions such as the qilian mountains in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau were not fully considered in this global assessment more importantly although li et al 2019b assessed alpine grasslands sensitivity over the qinghai tibet plateau that study neglected the exposure and resilience of grassland ecosystems to climate variability the qilian mountains a representative of typical alpine mountains are an important ecological security barrier and priority area for biodiversity conservation in western china and have important functions and significance in maintaining the ecological balance of the qinghai tibet plateau and safeguarding the recharge of inland river runoff in the hexi corridor he et al 2018 grasslands are the most widespread ecosystem type in the qilian mountains xu et al 2020 and have various ecological functions such as wind and sand control soil and water conservation however due to climate warming and weather extremes the alpine grasslands in this region are degraded and biodiversity is declining yao et al 2016 with consequent changes in regional ecohydrological characteristics kayiranga et al 2021 previous studies have shown that grassland vegetation in the qilian mountains is sensitive and vulnerable to climate change due to its special geographical location xu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 but a more comprehensive and systematic spatial representation of the vulnerability of grassland ecosystems in the region is lacking li et al 2019b therefore there is an urgent need to monitor and map the vulnerability of grassland ecosystems in the qilian mountains to short term climate variability with the aim of providing a scientific basis for prioritizing areas for adaptation measures by organizations managing natural resources in addition the carbon and water cycling processes in grassland ecosystems in the qilian mountains have also been altered by climate change liu et al 2021 as a coupled indicator of the carbon and water cycles in terrestrial ecosystems assessing the dynamics of water use efficiency wue can provide a reference for understanding the interactions between regional carbon and water cycles keenan et al 2013 differences in ecosystem responses to climate change have been found to be attributable to wue baldocchi et al 2004 wolf et al 2013 therefore wue can provide further insights into ecosystem response to climate change and its relation to vulnerability this study aims to understand the spatial patterns of grassland ecosystems vulnerability in the qilian mountains to short term climate variability and to explore its relationship with wue moreover qilian mountains have a complex substratum with large hydrothermal gradients and topography is an important environmental factor in shaping the vegetation pattern elevation in particular causes a clear vertical zonal distribution of vegetation types by altering temperature and precipitation patterns in the vertical direction tao et al 2015 within the same elevation gradient slope is also an important factor affecting the growth and distribution of grassland vegetation qin et al 2016 although elevation dependent change patterns of vegetation greenness and phenology have been analyzed in the high mountains of southwest china qinghai tibet plateau and even at the global scale tao et al 2015 tao et al 2018 gao et al 2019 there are regional differences in the dynamics of vegetation and environmental factors and their relationships due to climate heterogeneity li et al 2018b in view of this this study also explores the variation of grassland ecosystem vulnerability with environmental gradients in summary the main objectives of this study are 1 to quantify the vulnerability of grassland ecosystems to climate change in the qilian mountains over the period 2000 2018 2 to reveal the relationship between grassland ecosystems vulnerability and wue 3 to investigate spatial patterns of climate factors driving grassland dynamics this study can provide a basis for maintaining the stable and orderly development of grassland ecosystems mitigating and adapting to the adverse effects of external stresses on ecosystems and ecosystem restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qilian mountains are located at the northeastern edge of the qinghai tibetan plateau straddling gansu and qinghai provinces fig 1 a it is about 800 km long from east to west at an elevation of 4000 6000 m the terrain is high in the north west and low in the south east and consists of a number of parallel northwest southeast oriented mountains and wide valleys the largest inland lake in china qinghai lake is located in this region the qilian mountains are characterized by complex natural conditions and large differences in water and heat conditions with typical continental plateau climate characteristics the average temperature during the growing season may september in the study area for the period of 2000 2018 is 5 8 and the mean precipitation is 290 9 mm figs s1a s1b grasslands in this region are mainly distributed in the range of 2100 4600 m above sea level alpine meadow alpine steppe temperate typical steppe and temperate desert steppe account for 59 10 27 and 4 of the total grassland area respectively distributed in the range of 2500 4800 m 2300 4600 m 2100 4500 m 2400 4600 m above sea level fig 1b 1c 2 2 data source and pre processing 2 2 1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et the modis ndvi mod13a2 gpp mod17a2h and et mod16a2 dataset products from 2000 to 2018 were obtained from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov the spatial resolution of ndvi dataset is 1 km since atmospheric factors such as cloud cover and aerosols have a large impact on remote sensing images we used savitzky golay approach to reduce noise and smooth the ndvi time series data based on quality control files in this study the ndvi of grasslands in the qilian mountains from may to september of the growing season was selected for analysis and the mean growing season ndvi

the average monthly temperature and monthly precipitation for 2000 2018 which were obtained from national earth system science data center national science technology infrastructure of china https www geodata cn with a spatial resolution of 1 km the climatic research unit cru time series data are downscaled using the high spatial resolution reference climatology dataset of worldclim to generate the dataset peng et al 2019 the monthly air temperature at 2 m and precipitation were obtained from worldclim dataset and cru time series data first the 30 original cru time series data and reference climatology data with different spatial resolutions were evaluated by observations second the 30 original cru time series data were spatially downscaled to four spatial resolutions 10 5 2 5 and 0 5 corresponding to the spatial resolutions of the reference climatology data using the delta downscaling framework the downscaled data were validated through observations in addition the accuracy of the 0 5 downscaled data was compared with that of data downscaled with other spatial resolutions to demonstrate the performance of the downscaling framework finally the climatology data and annual trends in temperature and precipitation were investigated using the 30 original cru 0 5 downscaled it was also validated with data from 496 independent meteorological observation points and the validation results were credible peng et al 2019 2 2 3 auxiliary data digital elevation model dem was obtained from the resource environment science and data center https www resdc cn default aspx with a spatial resolution of 1 km grassland types data were obtained from the china ecosystem assessment and ecological security database https www ecosystem csdb cn 2 3 methods 2 3 1 exposure assessment exposure which considers only the extrinsic climate conditions can be estimated using the climate change velocities based on annual mean temperature and total annual precipitation mm loarie et al 2009 the climate velocity considers climate change as a movement of matter and thus allows for the representation of climate change in terms of spatial climate transport which is closely linked to the movement of organisms and energy in the biosphere loarie et al 2009 molinos et al 2016 brito morales et al 2020 in this study climate change velocity of temperature and precipitation was obtained as the ratio of the temporal gradients to the spatial gradients 1 vel tem temp e rature t e m p o r a l g r a d i e n t temp e rature s p a t i a l g r a d i e n t 2 vel pre precipitation t e m p o r a l g r a d i e n t precipitation s p a t i a l g r a d i e n t where veltem kmyr 1 and velpre kmyr 1 represent the climate change velocity of temperature and precipitation respectively the temporal gradients of temperature and precipitation for 2000 2018 were calculated using a least squares linear regression for each grid in calculating the spatial gradient the average of the temperature and precipitation from 2000 to 2018 is first calculated and on this basis the spatial gradients of the 19 year average were calculated using average maximum technique burrough and mcdonell 1998 this method calculates the spatial gradients of intermediate grids by opening a 3 3 grid window on the meteorological data in order to adjust for the variation in the actual distance represented by the edge lengths of the image elements in the east west direction at different latitudes a factor of 111 325 km per degree was used loarie et al 2009 the conversion was accomplished using the following equation 3 c o s π 180 y 111 235 where y is the latitude of the pixel in degrees once the climate change velocities in temperature veltem and precipitation velpre have been calculated they were rescaled between 0 and 1 using the maximum and minimum values and are used to calculate the exposure index we referred to the equation proposed by li et al 2018a to weight the exposure index using the spatial coefficients of temperature and precipitation this weighs all climate variables and allows for a better assessment of exposure than previous methods dobrowski et al 2013 ordonez et al 2014 equation is as follows 4 exp α vel tem β vel pre where exp is the exposure index dimensionless α and β are the coefficients for temperature and precipitation from equation 5 2 3 2 sensitivity and resilience assessment some studies have considered sensitivity or resistance as an aspect of resilience walker et al 2004 scheffer et al 2009 serra maluquer et al 2018 however this study adopts the approach of grimm and wissel 1997 which considers sensitivity and resilience as separate properties related theoretical studies suggest that systems with lower resilience i e those with a higher probability of crossing a threshold into another state holling 1973 are more responsive to perturbations and more sensitive to environmental perturbations scheffer et al 2009 sensitivity is an empirically calculated property that reflects the response of vegetation to climate change seddon et al 2016 resilience is a temporal autocorrelation of the vegetation state de keersmaecker et al 2015 a recent empirical method can simultaneously quantify global vegetation sensitivity and resilience under short term climate variability de keersmaecker et al 2015 seddon et al 2016 in this study we tailored the empirical methodology to identify grassland ecosystem sensitivity and resilience to climate variability over the qilian mountains unlike the study by seddon et al 2016 we initially selected ndvi as a proxy for vegetation productivity instead of the monthly evi because ndvi generally performs better for low density canopies and grasslands ji and peters 2007 furthermore for two major climatic variables we employed temperature and precipitation from downscaled data peng et al 2019 instead of those solely derived from modis seddon et al 2016 li et al 2018a first the grassland vegetative response to short term climate variability was evaluated using an autoregressive model ar1 with the ndvi anomaly as the dependent variable and the temperature precipitation and ndvi anomaly data at an earlier time as independent variables a one month lagged ndvi anomaly provides the best explanatory power for the delayed response of vegetation to climate change at the time scale seddon et al 2016 therefore in this study a one month lagged ndvi anomaly was chosen as the third variable to characterize the potential impact of memory effects on vegetation and thus the ability of vegetation to recover after disturbance de keersmaecker et al 2015 li et al 2018a the sensitivity and resilience of vegetative productivity to climate variability 2000 2018 were quantified using the following equation 5 ndvi t α tem t β pre t γ ndvi t 1 where ndvit is the standardized ndvi anomaly series at time t temt is the standardized temperature anomaly series at time t pret is the standardized precipitation anomaly series at time t ndvit 1 is the standardized ndvi anomaly series at time t 1 ε denotes the residual error α β and γ are the model coefficients for the temperature precipitation and ndvit 1 anomalies respectively α β and γ were rescaled between 0 and 1 using the minimum and maximum values to be used for our calculations of sensitivity and resilience to ensure comparability between coefficients all of the time series were detrended and standardized in equation 5 when performing regression analysis the standardized anomaly series of precipitation and temperature data were first transformed using z score normalization to remove any impact of co linearity between the two climate variables principal components regression pcr was used to identify the relative importance of each variable driving monthly variations of ndvi in each pixel seddon et al 2016 and the principal component with a significant relationship to climate p 0 1 was selected for regression analysis γ represents the weight coefficient of ndvit 1 reflecting the similarity of grassland vegetation status at two adjacent moments a larger γ indicates that the ndvi at moment t is closer to the ndvi at moment t 1 indicating that the grassland vegetation recovers more slowly after external disturbances verbesselt et al 2016 thus the resilience can be expressed as li et al 2018a 6 res 1 γ where res is the resilience index dimensionless γ is the coefficient for ndvi t 1 anomalies second to estimate the variations of both the climate variables and ndvi on these time series we used the residuals of a quadratic linear model fitted to the mean variance relationship of both the ndvi and climate variables for each pixel we rescaled the residuals 0 100 for each variable to unify calculation sensitivity metrics are the ratios between ndvi variability and each of the climate variables each ratio was weighted according to the importance of the climate variable to ndvi variability by multiplying it by the value of the regression coefficient climate weights α and β the sensitivity index was calculated by summing sensitivity scores for each variable 7 sen α tem sen β pre sen where sen is the sensitivity index dimensionless temsen and presen are the sensitivity of grassland ecosystems to temperature and precipitation respectively α and β are coefficients for temperature and precipitation from equation 5 respectively finally exp sen res and vul were rescaled 0 to 100 using the minimum and maximum values of individual variables the exp sen res and vul have no units and therefore provides relative information the detailed algorithm for calculating sen and the r script can be found in seddon et al 2016 2 3 3 vulnerability assessment the vulnerability of grassland ecosystems to climate change was characterized within a widely used framework of exposure sensitivity and resilience the following equation was used to incorporate exposure sensitivity and resilience into an overall vulnerability index li et al 2018a 8 vul exp s e n 1 r e s where vul is the vulnerability index exp is the exposure index sen is the sensitivity index res is the resilience index this equation assumes that vulnerability varies linearly with exposure and sensitivity because the immediate response of an ecosystem to climate change stressors is determined by these two components ippolito et al 2010 2 3 4 water use efficiency wue ecosystem water use efficiency wue is an important parameter of carbon water coupling which connects the carbon cycle and water cycle keenan et al 2013 nie et al 2021 wue is general defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et ponton et al 2006 gpp is the sum of carbon gained by ecosystems by photosynthesis and the et represents the sum of water loss from soil evaporation and plant transpiration moore et al 2008 the wue of grassland ecosystems can be computed as follows 9 w u e g p p e t where wue is the water use efficiency gcm 2 mm 1 gpp is the annual carbon assimilation gcm 2 et is the annual water loss mm 2 3 5 correlation analysis to better understand the relationship between four indices of exposure sensitivity resilience and vulnerability the correlation coefficient between the two was calculated using spearman correlation coefficient spearman rank correlation is often used as a non parametric alternative to linear regression and correlation because it applies the rank rather than making assumptions about the distribution of the two variables pastén zapata et al 2020 it works by calculating the pearson s correlation of the rank values of the data of interest the spearman correlation coefficient is therefore a statistical measure of the strength of the monotonic relationship between the paired data 3 results 3 1 spatial patterns of grassland ecosystems vulnerability grassland ecosystems in the qilian mountains showed significant spatial variation in exposure sensitivity resilience and vulnerability between 2000 and 2018 fig 2 the spatial distribution patterns of grassland vulnerability were very similar to that of exposure fig 2a 2d with a significant positive correlation between the two spearman s ρ 0 931 q 0 001 the high values of exposure and vulnerability were concentrated in parts of the central qilian mountains around lakes and rivers except for some areas mainly in the west and east where exposure was low and vulnerability was at an intermediate level the high values of grassland sensitivity were scattered throughout the qilian mountains with the highest proportion of high sensitivity values in the central part of the region fig 2b furthermore grasslands in the western part of the qilian mountains and the northern part of qinghai lake showed low resilience while grasslands in the central part showed high resilience fig 2c sensitivity was significantly and positively correlated with exposure spearman s ρ 0 313 q 0 001 and was negatively correlated with resilience spearman s ρ 0 217 q 0 001 the exposure sensitivity resilience and vulnerability of the different grassland types in the qilian mountains showed significant differences fig 3 the four grassland types showed similar patterns of variation in exposure and vulnerability fig 3a 3d with alpine steppe 14 395 8 903 and alpine meadow 14 155 7 873 showing higher vulnerability followed by temperate desert steppe 12 459 6 088 and temperate typical steppe had the lowest 11 612 6 773 the sensitivity was higher in alpine meadow 35 332 12 130 and alpine steppe 35 021 12 330 and lowest in temperate desert steppe 31 509 10 824 fig 3b in terms of resilience index variation both alpine meadow and alpine steppe alm 80 526 9 256 als 78 098 10 473 showed higher resilience than temperate typical steppe 76 387 11 081 and temperate desert steppe 73 607 10 733 fig 3c it is worth noting that temperate typical steppe was more sensitive but its lower exposure and higher resilience made it the least vulnerable of the four grassland types alpine meadow was slightly more sensitive than alpine steppe but its lower exposure and higher resilience made it less vulnerable than alpine steppe in summary both alpine meadow and alpine steppe were more sensitive and vulnerable than the other two grassland types 3 2 changes in grassland ecosystems vulnerability under different environmental gradients 3 2 1 climate gradients during the period 2000 2018 61 of the qilian mountains showed a warming trend and 39 a cooling trend fig s1c and precipitation increased in almost all areas fig s1d grassland exposure sensitivity resilience and vulnerability varied regularly along the climatic gradients fig 4 exposure and vulnerability tended to increase with increasing rates of temperature change between 0 04 0 025 c yr 1 fig 4a 4d and both tended to decrease when the rate of temperature change exceeded 0 025 c yr 1 sensitivity and resilience showed a fluctuating increasing trend with increasing rate of temperature change fig 4b 4c in terms of precipitation gradients exposure sensitivity resilience and vulnerability showed fluctuating increasing trends with increasing rates of precipitation change fig 4e 4f 4g 4h exposure varied most significantly with temperature and precipitation gradients and sensitivity varied least figure s2 showed the variation of the four indices under typical climate gradients temperature precipitation exposure and vulnerability showed the same characteristics with temperature precipitation gradients figs s2a s2d in the high temperature high precipitation case exposure and vulnerability were higher while sensitivity and resilience were higher figs s2b s2c in the high temperature low precipitation case exposure and vulnerability were higher while sensitivity and resilience were lower 3 2 2 topography gradients in order to investigate the variation of grassland vulnerability along elevation gradients the mean values of exposure sensitivity resilience and vulnerability were calculated at 50 m elevation intervals fig 5 a 5b 5c 5d the change in the number of pixels at each elevation interval showed that the number of pixels was mainly concentrated around 4000 m fig s3c overall the exposure and vulnerability of grassland tended to increase and then decrease along elevation gradients fig 5a 5d exposure and vulnerability showed a fluctuating increase between 2300 and 4000 m above sea level and after 4000 m both tended to decrease the high values of exposure and vulnerability were concentrated in the range 3200 4000 m above sea level indicating the highest vulnerability of grasslands at mid elevation over the last 19 years sensitivity tended to increase and then decrease with altitude fig 5b with high values concentrate at low and middle elevations indicating that grasslands at low and middle elevations were the most sensitive to climate change in contrast the resilience showed a fluctuating increase between 2600 and 4600 m and after 4600 m the resilience tended to decrease with increasing elevation fig 5c significant differences were found in exposure sensitivity resilience and vulnerability of grasslands at different gradients of slope fig 5e 5f 5g 5h spatially high values of vulnerability were concentrated in areas of lesser slope fig 2d s1e there was a significant quadratic relationship between exposure vulnerability and slope gradients with r2 reaching above 0 8 fig 5e 5h overall exposure and vulnerability tended to decrease with increasing slope suggesting that the flatter the area the higher the exposure and vulnerability with both decreasing fastest between 0 20 and levelling off after slopes 20 sensitivity tended to decrease along the slope gradients fig 5f while resilience tended to increase fig 5g suggesting that grassland resilience was relatively low in flat areas 3 3 relationship between grassland ecosystem vulnerability and wue in the qilian mountains the mean annual wue for 2000 2018 was 1 149 0 777 gcm 2 mm 1 the wue pattern of grassland ecosystems had a significantly larger spatial variability with an overall trend of low in the northwest and high in the southeast fig 6 a for a more specific analysis of the spatial patterns of wue the slope and z value for each pixel were evaluated by the theil sen median and mann kendall methods the mann kendall test results showed that wue in 0 12 of the area increased significantly p 0 05 and wue in 36 68 of the area decreased significantly fig 6b as grassland exposure and vulnerability increased the mean annual wue tended to decrease fig 6c 6f wue was positively correlated with sensitivity and negatively correlated with resilience fig 6d 6e the faster the rate of increase or decrease in wue the low the exposure resilience and vulnerability fig 6g 6i 6j and the lower the sensitivity fig 6h 3 4 dominant climate factors of grassland ecosystems vulnerability according to the vulnerability formula the greater the sensitivity normalization factor climate weights the greater the contribution of the climate factor to vulnerability the spatial distributions of dominant climate controls showed that the vulnerability to changes in precipitation was higher than that to temperature in about 57 of the total area mainly in the western and southern parts of the qilian mountains fig 7 c the northern grasslands were primarily influenced by temperature while the western and southern parts were mainly affected by precipitation fig 7a 7b in terms of the four grassland types alpine meadow and alpine steppe were more vulnerable to temperature change and temperate desert steppe were the least vulnerable fig 8 a vulnerability to precipitation was highest in temperate desert steppe followed by temperate typical steppe and lowest in alpine meadow fig 8b the main climatic control factor for all four grassland types was precipitation fig 8c in contrast temperate typical grasslands and temperate desert grasslands were more significantly controlled by precipitation 61 and 74 respectively vulnerability of grasslands to temperature tended to increase and then decrease with elevation fig 8d grasslands vulnerability to temperature increased with elevation from 2400 to 3700 m above sea level after 3700 m it tended to decrease the vulnerability of grasslands to precipitation fluctuated downwards with elevation with higher vulnerability to precipitation at lower elevations fig 8e in summary the dominant role of precipitation tended to decrease increase decrease with elevation but the opposite was true for temperature fig 8f 4 discussion 4 1 spatial heterogeneity of grassland ecosystems vulnerability the spatial distribution patterns of grassland ecosystems vulnerability in the qilian mountains are very similar to that of exposure fig 2a 2d suggesting that the vulnerability of grassland vegetation depends mainly on its exposure to external disturbances and similar patterns have been found in regional and global scale studies beaugrand et al 2015 li et al 2018a however there are regional differences in the spatial distribution of exposure and vulnerability with lower exposure and higher vulnerability in the southwest southeast and parts of the central part of the study area mainly due to the higher sensitivity and lower resilience of these areas fig 2b 2c thus the impact of climate change on grassland ecosystems also depends on their sensitivity and resilience verbesselt et al 2016 li et al 2018a grassland exposure is positively correlated with sensitivity spearman s ρ 0 313 q 0 001 suggesting that more exposed grasslands exhibit higher sensitivity mainly in the central qilian mountains fig 2a 2b this is mainly related to the state of succession of ecosystems where climatically disturbed ecosystems are often in an unbalanced or unstable state and those that recover from premature disturbance are often more sensitive than stable ecosystems kröel dulay et al 2015 in other words more exposed grasslands are at a stage where they have recovered or are recovering due to early disturbances from climate change and are generally more sensitive than surrounding ecosystems that are less exposed or more stable in other words more exposed grasslands are at a stage where they have recovered or are recovering due to early disturbances from climate change and are generally more sensitive than surrounding ecosystems that are less exposed or more stable furthermore sensitivity is negatively correlated with resilience spearman s ρ 0 217 q 0 001 with more sensitive grasslands being less resilient grassland resilience is lower in the western part of the study area and in the northern part of qinghai lake fig 2c this is mainly due to the higher exposure and sensitivity of grassland in this area thus the magnitude of grassland resilience depends largely on the degree of ecosystem disturbance oliveras and malhi 2016 laris et al 2016 and once a certain threshold of disturbance is reached the ecosystem may be close to collapse banks leite et al 2014 the vulnerability of different grassland types in the qilian mountains varies considerably fig 3d alpine meadow and alpine steppe are the two typical alpine vegetation types in the region and both are more vulnerable overall than temperate typical steppe and temperate desert steppe a similar phenomenon was found in a study by gao et al 2018 on chinese grasslands this is mainly due to the fact that alpine grassland vegetations are much more disturbed by climate extremes than temperate typical steppe and temperate desert steppe resulting in higher exposure and sensitivity liu et al 2018 and thus higher vulnerability notably the resilience of both alpine grasslands is also higher fig 3c it was found that ecosystems recovered faster with more disturbance mainly due to the dominances of the dominant vegetation species over the ecosystem allowing it to tolerate disturbance and respond quickly to them willis et al 2018 it follows that the dominance of a few species is characteristic of most ecosystems hoover et al 2014 and understanding the characteristics of these species and their responses to climate extremes will be key to predicting future ecosystem dynamics and function he et al 2015 however temperate typical steppe and temperate desert steppe are less resilient mainly due to low soil utilization gessler et al 2017 and phenological variability severely limits potential growth later in the growing season lian et al 2020 these types of grasslands are difficult to restore to their initial state once they have been subjected to major external climatic disturbances yao et al 2016 many studies have shown that the spatial distributions of vegetation are not entirely determined by climatic factors but also by other environmental factors such as latitude elevation soil and water table iverson and prasad 1998 kløve et al 2014 li et al 2018b xu et al 2020 in arid mountainous areas the spatial heterogeneity of different environmental factors makes the response of grassland vegetation change to climate change more complex he et al 2015 yang et al 2018 climate elevation and slope all have an impact on the vulnerability of grassland ecosystems fig 4d 4h 5d 5h overall the changing trends in exposure and vulnerability are generally consistent across climate gradients the relationship between vulnerability and climate gradient shows that vulnerability increases with increasing precipitation trend and tends to increase and then decrease with increasing temperature trend fig 4d 4h this suggests that temperature change can form a more favorable hydrothermal combination with increased rainfall at a certain time making grasslands less vulnerable to climate change and favoring their growth gao et al 2018 elevation and slope are important environmental factors on the growth of grassland vegetation qin et al 2016 tao et al 2018 grasslands with higher vulnerability are mainly found in the mid elevation 3200 4000 m areas of the qilian mountains with less topographic relief fig 5d 5h these areas are relatively flat figs s1e s4c have high grassland exposure fig 5a and have moderate grass resilience and sensitivity at this elevation fig 5b 5c the more sensitive grasslands are mainly found at low and medium elevations with an increasing trend in resilience between 2500 and 4600 m with increasing elevation however in the qinghai tibet plateau region the sensitivity of alpine grasslands was found to increase along an elevation gradient li et al 2019b the reason for this is that non climatic factors such as human activity were not considered in this study when assessing sensitivity and resilience and in fact human activity stress is weakly correlated with sensitivity and resilience li et al 2018a with higher human activity stress being associated with higher sensitivity and lower resilience in the context of global warming the impact of non climatic factors on grassland vegetation cannot be ignored wang et al 2016 liu et al 2019 the qilian mountains are a very important pastoral area where population growth and overgrazing have led to a reduction in vegetation cover and biodiversity at lower elevations increased soil erosion and desertification and damage to the integrity of grassland ecosystems making them more sensitive and less resilient to climate change vitousek et al 1997 wang et al 2016 li et al 2018a this may be the main reason for the higher sensitivity of grasslands at middle and low elevations 4 2 relationship between grassland ecosystem vulnerability and wue the low values of grassland wue are mainly distributed in the northwest of qilian mountains mainly due to the low productivity of grassland in this area and high evapotranspiration yang et al 2021 long term trend analysis showed that grassland wue decreased in the north and southeast might be due to the rate of et increase exceeding that of gpp increase fig 6b liu et al 2021 it can be further explained as a result of the increase in temperature fig s1c when the temperature increases the evapotranspiration of soil moisture and vegetation canopy is higher than gpp resulting in a decrease in grassland wue yu et al 2008 peñuelas et al 2011 in contrast the rate of gpp rise exceeded that of et rise resulted in a wue increase in parts of the western qilian mountains in addition this study finds that the high vulnerability of grassland ecosystems leads to a decrease in its wue indicating vulnerability to climate change in grassland vegetation affects the level of wue in the qilian mountains higher vulnerability of grassland ecosystems under the combined effects of high temperature and high precipitation fig s2d this resulted in lower wue yu et al 2008 li et al 2019a 4 3 the impact of climate factors on grassland ecosystems vulnerability arid mountain ecosystems are exceptionally vulnerable to changes in temperature and precipitation he et al 2015 du et al 2019 and precipitation is considered to be the main driver of vegetation growth changes in these ecosystems xu et al 2020 this study explored the relationship between grassland ecosystems and climate factors based on the pixel scale and found significant spatial heterogeneity in the vulnerability of grasslands to changes in temperature and precipitation fig 7 in the northern qilian mountains where temperatures are cooler but warming rates are higher figs s1a s1c excessive warming accelerates evapotranspiration and increases drought trends thereby inhibiting vegetation activity gao et al 2018 this makes grasslands much more vulnerable to temperature than precipitation fig 7a whereas in the west precipitation is low and tends to decrease over the years figs s1b s1d making grasslands more vulnerable to changes in precipitation fig 7b in the south where precipitation is high but warming is relatively limited figs s1a s1b ecosystem sensitivity to precipitation change elicits a strong response within the system gao et al 2018 contributing more to the vulnerability of southern grasslands in terms of elevational gradients in temperature and precipitation vulnerability grasslands at low elevations with low precipitation and high temperature figs s4a s4b and under dry conditions tend to be more vulnerable to changes in precipitation you et al 2018 and as elevation increases precipitation increases while temperature decreases which leads to reduced evapotranspiration and thus increased plant availability guo et al 2013 and vulnerability to precipitation is reduced thus the vulnerability of grasslands to precipitation changes tends to decrease with increasing elevation fig 8e vulnerability of grasslands to temperature tends to increase between 2400 and 3700 m above sea level grasslands at higher elevations are generally more sensitive and vulnerable to temperature changes because plants at higher elevations are exposed to colder and wetter climates than those at lower elevations which are relatively warm and dry du et al 2019 although precipitation has increased significantly in northwest china since 1980 and the climate has begun to shift towards a warmer and wetter climate shi et al 2007 there has also been significant warming in the mountains with rates of warming generally higher than the global average gobiet et al 2014 the increase in evapotranspiration and drought frequency caused by higher temperatures may offset the effect of increased mean precipitation on vegetation yang et al 2018 xu et al 2020 found that the reversal of npp in shrubby meadows and alpine deserts in the qilian mountains from 2000 to 2018 was associated with drought caused by insufficient precipitation in this study 57 of the grasslands in the qilian mountains region were found to be more vulnerable to precipitation than temperature this shows that precipitation is still an important factor causing vegetation changes in the qilian mountains furthermore simultaneous extreme events of heat and drought are more frequent than single climatic events de boeck et al 2018 and the combination of heat and drought usually exceeds the sum of their respective impacts de boeck and verbeeck 2011 warming and drying make grassland ecosystems more sensitive and vulnerable wang et al 2016 with the rate of warming in mountainous regions expected to be two to three times faster in the 21st century than in the 20th century nogués bravo et al 2007 mountain ecosystems remain the areas most affected by future climate change and will continue to require significant attention in the future 4 4 suitable strategy in the context of global climate change extreme weather events are frequent and disaster risks are increasing in arid and semi arid regions of northwest china jiang et al 2012 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and identification of ecosystem vulnerability are fundamental to addressing global climate change and preventing extreme weather events adger 2006 watson et al 2013 which are essential for sustainable ecosystem development belote et al 2017 in this study the three properties of grassland ecosystem vulnerability exposure sensitivity and resilience in the qilian mountains were spatially overlaid by rgb fig 9 a it is found that the southwestern part of the qilian mountains is mainly controlled by the magnitude of resilience the northwestern and southeastern parts are influenced by both sensitivity and resilience the flatter topography in the central area is mainly influenced by exposure in addition most of the central area is influenced by both sensitivity and exposure to further identify areas of high ecological vulnerability all the pixel values of the three indices were divided into high and low values using the median as the cut off point and then they were combined fig 9b in an attempt to propose corresponding adaptation strategies for grasslands of different vulnerability levels in the qilian mountains first areas with high exposure need to focus on identifying and monitoring the current dynamics of climate change areas with high sensitivity need to protect grassland resources appropriately and areas with low resilience need to improve the ability of grassland vegetation to recover after disturbance li et al 2018a high exposure high sensitivity and low resilience are positive contributors to vulnerability therefore the high exposure high sensitivity low resilience combination is a priority for future conservation and management as these grasslands will be more severely affected by climate change and are vulnerable to deviations from equilibrium kröel dulay et al 2015 li et al 2018a in the qilian mountains this part of the grassland is mainly alpine meadow and alpine steppe distributed in the central region and around lakes and certain measures should be taken to protect grassland vegetation while focusing on monitoring climate extremes the establishment of ecological corridors for example can accelerate species dispersal migration and exchange contributing to ecosystem integrity and to some extent reducing the sensitivity of grassland ecosystems li et al 2018a rana et al 2021 grasslands with low exposure and low sensitivity are mainly found in the western part of the qilian mountains where they are relatively stable and at low risk of climate disturbance grasslands with low exposure and high sensitivity are mainly found in the central part of the qilian mountains where the climatic environment is relatively stable and should focus on anthropogenic pressures such as adopting grazing retreat schemes mu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 to reduce the sensitivity of the grasslands in addition for areas with high exposure low sensitivity low resilience and low exposure high sensitivity low resilience fig 9b the focus should be on increasing the resilience of grasslands natural restoration is a slow process and can be combined with artificial restoration starting with the establishment of artificial grasslands followed by a gradual succession to natural vegetation pan et al 2021 5 conclusion based on modis datasets and meteorological data this study quantitatively evaluated the vulnerability of the grassland ecosystem in the qilian mountains to short term climate change by combining three indices of exposure sensitivity and resilience and explored the relationship between grassland vulnerability and wue the main findings are as follows 1 the spatial distribution patterns of grassland vulnerability in the qilian mountains from 2000 2018 are largely similar to that of exposure sensitivity is positively correlated with exposure and negatively correlated with resilience in terms of different grassland types alpine meadow and alpine steppe have higher vulnerability while temperate typical steppe and temperate desert steppe have lower vulnerability which mainly depends on the degree of exposure of grasslands to climatic disturbances climate elevation and slope factors combine to influence the spatial distribution patterns of grassland vulnerability grasslands with higher vulnerability are mainly found in flatter areas at mid altitude 3200 4000 m as grassland exposure and vulnerability increase the mean annual wue tends to decrease 2 the vulnerability of grassland vegetation to different climatic factors shows significant spatial differences and varies regularly with grassland types and elevation gradients in terms of spatial distribution grasslands in the northern qilian mountains are mainly affected by temperature while those in the west and south are mainly affected by precipitation in terms of different grassland types and elevation gradients alpine meadow and alpine steppe are more vulnerable to temperature while temperate desert grasslands are more vulnerable to precipitation the vulnerability of grasslands to temperature tends to increase and then decrease with elevation while the vulnerability to precipitation tends to decrease with elevation due to the warm and dry conditions at lower elevations and the relatively cold and wet conditions at higher elevations 3 the alpine meadow and alpine steppe in the central qilian mountains show high exposure and sensitivity and these grasslands should be a priority for future protection and management while monitoring extreme climate change in the region in real time conservation measures such as grazing retreat and construction of ecological corridors can be taken to help grasp the exposure of the ecosystem and reduce its sensitivity for grasslands with low resilience a

3038,with climate warming and frequent extreme weather events the structure and function of grassland ecosystems have been significantly altered the qilian mountains are a wet island serving as an important ecological barrier in china and central asia it is highly sensitive and prone to climate change yet the vulnerability of grasslands to climate variability in this region remains unclear in this study based a ndvi dataset and meteorological data we evaluated the relative vulnerability of grassland ecosystems to short term climate variability by combining three indices exposure sensitivity and resilience and explored its relationship with water use efficiency wue the results show that the spatial distribution patterns of grassland vulnerability in the qilian mountains from 2000 to 2018 were largely determined by exposure and sensitivity is positively correlated with exposure and negatively correlated with resilience the vulnerability of alpine meadow and alpine steppe is higher than that of temperate typical steppe and temperate desert steppe climate and topography gradients together affect the degree of grassland vulnerability grasslands with higher vulnerability are mainly found at medium elevation 3200 4000 m area where the topography is flat the northern grasslands are primarily influenced by temperature while the western and southern parts are mainly affected by precipitation alpine meadow and alpine steppe are more vulnerable to temperature and temperate desert steppe is more vulnerable to changes in precipitation the higher the vulnerability the lower the wue of the grasslands this study provides a reference for assessing the impact of climate change on grassland ecosystems and developing grassland vegetation management strategies keywords climate change grassland ecosystems vulnerability qilian mountains data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction grasslands cover about 25 of the total global land area and are the main type of terrestrial ecosystems hui and jackson 2006 playing an essential role in climate regulation soil and water conservation windbreak and sand fixation and biodiversity conservation raiesi and riahi 2014 liu et al 2019 meanwhile as an important carbon sink grasslands are closely linked to the material and energy cycles of terrestrial ecosystems scurlock and hall 1998 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2020 there is increasing evidence that the composition structure and function of grassland ecosystems are substantially affected by global climate change craine et al 2013 hoover et al 2014 de boeck et al 2018 especially in alpine regions increasing climate variability and extreme events will generate higher ecological risks to grasslands zhang et al 2018 li et al 2019b wu et al 2021 therefore in order to mitigate the ecological economic and social consequences of future climate change we must understand and quantify the vulnerability of grassland ecosystems to short term climate variability the vulnerability of ecosystems has become a hot research topic in the field of climate change in recent years ipcc 2021 zarei et al 2021 currently studies on ecosystem vulnerability have been conducted at regional continental and global scales loarie et al 2009 pacifici et al 2015 fremout et al 2020 however these studies only consider an exposure to climate change when assessing ecosystem vulnerability dobrowski et al 2013 exposure describes the extent to which a species or ecosystem is likely to experience climate disturbance in the future loarie et al 2009 dobrowski et al 2013 the higher the exposure the more vulnerable the ecosystem to climate change brito morales et al 2020 further research found that ecosystems exposed to similar climate conditions may have different vulnerabilities due to differences in sensitivity and resilience li et al 2018a fremout et al 2020 sensitivity reflects the degree to which a species or ecosystem changes when disturbed de keersmaecker et al 2015 resilience refers to the ability of a species or ecosystem to recover to its initial state after disturbed hoover et al 2014 together higher sensitivity and weaker resilience would create a vulnerable system therefore integrating all three aspects of vulnerability exposure sensitivity and resilience may offer more comprehensive and spatially explicit adaptation strategies to reduce the impacts of climate change on ecosystems a recent study mapped the spatial patterns of terrestrial ecosystem vulnerability at a global scale li et al 2018a however some regions such as the qilian mountains in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau were not fully considered in this global assessment more importantly although li et al 2019b assessed alpine grasslands sensitivity over the qinghai tibet plateau that study neglected the exposure and resilience of grassland ecosystems to climate variability the qilian mountains a representative of typical alpine mountains are an important ecological security barrier and priority area for biodiversity conservation in western china and have important functions and significance in maintaining the ecological balance of the qinghai tibet plateau and safeguarding the recharge of inland river runoff in the hexi corridor he et al 2018 grasslands are the most widespread ecosystem type in the qilian mountains xu et al 2020 and have various ecological functions such as wind and sand control soil and water conservation however due to climate warming and weather extremes the alpine grasslands in this region are degraded and biodiversity is declining yao et al 2016 with consequent changes in regional ecohydrological characteristics kayiranga et al 2021 previous studies have shown that grassland vegetation in the qilian mountains is sensitive and vulnerable to climate change due to its special geographical location xu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 but a more comprehensive and systematic spatial representation of the vulnerability of grassland ecosystems in the region is lacking li et al 2019b therefore there is an urgent need to monitor and map the vulnerability of grassland ecosystems in the qilian mountains to short term climate variability with the aim of providing a scientific basis for prioritizing areas for adaptation measures by organizations managing natural resources in addition the carbon and water cycling processes in grassland ecosystems in the qilian mountains have also been altered by climate change liu et al 2021 as a coupled indicator of the carbon and water cycles in terrestrial ecosystems assessing the dynamics of water use efficiency wue can provide a reference for understanding the interactions between regional carbon and water cycles keenan et al 2013 differences in ecosystem responses to climate change have been found to be attributable to wue baldocchi et al 2004 wolf et al 2013 therefore wue can provide further insights into ecosystem response to climate change and its relation to vulnerability this study aims to understand the spatial patterns of grassland ecosystems vulnerability in the qilian mountains to short term climate variability and to explore its relationship with wue moreover qilian mountains have a complex substratum with large hydrothermal gradients and topography is an important environmental factor in shaping the vegetation pattern elevation in particular causes a clear vertical zonal distribution of vegetation types by altering temperature and precipitation patterns in the vertical direction tao et al 2015 within the same elevation gradient slope is also an important factor affecting the growth and distribution of grassland vegetation qin et al 2016 although elevation dependent change patterns of vegetation greenness and phenology have been analyzed in the high mountains of southwest china qinghai tibet plateau and even at the global scale tao et al 2015 tao et al 2018 gao et al 2019 there are regional differences in the dynamics of vegetation and environmental factors and their relationships due to climate heterogeneity li et al 2018b in view of this this study also explores the variation of grassland ecosystem vulnerability with environmental gradients in summary the main objectives of this study are 1 to quantify the vulnerability of grassland ecosystems to climate change in the qilian mountains over the period 2000 2018 2 to reveal the relationship between grassland ecosystems vulnerability and wue 3 to investigate spatial patterns of climate factors driving grassland dynamics this study can provide a basis for maintaining the stable and orderly development of grassland ecosystems mitigating and adapting to the adverse effects of external stresses on ecosystems and ecosystem restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qilian mountains are located at the northeastern edge of the qinghai tibetan plateau straddling gansu and qinghai provinces fig 1 a it is about 800 km long from east to west at an elevation of 4000 6000 m the terrain is high in the north west and low in the south east and consists of a number of parallel northwest southeast oriented mountains and wide valleys the largest inland lake in china qinghai lake is located in this region the qilian mountains are characterized by complex natural conditions and large differences in water and heat conditions with typical continental plateau climate characteristics the average temperature during the growing season may september in the study area for the period of 2000 2018 is 5 8 and the mean precipitation is 290 9 mm figs s1a s1b grasslands in this region are mainly distributed in the range of 2100 4600 m above sea level alpine meadow alpine steppe temperate typical steppe and temperate desert steppe account for 59 10 27 and 4 of the total grassland area respectively distributed in the range of 2500 4800 m 2300 4600 m 2100 4500 m 2400 4600 m above sea level fig 1b 1c 2 2 data source and pre processing 2 2 1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et the modis ndvi mod13a2 gpp mod17a2h and et mod16a2 dataset products from 2000 to 2018 were obtained from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov the spatial resolution of ndvi dataset is 1 km since atmospheric factors such as cloud cover and aerosols have a large impact on remote sensing images we used savitzky golay approach to reduce noise and smooth the ndvi time series data based on quality control files in this study the ndvi of grasslands in the qilian mountains from may to september of the growing season was selected for analysis and the mean growing season ndvi 0 1 was used as the threshold value to exclude non vegetation cover li et al 2019b based upon the radiation use efficiency concept mod17a2 provides cumulative gpp at 8 day composite period with a 500 m resolution running et al 2015 whereas mod16a2 product provides information about 8 day global et 500 m resolution running et al 2017 2 2 2 meteorological data the meteorological data used included the average monthly temperature and monthly precipitation for 2000 2018 which were obtained from national earth system science data center national science technology infrastructure of china https www geodata cn with a spatial resolution of 1 km the climatic research unit cru time series data are downscaled using the high spatial resolution reference climatology dataset of worldclim to generate the dataset peng et al 2019 the monthly air temperature at 2 m and precipitation were obtained from worldclim dataset and cru time series data first the 30 original cru time series data and reference climatology data with different spatial resolutions were evaluated by observations second the 30 original cru time series data were spatially downscaled to four spatial resolutions 10 5 2 5 and 0 5 corresponding to the spatial resolutions of the reference climatology data using the delta downscaling framework the downscaled data were validated through observations in addition the accuracy of the 0 5 downscaled data was compared with that of data downscaled with other spatial resolutions to demonstrate the performance of the downscaling framework finally the climatology data and annual trends in temperature and precipitation were investigated using the 30 original cru 0 5 downscaled it was also validated with data from 496 independent meteorological observation points and the validation results were credible peng et al 2019 2 2 3 auxiliary data digital elevation model dem was obtained from the resource environment science and data center https www resdc cn default aspx with a spatial resolution of 1 km grassland types data were obtained from the china ecosystem assessment and ecological security database https www ecosystem csdb cn 2 3 methods 2 3 1 exposure assessment exposure which considers only the extrinsic climate conditions can be estimated using the climate change velocities based on annual mean temperature and total annual precipitation mm loarie et al 2009 the climate velocity considers climate change as a movement of matter and thus allows for the representation of climate change in terms of spatial climate transport which is closely linked to the movement of organisms and energy in the biosphere loarie et al 2009 molinos et al 2016 brito morales et al 2020 in this study climate change velocity of temperature and precipitation was obtained as the ratio of the temporal gradients to the spatial gradients 1 vel tem temp e rature t e m p o r a l g r a d i e n t temp e rature s p a t i a l g r a d i e n t 2 vel pre precipitation t e m p o r a l g r a d i e n t precipitation s p a t i a l g r a d i e n t where veltem kmyr 1 and velpre kmyr 1 represent the climate change velocity of temperature and precipitation respectively the temporal gradients of temperature and precipitation for 2000 2018 were calculated using a least squares linear regression for each grid in calculating the spatial gradient the average of the temperature and precipitation from 2000 to 2018 is first calculated and on this basis the spatial gradients of the 19 year average were calculated using average maximum technique burrough and mcdonell 1998 this method calculates the spatial gradients of intermediate grids by opening a 3 3 grid window on the meteorological data in order to adjust for the variation in the actual distance represented by the edge lengths of the image elements in the east west direction at different latitudes a factor of 111 325 km per degree was used loarie et al 2009 the conversion was accomplished using the following equation 3 c o s π 180 y 111 235 where y is the latitude of the pixel in degrees once the climate change velocities in temperature veltem and precipitation velpre have been calculated they were rescaled between 0 and 1 using the maximum and minimum values and are used to calculate the exposure index we referred to the equation proposed by li et al 2018a to weight the exposure index using the spatial coefficients of temperature and precipitation this weighs all climate variables and allows for a better assessment of exposure than previous methods dobrowski et al 2013 ordonez et al 2014 equation is as follows 4 exp α vel tem β vel pre where exp is the exposure index dimensionless α and β are the coefficients for temperature and precipitation from equation 5 2 3 2 sensitivity and resilience assessment some studies have considered sensitivity or resistance as an aspect of resilience walker et al 2004 scheffer et al 2009 serra maluquer et al 2018 however this study adopts the approach of grimm and wissel 1997 which considers sensitivity and resilience as separate properties related theoretical studies suggest that systems with lower resilience i e those with a higher probability of crossing a threshold into another state holling 1973 are more responsive to perturbations and more sensitive to environmental perturbations scheffer et al 2009 sensitivity is an empirically calculated property that reflects the response of vegetation to climate change seddon et al 2016 resilience is a temporal autocorrelation of the vegetation state de keersmaecker et al 2015 a recent empirical method can simultaneously quantify global vegetation sensitivity and resilience under short term climate variability de keersmaecker et al 2015 seddon et al 2016 in this study we tailored the empirical methodology to identify grassland ecosystem sensitivity and resilience to climate variability over the qilian mountains unlike the study by seddon et al 2016 we initially selected ndvi as a proxy for vegetation productivity instead of the monthly evi because ndvi generally performs better for low density canopies and grasslands ji and peters 2007 furthermore for two major climatic variables we employed temperature and precipitation from downscaled data peng et al 2019 instead of those solely derived from modis seddon et al 2016 li et al 2018a first the grassland vegetative response to short term climate variability was evaluated using an autoregressive model ar1 with the ndvi anomaly as the dependent variable and the temperature precipitation and ndvi anomaly data at an earlier time as independent variables a one month lagged ndvi anomaly provides the best explanatory power for the delayed response of vegetation to climate change at the time scale seddon et al 2016 therefore in this study a one month lagged ndvi anomaly was chosen as the third variable to characterize the potential impact of memory effects on vegetation and thus the ability of vegetation to recover after disturbance de keersmaecker et al 2015 li et al 2018a the sensitivity and resilience of vegetative productivity to climate variability 2000 2018 were quantified using the following equation 5 ndvi t α tem t β pre t γ ndvi t 1 where ndvit is the standardized ndvi anomaly series at time t temt is the standardized temperature anomaly series at time t pret is the standardized precipitation anomaly series at time t ndvit 1 is the standardized ndvi anomaly series at time t 1 ε denotes the residual error α β and γ are the model coefficients for the temperature precipitation and ndvit 1 anomalies respectively α β and γ were rescaled between 0 and 1 using the minimum and maximum values to be used for our calculations of sensitivity and resilience to ensure comparability between coefficients all of the time series were detrended and standardized in equation 5 when performing regression analysis the standardized anomaly series of precipitation and temperature data were first transformed using z score normalization to remove any impact of co linearity between the two climate variables principal components regression pcr was used to identify the relative importance of each variable driving monthly variations of ndvi in each pixel seddon et al 2016 and the principal component with a significant relationship to climate p 0 1 was selected for regression analysis γ represents the weight coefficient of ndvit 1 reflecting the similarity of grassland vegetation status at two adjacent moments a larger γ indicates that the ndvi at moment t is closer to the ndvi at moment t 1 indicating that the grassland vegetation recovers more slowly after external disturbances verbesselt et al 2016 thus the resilience can be expressed as li et al 2018a 6 res 1 γ where res is the resilience index dimensionless γ is the coefficient for ndvi t 1 anomalies second to estimate the variations of both the climate variables and ndvi on these time series we used the residuals of a quadratic linear model fitted to the mean variance relationship of both the ndvi and climate variables for each pixel we rescaled the residuals 0 100 for each variable to unify calculation sensitivity metrics are the ratios between ndvi variability and each of the climate variables each ratio was weighted according to the importance of the climate variable to ndvi variability by multiplying it by the value of the regression coefficient climate weights α and β the sensitivity index was calculated by summing sensitivity scores for each variable 7 sen α tem sen β pre sen where sen is the sensitivity index dimensionless temsen and presen are the sensitivity of grassland ecosystems to temperature and precipitation respectively α and β are coefficients for temperature and precipitation from equation 5 respectively finally exp sen res and vul were rescaled 0 to 100 using the minimum and maximum values of individual variables the exp sen res and vul have no units and therefore provides relative information the detailed algorithm for calculating sen and the r script can be found in seddon et al 2016 2 3 3 vulnerability assessment the vulnerability of grassland ecosystems to climate change was characterized within a widely used framework of exposure sensitivity and resilience the following equation was used to incorporate exposure sensitivity and resilience into an overall vulnerability index li et al 2018a 8 vul exp s e n 1 r e s where vul is the vulnerability index exp is the exposure index sen is the sensitivity index res is the resilience index this equation assumes that vulnerability varies linearly with exposure and sensitivity because the immediate response of an ecosystem to climate change stressors is determined by these two components ippolito et al 2010 2 3 4 water use efficiency wue ecosystem water use efficiency wue is an important parameter of carbon water coupling which connects the carbon cycle and water cycle keenan et al 2013 nie et al 2021 wue is general defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et ponton et al 2006 gpp is the sum of carbon gained by ecosystems by photosynthesis and the et represents the sum of water loss from soil evaporation and plant transpiration moore et al 2008 the wue of grassland ecosystems can be computed as follows 9 w u e g p p e t where wue is the water use efficiency gcm 2 mm 1 gpp is the annual carbon assimilation gcm 2 et is the annual water loss mm 2 3 5 correlation analysis to better understand the relationship between four indices of exposure sensitivity resilience and vulnerability the correlation coefficient between the two was calculated using spearman correlation coefficient spearman rank correlation is often used as a non parametric alternative to linear regression and correlation because it applies the rank rather than making assumptions about the distribution of the two variables pastén zapata et al 2020 it works by calculating the pearson s correlation of the rank values of the data of interest the spearman correlation coefficient is therefore a statistical measure of the strength of the monotonic relationship between the paired data 3 results 3 1 spatial patterns of grassland ecosystems vulnerability grassland ecosystems in the qilian mountains showed significant spatial variation in exposure sensitivity resilience and vulnerability between 2000 and 2018 fig 2 the spatial distribution patterns of grassland vulnerability were very similar to that of exposure fig 2a 2d with a significant positive correlation between the two spearman s ρ 0 931 q 0 001 the high values of exposure and vulnerability were concentrated in parts of the central qilian mountains around lakes and rivers except for some areas mainly in the west and east where exposure was low and vulnerability was at an intermediate level the high values of grassland sensitivity were scattered throughout the qilian mountains with the highest proportion of high sensitivity values in the central part of the region fig 2b furthermore grasslands in the western part of the qilian mountains and the northern part of qinghai lake showed low resilience while grasslands in the central part showed high resilience fig 2c sensitivity was significantly and positively correlated with exposure spearman s ρ 0 313 q 0 001 and was negatively correlated with resilience spearman s ρ 0 217 q 0 001 the exposure sensitivity resilience and vulnerability of the different grassland types in the qilian mountains showed significant differences fig 3 the four grassland types showed similar patterns of variation in exposure and vulnerability fig 3a 3d with alpine steppe 14 395 8 903 and alpine meadow 14 155 7 873 showing higher vulnerability followed by temperate desert steppe 12 459 6 088 and temperate typical steppe had the lowest 11 612 6 773 the sensitivity was higher in alpine meadow 35 332 12 130 and alpine steppe 35 021 12 330 and lowest in temperate desert steppe 31 509 10 824 fig 3b in terms of resilience index variation both alpine meadow and alpine steppe alm 80 526 9 256 als 78 098 10 473 showed higher resilience than temperate typical steppe 76 387 11 081 and temperate desert steppe 73 607 10 733 fig 3c it is worth noting that temperate typical steppe was more sensitive but its lower exposure and higher resilience made it the least vulnerable of the four grassland types alpine meadow was slightly more sensitive than alpine steppe but its lower exposure and higher resilience made it less vulnerable than alpine steppe in summary both alpine meadow and alpine steppe were more sensitive and vulnerable than the other two grassland types 3 2 changes in grassland ecosystems vulnerability under different environmental gradients 3 2 1 climate gradients during the period 2000 2018 61 of the qilian mountains showed a warming trend and 39 a cooling trend fig s1c and precipitation increased in almost all areas fig s1d grassland exposure sensitivity resilience and vulnerability varied regularly along the climatic gradients fig 4 exposure and vulnerability tended to increase with increasing rates of temperature change between 0 04 0 025 c yr 1 fig 4a 4d and both tended to decrease when the rate of temperature change exceeded 0 025 c yr 1 sensitivity and resilience showed a fluctuating increasing trend with increasing rate of temperature change fig 4b 4c in terms of precipitation gradients exposure sensitivity resilience and vulnerability showed fluctuating increasing trends with increasing rates of precipitation change fig 4e 4f 4g 4h exposure varied most significantly with temperature and precipitation gradients and sensitivity varied least figure s2 showed the variation of the four indices under typical climate gradients temperature precipitation exposure and vulnerability showed the same characteristics with temperature precipitation gradients figs s2a s2d in the high temperature high precipitation case exposure and vulnerability were higher while sensitivity and resilience were higher figs s2b s2c in the high temperature low precipitation case exposure and vulnerability were higher while sensitivity and resilience were lower 3 2 2 topography gradients in order to investigate the variation of grassland vulnerability along elevation gradients the mean values of exposure sensitivity resilience and vulnerability were calculated at 50 m elevation intervals fig 5 a 5b 5c 5d the change in the number of pixels at each elevation interval showed that the number of pixels was mainly concentrated around 4000 m fig s3c overall the exposure and vulnerability of grassland tended to increase and then decrease along elevation gradients fig 5a 5d exposure and vulnerability showed a fluctuating increase between 2300 and 4000 m above sea level and after 4000 m both tended to decrease the high values of exposure and vulnerability were concentrated in the range 3200 4000 m above sea level indicating the highest vulnerability of grasslands at mid elevation over the last 19 years sensitivity tended to increase and then decrease with altitude fig 5b with high values concentrate at low and middle elevations indicating that grasslands at low and middle elevations were the most sensitive to climate change in contrast the resilience showed a fluctuating increase between 2600 and 4600 m and after 4600 m the resilience tended to decrease with increasing elevation fig 5c significant differences were found in exposure sensitivity resilience and vulnerability of grasslands at different gradients of slope fig 5e 5f 5g 5h spatially high values of vulnerability were concentrated in areas of lesser slope fig 2d s1e there was a significant quadratic relationship between exposure vulnerability and slope gradients with r2 reaching above 0 8 fig 5e 5h overall exposure and vulnerability tended to decrease with increasing slope suggesting that the flatter the area the higher the exposure and vulnerability with both decreasing fastest between 0 20 and levelling off after slopes 20 sensitivity tended to decrease along the slope gradients fig 5f while resilience tended to increase fig 5g suggesting that grassland resilience was relatively low in flat areas 3 3 relationship between grassland ecosystem vulnerability and wue in the qilian mountains the mean annual wue for 2000 2018 was 1 149 0 777 gcm 2 mm 1 the wue pattern of grassland ecosystems had a significantly larger spatial variability with an overall trend of low in the northwest and high in the southeast fig 6 a for a more specific analysis of the spatial patterns of wue the slope and z value for each pixel were evaluated by the theil sen median and mann kendall methods the mann kendall test results showed that wue in 0 12 of the area increased significantly p 0 05 and wue in 36 68 of the area decreased significantly fig 6b as grassland exposure and vulnerability increased the mean annual wue tended to decrease fig 6c 6f wue was positively correlated with sensitivity and negatively correlated with resilience fig 6d 6e the faster the rate of increase or decrease in wue the low the exposure resilience and vulnerability fig 6g 6i 6j and the lower the sensitivity fig 6h 3 4 dominant climate factors of grassland ecosystems vulnerability according to the vulnerability formula the greater the sensitivity normalization factor climate weights the greater the contribution of the climate factor to vulnerability the spatial distributions of dominant climate controls showed that the vulnerability to changes in precipitation was higher than that to temperature in about 57 of the total area mainly in the western and southern parts of the qilian mountains fig 7 c the northern grasslands were primarily influenced by temperature while the western and southern parts were mainly affected by precipitation fig 7a 7b in terms of the four grassland types alpine meadow and alpine steppe were more vulnerable to temperature change and temperate desert steppe were the least vulnerable fig 8 a vulnerability to precipitation was highest in temperate desert steppe followed by temperate typical steppe and lowest in alpine meadow fig 8b the main climatic control factor for all four grassland types was precipitation fig 8c in contrast temperate typical grasslands and temperate desert grasslands were more significantly controlled by precipitation 61 and 74 respectively vulnerability of grasslands to temperature tended to increase and then decrease with elevation fig 8d grasslands vulnerability to temperature increased with elevation from 2400 to 3700 m above sea level after 3700 m it tended to decrease the vulnerability of grasslands to precipitation fluctuated downwards with elevation with higher vulnerability to precipitation at lower elevations fig 8e in summary the dominant role of precipitation tended to decrease increase decrease with elevation but the opposite was true for temperature fig 8f 4 discussion 4 1 spatial heterogeneity of grassland ecosystems vulnerability the spatial distribution patterns of grassland ecosystems vulnerability in the qilian mountains are very similar to that of exposure fig 2a 2d suggesting that the vulnerability of grassland vegetation depends mainly on its exposure to external disturbances and similar patterns have been found in regional and global scale studies beaugrand et al 2015 li et al 2018a however there are regional differences in the spatial distribution of exposure and vulnerability with lower exposure and higher vulnerability in the southwest southeast and parts of the central part of the study area mainly due to the higher sensitivity and lower resilience of these areas fig 2b 2c thus the impact of climate change on grassland ecosystems also depends on their sensitivity and resilience verbesselt et al 2016 li et al 2018a grassland exposure is positively correlated with sensitivity spearman s ρ 0 313 q 0 001 suggesting that more exposed grasslands exhibit higher sensitivity mainly in the central qilian mountains fig 2a 2b this is mainly related to the state of succession of ecosystems where climatically disturbed ecosystems are often in an unbalanced or unstable state and those that recover from premature disturbance are often more sensitive than stable ecosystems kröel dulay et al 2015 in other words more exposed grasslands are at a stage where they have recovered or are recovering due to early disturbances from climate change and are generally more sensitive than surrounding ecosystems that are less exposed or more stable in other words more exposed grasslands are at a stage where they have recovered or are recovering due to early disturbances from climate change and are generally more sensitive than surrounding ecosystems that are less exposed or more stable furthermore sensitivity is negatively correlated with resilience spearman s ρ 0 217 q 0 001 with more sensitive grasslands being less resilient grassland resilience is lower in the western part of the study area and in the northern part of qinghai lake fig 2c this is mainly due to the higher exposure and sensitivity of grassland in this area thus the magnitude of grassland resilience depends largely on the degree of ecosystem disturbance oliveras and malhi 2016 laris et al 2016 and once a certain threshold of disturbance is reached the ecosystem may be close to collapse banks leite et al 2014 the vulnerability of different grassland types in the qilian mountains varies considerably fig 3d alpine meadow and alpine steppe are the two typical alpine vegetation types in the region and both are more vulnerable overall than temperate typical steppe and temperate desert steppe a similar phenomenon was found in a study by gao et al 2018 on chinese grasslands this is mainly due to the fact that alpine grassland vegetations are much more disturbed by climate extremes than temperate typical steppe and temperate desert steppe resulting in higher exposure and sensitivity liu et al 2018 and thus higher vulnerability notably the resilience of both alpine grasslands is also higher fig 3c it was found that ecosystems recovered faster with more disturbance mainly due to the dominances of the dominant vegetation species over the ecosystem allowing it to tolerate disturbance and respond quickly to them willis et al 2018 it follows that the dominance of a few species is characteristic of most ecosystems hoover et al 2014 and understanding the characteristics of these species and their responses to climate extremes will be key to predicting future ecosystem dynamics and function he et al 2015 however temperate typical steppe and temperate desert steppe are less resilient mainly due to low soil utilization gessler et al 2017 and phenological variability severely limits potential growth later in the growing season lian et al 2020 these types of grasslands are difficult to restore to their initial state once they have been subjected to major external climatic disturbances yao et al 2016 many studies have shown that the spatial distributions of vegetation are not entirely determined by climatic factors but also by other environmental factors such as latitude elevation soil and water table iverson and prasad 1998 kløve et al 2014 li et al 2018b xu et al 2020 in arid mountainous areas the spatial heterogeneity of different environmental factors makes the response of grassland vegetation change to climate change more complex he et al 2015 yang et al 2018 climate elevation and slope all have an impact on the vulnerability of grassland ecosystems fig 4d 4h 5d 5h overall the changing trends in exposure and vulnerability are generally consistent across climate gradients the relationship between vulnerability and climate gradient shows that vulnerability increases with increasing precipitation trend and tends to increase and then decrease with increasing temperature trend fig 4d 4h this suggests that temperature change can form a more favorable hydrothermal combination with increased rainfall at a certain time making grasslands less vulnerable to climate change and favoring their growth gao et al 2018 elevation and slope are important environmental factors on the growth of grassland vegetation qin et al 2016 tao et al 2018 grasslands with higher vulnerability are mainly found in the mid elevation 3200 4000 m areas of the qilian mountains with less topographic relief fig 5d 5h these areas are relatively flat figs s1e s4c have high grassland exposure fig 5a and have moderate grass resilience and sensitivity at this elevation fig 5b 5c the more sensitive grasslands are mainly found at low and medium elevations with an increasing trend in resilience between 2500 and 4600 m with increasing elevation however in the qinghai tibet plateau region the sensitivity of alpine grasslands was found to increase along an elevation gradient li et al 2019b the reason for this is that non climatic factors such as human activity were not considered in this study when assessing sensitivity and resilience and in fact human activity stress is weakly correlated with sensitivity and resilience li et al 2018a with higher human activity stress being associated with higher sensitivity and lower resilience in the context of global warming the impact of non climatic factors on grassland vegetation cannot be ignored wang et al 2016 liu et al 2019 the qilian mountains are a very important pastoral area where population growth and overgrazing have led to a reduction in vegetation cover and biodiversity at lower elevations increased soil erosion and desertification and damage to the integrity of grassland ecosystems making them more sensitive and less resilient to climate change vitousek et al 1997 wang et al 2016 li et al 2018a this may be the main reason for the higher sensitivity of grasslands at middle and low elevations 4 2 relationship between grassland ecosystem vulnerability and wue the low values of grassland wue are mainly distributed in the northwest of qilian mountains mainly due to the low productivity of grassland in this area and high evapotranspiration yang et al 2021 long term trend analysis showed that grassland wue decreased in the north and southeast might be due to the rate of et increase exceeding that of gpp increase fig 6b liu et al 2021 it can be further explained as a result of the increase in temperature fig s1c when the temperature increases the evapotranspiration of soil moisture and vegetation canopy is higher than gpp resulting in a decrease in grassland wue yu et al 2008 peñuelas et al 2011 in contrast the rate of gpp rise exceeded that of et rise resulted in a wue increase in parts of the western qilian mountains in addition this study finds that the high vulnerability of grassland ecosystems leads to a decrease in its wue indicating vulnerability to climate change in grassland vegetation affects the level of wue in the qilian mountains higher vulnerability of grassland ecosystems under the combined effects of high temperature and high precipitation fig s2d this resulted in lower wue yu et al 2008 li et al 2019a 4 3 the impact of climate factors on grassland ecosystems vulnerability arid mountain ecosystems are exceptionally vulnerable to changes in temperature and precipitation he et al 2015 du et al 2019 and precipitation is considered to be the main driver of vegetation growth changes in these ecosystems xu et al 2020 this study explored the relationship between grassland ecosystems and climate factors based on the pixel scale and found significant spatial heterogeneity in the vulnerability of grasslands to changes in temperature and precipitation fig 7 in the northern qilian mountains where temperatures are cooler but warming rates are higher figs s1a s1c excessive warming accelerates evapotranspiration and increases drought trends thereby inhibiting vegetation activity gao et al 2018 this makes grasslands much more vulnerable to temperature than precipitation fig 7a whereas in the west precipitation is low and tends to decrease over the years figs s1b s1d making grasslands more vulnerable to changes in precipitation fig 7b in the south where precipitation is high but warming is relatively limited figs s1a s1b ecosystem sensitivity to precipitation change elicits a strong response within the system gao et al 2018 contributing more to the vulnerability of southern grasslands in terms of elevational gradients in temperature and precipitation vulnerability grasslands at low elevations with low precipitation and high temperature figs s4a s4b and under dry conditions tend to be more vulnerable to changes in precipitation you et al 2018 and as elevation increases precipitation increases while temperature decreases which leads to reduced evapotranspiration and thus increased plant availability guo et al 2013 and vulnerability to precipitation is reduced thus the vulnerability of grasslands to precipitation changes tends to decrease with increasing elevation fig 8e vulnerability of grasslands to temperature tends to increase between 2400 and 3700 m above sea level grasslands at higher elevations are generally more sensitive and vulnerable to temperature changes because plants at higher elevations are exposed to colder and wetter climates than those at lower elevations which are relatively warm and dry du et al 2019 although precipitation has increased significantly in northwest china since 1980 and the climate has begun to shift towards a warmer and wetter climate shi et al 2007 there has also been significant warming in the mountains with rates of warming generally higher than the global average gobiet et al 2014 the increase in evapotranspiration and drought frequency caused by higher temperatures may offset the effect of increased mean precipitation on vegetation yang et al 2018 xu et al 2020 found that the reversal of npp in shrubby meadows and alpine deserts in the qilian mountains from 2000 to 2018 was associated with drought caused by insufficient precipitation in this study 57 of the grasslands in the qilian mountains region were found to be more vulnerable to precipitation than temperature this shows that precipitation is still an important factor causing vegetation changes in the qilian mountains furthermore simultaneous extreme events of heat and drought are more frequent than single climatic events de boeck et al 2018 and the combination of heat and drought usually exceeds the sum of their respective impacts de boeck and verbeeck 2011 warming and drying make grassland ecosystems more sensitive and vulnerable wang et al 2016 with the rate of warming in mountainous regions expected to be two to three times faster in the 21st century than in the 20th century nogués bravo et al 2007 mountain ecosystems remain the areas most affected by future climate change and will continue to require significant attention in the future 4 4 suitable strategy in the context of global climate change extreme weather events are frequent and disaster risks are increasing in arid and semi arid regions of northwest china jiang et al 2012 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and identification of ecosystem vulnerability are fundamental to addressing global climate change and preventing extreme weather events adger 2006 watson et al 2013 which are essential for sustainable ecosystem development belote et al 2017 in this study the three properties of grassland ecosystem vulnerability exposure sensitivity and resilience in the qilian mountains were spatially overlaid by rgb fig 9 a it is found that the southwestern part of the qilian mountains is mainly controlled by the magnitude of resilience the northwestern and southeastern parts are influenced by both sensitivity and resilience the flatter topography in the central area is mainly influenced by exposure in addition most of the central area is influenced by both sensitivity and exposure to further identify areas of high ecological vulnerability all the pixel values of the three indices were divided into high and low values using the median as the cut off point and then they were combined fig 9b in an attempt to propose corresponding adaptation strategies for grasslands of different vulnerability levels in the qilian mountains first areas with high exposure need to focus on identifying and monitoring the current dynamics of climate change areas with high sensitivity need to protect grassland resources appropriately and areas with low resilience need to improve the ability of grassland vegetation to recover after disturbance li et al 2018a high exposure high sensitivity and low resilience are positive contributors to vulnerability therefore the high exposure high sensitivity low resilience combination is a priority for future conservation and management as these grasslands will be more severely affected by climate change and are vulnerable to deviations from equilibrium kröel dulay et al 2015 li et al 2018a in the qilian mountains this part of the grassland is mainly alpine meadow and alpine steppe distributed in the central region and around lakes and certain measures should be taken to protect grassland vegetation while focusing on monitoring climate extremes the establishment of ecological corridors for example can accelerate species dispersal migration and exchange contributing to ecosystem integrity and to some extent reducing the sensitivity of grassland ecosystems li et al 2018a rana et al 2021 grasslands with low exposure and low sensitivity are mainly found in the western part of the qilian mountains where they are relatively stable and at low risk of climate disturbance grasslands with low exposure and high sensitivity are mainly found in the central part of the qilian mountains where the climatic environment is relatively stable and should focus on anthropogenic pressures such as adopting grazing retreat schemes mu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 to reduce the sensitivity of the grasslands in addition for areas with high exposure low sensitivity low resilience and low exposure high sensitivity low resilience fig 9b the focus should be on increasing the resilience of grasslands natural restoration is a slow process and can be combined with artificial restoration starting with the establishment of artificial grasslands followed by a gradual succession to natural vegetation pan et al 2021 5 conclusion based on modis datasets and meteorological data this study quantitatively evaluated the vulnerability of the grassland ecosystem in the qilian mountains to short term climate change by combining three indices of exposure sensitivity and resilience and explored the relationship between grassland vulnerability and wue the main findings are as follows 1 the spatial distribution patterns of grassland vulnerability in the qilian mountains from 2000 2018 are largely similar to that of exposure sensitivity is positively correlated with exposure and negatively correlated with resilience in terms of different grassland types alpine meadow and alpine steppe have higher vulnerability while temperate typical steppe and temperate desert steppe have lower vulnerability which mainly depends on the degree of exposure of grasslands to climatic disturbances climate elevation and slope factors combine to influence the spatial distribution patterns of grassland vulnerability grasslands with higher vulnerability are mainly found in flatter areas at mid altitude 3200 4000 m as grassland exposure and vulnerability increase the mean annual wue tends to decrease 2 the vulnerability of grassland vegetation to different climatic factors shows significant spatial differences and varies regularly with grassland types and elevation gradients in terms of spatial distribution grasslands in the northern qilian mountains are mainly affected by temperature while those in the west and south are mainly affected by precipitation in terms of different grassland types and elevation gradients alpine meadow and alpine steppe are more vulnerable to temperature while temperate desert grasslands are more vulnerable to precipitation the vulnerability of grasslands to temperature tends to increase and then decrease with elevation while the vulnerability to precipitation tends to decrease with elevation due to the warm and dry conditions at lower elevations and the relatively cold and wet conditions at higher elevations 3 the alpine meadow and alpine steppe in the central qilian mountains show high exposure and sensitivity and these grasslands should be a priority for future protection and management while monitoring extreme climate change in the region in real time conservation measures such as grazing retreat and construction of ecological corridors can be taken to help grasp the exposure of the ecosystem and reduce its sensitivity for grasslands with low resilience a combination of natural and artificial restoration measures can be adopted credit authorship contribution statement qinqin du conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original

3039,reliable estimates of the dynamic volume of karst aquifers i e the drainable volume of groundwater are important in the context of sustainable management and environmental protection of the karst water resources extrapolation of the observed recession of spring hydrographs is commonly used as a basis for the estimation of the dynamic volume however our understanding concerning the reliability of this approach is still limited therefore the adequacy of this approach is investigated using flow models of hypothetical karst aquifers to assess the deviation of the extrapolated from the real recession curve and identify parameters controlling the extrapolated recession coefficient the results show that parameters such as the geometry of the catchment area and point recharge have little effect on the accuracy of the estimated dynamic volume low extension of the highly conductive zone and increase in specific yield or catchment area with depth of the aquifer result in the underestimation of the dynamic volume groundwater abstraction and decrease of specific yield or catchment area with increasing saturated thickness can lead to an overestimation of the dynamic volume these findings clarify the potential underestimation or overestimation in dynamic volume estimates on the basis of the observed recession characteristics keywords dynamic volume recession coefficient extrapolation karst aquifer numerical modelling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the dynamic volume of a karst aquifer is defined as the volume of groundwater drainable by gravity at the spring padilla et al 1994 quantitative information about the dynamic volume of a karst aquifer is required for the development and sustainable management of groundwater resources el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 documented the importance of this information in a region with a complex karst system where groundwater abstraction is uncontrolled similarly hartmann et al 2012 addressed the drastic water shortage of one of the largest fresh water springs in the west bank attributed to an overexploitation of the aquifer i e an inappropriate management of the resource knowledge of the dynamic volume also allows the assessment of residence times relevant for the determination of aquifer vulnerability with respect to contamination einsiedl 2005 the scientific literature provides a number of methods for estimating the dynamic volume such as 1 analysis of residence times by lumped parameter models based on time series of environmental tracers e g maloszewski et al 2002 einsiedl 2005 2 geometric assessment of the water volume based on the saturated rock porosity above the spring outlet level atkinson 1977 pérez and sanz 2011 3 analysis of the karst groundwater flow by numerical methods e g sauter 1992 4 analysis of the spring discharge recession based on functional relationships such as those proposed by maillet 1905 mangin 1975 padilla et al 1994 el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 and mohammadi and shoja 2014 some authors also employed hydrological models for this purpose fleury et al 2007 jukić and denić jukić 2009 željković and kadić 2015 fu et al 2016 the first method requires long term time series of the relative abundance of stable water isotopes that is often not readily available and inapplicable for many practical purposes furthermore the isotope signal at the spring is dampened considerably for large catchments with large storage volumes a sufficiently accurate estimate of the effective porosity in karst environments is the most important factor in the application of the second method obtaining appropriate estimates of effective porosity in karst aquifers unfortunately is highly challenging and typically associated with high uncertainty finding the thickness of the phreatic zone between groundwater level and geodetic spring level is another quantity required and regarding the high heterogeneity of karst aquifers it requires groundwater levels frequently unavailable in karst catchments with thick unsaturated zones likewise the application of numerical flow models requires a wealth of detailed hydrogeological and hydrological data generally not readily available for cases where the above mentioned data environmental tracers hydraulic heads etc are unavailable this leaves the fourth method extrapolating the observed recession and integrating the discharge as the most attractive approach bakalowicz 2005 thus states that there is no other readily applicable method available for evaluating the dynamic volume yet the reliability of the estimates obtained with this method obviously depends on the validity of the extrapolated recession curve the purpose of this paper therefore is to explore for which conditions the extrapolation of the exponential recession function maillet 1905 yields acceptable estimates of the dynamic volume further we want to identify those factors causing either an underestimate or overestimate of the dynamic volume of the aquifer in general various factors and parameters can be assumed to affect the recession coefficient at different times of the discharge recession curve e g at early times the type and distribution of recharge localized or distributed intensity and duration etc and the epikarst hydraulics at intermediate times the hydraulic properties and the spatial extent of the conduit network and at late times the heterogeneity and hydraulic properties of the aquifer matrix as well as the catchment geometry the estimation of the dynamic volume mainly depends on the recession at intermediate and late time following the rainy season or recharge event therefore the focus of this research is placed on the identification of factors and parameters affecting the recession coefficient during intermediate and late times of the discharge recession for this purpose simplified but realistic close to nature prototype karst aquifers are designed and implemented in the conduit flow process cfp mode of the modular finite difference ground water flow model modflow 2005 shoemaker et al 2008 the cfp model option simulates flow in discrete conduits and turbulent groundwater flow conditions as well as the interaction between the conduit network and the permeable aquifer matrix by changing boundary conditions and aquifer parameters a sensitivity study is carried out and the effect of a change in selected parameters and factors on the shape of the recession curve and consequently on the dynamic volume is assessed thus we follow the generally accepted approach of applying simplified karst models to improve the understanding and the analysis of the spring discharge recession as already demonstrated by e g eisenlohr et al 1997 and kovács et al 2005 2 material and methods 2 1 dynamic volume as discussed above the analysis of the spring discharge recession based on functional relationships is a widely used and practical method for calculating the dynamic volume of the karst aquifer dewandel et al 2003 and fiorillo 2014 published comprehensive review papers on this topic the maillet formula an exponential equation widely used for recession curve analysis is an approximate analytical solution for the diffusion equation dewandel et al 2003 here it is used for the estimation of the dynamic volume the actual dynamic volume of the simplified prototype model karst aquifer is calculated based on mass storage in the aquifer using the discretized output of the modflow cfp model more details about how to calculate the estimated and actual dynamic volume are described below 2 1 1 estimates of the dynamic volume the maillet formula describes the recession using an exponential function of time qr qr0 e αt qr in m3 s is the discharge from the phreatic zone qr0 in m3 s is the initial discharge at time zero α in day 1 is the recession coefficient and t is time in days this allows calculating the dynamic volume vdyn in m3 by integration which relates to the total volume of drainable water in storage in the saturated zone above the geodetic level of the spring outlet ford and williams 2007 v dyn 0 q r 0 e αt dt c q r 0 α c is a constant equal to 86 400 for qr0 being expressed in m3 s and α in day 1 the volume of water dynamically stored in the aquifer at the end of the observed recession period remaining dynamic volume is more important for aquifer management during extended drought than the total dynamic volume fig 1 shows estimates of the total dynamic volume and the remaining dynamic volume obtained from the maillet formula as shown in fig 1 the remaining dynamic volume displays some uncertainty because the late recession is not observed due to recharge events thus it is estimated by extrapolation using the recession coefficient from the observed recession period therefore the focus of this research is on calculating estimates of the remaining dynamic volume to do so the maillet formula is fitted to the observed base flow recession of the spring discharge red solid lines in fig 1 together with the recession coefficient of this formula and the spring discharge at the initial time of the extrapolation period the estimate of the remaining dynamic volume was determined 2 1 2 actual dynamic volume the actual dynamic volume remaining at the beginning of the extrapolation period of the hypothetical prototype karst aquifer is calculated based on the storage in this aquifer using the discretized output of the employed groundwater flow model modflow cfp see 2 2 this is achieved by adding up the drainable water volume stored in each of the active cells at the start of the extrapolation period for each cell this volume is obtained by multiplying the specific yield the area of the cell and the saturated thickness obtained from the simulated hydraulic head 2 2 numerical aquifer model the discharge recession depends on the interaction between the highly conductive low storage conduit network system and the less conductive high storage matrix system the groundwater flow model modflow cfp shoemaker et al 2008 representing the complex hydraulic interaction between conduits and matrix has been employed to better understand the influence of the aquifer properties on the discharge recession modflow cfp is a finite difference groundwater flow model developed especially for karst aquifers displaying nonlinear or turbulent flow this code contains three modules each with unique abilities for simulating different aquifer conditions mode 1 is applied to simulate the hydraulic response of a discrete pipe network imbedded in a low permeability carbonate rock matrix mode 2 considers a preferential flow layer with the ability of switching between laminar and turbulent conditions mode 3 mixes the preferential flow layer with a pipe network cfp mode 1 has especially been designed to simulate groundwater flow in a conduit network with defined dimensions it requires information about conduit geometry and hydraulic properties cfp mode 2 is effectively applicable to simulate less mature karst aquifers without a well developed network of conduits and pipes or without detailed information about the properties of the conduit system its dependence on just a few parameters such as the critical reynolds numbers and void diameters is one of the most important advantages of this mode thus cfp mode 2 is employed here cfp mode 2 considers non darcian flow conditions in lateral flow but not in vertical direction using modflow cfp mode 2 the effect of non laminar and turbulent flow is considered by reducing the hydraulic conductivity with increasing flow velocity once the critical reynolds number indicating the transition from darcian to non darcian flow is exceeded kuniansky et al 2008 2 2 1 parameter study various parameters and factors affect the shape of the recession curve such as hydraulic conductivity specific yield and aquifer geometry kovács et al 2005 dewandel et al 2003 bonacci 1993 mode of recharge smart and hobbs 1986 and conduit network density eisenlohr et al 1997 changes in recession coefficient on the falling limb of the spring hydrograph can be related to flow regimes with different magnitudes of hydraulic conductivity forkasiewicz and paloc 1967 baedke and krothe 2001 changes in the catchment area or effective porosity with depth of aquifer fiorillo 2011 2014 and the duration of the recharge pulse birk and hergarten 2010 groundwater abstraction in the catchment area and delayed or ongoing recharge from the vadose zone wu et al 2019 eisenlohr et al 1997 perrin 2003 lastennet and mudry 1997 result in an increase and decrease of the recession coefficients respectively below we developed different scenarios to simulate the above cases and examine the influence of the characteristics of each case on the recession coefficient and the dynamic volume 2 2 2 basic model setup and modifications the hypothetical spring catchment includes a fissured limestone matrix drained by a highly conductive zone represented by a single conduit as fig 2 shows this model is discretized into 30 rows and 50 columns the width of the columns and rows is 100 m except where cells are close to the highly conductive zone the length of the highly conductive zone is 4000 m its thickness and width are 2 m and 1 m respectively the catchment is delineated by a no flow neumann type boundary except for the spring location represented by a fixed head boundary condition at 2 m dirichlet type boundary the basic geometry used here is an upscaled and modified version of a modflow cfp setup previously used for other parameter studies birk et al 2006 reimann et al 2011 since unconfined groundwater flow was modeled the horizontal transmissivity is a function of the saturated thickness of the cells throughout the simulation modflow cfp computes the saturated thickness for the individual cells if the saturated thickness becomes zero modflow converts the cell into dry cells no flow recharge 500 mm y infiltrates during a 5 month precipitation period corresponding to precipitation patterns recorded in south central iran naderi and raeisi 2015 the discharge of the large karst springs in iran starts to increase with the beginning of the wet season and starts to decrease at the end of this period mohammadi and shoja 2014 kavousi and raeisi 2015 based on this behavior recharge increases in the model linearly and becomes zero at the end of the precipitation season fig 3 while recharge is spatially uniformly distributed in the basic scenario some modified scenarios consider the effect of localized recharge directly into sinkholes for these scenarios 5 of total recharge is directly injected into the first cell of the highly conductive zone and the remaining 95 are distributed across the low permeability matrix the hydraulic parameters are uniform both within the low permeability matrix and within the highly conductive zone a value of 10 4 ms 1 is defined as hydraulic conductivity of the matrix its specific yield is 0 02 the hydraulic conductivity of the highly conductive zone is 147 ms 1 which corresponds to a 0 2 m diameter pipe computed by the hagen poiseuille formula reimann et al 2011 upper and lower limits of the critical reynolds number for the threshold between darcian and non darcian flow conditions are 50 and 100 respectively table 1 depicts how the basic scenario s1 is modified in the model scenarios considered here the simulation time period is 16 years for all scenarios in table 1 during this time period 12 years have recharge periods and in the remaining 4 years recharge is defined as zero to simulate a long term recession fig 3 at first all scenarios have been run in steady state mode with constant recharge depth then transient recharge was applied starting with the steady state head distribution as initial condition 3 model results the simulated discharge during the recession period is shown for three example scenarios in fig 4 a b and c supplement 1 provides the corresponding figures for the full set of scenarios fig 4a shows the discharge in a semi logarithmic plot for the basic scenario s1 this scenario resulted in an almost straight line except for negligible differences in the beginning of the graph indicating exponential decrease in discharge during the recession period the same recession behavior is apparent in the scenarios assuming point recharge s3 point recharge at short distance from the spring s4 and different length and width ratios of the aquifer 1 and 4 s17 and s18 see supplement 1 fig 4b displays the discharge recession for the scenario with reduced spatial extent of the highly conductive zone s5 the concave shape of the discharge recession indicates the discharge decreases slower than exponential decay with time this is also found for the scenarios with higher critical reynold number s6 increase and decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth of aquifer s8 s9 increase in hydraulic conductivity in length of aquifer s10 increase in specific yield with depth of aquifer s12 increase in catchment area with depth of aquifer s14 and increase in hydraulic conductivity of the highly conductive zone s16 see supplement 1 the scenarios with ongoing recharge s2 displays a convex shape implying that discharge decreases faster than exponential decay with time fig 4c this is obtained from scenarios with exploitation well s7 decrease in hydraulic conductivity in downgradient direction of the aquifer s11 decrease in specific yield with decreasing depth of the aquifer s13 and decrease in catchment area with decreasing depth of the aquifer s15 see supplement 1 based on the recession coefficient of the observation period and the discharge at the initial time of extrapolation period the estimated remaining dynamic volume was calculated table 2 table 2 also provides the exponential fit equation r2 and actual remaining volume fig 5 a compares the estimated and the actual remaining dynamic volumes fig 5b shows the relative error of the estimated remaining dynamic volumes comparing scenarios it becomes obvious that the actual dynamic volume increases with an increase in specific yield with increasing distance between the point of recharge and the spring with increasing catchment area with ongoing recharge and with a decrease in hydraulic conductivity of the matrix and conduit with an increase in spatial extent of the highly conductive zone with an increase in critical reynolds numbers and with increasing percentage of point recharge for these conditions the karst aquifer can sustain flow for a long time period and is therefore much less affected by dry seasons and long term droughts for inverse conditions the dynamic volume of the aquifer decreases and thus the aquifer is more subject to the adverse effects of droughts fiorillo et al 2012 following fiorillo et al 2012 karst springs that have large dynamic volume can be termed drought resistant whereas those with a small volume are drought vulnerable overestimation or underestimation of the dynamic volume thus may result in misjudgment of the resistance or vulnerability of a karst spring to drought 4 discussion table 3 provides information on the characteristics of some karst springs in the zagros mountains of iran as shown in this table these springs have different recession coefficients and dynamic volumes estimated based on recession analysis in order to improve our understanding of the origin of such differences and to assess potential errors in the estimation of the dynamic volumes this section discusses the results of the scenario investigations and compares them with selected real world examples as mentioned above different scenarios show three groups of parameters a parameters with no or little contribution to the error in the estimation of dynamic volume b parameters likely to contribute to an underestimation and c parameters possibly contributing to an overestimation of the dynamic volume the role of the above parameters is discussed below 4 1 parameters contributing little to the error in the estimation of the dynamic volume the basic scenario as well as scenarios considering point recharge s3 s4 and different geometry of the catchment area l w ratio s17 s18 exhibit only minor deviations between the recession curve extrapolated based on the maillet equation and the observed recession fig 4a and supplement 1 as a result these factors do not notably affect the estimation of the remaining dynamic volume and do not add any error in dynamic volume estimation based on an extrapolation of the observed recession in scenario s3 5 of recharge was allocated as point recharge directly into the highly conductive zone the recession coefficient of the exponential fit to the base flow of s3 0 0033d 1 is slightly higher than that of the basic scenario 0 0032d 1 this is caused by the direct connection of this recharge component to the highly conductive zone explaining the slightly more rapid drainage of the aquifer the actual dynamic volume remaining at the beginning of the extrapolation period thus is smaller than that of the basic scenario yet the modeling results reveal that the recession curve extrapolated from the observed recession is very close to the actual spring discharge through the extrapolation period therefore the estimation of the remaining dynamic volume is found to be reliable for the s4 scenario in which the distance between the point of recharge and the spring decreases the recession coefficient of the base flow exponential fit is slightly increased compared to the basic scenario from 0 0032d 1 to 0 0033d 1 thus the dynamic volume in s4 is larger than that of the basic scenario but again the estimated remaining dynamic volume is reliable likewise for scenarios s17 and s18 investigating the effect of basin geometry the discharge recession during the extrapolation period is matched by the maillet equation that was fitted to the observed recession period thus for each of these scenarios the estimation of the remaining dynamic volume is reliable although the values of the actual dynamic volumes differ from that of the basic scenario see table 1 a larger extent in flow direction of the aquifer s18 where length width 4 leads to a lower recession coefficient and thus larger remaining dynamic volume compared to non expanded settings s17 with length width ratio 1 the density length area of the highly conductive zone in the longer aquifer is larger compared to that in non expanded one nevertheless the recession coefficient of the non expanded aquifer is higher and thus the remaining dynamic volume lower for equal densities of the highly conductive zone the difference in recession coefficient and remaining dynamic volume is even more increased in the gilan aquifer located in the zagros region west iran employed as an example of a limestone karst aquifer in which despite conduit flow karimi et al 2003 the recession coefficient of the base flow condition is low 0 0012d 1 and the large ca 37 km longitudinal extent provides large volumes of water during the base flow period 72 106 m3 in contrast the catchment area of the pireghar karst spring in the same region zagros region and with similar lithological composition asmari formation but shorter longitudinal extent 21 km exhibits a higher recession coefficient 0 005 d 1 and lower dynamic volume 21 106 m3 for base flow conditions mohammadi and shoja 2014 other characteristics of these two spring catchments are similar for instance the catchment areas of the gilan aquifer and pireghar karst spring are 110 km2 and 102 km2 and average annual precipitation is 625 mm and 606 mm respectively suggesting recharge is similar based on the model results it is thus suggested that the different geometry in the given examples is a likely reason for the differences in the observed recession coefficients and the values of the actual dynamic volumes but that the geometry does not affect the reliability of the dynamic volume estimates 4 2 parameters causing underestimation of the dynamic volume during the extrapolation period of some scenarios the modelled recession coefficient decreases faster than the observed discharge recession coefficient fig 4b therefore the modelled remaining dynamic volume is lower than the actual volume in many real karst aquifers the highly conductive zone may not extend throughout the entire aquifer s5 scenario and in most cases these less permeable regions have a considerable extent in areas at remote upgradient distance from the spring outlet as a result the behavior of the springs is flashy and during early times when the drainage of the area close to the spring initially controls discharge groundwater drains rapidly from the karst aquifer however after draining of this aquifer section the low conductive area at greater distance from the spring controls the flow of groundwater during the extrapolation period slow groundwater drainage from the remote area thus causes the observed discharge to decrease slower compared to the one modelled using the maillet equation in scenario s5 the estimated and actual remaining dynamic volumes are 5 2 106 m3 and 9 8 106 m3 respectively a similar effect is obtained when the matrix hydraulic conductivity increases along the aquifer toward the spring scenario s10 shows that in this case the discharge during the extrapolation period decreases slower than the exponential decay that was fitted to the observed recession period supplement 1 therefore the estimated remaining dynamic volume is less than the real volume the matrix hydraulic conductivity in a karst aquifer may also increase or decrease with depth the s9 scenario considers two layers where the upper layer has a higher hydraulic conductivity compared to the lower layer connected to the highly conductive zone initially groundwater is quickly drained from the upper layer and thus the recession of the spring hydrograph is fast as this upper layer falls dry however only the less conductive lower layer provides flow to the spring thus the discharge from the karst aquifer decreases more slowly than before when the discharge was provided by the upper more conductive layer if the drop of the water table to the level of the less conductive layer occurs at the extrapolation stage the consequence would be an underestimation of the remaining dynamic volume an example of this type of behavior is apparent in the gallusquelle karst aquifer in southwest germany sauter 1992 as shown in fig 6 the recession coefficient of the karst spring draining this aquifer is considerably reduced when groundwater level drops below a specific threshold 660 m in b7 and 683 m in b14 observation boreholes based on pumping and injection tests data and also well logs sauter 1992 1995 related this change in recession coefficient to a decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth similar observations such as in s9 scenario are made when the hydraulic conductivity of the deep layer is higher compared to that of the shallow one s8 in some karst aquifers it is possible that the specific yield and catchment area increase with the depth of the aquifer scenarios s12 and s14 consider an increase with depth for the specific yield or the catchment area respectively as shown by the modeling results supplement 1 for both of these scenarios during the extrapolation period spring discharge decreases slower than the exponential decline fitted to the observed recession period with the drop of the groundwater level during the recession period the water volume released per unit head change increases under these conditions therefore the extrapolation based on maillet s equation leads to an underestimation of the remaining dynamic volume in a real karst aquifer in a highly conductive zone turbulent flow conditions can affect the emptying rate of the aquifer and thus the estimation of the remaining dynamic volume of the aquifer for turbulent flow a proportion of the energy and head will be lost by energy dissipation in eddies thus the effective hydraulic conductivity of the conduit for turbulent flow conditions is less than for laminar flow the parameter commonly used to assess when flow turns from laminar into turbulent is the critical reynolds number conduits with low tortuosity and low internal roughness have larger critical reynolds numbers which means that laminar flow prevails in the conduit shoemaker et al 2008 an increase in the critical reynolds number facilitates the drainage through the highly conductive zone and thus the drainage of water from areas remote from the spring during the extrapolation period as a result spring discharge decreases slower during the extrapolation period of this scenario s6 compared to the exponential decline fitted to the observed recession period thus the estimate of the remaining dynamic volume is lower than the actual volume increasing or decreasing the hydraulic conductivity in the highly conductive zone has effects similar to an increase and decrease in the critical reynolds number with increased hydraulic conductivity in the highly conductive zone the emptying rate of the aquifer increases and the dynamic volume decreases and vice versa in scenario s16 with high hydraulic conductivity in the highly conductive zone the emptying rate of the aquifer is high during observed recession times and decreases during the extrapolation period thus the remaining dynamic volume estimate is lower compared to the actual volume a good example for showing the effect of a highly conductive zone on the magnitude of the recession coefficient emptying rate of the aquifer during recession times and dynamic volume is the hammerbach spring system this spring emerges from the lurbach karst aquifer located in the south of austria after a flood event in august 2005 part of the main conduit in this aquifer presumably was plugged with sediments decreasing the effective hydraulic conductivity of the whole system mayaud et al 2016 as a result the discharge behavior of the hammerbach spring changed to a more dampened discharge pattern after this event despite the pattern of precipitation not having been changed as shown in fig 7 the recession coefficient decreased after this event from 0 02d 1 to 0 013d 1 and the dynamic volume of the aquifer increased accordingly 4 3 parameters causing overestimation of the dynamic volume in some scenarios the curve fitted to the observed recession decreases slower than real discharge recession during the extrapolation period fig 4c thus the dynamic volume is being overestimated one potential cause of this behavior is that recharge did not entirely cease for some time period of the observed recession this can be an effect of the hydraulic function of an epikarst the epikarst zone can be very thick and thus may store significant volumes of water water flow from this zone toward the saturated zone via the vadose zone has different velocities smart and friederich 1987 kogovsek 1997 sauter 1992 therefore part of the epikarst water may flow slowly and reach the phreatic zone delayed during the recession period to account for such a slow recharge process the s2 scenario considers that 30 of total recharge occurs during the recession period and decreases exponentially such that a considerable portion of this amount 85 is recharged during the observation period fig 4 c as shown by the modeling results this results in a reduced recession coefficient during the observation period since recharge ceases during the extrapolation period the recession coefficient increases relative to that of the observation period therefore the calculated remaining dynamic volume is higher than the actual volume daily discharge and weekly water table data from gallusquelle karst aquifer show that after reaching the maximum discharge the water table still rises fig 8 this suggests ongoing recharge during the recession period and if this recharge ceases during late times the recession coefficient will increase from that time onwards the spring discharge also decreases quicker during the extrapolation period than the exponential decline fitted to the observed recession period if specific yield or catchment area of the karst aquifer decrease with depth such as in scenarios s13 and s15 supplement 1 this is due to a decrease in storage when the groundwater level gradually decreases during the recession period thus these conditions lead to an overestimation of the remaining dynamic volume in scenario s11 the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix gradually decreases towards the spring this scenario shows that during the extrapolation period spring discharge decreases more quickly than the exponential decline fitted to the observed recession period supplement 1 as the low conductivity area close to the spring controls discharge during the observed recession period groundwater initially drains slowly from the karst aquifer however after this part of aquifer has been drained the high conductivity area at the remote area of the aquifer controls the flow of groundwater fast groundwater drainage from this area causes the discharge during the extrapolation period to decrease faster than the curve extrapolated from the observed recession period thus the remaining dynamic volume is overestimated karst aquifers in iran and many other regions of the world are used for the abstraction of drinking water by pumping wells according to the s7 scenario results groundwater abstraction from the karst aquifer can also result in an acceleration of the discharge recession the results of scenario s7 show a strong decrease in spring discharge during the extrapolation period compared to the exponential decline fitted to the observed recession period as a consequence the estimated remaining dynamic volume will be larger than the actual value this finding appears to be of high practical relevance for two reasons first the effects of groundwater abstraction may not only be caused by pumping within the karst aquifer itself but may result from the groundwater abstraction in adjacent karst or alluvial aquifers hydraulically connected but easily overlooked in the management of groundwater resources second given the negligible effect on the recession coefficient observed for the early recession period this may suggest that groundwater abstraction by pumping may not have relevant effects on spring discharge for average flow conditions such that it is overlooked that the recession coefficient markedly increases during the extrapolation period as a result the groundwater resources will be unexpectedly vulnerable to drought conditions 4 4 overview of factors affecting the volume estimation table 4 presents a summary of the effects of the various factors on the dynamic volume estimation this overview may serve as a checklist for a first assessment of potential underestimation or overestimation of the water storage estimated from the recession period whether or not the effects on the recession curve and thus on the volume estimate are significant will need more detailed field investigation and model application at the specific study site in a real karst aquifer some of the parameters examined here may simultaneously affect the estimation of the dynamic volume if the individual parameters act in the same direction overestimation or underestimation their superposition is expected to increase the overall difference between the estimated and actual dynamic volume in contrast parameters that have opposing effects on the recession coefficient and thus the volume estimate may compensate each other partially or completely the insight provided by model scenarios discussed here and summarized in table 4 thus can guide investigations into such more complex settings 5 conclusion process based modeling employing groundwater flow models was performed to simulate the hydrograph of typical karst springs the behavior of the spring discharge pattern was analyzed during all stages of the recession period modelled aquifer parameters can easily be changed to detect their effect on the different stages of the spring recession period this was found helpful to investigate the effect of a change in each parameter on the different stages of the spring discharge recession the exact values of overestimation and underestimation dynamic volume of the modeled scenarios are summarized in the result section for comparison these values can be expected to vary between different types of karst aquifers therefore these numbers should not be taken as indicators of the relative importance of the different parameters instead they illustrate the general effect of the individual parameters with respect to an over or underestimation of the dynamic volume the results of this modelling study reveal that the dynamic volume estimation based on observed discharge recession especially for aquifers that do not display long dry seasons may not always yield reliable estimates because the late times of the recession cannot be observed in general the best way to calculate the dynamic volume and extrapolate the recession coefficient is to build a master recession curve involving spring recessions for dry and very dry seasons should it be not possible to follow this suggested procedure the results provided here can possibly support the assessment of the reliability of the estimate and may indicate a tendency towards overestimation or underestimation based on the knowledge of the hydrogeological characteristics of the catchment this study focused on unconfined aquifers that are drained by a spring at the aquifer base while this type of setting is relevant in many water resources investigations other types deserve attention too for example the development of conduit systems below the spring level may create deep and complex flow systems such as those feeding the fontaine de vaucluse spring in france fleury et al 2007 caution is needed when transferring our results to such different settings and thus further investigations into the parameters controlling the dynamic volume and its estimation under conditions other than those considered here are recommended finally an important caveat the discharge recession provides integral information on the entire aquifer system i e the summed effects of spatio temporal distribution of recharge the hydraulic effects of the different compartments i e epikarst vadose zone and phreatic zone as well as the effect of the partitioning of the flow between highly and less permeable systems thus the variation of the individual aquifer geometries in horizontal and vertical directions the variation of the above hydraulic parameters as well as other factors their effect on system hydraulics are all summed up in just one individual recession curve difficult to deconvolute this implies a major ambiguity problem in the characterization of a karst system which can be resolved only by using additional information may it be soft e g information on the genesis of the aquifer system or hard e g hydraulic conductivity of the matrix from pumping tests data nevertheless we suggest that the above systematic investigation helps approach the characterization of karst aquifers by recession analysis and assists in the analysis of less investigated karst systems where only information on spring discharge is available credit authorship contribution statement mahmoud

3039,reliable estimates of the dynamic volume of karst aquifers i e the drainable volume of groundwater are important in the context of sustainable management and environmental protection of the karst water resources extrapolation of the observed recession of spring hydrographs is commonly used as a basis for the estimation of the dynamic volume however our understanding concerning the reliability of this approach is still limited therefore the adequacy of this approach is investigated using flow models of hypothetical karst aquifers to assess the deviation of the extrapolated from the real recession curve and identify parameters controlling the extrapolated recession coefficient the results show that parameters such as the geometry of the catchment area and point recharge have little effect on the accuracy of the estimated dynamic volume low extension of the highly conductive zone and increase in specific yield or catchment area with depth of the aquifer result in the underestimation of the dynamic volume groundwater abstraction and decrease of specific yield or catchment area with increasing saturated thickness can lead to an overestimation of the dynamic volume these findings clarify the potential underestimation or overestimation in dynamic volume estimates on the basis of the observed recession characteristics keywords dynamic volume recession coefficient extrapolation karst aquifer numerical modelling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the dynamic volume of a karst aquifer is defined as the volume of groundwater drainable by gravity at the spring padilla et al 1994 quantitative information about the dynamic volume of a karst aquifer is required for the development and sustainable management of groundwater resources el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 documented the importance of this information in a region with a complex karst system where groundwater abstraction is uncontrolled similarly hartmann et al 2012 addressed the drastic water shortage of one of the largest fresh water springs in the west bank attributed to an overexploitation of the aquifer i e an inappropriate management of the resource knowledge of the dynamic volume also allows the assessment of residence times relevant for the determination of aquifer vulnerability with respect to contamination einsiedl 2005 the scientific literature provides a number of methods for estimating the dynamic volume such as 1 analysis of residence times by lumped parameter models based on time series of environmental tracers e g maloszewski et al 2002 einsiedl 2005 2 geometric assessment of the water volume based on the saturated rock porosity above the spring outlet level atkinson 1977 pérez and sanz 2011 3 analysis of the karst groundwater flow by numerical methods e g sauter 1992 4 analysis of the spring discharge recession based on functional relationships such as those proposed by maillet 1905 mangin 1975 padilla et al 1994 el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 and mohammadi and shoja 2014 some authors also employed hydrological models for this purpose fleury et al 2007 jukić and denić jukić 2009 željković and kadić 2015 fu et al 2016 the first method requires long term time series of the relative abundance of stable water isotopes that is often not readily available and inapplicable for many practical purposes furthermore the isotope signal at the spring is dampened considerably for large catchments with large storage volumes a sufficiently accurate estimate of the effective porosity in karst environments is the most important factor in the application of the second method obtaining appropriate estimates of effective porosity in karst aquifers unfortunately is highly challenging and typically associated with high uncertainty finding the thickness of the phreatic zone between groundwater level and geodetic spring level is another quantity required and regarding the high heterogeneity of karst aquifers it requires groundwater levels frequently unavailable in karst catchments with thick unsaturated zones likewise the application of numerical flow models requires a wealth of detailed hydrogeological and hydrological data generally not readily available for cases where the above mentioned data environmental tracers hydraulic heads etc are unavailable this leaves the fourth method extrapolating the observed recession and integrating the discharge as the most attractive approach bakalowicz 2005 thus states that there is no other readily applicable method available for evaluating the dynamic volume yet the reliability of the estimates obtained with this method obviously depends on the validity of the extrapolated recession curve the purpose of this paper therefore is to explore for which conditions the extrapolation of the exponential recession function maillet 1905 yields acceptable estimates of the dynamic volume further we want to identify those factors causing either an underestimate or overestimate of the dynamic volume of the aquifer in general various factors and parameters can be assumed to affect the recession coefficient at different times of the discharge recession curve e g at early times the type and distribution of recharge localized or distributed intensity and duration etc and the epikarst hydraulics at intermediate times the hydraulic properties and the spatial extent of the conduit network and at late times the heterogeneity and hydraulic properties of the aquifer matrix as well as the catchment geometry the estimation of the dynamic volume mainly depends on the recession at intermediate and late time following the rainy season or recharge event therefore the focus of this research is placed on the identification of factors and parameters affecting the recession coefficient during intermediate and late times of the discharge recession for this purpose simplified but realistic close to nature prototype karst aquifers are designed and implemented in the conduit flow process cfp mode of the modular finite difference ground water flow model modflow 2005 shoemaker et al 2008 the cfp model option simulates flow in discrete conduits and turbulent groundwater flow conditions as well as the interaction between the conduit network and the permeable aquifer matrix by changing boundary conditions and aquifer parameters a sensitivity study is carried out and the effect of a change in selected parameters and factors on the shape of the recession curve and consequently on the dynamic volume is assessed thus we follow the generally accepted approach of applying simplified karst models to improve the understanding and the analysis of the spring discharge recession as already demonstrated by e g eisenlohr et al 1997 and kovács et al 2005 2 material and methods 2 1 dynamic volume as discussed above the analysis of the spring discharge recession based on functional relationships is a widely used and practical method for calculating the dynamic volume of the karst aquifer dewandel et al 2003 and fiorillo 2014 published comprehensive review papers on this topic the maillet formula an exponential equation widely used for recession curve analysis is an approximate analytical solution for the diffusion equation dewandel et al 2003 here it is used for the estimation of the dynamic volume the actual dynamic volume of the simplified prototype model karst aquifer is calculated based on mass storage in the aquifer using the discretized output of the modflow cfp model more details about how to calculate the estimated and actual dynamic volume are described below 2 1 1 estimates of the dynamic volume the maillet formula describes the recession using an exponential function of time qr qr0 e αt qr in m3 s is the discharge from the phreatic zone qr0 in m3 s is the initial discharge at time zero α in day 1 is the recession coefficient and t is time in days this allows calculating the dynamic volume vdyn in m3 by integration which relates to the total volume of drainable water in storage in the saturated zone above the geodetic level of the spring outlet ford and williams 2007 v dyn 0 q r 0 e αt dt c q r 0 α c is a constant equal to 86 400 for qr0 being expressed in m3 s and α in day 1 the volume of water dynamically stored in the aquifer at the end of the observed recession period remaining dynamic volume is more important for aquifer management during extended drought than the total dynamic volume fig 1 shows estimates of the total dynamic volume and the remaining dynamic volume obtained from the maillet formula as shown in fig 1 the remaining dynamic volume displays some uncertainty because the late recession is not observed due to recharge events thus it is estimated by extrapolation using the recession coefficient from the observed recession period therefore the focus of this research is on calculating estimates of the remaining dynamic volume to do so the maillet formula is fitted to the observed base flow recession of the spring discharge red solid lines in fig 1 together with the recession coefficient of this formula and the spring discharge at the initial time of the extrapolation period the estimate of the remaining dynamic volume was determined 2 1 2 actual dynamic volume the actual dynamic volume remaining at the beginning of the extrapolation period of the hypothetical prototype karst aquifer is calculated based on the storage in this aquifer using the discretized output of the employed groundwater flow model modflow cfp see 2 2 this is achieved by adding up the drainable water volume stored in each of the active cells at the start of the extrapolation period for each cell this volume is obtained by multiplying the specific yield the area of the cell and the saturated thickness obtained from the simulated hydraulic head 2 2 numerical aquifer model the discharge recession depends on the interaction between the highly conductive low storage conduit network system and the less conductive high storage matrix system the groundwater flow model modflow cfp shoemaker et al 2008 representing the complex hydraulic interaction between conduits and matrix has been employed to better understand the influence of the aquifer properties on the discharge recession modflow cfp is a finite difference groundwater flow model developed especially for karst aquifers displaying nonlinear or turbulent flow this code contains three modules each with unique abilities for simulating different aquifer conditions mode 1 is applied to simulate the hydraulic response of a discrete pipe network imbedded in a low permeability carbonate rock matrix mode 2 considers a preferential flow layer with the ability of switching between laminar and turbulent conditions mode 3 mixes the preferential flow layer with a pipe network cfp mode 1 has especially been designed to simulate groundwater flow in a conduit network with defined dimensions it requires information about conduit geometry and hydraulic properties cfp mode 2 is effectively applicable to simulate less mature karst aquifers without a well developed network of conduits and pipes or without detailed information about the properties of the conduit system its dependence on just a few parameters such as the critical reynolds numbers and void diameters is one of the most important advantages of this mode thus cfp mode 2 is employed here cfp mode 2 considers non darcian flow conditions in lateral flow but not in vertical direction using modflow cfp mode 2 the effect of non laminar and turbulent flow is considered by reducing the hydraulic conductivity with increasing flow velocity once the critical reynolds number indicating the transition from darcian to non darcian flow is exceeded kuniansky et al 2008 2 2 1 parameter study various parameters and factors affect the shape of the recession curve such as hydraulic conductivity specific yield and aquifer geometry kovács et al 2005 dewandel et al 2003 bonacci 1993 mode of recharge smart and hobbs 1986 and conduit network density eisenlohr et al 1997 changes in recession coefficient on the falling limb of the spring hydrograph can be related to flow regimes with different magnitudes of hydraulic conductivity forkasiewicz and paloc 1967 baedke and krothe 2001 changes in the catchment area or effective porosity with depth of aquifer fiorillo 2011 2014 and the duration of the recharge pulse birk and hergarten 2010 groundwater abstraction in the catchment area and delayed or ongoing recharge from the vadose zone wu et al 2019 eisenlohr et al 1997 perrin 2003 lastennet and mudry 1997 result in an increase and decrease of the recession coefficients respectively below we developed different scenarios to simulate the above cases and examine the influence of the characteristics of each case on the recession coefficient and the dynamic volume 2 2 2 basic model setup and modifications the hypothetical spring catchment includes a fissured limestone matrix drained by a highly conductive zone represented by a single conduit as fig 2 shows this model is discretized into 30 rows and 50 columns the width of the columns and rows is 100 m except where cells are close to the highly conductive zone the length of the highly conductive zone is 4000 m its thickness and width are 2 m and 1 m respectively the catchment is delineated by a no flow neumann type boundary except for the spring location represented by a fixed head boundary condition at 2 m dirichlet type boundary the basic geometry used here is an upscaled and modified version of a modflow cfp setup previously used for other parameter studies birk et al 2006 reimann et al 2011 since unconfined groundwater flow was modeled the horizontal transmissivity is a function of the saturated thickness of the cells throughout the simulation modflow cfp computes the saturated thickness for the individual cells if the saturated thickness becomes zero modflow converts the cell into dry cells no flow recharge 500 mm y infiltrates during a 5 month precipitation period corresponding to precipitation patterns recorded in south central iran naderi and raeisi 2015 the discharge of the large karst springs in iran starts to increase with the beginning of the wet season and starts to decrease at the end of this period mohammadi and shoja 2014 kavousi and raeisi 2015 based on this behavior recharge increases in the model linearly and becomes zero at the end of the precipitation season fig 3 while recharge is spatially uniformly distributed in the basic scenario some modified scenarios consider the effect of localized recharge directly into sinkholes for these scenarios 5 of total recharge is directly injected into the first cell of the highly conductive zone and the remaining 95 are distributed across the low permeability matrix the hydraulic parameters are uniform both within the low permeability matrix and within the highly conductive zone a value of 10 4 ms 1 is defined as hydraulic conductivity of the matrix its specific yield is 0 02 the hydraulic conductivity of the highly conductive zone is 147 ms 1 which corresponds to a 0 2 m diameter pipe computed by the hagen poiseuille formula reimann et al 2011 upper and lower limits of the critical reynolds number for the threshold between darcian and non darcian flow conditions are 50 and 100 respectively table 1 depicts how the basic scenario s1 is modified in the model scenarios considered here the simulation time period is 16 years for all scenarios in table 1 during this time period 12 years have recharge periods and in the remaining 4 years recharge is defined as zero to simulate a long term recession fig 3 at first all scenarios have been run in steady state mode with constant recharge depth then transient recharge was applied starting with the steady state head distribution as initial condition 3 model results the simulated discharge during the recession period is shown for three example scenarios in fig 4 a b and c supplement 1 provides the corresponding figures for the full set of scenarios fig 4a shows the discharge in a semi logarithmic plot for the basic scenario s1 this scenario resulted in an almost straight line except for negligible differences in the beginning of the graph indicating exponential decrease in discharge during the recession period the same recession behavior is apparent in the scenarios assuming point recharge s3 point recharge at short distance from the spring s4 and different length and width ratios of the aquifer 1 and 4 s17 and s18 see supplement 1 fig 4b displays the discharge recession for the scenario with reduced spatial extent of the highly conductive zone s5 the concave shape of the discharge recession indicates the discharge decreases slower than exponential decay with time this is also found for the scenarios with higher critical reynold number s6 increase and decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth of aquifer s8 s9 increase in hydraulic conductivity in length of aquifer s10 increase in specific yield with depth of aquifer s12 increase in catchment area with depth of aquifer s14 and increase in hydraulic conductivity of the highly conductive zone s16 see supplement 1 the scenarios with ongoing recharge s2 displays a convex shape implying that discharge decreases faster than exponential decay with time fig 4c this is obtained from scenarios with exploitation well s7 decrease in hydraulic conductivity in downgradient direction of the aquifer s11 decrease in specific yield with decreasing depth of the aquifer s13 and decrease in catchment area with decreasing depth of the aquifer s15 see supplement 1 based on the recession coefficient of the observation period and the discharge at the initial time of extrapolation period the estimated remaining dynamic volume was calculated table 2 table 2 also provides the exponential fit equation r2 and actual remaining volume fig 5 a compares the estimated and the actual remaining dynamic volumes fig 5b shows the relative error of the estimated remaining dynamic volumes comparing scenarios it becomes obvious that the actual dynamic volume increases with an increase in specific yield with increasing distance between the point of recharge and the spring with increasing catchment area with ongoing recharge and with a decrease in hydraulic conductivity of the matrix and conduit with an increase in spatial extent of the highly conductive zone with an increase in critical reynolds numbers and with increasing percentage of point recharge for these conditions the karst aquifer can sustain flow for a long time period and is therefore much less affected by dry seasons and long term droughts for inverse conditions the dynamic volume of the aquifer decreases and thus the aquifer is more subject to the adverse effects of droughts fiorillo et al 2012 following fiorillo et al 2012 karst springs that have large dynamic volume can be termed drought resistant whereas those with a small volume are drought vulnerable overestimation or underestimation of the dynamic volume thus may result in misjudgment of the resistance or vulnerability of a karst spring to drought 4 discussion table 3 provides information on the characteristics of some karst springs in the zagros mountains of iran as shown in this table these springs have different recession coefficients and dynamic volumes estimated based on recession analysis in order to improve our understanding of the origin of such differences and to assess potential errors in the estimation of the dynamic volumes this section discusses the results of the scenario investigations and compares them with selected real world examples as mentioned above different scenarios show three groups of parameters a parameters with no or little contribution to the error in the estimation of dynamic volume b parameters likely to contribute to an underestimation and c parameters possibly contributing to an overestimation of the dynamic volume the role of the above parameters is discussed below 4 1 parameters contributing little to the error in the estimation of the dynamic volume the basic scenario as well as scenarios considering point recharge s3 s4 and different geometry of the catchment area l w ratio s17 s18 exhibit only minor deviations between the recession curve extrapolated based on the maillet equation and the observed recession fig 4a and supplement 1 as a result these factors do not notably affect the estimation of the remaining dynamic volume and do not add any error in dynamic volume estimation based on an extrapolation of the observed recession in scenario s3 5 of recharge was allocated as point recharge directly into the highly conductive zone the recession coefficient of the exponential fit to the base flow of s3 0 0033d 1 is slightly higher than that of the basic scenario 0 0032d 1 this is caused by the direct connection of this recharge component to the highly conductive zone explaining the slightly more rapid drainage of the aquifer the actual dynamic volume remaining at the beginning of the extrapolation period thus is smaller than that of the basic scenario yet the modeling results reveal that the recession curve extrapolated from the observed recession is very close to the actual spring discharge through the extrapolation period therefore the estimation of the remaining dynamic volume is found to be reliable for the s4 scenario in which the distance between the point of recharge and the spring decreases the recession coefficient of the base flow exponential fit is slightly increased compared to the basic scenario from 0 0032d 1 to 0 0033d 1 thus the dynamic volume in s4 is larger than that of the basic scenario but again the estimated remaining dynamic volume is reliable likewise for scenarios s17 and s18 investigating the effect of basin geometry the discharge recession during the extrapolation period is matched by the maillet equation that was fitted to the observed recession period thus for each of these scenarios the estimation of the remaining dynamic volume is reliable although the values of the actual dynamic volumes differ from that of the basic scenario see table 1 a larger extent in flow direction of the aquifer s18 where length width 4 leads to a lower recession coefficient and thus larger remaining dynamic volume compared to non expanded settings s17 with length width ratio 1 the density length area of the highly conductive zone in the longer aquifer is larger compared to that in non expanded one nevertheless the recession coefficient of the non expanded aquifer is higher and thus the remaining dynamic volume lower for equal densities of the highly conductive zone the difference in recession coefficient and remaining dynamic volume is even more increased in the gilan aquifer located in the zagros region west iran employed as an example of a limestone karst aquifer in which despite conduit flow karimi et al 2003 the recession coefficient of the base flow condition is low 0 0012d 1 and the large ca 37 km longitudinal extent provides large volumes of water during the base flow period 72 106 m3 in contrast the catchment area of the pireghar karst spring in the same region zagros region and with similar lithological composition asmari formation but shorter longitudinal extent 21 km exhibits a higher recession coefficient 0 005 d 1 and lower dynamic volume 21 106 m3 for base flow conditions mohammadi and shoja 2014 other characteristics of these two spring catchments are similar for instance the catchment areas of the gilan aquifer and pireghar karst spring are 110 km2 and 102 km2 and average annual precipitation is 625 mm and 606 mm respectively suggesting recharge is similar based on the model results it is thus suggested that the different geometry in the given examples is a likely reason for the differences in the observed recession coefficients and the values of the actual dynamic volumes but that the geometry does not affect the reliability of the dynamic volume estimates 4 2 parameters causing underestimation of the dynamic volume during the extrapolation period of some scenarios the modelled recession coefficient decreases faster than the observed discharge recession coefficient fig 4b therefore the modelled remaining dynamic volume is lower than the actual volume in many real karst aquifers the highly conductive zone may not extend throughout the entire aquifer s5 scenario and in most cases these less permeable regions have a considerable extent in areas at remote upgradient distance from the spring outlet as a result the behavior of the springs is flashy and during early times when the drainage of the area close to the spring initially controls discharge groundwater drains rapidly from the karst aquifer however after draining of this aquifer section the low conductive area at greater distance from the spring controls the flow of groundwater during the extrapolation period slow groundwater drainage from the remote area thus causes the observed discharge to decrease slower compared to the one modelled using the maillet equation in scenario s5 the estimated and actual remaining dynamic volumes are 5 2 106 m3 and 9 8 106 m3 respectively a similar effect is obtained when the matrix hydraulic conductivity increases along the aquifer toward the spring scenario s10 shows that in this case the discharge during the extrapolation period decreases slower than the exponential decay that was fitted to the observed recession period supplement 1 therefore the estimated remaining dynamic volume is less than the real volume the matrix hydraulic conductivity in a karst aquifer may also increase or decrease with depth the s9 scenario considers two layers where the upper layer has a higher hydraulic conductivity compared to the lower layer connected to the highly conductive zone initially groundwater is quickly drained from the upper layer and thus the recession of the spring hydrograph is fast as this upper layer falls dry however only the less conductive lower layer provides flow to the spring thus the discharge from the karst aquifer decreases more slowly than before when the discharge was provided by the upper more conductive layer if the drop of the water table to the level of the less conductive layer occurs at the extrapolation stage the consequence would be an underestimation of the remaining dynamic volume an example of this type of behavior is apparent in the gallusquelle karst aquifer in southwest germany sauter 1992 as shown in fig 6 the recession coefficient of the karst spring draining this aquifer is considerably reduced when groundwater level drops below a specific threshold 660 m in b7 and 683 m in b14 observation boreholes based on pumping and injection tests data and also well logs sauter 1992 1995 related this change in recession coefficient to a decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth similar observations such as in s9 scenario are made when the hydraulic conductivity of the deep layer is higher compared to that of the shallow one s8 in some karst aquifers it is possible that the specific yield and catchment area increase with the depth of the aquifer scenarios s12 and s14 consider an increase with depth for the specific yield or the catchment area respectively as shown by the modeling results supplement 1 for both of these scenarios during the extrapolation period spring discharge decreases slower than the exponential decline fitted to the observed recession period with the drop of the groundwater level during the recession period the water volume released per unit head change increases under these conditions therefore the extrapolation based on maillet s equation leads to an underestimation of the remaining dynamic volume in a real karst aquifer in a highly conductive zone turbulent flow conditions can affect the emptying rate of the aquifer and thus the estimation of the remaining dynamic volume of the aquifer for turbulent flow a proportion of the energy and head will be lost by energy dissipation in eddies thus the effective hydraulic conductivity of the conduit for turbulent flow conditions is less than for laminar flow the parameter commonly used to assess when flow turns from laminar into turbulent is the critical reynolds number conduits with low tortuosity and low internal roughness have larger critical reynolds numbers which means that laminar flow prevails in the conduit shoemaker et al 2008 an increase in the critical reynolds number facilitates the drainage through the highly conductive zone and thus the drainage of water from areas remote from the spring during the extrapolation period as a result spring discharge decreases slower during the extrapolation period of this scenario s6 compared to the exponential decline fitted to the observed recession period thus the estimate of the remaining dynamic volume is lower than the actual volume increasing or decreasing the hydraulic conductivity in the highly conductive zone has effects similar to an increase and decrease in the critical reynolds number with increased hydraulic conductivity in the highly conductive zone the emptying rate of the aquifer increases and the dynamic volume decreases and vice versa in scenario s16 with high hydraulic conductivity in the highly conductive zone the emptying rate of the aquifer is high during observed recession times and decreases during the extrapolation period thus the remaining dynamic volume estimate is lower compared to the actual volume a good example for showing the effect of a highly conductive zone on the magnitude of the recession coefficient emptying rate of the aquifer during recession times and dynamic volume is the hammerbach spring system this spring emerges from the lurbach karst aquifer located in the south of austria after a flood event in august 2005 part of the main conduit in this aquifer presumably was plugged with sediments decreasing the effective hydraulic conductivity of the whole system mayaud et al 2016 as a result the discharge behavior of the hammerbach spring changed to a more dampened discharge pattern after this event despite the pattern of precipitation not having been changed as shown in fig 7 the recession coefficient decreased after this event from 0 02d 1 to 0 013d 1 and the dynamic volume of the aquifer increased accordingly 4 3 parameters causing overestimation of the dynamic volume in some scenarios the curve fitted to the observed recession decreases slower than real discharge recession during the extrapolation period fig 4c thus the dynamic volume is being overestimated one potential cause of this behavior is that recharge did not entirely cease for some time period of the observed recession this can be an effect of the hydraulic function of an epikarst the epikarst zone can be very thick and thus may store significant volumes of water water flow from this zone toward the saturated zone via the vadose zone has different velocities smart and friederich 1987 kogovsek 1997 sauter 1992 therefore part of the epikarst water may flow slowly and reach the phreatic zone delayed during the recession period to account for such a slow recharge process the s2 scenario considers that 30 of total recharge occurs during the recession period and decreases exponentially such that a considerable portion of this amount 85 is recharged during the observation period fig 4 c as shown by the modeling results this results in a reduced recession coefficient during the observation period since recharge ceases during the extrapolation period the recession coefficient increases relative to that of the observation period therefore the calculated remaining dynamic volume is higher than the actual volume daily discharge and weekly water table data from gallusquelle karst aquifer show that after reaching the maximum discharge the water table still rises fig 8 this suggests ongoing recharge during the recession period and if this recharge ceases during late times the recession coefficient will increase from that time onwards the spring discharge also decreases quicker during the extrapolation period than the exponential decline fitted to the observed recession period if specific yield or catchment area of the karst aquifer decrease with depth such as in scenarios s13 and s15 supplement 1 this is due to a decrease in storage when the groundwater level gradually decreases during the recession period thus these conditions lead to an overestimation of the remaining dynamic volume in scenario s11 the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix gradually decreases towards the spring this scenario shows that during the extrapolation period spring discharge decreases more quickly than the exponential decline fitted to the observed recession period supplement 1 as the low conductivity area close to the spring controls discharge during the observed recession period groundwater initially drains slowly from the karst aquifer however after this part of aquifer has been drained the high conductivity area at the remote area of the aquifer controls the flow of groundwater fast groundwater drainage from this area causes the discharge during the extrapolation period to decrease faster than the curve extrapolated from the observed recession period thus the remaining dynamic volume is overestimated karst aquifers in iran and many other regions of the world are used for the abstraction of drinking water by pumping wells according to the s7 scenario results groundwater abstraction from the karst aquifer can also result in an acceleration of the discharge recession the results of scenario s7 show a strong decrease in spring discharge during the extrapolation period compared to the exponential decline fitted to the observed recession period as a consequence the estimated remaining dynamic volume will be larger than the actual value this finding appears to be of high practical relevance for two reasons first the effects of groundwater abstraction may not only be caused by pumping within the karst aquifer itself but may result from the groundwater abstraction in adjacent karst or alluvial aquifers hydraulically connected but easily overlooked in the management of groundwater resources second given the negligible effect on the recession coefficient observed for the early recession period this may suggest that groundwater abstraction by pumping may not have relevant effects on spring discharge for average flow conditions such that it is overlooked that the recession coefficient markedly increases during the extrapolation period as a result the groundwater resources will be unexpectedly vulnerable to drought conditions 4 4 overview of factors affecting the volume estimation table 4 presents a summary of the effects of the various factors on the dynamic volume estimation this overview may serve as a checklist for a first assessment of potential underestimation or overestimation of the water storage estimated from the recession period whether or not the effects on the recession curve and thus on the volume estimate are significant will need more detailed field investigation and model application at the specific study site in a real karst aquifer some of the parameters examined here may simultaneously affect the estimation of the dynamic volume if the individual parameters act in the same direction overestimation or underestimation their superposition is expected to increase the overall difference between the estimated and actual dynamic volume in contrast parameters that have opposing effects on the recession coefficient and thus the volume estimate may compensate each other partially or completely the insight provided by model scenarios discussed here and summarized in table 4 thus can guide investigations into such more complex settings 5 conclusion process based modeling employing groundwater flow models was performed to simulate the hydrograph of typical karst springs the behavior of the spring discharge pattern was analyzed during all stages of the recession period modelled aquifer parameters can easily be changed to detect their effect on the different stages of the spring recession period this was found helpful to investigate the effect of a change in each parameter on the different stages of the spring discharge recession the exact values of overestimation and underestimation dynamic volume of the modeled scenarios are summarized in the result section for comparison these values can be expected to vary between different types of karst aquifers therefore these numbers should not be taken as indicators of the relative importance of the different parameters instead they illustrate the general effect of the individual parameters with respect to an over or underestimation of the dynamic volume the results of this modelling study reveal that the dynamic volume estimation based on observed discharge recession especially for aquifers that do not display long dry seasons may not always yield reliable estimates because the late times of the recession cannot be observed in general the best way to calculate the dynamic volume and extrapolate the recession coefficient is to build a master recession curve involving spring recessions for dry and very dry seasons should it be not possible to follow this suggested procedure the results provided here can possibly support the assessment of the reliability of the estimate and may indicate a tendency towards overestimation or underestimation based on the knowledge of the hydrogeological characteristics of the catchment this study focused on unconfined aquifers that are drained by a spring at the aquifer base while this type of setting is relevant in many water resources investigations other types deserve attention too for example the development of conduit systems below the spring level may create deep and complex flow systems such as those feeding the fontaine de vaucluse spring in france fleury et al 2007 caution is needed when transferring our results to such different settings and thus further investigations into the parameters controlling the dynamic volume and its estimation under conditions other than those considered here are recommended finally an important caveat the discharge recession provides integral information on the entire aquifer system i e the summed effects of spatio temporal distribution of recharge the hydraulic effects of the different compartments i e epikarst vadose zone and phreatic zone as well as the effect of the partitioning of the flow between highly and less permeable systems thus the variation of the individual aquifer geometries in horizontal and vertical directions the variation of the above hydraulic parameters as well as other factors their effect on system hydraulics are all summed up in just one individual recession curve difficult to deconvolute this implies a major ambiguity problem in the characterization of a karst system which can be resolved only by using additional information may it be soft e g information on the genesis of the aquifer system or hard e g hydraulic conductivity of the matrix from pumping tests data nevertheless we suggest that the above systematic investigation helps approach the characterization of karst aquifers by recession analysis and assists in the analysis of less investigated karst systems where only information on spring discharge is available credit authorship contribution statement mahmoud
