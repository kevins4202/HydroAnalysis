1495,chlorinated solvents are extensively used in many activities and hence in the past decades impacted a large number of sites the presence of these contaminants in groundwater is challenging particularly for the management of the vapor intrusion pathway in this work we examine the potential feasibility of using horizontal permeable reactive barriers hprbs placed in the unsaturated zone to treat chlorinated solvent vapors emitted from groundwater zero valent iron zvi powders partially saturated with water and characterized by different specific surface areas ssa were tested alone or mixed with sand in lab scale batch reactors using tce as model compound depending on the type of iron powder used a reduction of tce concentration in the vapor phase from approximately 35 up to 99 was observed after 3 weeks of treatment the best performance in terms of tce reduction was obtained using the zvi characterized by the intermediated values of the specific surface area ssa this finding which is in contrast with the results generally observed in in aqueous solutions was tentatively attributed to a non selective higher reactivity of the fine grained iron samples with water and dissolved oxygen with a consequent iron passivation or to the occurrence of a diffusion limited reaction kinetics based on the first order kinetic degradation rate constants estimated from the experimental data a horizontal barrier of 1 m containing zvi or a mixture of zvi and sand can potentially lead to an attenuation of tce vapors over 99 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords zero valent iron contaminated sites horizontal permeable reactive barrier chlorinated solvent vapors vapor intrusion 1 introduction chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene tce or tetrachloroethylene pce have been extensively used in industry and other activities e g dry cleaning all over the world as a consequence a large number of sites is now contaminated by this class of pollutants with a strong impact on groundwater quality hunkeler and aravena 2000 parker et al 2003 balderacchi et al 2014 as widely reported in the literature e g guilbeault et al 2005 rivett and feenstra 2005 at many sites these compounds persist as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls that can closely interact with low permeability deposits where they can be trapped and subsequently released into the aquifer as a result of back diffusion processes mackay and cherry 1989 chapman et al 2012 thus these deposits become a secondary source of pollution persisting for many decades or even hundreds of years chapman and parker 2005 rivett et al 2011 the persistence of these compounds can lead to the formation of huge coalescing plumes in groundwater i e diffuse pollution that can pose potential long term risks for human health of overlying residents namely due to their chemico physical and toxicological nature chlorinated solvents such as tce and pce are of concern for the vapor intrusion pathway u s epa 2015a vapor intrusion refers to the migration of toxic volatile compounds from the subsurface into overlying buildings itrc 2007 in brief the contaminants in the soil gas diffuse upward toward the foundation and ground surface as the chemical vapors approach the building foundation they are transported with the soil gas flow into the building through openings and penetrations in the foundations u s epa 2015a the management of sites associated with chlorinated solvents is challenging the traditional remediation approaches generally effective on the source of contamination may in fact result impracticable from an economical and technical viewpoint when applied to large groundwater plumes citychlor 2013 for these scenarios management strategies relying on the interruption of the vapor intrusion pathway into the building are preferable for instance the vapor intrusion can be controlled by sealing the major openings for soil gas entry or by installing vapor barriers below the building itrc 2007 u s epa 2015a alternatively systems aimed at treating the upcoming vapors can be employed for instance mahmoodlu et al 2014 2015 carried out lab scale tests aimed at evaluating the feasibility of using solid potassium permanganate to create a horizontal permeable reactive barrier hprb to treat volatile organic compounds vocs flowing upward the hprbs can be placed in the unsaturated zone overlying the source of contamination to treat chlorinated solvent vapors emitted from groundwater recently we proposed see zingaretti et al 2019 to use zero valent iron as reactive material in hprbs zero valent iron reacts with the chlorinated organic compounds through electron transfer reactions as shown below for the degradation of tce itrc 2011 1 3 fe 0 3 fe 2 6 e 2 c 2 h cl 3 3 h 6 e c 2 h 4 3 cl 3 3 fe 0 c 2 h cl 3 3 h 3 fe 2 c 2 h 4 3 cl the primary reaction mechanism generally considered for the reduction of chlorinated ethenes by zvi is the β elimination pathway roberts et al 1996 this pathway involves a two electron transfer that produces chloroacetylene intermediates which are then transformed to acetylene by hydrogenolysis and rapidly reduced to ethene and ethane campbell et al 1997 arnold and roberts 2000 a minor reaction pathway for the dechlorination process by zvi is hydrogenolysis arnold and roberts 2000 in this case less chlorinated intermediates with replacement of a halogen by hydrogen are produced and subsequently degraded campbell et al 1997 in our preliminary experiments zingaretti et al 2019 we found that zero valent iron partially saturated with water can be effective for the treatment of tce in gas phase compared to our previous work here we examine the performances of different iron powders commercially available from different manufacturers and characterized by different specific surface areas ssa furthermore we investigate the application of zvi and sand mixtures and the impact of changing the operating conditions from anaerobic to aerobic in view of simulating more closely the conditions expected in the field finally differently from our previous work here we estimate from the experimental data the degradation rate constants of tce by zvi which are then used for a preliminary but robust design of the permeable reactive barrier 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials four types of iron powders were tested named in this work as fe1 fe2 fe3 and fe4 the fe1 and fe4 samples were provided by iputec gmbh and are both characterized by a particle size lower than 63 μm i e in the range of silty to very fine sand soils according to the classification of usda united states department of agriculture based on manufacturer information fe1 contains 1 oxygen while fe4 contains 20 oxygen as iron oxides fe2o3 the fe2 sample was purchased from sigma aldrich 325 mesh 97 and is characterized by a particle size lower than 44 μm i e in the range of silty soils according to the usda classification the fe3 iron powder was provided by pometon s p a maerne italy and was obtained by water atomization sieving and an annealing processing h2 furnace to reduce the content of oxides and is characterized by a particle size lower than 425 μm i e in the range of fine to medium sandy soils according to the usda classification all the iron powders were preliminarily pretreated with hcl 0 1 m for 30 min and then rinsed with n2 purged water and dried in a n2 atmosphere as shown by other authors the acid pretreatment can lead to the cleaning of the surface by dissolution of metals and breakdown of the passivating oxide layer with a consequent increase in the density of reactive sites and of the specific surface area su and puls 1999 uludag demirer and bowers 2001 2003 tce 99 used in the experiments was purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 materials characterization the iron powders used in this study were characterized in terms of microstructure and specific surface area ssa the microstructure and chemical characteristics of the solid samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem fe sem supra 35 carl zeiss smt oberkochen germany the mineralogy of the iron samples was evaluated by x ray diffraction xrd analysis with cu kα radiation using a philips expert pro diffractometer equipped with a copper tube operated at 40 kv and 40 ma with an angular step of 0 02 held for 0 6 s with 2θ spanning from 5 to 90 the surface chemical analysis of the iron samples was carried out using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis vg excalab mkii enea c r casaccia n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were obtained at 196 c using a micromeritics asap2020 apparatus the specific surface area was calculated by the bet brunauer emmett teller method in the equilibrium pressure interval 0 01 p p 0 2 where p p is the relative pressure namely the specific surface area ssa in m2 g was calculated according to the following equation brunauer et al 1940 4 ssa 0 001 v m n a x 22 4 where vm cm3 g is the monolayer volume n the avogadro number and ax the atomic surface area of n2 0 162 nm2 at 77 k the pore size distribution was obtained from the desorption branch of the hysteresis loop using the barrett joyner halenda bjh method barrett et al 1951 and the total pore volume was calculated from the maximum adsorption point at p p 0 99 prior to the n2 adsorption the sample was degassed under vacuum at 350 c for 5 h 2 3 tce removal experiments the batch tests were carried out at room temperature 20 2 c in 20 ml transparent glass vials see fig 1 the tests were carried out using the same procedure adopted by zingaretti et al 2019 in particular each reactor was prepared by adding 1 g of zero valent iron to the vial that was then purged with n2 for few minutes to remove air and promote an anaerobic environment to ensure a moisture content of 10 by weight 100 μl of distilled water was added with a syringe to the granular iron placed in the vial 1 g it is worth mentioning that as shown in eqs 1 3 the presence of a proton donor i e water is essential for the degradation of tce by zero valent iron afterwards 5 μl of pure tce was injected with a glass syringe into the 1 ml glass tube which was previously placed on the bottom of the vial to avoid a direct contact of pure tce with zero valent iron immediately after this last step the vials were sealed with ptfe faced butyl septa and aluminum caps control tests adopting the same procedure discussed above but without adding the iron powder were also carried out in parallel to the zvi tests to assess the possible losses of tce vapors from the vial a set of tce reduction experiments was also carried out using mixtures of iron fe1 sample and laboratory sand at different ratios 50 50 by weight or 25 75 by weight in order to evaluate a possible configuration of the hprb in field applications which could reduce the installation costs furthermore to simulate the conditions expected in the unsaturated zone some tests were also carried out at aerobic conditions i e without the preliminary n2 purging in the batch using fe1 iron samples with or without sand the operating conditions employed in the different tests are summarized in table 1 for each experiment different vials were prepared to evaluate the tce removal by zero valent iron after 3 7 14 and 21 days as described earlier for each time interval control experiments were also performed without zero valent iron to evaluate the losses of tce vapors from the vials during the experiments all the experiments were carried out in triplicate the tce concentration was measured in the headspace of the vials by gas chromatography gc with a flame ionization detector fid the headspace gas 250 μl was injected with an auto sampler aoc 5000 plus using a split ratio of 1 10 into a shimadzu gc gc qp2010se equipped with a column equity 5 30 m 0 25 mm id x 0 25 μm film thickness helium 0 9 ml min was used as carrier gas the oven temperature was programmed starting from 40 c for 2 min and then ramped to 150 c at 8 c min that was maintained for other 2 min using the same gc fid settings the identification of tce degradation byproducts was performed by carrying out gc ms analysis on selected samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface specific area microstructure and mineralogical phases fig 2 shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the specimen and the corresponding pore size distribution curves the textural properties of the different samples are reported in table 2 for the fe3 sample the n2 physisorption amount was below the minimum measurable value of the instrument and thus it was not possible to provide a numerical value for the specific surface area detection limit around 0 01 m2 g the shape of the isotherms of the other samples fall within the iupac international union of pure and applied chemistry classification of type ii typically obtained in case of nonporous or macro porous materials the ssa values increases in the samples order fe1 fe2 fe4 from 0 69 m2 g 3 10 m2 g up to 15 54 m2 g respectively these ssa values are consistent with other commercially available zero valent iron such as those tested by su and puls 1999 that found values in the order of 0 334 to 2 136 m2 g for hcl washed zero valent iron samples consistently the very small pore volume increases in the same order from 0 008 cm3 g 0 017 cm3 g up to 0 063 cm3 g respectively fe1 sample is almost macro porous iupac definition pore width 50 nm indeed its desorption branch perfectly follows the adsorption one with no hysteresis conversely fe2 and fe4 samples show a small hysteresis between the adsorption and desorption branch of the isotherms that can be described as a h3 type according to the iupac classification corresponding to wedge shaped pores formed by the stacking of flaky particles fe2 and fe4 samples show a bimodal pore distribution with a small fraction of pores 3 8 nm width and a large fraction in the range 10 100 nm the small pore of 3 8 nm width is evident on fe4 sample assuming a specific gravity of the samples d 7 87 cm3 g which is that of metallic iron we estimated the average particles size dbet with the formula dbet 6 d ssa it can be observed that the calculated dbet is much smaller than the nominal size provided by the manufacturers see section 2 1 and this can be attributed to the irregular shape and pronounced surface roughness and nano scale porosity of the iron samples these results are confirmed by the sem images reported in fig 3 which show the microstructure of the tested iron powders from this figure it can be noticed that the fe3 sample is characterized by the higher particle diameter i e lower ssa furthermore this figure confirms the presence of flaky particles for fe2 and fe4 samples in accordance with the bet results fig 4 shows the mineralogical phases detected by xrd analysis in the different iron samples in all samples the only crystalline phases detected by xrd analysis were metallic iron fe0 and iron oxides fe2o3 namely it can be noticed that iron oxides were mainly detected on the fe4 sample indicating that for this sample the pre treatment with 0 1 hcl was not effective to obtain a complete oxide free surface fig 5 shows the surface chemical analysis of the specimen carried out using xps the xps spectra were obtained by irradiating the samples with a beam of x rays while simultaneously measuring the kinetic energy and electrons emitted from the top of the analysed material peaks appear in the spectrum from atoms emitting electrons of a particular characteristic energy the full spectrum not reported here showed two main fe o components and minor c from the carbon tape supporting the powders and au a small gold wire to determine surface charging signals the iron orbitals 2p spectrum shows two main photoelectron peaks around 712 ev and 724 ev assigned to the electron emission from 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 core levels the 2p3 2 peak was fitted into two components at 710 ev and 714 2 ev attributed to fe2 and fe3 respectively indicating the surface passivation of the fe particles by ambient air with formation of iron oxides feo and fe2o3 and hydroxide species feooh no metallic fe was detected due to the thickness of the passivation layer and to the xps depth of analysis the o1s orbitals spectrum shows a main peak at 530 ev attributed to o2 in feo bond with a shoulder at higher binding energy due to surface hydroxyl group and h2o the hydroxyl group component was particularly evident on fe1 surface the relative amount of fe and o on the surface was calculated by integrating the core level peaks by taking into account their sensitivity factors table 3 in agreement with the xrd analysis the fe4 specimen shows the most oxidized surface 3 2 tce removal using different types of iron fig 6 shows the normalized concentration of tce in gas phase c c0 as a function of the reaction time 3 7 14 and 21 days with the different types of iron powders in particular the residual concentration of tce at each time interval was normalized with respect to the concentration of tce measured at the same time in the control test carried out without adding the iron powder to the vial in the same figure we reported the degradation tce rate constants calculated assuming a first order reaction kinetics 5 c t c ctr e kt where c t is the concentration of tce in the gas phase g m3 measured at time t ctcr the concentration of tce in the gas phase g m3 measured at the same time in the control test carried out without adding the zvi k the first order degradation rate constant d 1 and t the reaction time d the obtained results show that depending on the type of iron powder used a reduction of tce gas concentration from 34 i e normalized concentration of 0 66 see fe3 sample in fig 6c to more than 99 normalized concentration of 0 006 see fe1 sample in fig 6a was observed for treatments of 3 weeks specifically as expected the lower reduction of tce by zero valent iron was observed in the tests carried out using fe3 iron powder which as described in the previous section see table 2 is characterized by a lower ssa 0 01 m2 g and hence by a lower reactivity conversely for the other iron samples we did not find a positive correlation between the tce reduction in gas phase and the ssa namely the highest tce reduction more than 99 was observed for fe1 sample that is characterized by a ssa of 0 69 m2 g i e significantly lower than the ssa of fe4 15 54 m2 g and fe2 3 1 m2 g this finding is in contrast with the results obtained by different authors in the experiments carried out on aqueous solutions that usually found a higher iron reactivity for zvi characterized by a higher ssa e g matheson and tratnyek 1994 johnson et al 1996 wang and zhang 1997 su and puls 1999 lin and lo 2005 however as elucidated by tratnyek and johnson 2006 a higher reactivity does not necessarily improve the remediation performance indeed high reactivity correlates with low selectivity i e the tendency of iron particles to react also with non target substances such as dissolved oxygen and water tratnyek and johnson 2006 for instance some authors found that compared to micrometric zero valent iron the reactivity of zero valent iron particles in the nanometric scale could be easily weakened due to the formation of iron oxides on the particle surface that greatly affects the iron reactivity shin et al 2012 li et al 2014 as a result the lifetime of nanometric zero valent iron particles can be shorter than micrometric zero valent iron with a consequent lower remediation performance this faster iron passivation can explain the obtained results considering that fe2 and fe4 particles are characterized by higher ssa compared to fe1 see table 2 on the other hand the obtained results can be also explained by the fact that in this work the investigated reaction is between tce present in the gas phase and unsaturated zero valent iron namely considering that the reactions occur at the iron water interface the overall reaction rate can be influenced by the diffusion rate of tce vapors in the porosity of the iron sample and by the subsequent dissolution rate in the water filled porosity considering that in the different experiments the water content in the iron samples was the same 10 water by weight the limiting step of the reaction can be the diffusion rate of tce in gas phase within the iron sample porosity the intraparticle effective diffusion of tce is indeed inversely proportional to the pore size of the sample and this can explain the lower performance in terms of tce reduction observed in the tests carried out with fe2 and fe4 samples compared to the ones obtained with fe1 characterized by a higher pore size see table 2 as to the first order degradation rate constants table 4 reports a summary of the values estimated for the different experiments to compare the observed degradation rate constants with the values obtained in previous works carried in aqueous solution the first order degradation rate constants k h 1 were normalized to the specific surface area ssa m2 g the mass of zero valent iron used in the tests mzvi g and the volume of the reactor vreactor l as follows johnson et al 1996 6 k ssa v reactor ssa m zvi k the normalized degradation rate constants kssa are reported in table 4 making reference to fe1 the obtained tce degradation rate constant kssa 3 3 10 4 l m2 h compares well with the value of 3 9 10 4 l m2 h reported by johnson et al 1996 based on a literature review of experiments carried out in aqueous solution conversely the kssa derived for fe2 and fe4 characterized by a higher ssa fall below the lower range of the literature data collected by johnson et al 1996 thus supporting the hypothesis that the reaction was to some extent hindered by iron passivation or controlled by the mass transfer of tce in the gas phase within the iron sample namely it is worth noting that the ratio between the tce degradation rate constants of fe4 and fe2 samples kssafe1 kssafe4 is around 62 this values is not far from the ratio of the expected diffusion coefficients for the two iron samples which from eq 9 is equal to the inverse of the square of the pore volume of the two iron samples pvfe4 2 pvfe1 2 69 this leads to the conclusion that for the fe4 sample the reaction seems to be limited by diffusion for fe1 iron powder that as discussed in the previous section showed the best performance in terms of tce reduction in gas phase we carried out some further tests to simulate the conditions that can be employed in field applications in the unsaturated zone specifically the reduction of tce using an iron sand mixture 50 50 or 25 75 was examined furthermore to simulate the conditions expected in the unsaturated zone some tests were carried out under aerobic conditions i e no n2 purged in the batch with or without sand the results of these tests are shown in fig 7 together with the first order degradation rates estimated for each experiment the results obtained show that the performance in terms of tce reduction after 3 weeks slightly decreased from 99 when only iron was used see fig 6a to around 93 i e normalized concentration of 0 07 see fig 7a for the iron and sand mixture when the mixture was composed of 75 of sand and 25 of iron powder a noticeable reduction of the reactivity was observed with a residual normalized tce concentration after 3 weeks of 0 35 i e reduction of 65 considering that the amount of iron in these tests is largely in excess compared to the one needed to degrade the amount of the tce injected into the vial these results can be attributed to a non homogenous distribution of the water in the mixture making the reaction at the iron to water interface less effective as to the experiments performed without n2 purging of the vials see fig 7c and d we found that the tce reduction in aerobic reactors was slightly lower than in anaerobic reactors although this difference does not look statistically significant specifically in the tests with iron only the tce reduction in gas phase after 3 weeks of treatment decreased from 99 4 normalized concentration of 0 006 see fig 6a at anaerobic conditions to 98 9 normalized concentration of 0 01 see fig 7d at aerobic conditions for the 50 50 iron sand mixture the performance decreased from 92 6 normalized concentration of 0 074 see fig 7a at anaerobic conditions to 92 3 normalized concentration of 0 077 see fig 7d at aerobic conditions these results can be ascribed to a reduction of the number of reactive sites in the aerobic tests due to a higher oxidation of zvi surface overall these results suggest that the use of zero valent iron with sand especially using a 50 50 mixture and the application in aerobic environments do not seem to significantly affect the performance in terms of tce reduction with respect to using iron only at anaerobic conditions this is also confirmed by the normalized first order reaction rate constants derived for the different operating conditions see kssa in table 4 which are in the range of 2 4 2 7 10 4 l m2 h i e only slightly lower than the degradation rate of 3 3 10 4 l m2 h obtained in the anaerobic reactor using only fe1 iron powder in this view the application of zero valent iron in sand mixtures can be of particular interest for in situ applications for two main reasons the first is that using sand can noticeably reduce the costs of hprb material furthermore the mixture of iron with sand can ensure a higher permeability of the barrier compared to the use of iron only thus potentially limiting possible lateral preferential pathways for application in the unsaturated soils characterized by high permeabilities 3 3 byproducts and degradation pathway fig 8 shows the gc fid chromatograms obtained in one set of experiments at 3 days and 21 days during the reduction of tce by zero valent iron the chromatogram obtained in one of the control tests carried out without the addition of the iron powder is also reported as reference similar profiles were obtained also for the other tests carried out data not shown for sake of conciseness the chromatograms illustrate the transformation of tce to reaction byproducts specifically it can be observed that in the control test the only peak detectable was the one corresponding to tce for the other tests the appearance of several peaks at lower retention times are progressively detected with a corresponding decrease of the tce peak these peaks were identified by gc ms in selective ion monitoring mode as c3 c4 hydrocarbons and to a lower extent c5 c6 hydrocarbons the identification of these peaks is shown in fig 9 specifically as shown in detail in fig 9 in the c3 c4 region the peaks were identified as methylacetylene 2 methyl propene and 1 butene the c5 region peaks were identified as 2 methyl butane 3 methyl 1 butanol 1 pentanol 2 methyl 2 butene and cyclopropane finally the c6 region peaks were identified as 3 methylene pentane 2 ethyl 1 butene 3 methyl pentane 1 hexene 3 methyl 1 pentene and 3 hexene it is worth noting that an identification of these byproducts with a good level of confidence was not possible due to the weak peak intensity and the low resolution of overlapping peaks these results highlight that β elimination was the main degradation pathway in agreement with the previous findings of campbell et al 1997 and zingaretti et al 2019 as discussed earlier the β elimination pathway produces chloroacetylene intermediates which are unstable and rapidly reduced to ethene campbell et al 1997 the other possible pathway is the hydrogenolysis that is however a slower reaction during which less chlorinated intermediates are produced and subsequently degraded arnold and roberts 2000 the conclusion that in this case we assume β elimination as the main degradation pathway is based on the fact that most of the products resulting from tce reacting with iron are ethane and c2 c6 hydrocarbons orth and gillham 1995 the formation of these hydrocarbons as elucidated by campbell et al 1997 deng et al 1997 and schrick et al 2002 can be in a small part attributed to the reduction of aqueous co2 by metallic iron while the primary source of carbon is iron carbide as described by these authors the mechanism in the formation of hydrocarbons in metallic iron water systems is analogous to the fischer tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons specifically in fischer tropsch processes hydrocarbons are produced at high temperatures from co and h2 syngas in the presence of various metals including iron or metal oxide catalysts deng et al 1997 kaminsky et al 1986 observed that co and h2 can chemisorb on the metal surface decompose and form carbide and other reaction intermediates in other studies e g galwey 1962 it was found that carbide reacts with h2 leading to the formation of hydrocarbon gases based on this evidence deng et al 1997 proposed that in metallic iron water systems such as the one tested here the iron carbide can react by fischer tropsch analogous processes to produce the observed c2 c6 hydrocarbons 3 4 estimation of horizontal permeable reactive barrier hprb thickness to estimate the minimum thickness of the hprb d hprb needed to attenuate vapors to acceptable risk based levels the simplified equation proposed by verginelli et al 2017 can be used 7 d hprb l r ln c hprb in c target where d hprb m is the minimum thickness of the hprb c hprb in g m3 the concentration of vapors entering into the barrier c target g m3 the acceptable risk based soil gas concentration outdoor or indoor depending on the type of application and l r m the diffusive reaction length and that for a first order reaction kinetic can be estimated as follows 8 l r d hprb h k θ w hprb where k d 1 is the first order degradation rate constant θ w hprb the water filled porosity in the hprb h the dimensionless henry s law constant of the contaminant and d hprb m2 d the effective porous medium diffusion coefficient through the hprb which can be estimated by using the millington and quirk 1961 equation 9 d hprb d a θ a hprb 10 3 θ e hprb 2 where d a m2 d is the diffusion coefficients of the contaminant in air θ e hprb the effective porosity in the hprb and θ a hprb the air filled porosity in the hprb considering a diffusion coefficient of the tce in air of 0 0687 cm2 s u s epa 2015b a hprb porosity of θ e hprb 0 5 and air filled porosity of θ a hprb 0 15 zingaretti et al 2019 from eq 9 the effective diffusion coefficient of tce through the hprb is equal to 2 05 10 4 m2 h using this value and a dimensionless henry s law constant of tce of 0 403 u s epa 2015b the tce attenuation factor c c0 was calculated as a function of the first order degradation constant and the hprb thickness the obtained results are shown in fig 10 it can be observed that for the more reactive iron sample tested i e fe1 with k 0 27 d 1 a barrier with a thickness of 1 m ensures a tce attenuation of 0 001 i e a reduction of tce of 99 9 indicating that hprbs containing granular zero valent iron can represent an attractive option for the treatment of tce vapors from contaminated soils and groundwater it is worth mentioning that in this work the iron samples were subjected to a preliminary acid treatment to increase their reactivity for in situ applications it should be considered that if this pretreatment is not applied the expected degradation rate constants could be lower than the ones reported in table 4 with a consequent lower attenuation through the barrier 4 conclusions the obtained results suggest that the use of horizontal zero valent iron barriers placed in the unsaturated zone to treat volatile compounds flowing upward can represent an attractive risk management option at sites contaminated by chlorinated solvents particular attention should be paid to the type of iron to be used the specific surface area of the iron powder was indeed found to play a key role on the reduction of tce by partially saturated zero valent iron using fe1 iron powder ssa 0 69 g m2 very good performances were achieved with tce gas concentration reduction higher than 99 after 3 weeks of treatment the estimated first order degradation rate constants for this type of iron were comparable to the values obtained by other researchers in the experiments carried out in aqueous solutions for fe3 iron powder a tce gas reduction of only 34 was observed after 3 weeks of treatment this result can be attributed to the lower ssa of fe3 0 01 g m2 compared to fe1 0 69 g m2 as to the fe2 and fe4 iron samples the tce reductions observed after 3 weeks of treatment were 54 and 85 respectively the lower performances observed for fe2 and fe4 were tentatively associated to two issues first the higher ssa of these iron samples compared to fe1 can be correlated to a higher reactivity that can lead to a lower selectivity i e a tendency of the iron particles to also react with non target substances such as dissolved oxygen and water as a result the reactive lifetime of these iron particles can be shorter due to a faster iron passivation on the other hand another possible explanation of the lower fe2 and fe4 reactivity can be correlated to the controlling regime of the reaction which looks diffusion limited namely considering that the reactions occur at the iron water interface the overall reduction rate can be influenced by the diffusion rate of tce in the gas phase within the iron sample porosity the intraparticle effective diffusion of tce is indeed inversely proportional to the pore size of the sample and this can potentially explain the lower performances in terms of tce reduction observed in the tests carried out with fe2 and fe4 samples compared to the ones obtained with fe1 characterized by a higher pore size these results suggest that extensive studies should be carried out to determine the optimal zero valent iron particle microstructure for the treatment of chlorinated solvent vapors as to the technical feasibility of using zero valent iron in hprbs it was estimated that a barrier of 1 m can ensure an attenuation of tce vapor concentration of 99 9 considering the kinetic rate constants observed using fe1 furthermore the tests carried out using the iron sand mixture and under aerobic conditions exhibited tce reduction close to the ones obtained using iron only at anaerobic conditions these results are encouraging in view of the field scale application of this technique in the unsaturated zone nevertheless another issue to be further investigated in view of a field scale application concerns the installation of the horizontal barrier in the subsurface in principle considering the particle size of the iron samples the installation can be performed either by realizing a trench with traditional excavation equipment and placing the zvi directly into the trench or by high pressure zvi slurry injection in the unsaturated zone we believe that the former option could be preferable since it seems more effective in ensuring the continuity and homogeneity of the reactive zone furthermore we believe that from an economical point of view future studies are needed for better assessing the applicability of using mixtures of zvi with sand in this case the installation of the barrier by high pressure slurry injections could be unfeasible another aspect that needs to be investigated in view of an in situ application is the permeability of the reactive material especially when the hprbs are foreseen to be installed in coarse soils e g sandy soils the permeability of the barrier could indeed affect the lateral migration along the soil to hprb interface while it is not expected to have significant effects on the performance of the mitigation system it is indeed recognized that the transport of volatile compounds in the subsurface is governed by diffusion u s epa 2015a and hence the intrusion of vapors into the barrier depends on the concentration gradient and on the air filled porosity of the barrier but not on the permeability of the material however it is reasonable to expect that using fine grained reactive materials the air filled porosity could be lower than surrounding native soils leading to an accumulation of vapors at the soil to the hprb interface that can promote lateral concentration gradients to limit this

1495,chlorinated solvents are extensively used in many activities and hence in the past decades impacted a large number of sites the presence of these contaminants in groundwater is challenging particularly for the management of the vapor intrusion pathway in this work we examine the potential feasibility of using horizontal permeable reactive barriers hprbs placed in the unsaturated zone to treat chlorinated solvent vapors emitted from groundwater zero valent iron zvi powders partially saturated with water and characterized by different specific surface areas ssa were tested alone or mixed with sand in lab scale batch reactors using tce as model compound depending on the type of iron powder used a reduction of tce concentration in the vapor phase from approximately 35 up to 99 was observed after 3 weeks of treatment the best performance in terms of tce reduction was obtained using the zvi characterized by the intermediated values of the specific surface area ssa this finding which is in contrast with the results generally observed in in aqueous solutions was tentatively attributed to a non selective higher reactivity of the fine grained iron samples with water and dissolved oxygen with a consequent iron passivation or to the occurrence of a diffusion limited reaction kinetics based on the first order kinetic degradation rate constants estimated from the experimental data a horizontal barrier of 1 m containing zvi or a mixture of zvi and sand can potentially lead to an attenuation of tce vapors over 99 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords zero valent iron contaminated sites horizontal permeable reactive barrier chlorinated solvent vapors vapor intrusion 1 introduction chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene tce or tetrachloroethylene pce have been extensively used in industry and other activities e g dry cleaning all over the world as a consequence a large number of sites is now contaminated by this class of pollutants with a strong impact on groundwater quality hunkeler and aravena 2000 parker et al 2003 balderacchi et al 2014 as widely reported in the literature e g guilbeault et al 2005 rivett and feenstra 2005 at many sites these compounds persist as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls that can closely interact with low permeability deposits where they can be trapped and subsequently released into the aquifer as a result of back diffusion processes mackay and cherry 1989 chapman et al 2012 thus these deposits become a secondary source of pollution persisting for many decades or even hundreds of years chapman and parker 2005 rivett et al 2011 the persistence of these compounds can lead to the formation of huge coalescing plumes in groundwater i e diffuse pollution that can pose potential long term risks for human health of overlying residents namely due to their chemico physical and toxicological nature chlorinated solvents such as tce and pce are of concern for the vapor intrusion pathway u s epa 2015a vapor intrusion refers to the migration of toxic volatile compounds from the subsurface into overlying buildings itrc 2007 in brief the contaminants in the soil gas diffuse upward toward the foundation and ground surface as the chemical vapors approach the building foundation they are transported with the soil gas flow into the building through openings and penetrations in the foundations u s epa 2015a the management of sites associated with chlorinated solvents is challenging the traditional remediation approaches generally effective on the source of contamination may in fact result impracticable from an economical and technical viewpoint when applied to large groundwater plumes citychlor 2013 for these scenarios management strategies relying on the interruption of the vapor intrusion pathway into the building are preferable for instance the vapor intrusion can be controlled by sealing the major openings for soil gas entry or by installing vapor barriers below the building itrc 2007 u s epa 2015a alternatively systems aimed at treating the upcoming vapors can be employed for instance mahmoodlu et al 2014 2015 carried out lab scale tests aimed at evaluating the feasibility of using solid potassium permanganate to create a horizontal permeable reactive barrier hprb to treat volatile organic compounds vocs flowing upward the hprbs can be placed in the unsaturated zone overlying the source of contamination to treat chlorinated solvent vapors emitted from groundwater recently we proposed see zingaretti et al 2019 to use zero valent iron as reactive material in hprbs zero valent iron reacts with the chlorinated organic compounds through electron transfer reactions as shown below for the degradation of tce itrc 2011 1 3 fe 0 3 fe 2 6 e 2 c 2 h cl 3 3 h 6 e c 2 h 4 3 cl 3 3 fe 0 c 2 h cl 3 3 h 3 fe 2 c 2 h 4 3 cl the primary reaction mechanism generally considered for the reduction of chlorinated ethenes by zvi is the β elimination pathway roberts et al 1996 this pathway involves a two electron transfer that produces chloroacetylene intermediates which are then transformed to acetylene by hydrogenolysis and rapidly reduced to ethene and ethane campbell et al 1997 arnold and roberts 2000 a minor reaction pathway for the dechlorination process by zvi is hydrogenolysis arnold and roberts 2000 in this case less chlorinated intermediates with replacement of a halogen by hydrogen are produced and subsequently degraded campbell et al 1997 in our preliminary experiments zingaretti et al 2019 we found that zero valent iron partially saturated with water can be effective for the treatment of tce in gas phase compared to our previous work here we examine the performances of different iron powders commercially available from different manufacturers and characterized by different specific surface areas ssa furthermore we investigate the application of zvi and sand mixtures and the impact of changing the operating conditions from anaerobic to aerobic in view of simulating more closely the conditions expected in the field finally differently from our previous work here we estimate from the experimental data the degradation rate constants of tce by zvi which are then used for a preliminary but robust design of the permeable reactive barrier 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials four types of iron powders were tested named in this work as fe1 fe2 fe3 and fe4 the fe1 and fe4 samples were provided by iputec gmbh and are both characterized by a particle size lower than 63 μm i e in the range of silty to very fine sand soils according to the classification of usda united states department of agriculture based on manufacturer information fe1 contains 1 oxygen while fe4 contains 20 oxygen as iron oxides fe2o3 the fe2 sample was purchased from sigma aldrich 325 mesh 97 and is characterized by a particle size lower than 44 μm i e in the range of silty soils according to the usda classification the fe3 iron powder was provided by pometon s p a maerne italy and was obtained by water atomization sieving and an annealing processing h2 furnace to reduce the content of oxides and is characterized by a particle size lower than 425 μm i e in the range of fine to medium sandy soils according to the usda classification all the iron powders were preliminarily pretreated with hcl 0 1 m for 30 min and then rinsed with n2 purged water and dried in a n2 atmosphere as shown by other authors the acid pretreatment can lead to the cleaning of the surface by dissolution of metals and breakdown of the passivating oxide layer with a consequent increase in the density of reactive sites and of the specific surface area su and puls 1999 uludag demirer and bowers 2001 2003 tce 99 used in the experiments was purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 materials characterization the iron powders used in this study were characterized in terms of microstructure and specific surface area ssa the microstructure and chemical characteristics of the solid samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem fe sem supra 35 carl zeiss smt oberkochen germany the mineralogy of the iron samples was evaluated by x ray diffraction xrd analysis with cu kα radiation using a philips expert pro diffractometer equipped with a copper tube operated at 40 kv and 40 ma with an angular step of 0 02 held for 0 6 s with 2θ spanning from 5 to 90 the surface chemical analysis of the iron samples was carried out using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis vg excalab mkii enea c r casaccia n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were obtained at 196 c using a micromeritics asap2020 apparatus the specific surface area was calculated by the bet brunauer emmett teller method in the equilibrium pressure interval 0 01 p p 0 2 where p p is the relative pressure namely the specific surface area ssa in m2 g was calculated according to the following equation brunauer et al 1940 4 ssa 0 001 v m n a x 22 4 where vm cm3 g is the monolayer volume n the avogadro number and ax the atomic surface area of n2 0 162 nm2 at 77 k the pore size distribution was obtained from the desorption branch of the hysteresis loop using the barrett joyner halenda bjh method barrett et al 1951 and the total pore volume was calculated from the maximum adsorption point at p p 0 99 prior to the n2 adsorption the sample was degassed under vacuum at 350 c for 5 h 2 3 tce removal experiments the batch tests were carried out at room temperature 20 2 c in 20 ml transparent glass vials see fig 1 the tests were carried out using the same procedure adopted by zingaretti et al 2019 in particular each reactor was prepared by adding 1 g of zero valent iron to the vial that was then purged with n2 for few minutes to remove air and promote an anaerobic environment to ensure a moisture content of 10 by weight 100 μl of distilled water was added with a syringe to the granular iron placed in the vial 1 g it is worth mentioning that as shown in eqs 1 3 the presence of a proton donor i e water is essential for the degradation of tce by zero valent iron afterwards 5 μl of pure tce was injected with a glass syringe into the 1 ml glass tube which was previously placed on the bottom of the vial to avoid a direct contact of pure tce with zero valent iron immediately after this last step the vials were sealed with ptfe faced butyl septa and aluminum caps control tests adopting the same procedure discussed above but without adding the iron powder were also carried out in parallel to the zvi tests to assess the possible losses of tce vapors from the vial a set of tce reduction experiments was also carried out using mixtures of iron fe1 sample and laboratory sand at different ratios 50 50 by weight or 25 75 by weight in order to evaluate a possible configuration of the hprb in field applications which could reduce the installation costs furthermore to simulate the conditions expected in the unsaturated zone some tests were also carried out at aerobic conditions i e without the preliminary n2 purging in the batch using fe1 iron samples with or without sand the operating conditions employed in the different tests are summarized in table 1 for each experiment different vials were prepared to evaluate the tce removal by zero valent iron after 3 7 14 and 21 days as described earlier for each time interval control experiments were also performed without zero valent iron to evaluate the losses of tce vapors from the vials during the experiments all the experiments were carried out in triplicate the tce concentration was measured in the headspace of the vials by gas chromatography gc with a flame ionization detector fid the headspace gas 250 μl was injected with an auto sampler aoc 5000 plus using a split ratio of 1 10 into a shimadzu gc gc qp2010se equipped with a column equity 5 30 m 0 25 mm id x 0 25 μm film thickness helium 0 9 ml min was used as carrier gas the oven temperature was programmed starting from 40 c for 2 min and then ramped to 150 c at 8 c min that was maintained for other 2 min using the same gc fid settings the identification of tce degradation byproducts was performed by carrying out gc ms analysis on selected samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface specific area microstructure and mineralogical phases fig 2 shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the specimen and the corresponding pore size distribution curves the textural properties of the different samples are reported in table 2 for the fe3 sample the n2 physisorption amount was below the minimum measurable value of the instrument and thus it was not possible to provide a numerical value for the specific surface area detection limit around 0 01 m2 g the shape of the isotherms of the other samples fall within the iupac international union of pure and applied chemistry classification of type ii typically obtained in case of nonporous or macro porous materials the ssa values increases in the samples order fe1 fe2 fe4 from 0 69 m2 g 3 10 m2 g up to 15 54 m2 g respectively these ssa values are consistent with other commercially available zero valent iron such as those tested by su and puls 1999 that found values in the order of 0 334 to 2 136 m2 g for hcl washed zero valent iron samples consistently the very small pore volume increases in the same order from 0 008 cm3 g 0 017 cm3 g up to 0 063 cm3 g respectively fe1 sample is almost macro porous iupac definition pore width 50 nm indeed its desorption branch perfectly follows the adsorption one with no hysteresis conversely fe2 and fe4 samples show a small hysteresis between the adsorption and desorption branch of the isotherms that can be described as a h3 type according to the iupac classification corresponding to wedge shaped pores formed by the stacking of flaky particles fe2 and fe4 samples show a bimodal pore distribution with a small fraction of pores 3 8 nm width and a large fraction in the range 10 100 nm the small pore of 3 8 nm width is evident on fe4 sample assuming a specific gravity of the samples d 7 87 cm3 g which is that of metallic iron we estimated the average particles size dbet with the formula dbet 6 d ssa it can be observed that the calculated dbet is much smaller than the nominal size provided by the manufacturers see section 2 1 and this can be attributed to the irregular shape and pronounced surface roughness and nano scale porosity of the iron samples these results are confirmed by the sem images reported in fig 3 which show the microstructure of the tested iron powders from this figure it can be noticed that the fe3 sample is characterized by the higher particle diameter i e lower ssa furthermore this figure confirms the presence of flaky particles for fe2 and fe4 samples in accordance with the bet results fig 4 shows the mineralogical phases detected by xrd analysis in the different iron samples in all samples the only crystalline phases detected by xrd analysis were metallic iron fe0 and iron oxides fe2o3 namely it can be noticed that iron oxides were mainly detected on the fe4 sample indicating that for this sample the pre treatment with 0 1 hcl was not effective to obtain a complete oxide free surface fig 5 shows the surface chemical analysis of the specimen carried out using xps the xps spectra were obtained by irradiating the samples with a beam of x rays while simultaneously measuring the kinetic energy and electrons emitted from the top of the analysed material peaks appear in the spectrum from atoms emitting electrons of a particular characteristic energy the full spectrum not reported here showed two main fe o components and minor c from the carbon tape supporting the powders and au a small gold wire to determine surface charging signals the iron orbitals 2p spectrum shows two main photoelectron peaks around 712 ev and 724 ev assigned to the electron emission from 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 core levels the 2p3 2 peak was fitted into two components at 710 ev and 714 2 ev attributed to fe2 and fe3 respectively indicating the surface passivation of the fe particles by ambient air with formation of iron oxides feo and fe2o3 and hydroxide species feooh no metallic fe was detected due to the thickness of the passivation layer and to the xps depth of analysis the o1s orbitals spectrum shows a main peak at 530 ev attributed to o2 in feo bond with a shoulder at higher binding energy due to surface hydroxyl group and h2o the hydroxyl group component was particularly evident on fe1 surface the relative amount of fe and o on the surface was calculated by integrating the core level peaks by taking into account their sensitivity factors table 3 in agreement with the xrd analysis the fe4 specimen shows the most oxidized surface 3 2 tce removal using different types of iron fig 6 shows the normalized concentration of tce in gas phase c c0 as a function of the reaction time 3 7 14 and 21 days with the different types of iron powders in particular the residual concentration of tce at each time interval was normalized with respect to the concentration of tce measured at the same time in the control test carried out without adding the iron powder to the vial in the same figure we reported the degradation tce rate constants calculated assuming a first order reaction kinetics 5 c t c ctr e kt where c t is the concentration of tce in the gas phase g m3 measured at time t ctcr the concentration of tce in the gas phase g m3 measured at the same time in the control test carried out without adding the zvi k the first order degradation rate constant d 1 and t the reaction time d the obtained results show that depending on the type of iron powder used a reduction of tce gas concentration from 34 i e normalized concentration of 0 66 see fe3 sample in fig 6c to more than 99 normalized concentration of 0 006 see fe1 sample in fig 6a was observed for treatments of 3 weeks specifically as expected the lower reduction of tce by zero valent iron was observed in the tests carried out using fe3 iron powder which as described in the previous section see table 2 is characterized by a lower ssa 0 01 m2 g and hence by a lower reactivity conversely for the other iron samples we did not find a positive correlation between the tce reduction in gas phase and the ssa namely the highest tce reduction more than 99 was observed for fe1 sample that is characterized by a ssa of 0 69 m2 g i e significantly lower than the ssa of fe4 15 54 m2 g and fe2 3 1 m2 g this finding is in contrast with the results obtained by different authors in the experiments carried out on aqueous solutions that usually found a higher iron reactivity for zvi characterized by a higher ssa e g matheson and tratnyek 1994 johnson et al 1996 wang and zhang 1997 su and puls 1999 lin and lo 2005 however as elucidated by tratnyek and johnson 2006 a higher reactivity does not necessarily improve the remediation performance indeed high reactivity correlates with low selectivity i e the tendency of iron particles to react also with non target substances such as dissolved oxygen and water tratnyek and johnson 2006 for instance some authors found that compared to micrometric zero valent iron the reactivity of zero valent iron particles in the nanometric scale could be easily weakened due to the formation of iron oxides on the particle surface that greatly affects the iron reactivity shin et al 2012 li et al 2014 as a result the lifetime of nanometric zero valent iron particles can be shorter than micrometric zero valent iron with a consequent lower remediation performance this faster iron passivation can explain the obtained results considering that fe2 and fe4 particles are characterized by higher ssa compared to fe1 see table 2 on the other hand the obtained results can be also explained by the fact that in this work the investigated reaction is between tce present in the gas phase and unsaturated zero valent iron namely considering that the reactions occur at the iron water interface the overall reaction rate can be influenced by the diffusion rate of tce vapors in the porosity of the iron sample and by the subsequent dissolution rate in the water filled porosity considering that in the different experiments the water content in the iron samples was the same 10 water by weight the limiting step of the reaction can be the diffusion rate of tce in gas phase within the iron sample porosity the intraparticle effective diffusion of tce is indeed inversely proportional to the pore size of the sample and this can explain the lower performance in terms of tce reduction observed in the tests carried out with fe2 and fe4 samples compared to the ones obtained with fe1 characterized by a higher pore size see table 2 as to the first order degradation rate constants table 4 reports a summary of the values estimated for the different experiments to compare the observed degradation rate constants with the values obtained in previous works carried in aqueous solution the first order degradation rate constants k h 1 were normalized to the specific surface area ssa m2 g the mass of zero valent iron used in the tests mzvi g and the volume of the reactor vreactor l as follows johnson et al 1996 6 k ssa v reactor ssa m zvi k the normalized degradation rate constants kssa are reported in table 4 making reference to fe1 the obtained tce degradation rate constant kssa 3 3 10 4 l m2 h compares well with the value of 3 9 10 4 l m2 h reported by johnson et al 1996 based on a literature review of experiments carried out in aqueous solution conversely the kssa derived for fe2 and fe4 characterized by a higher ssa fall below the lower range of the literature data collected by johnson et al 1996 thus supporting the hypothesis that the reaction was to some extent hindered by iron passivation or controlled by the mass transfer of tce in the gas phase within the iron sample namely it is worth noting that the ratio between the tce degradation rate constants of fe4 and fe2 samples kssafe1 kssafe4 is around 62 this values is not far from the ratio of the expected diffusion coefficients for the two iron samples which from eq 9 is equal to the inverse of the square of the pore volume of the two iron samples pvfe4 2 pvfe1 2 69 this leads to the conclusion that for the fe4 sample the reaction seems to be limited by diffusion for fe1 iron powder that as discussed in the previous section showed the best performance in terms of tce reduction in gas phase we carried out some further tests to simulate the conditions that can be employed in field applications in the unsaturated zone specifically the reduction of tce using an iron sand mixture 50 50 or 25 75 was examined furthermore to simulate the conditions expected in the unsaturated zone some tests were carried out under aerobic conditions i e no n2 purged in the batch with or without sand the results of these tests are shown in fig 7 together with the first order degradation rates estimated for each experiment the results obtained show that the performance in terms of tce reduction after 3 weeks slightly decreased from 99 when only iron was used see fig 6a to around 93 i e normalized concentration of 0 07 see fig 7a for the iron and sand mixture when the mixture was composed of 75 of sand and 25 of iron powder a noticeable reduction of the reactivity was observed with a residual normalized tce concentration after 3 weeks of 0 35 i e reduction of 65 considering that the amount of iron in these tests is largely in excess compared to the one needed to degrade the amount of the tce injected into the vial these results can be attributed to a non homogenous distribution of the water in the mixture making the reaction at the iron to water interface less effective as to the experiments performed without n2 purging of the vials see fig 7c and d we found that the tce reduction in aerobic reactors was slightly lower than in anaerobic reactors although this difference does not look statistically significant specifically in the tests with iron only the tce reduction in gas phase after 3 weeks of treatment decreased from 99 4 normalized concentration of 0 006 see fig 6a at anaerobic conditions to 98 9 normalized concentration of 0 01 see fig 7d at aerobic conditions for the 50 50 iron sand mixture the performance decreased from 92 6 normalized concentration of 0 074 see fig 7a at anaerobic conditions to 92 3 normalized concentration of 0 077 see fig 7d at aerobic conditions these results can be ascribed to a reduction of the number of reactive sites in the aerobic tests due to a higher oxidation of zvi surface overall these results suggest that the use of zero valent iron with sand especially using a 50 50 mixture and the application in aerobic environments do not seem to significantly affect the performance in terms of tce reduction with respect to using iron only at anaerobic conditions this is also confirmed by the normalized first order reaction rate constants derived for the different operating conditions see kssa in table 4 which are in the range of 2 4 2 7 10 4 l m2 h i e only slightly lower than the degradation rate of 3 3 10 4 l m2 h obtained in the anaerobic reactor using only fe1 iron powder in this view the application of zero valent iron in sand mixtures can be of particular interest for in situ applications for two main reasons the first is that using sand can noticeably reduce the costs of hprb material furthermore the mixture of iron with sand can ensure a higher permeability of the barrier compared to the use of iron only thus potentially limiting possible lateral preferential pathways for application in the unsaturated soils characterized by high permeabilities 3 3 byproducts and degradation pathway fig 8 shows the gc fid chromatograms obtained in one set of experiments at 3 days and 21 days during the reduction of tce by zero valent iron the chromatogram obtained in one of the control tests carried out without the addition of the iron powder is also reported as reference similar profiles were obtained also for the other tests carried out data not shown for sake of conciseness the chromatograms illustrate the transformation of tce to reaction byproducts specifically it can be observed that in the control test the only peak detectable was the one corresponding to tce for the other tests the appearance of several peaks at lower retention times are progressively detected with a corresponding decrease of the tce peak these peaks were identified by gc ms in selective ion monitoring mode as c3 c4 hydrocarbons and to a lower extent c5 c6 hydrocarbons the identification of these peaks is shown in fig 9 specifically as shown in detail in fig 9 in the c3 c4 region the peaks were identified as methylacetylene 2 methyl propene and 1 butene the c5 region peaks were identified as 2 methyl butane 3 methyl 1 butanol 1 pentanol 2 methyl 2 butene and cyclopropane finally the c6 region peaks were identified as 3 methylene pentane 2 ethyl 1 butene 3 methyl pentane 1 hexene 3 methyl 1 pentene and 3 hexene it is worth noting that an identification of these byproducts with a good level of confidence was not possible due to the weak peak intensity and the low resolution of overlapping peaks these results highlight that β elimination was the main degradation pathway in agreement with the previous findings of campbell et al 1997 and zingaretti et al 2019 as discussed earlier the β elimination pathway produces chloroacetylene intermediates which are unstable and rapidly reduced to ethene campbell et al 1997 the other possible pathway is the hydrogenolysis that is however a slower reaction during which less chlorinated intermediates are produced and subsequently degraded arnold and roberts 2000 the conclusion that in this case we assume β elimination as the main degradation pathway is based on the fact that most of the products resulting from tce reacting with iron are ethane and c2 c6 hydrocarbons orth and gillham 1995 the formation of these hydrocarbons as elucidated by campbell et al 1997 deng et al 1997 and schrick et al 2002 can be in a small part attributed to the reduction of aqueous co2 by metallic iron while the primary source of carbon is iron carbide as described by these authors the mechanism in the formation of hydrocarbons in metallic iron water systems is analogous to the fischer tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons specifically in fischer tropsch processes hydrocarbons are produced at high temperatures from co and h2 syngas in the presence of various metals including iron or metal oxide catalysts deng et al 1997 kaminsky et al 1986 observed that co and h2 can chemisorb on the metal surface decompose and form carbide and other reaction intermediates in other studies e g galwey 1962 it was found that carbide reacts with h2 leading to the formation of hydrocarbon gases based on this evidence deng et al 1997 proposed that in metallic iron water systems such as the one tested here the iron carbide can react by fischer tropsch analogous processes to produce the observed c2 c6 hydrocarbons 3 4 estimation of horizontal permeable reactive barrier hprb thickness to estimate the minimum thickness of the hprb d hprb needed to attenuate vapors to acceptable risk based levels the simplified equation proposed by verginelli et al 2017 can be used 7 d hprb l r ln c hprb in c target where d hprb m is the minimum thickness of the hprb c hprb in g m3 the concentration of vapors entering into the barrier c target g m3 the acceptable risk based soil gas concentration outdoor or indoor depending on the type of application and l r m the diffusive reaction length and that for a first order reaction kinetic can be estimated as follows 8 l r d hprb h k θ w hprb where k d 1 is the first order degradation rate constant θ w hprb the water filled porosity in the hprb h the dimensionless henry s law constant of the contaminant and d hprb m2 d the effective porous medium diffusion coefficient through the hprb which can be estimated by using the millington and quirk 1961 equation 9 d hprb d a θ a hprb 10 3 θ e hprb 2 where d a m2 d is the diffusion coefficients of the contaminant in air θ e hprb the effective porosity in the hprb and θ a hprb the air filled porosity in the hprb considering a diffusion coefficient of the tce in air of 0 0687 cm2 s u s epa 2015b a hprb porosity of θ e hprb 0 5 and air filled porosity of θ a hprb 0 15 zingaretti et al 2019 from eq 9 the effective diffusion coefficient of tce through the hprb is equal to 2 05 10 4 m2 h using this value and a dimensionless henry s law constant of tce of 0 403 u s epa 2015b the tce attenuation factor c c0 was calculated as a function of the first order degradation constant and the hprb thickness the obtained results are shown in fig 10 it can be observed that for the more reactive iron sample tested i e fe1 with k 0 27 d 1 a barrier with a thickness of 1 m ensures a tce attenuation of 0 001 i e a reduction of tce of 99 9 indicating that hprbs containing granular zero valent iron can represent an attractive option for the treatment of tce vapors from contaminated soils and groundwater it is worth mentioning that in this work the iron samples were subjected to a preliminary acid treatment to increase their reactivity for in situ applications it should be considered that if this pretreatment is not applied the expected degradation rate constants could be lower than the ones reported in table 4 with a consequent lower attenuation through the barrier 4 conclusions the obtained results suggest that the use of horizontal zero valent iron barriers placed in the unsaturated zone to treat volatile compounds flowing upward can represent an attractive risk management option at sites contaminated by chlorinated solvents particular attention should be paid to the type of iron to be used the specific surface area of the iron powder was indeed found to play a key role on the reduction of tce by partially saturated zero valent iron using fe1 iron powder ssa 0 69 g m2 very good performances were achieved with tce gas concentration reduction higher than 99 after 3 weeks of treatment the estimated first order degradation rate constants for this type of iron were comparable to the values obtained by other researchers in the experiments carried out in aqueous solutions for fe3 iron powder a tce gas reduction of only 34 was observed after 3 weeks of treatment this result can be attributed to the lower ssa of fe3 0 01 g m2 compared to fe1 0 69 g m2 as to the fe2 and fe4 iron samples the tce reductions observed after 3 weeks of treatment were 54 and 85 respectively the lower performances observed for fe2 and fe4 were tentatively associated to two issues first the higher ssa of these iron samples compared to fe1 can be correlated to a higher reactivity that can lead to a lower selectivity i e a tendency of the iron particles to also react with non target substances such as dissolved oxygen and water as a result the reactive lifetime of these iron particles can be shorter due to a faster iron passivation on the other hand another possible explanation of the lower fe2 and fe4 reactivity can be correlated to the controlling regime of the reaction which looks diffusion limited namely considering that the reactions occur at the iron water interface the overall reduction rate can be influenced by the diffusion rate of tce in the gas phase within the iron sample porosity the intraparticle effective diffusion of tce is indeed inversely proportional to the pore size of the sample and this can potentially explain the lower performances in terms of tce reduction observed in the tests carried out with fe2 and fe4 samples compared to the ones obtained with fe1 characterized by a higher pore size these results suggest that extensive studies should be carried out to determine the optimal zero valent iron particle microstructure for the treatment of chlorinated solvent vapors as to the technical feasibility of using zero valent iron in hprbs it was estimated that a barrier of 1 m can ensure an attenuation of tce vapor concentration of 99 9 considering the kinetic rate constants observed using fe1 furthermore the tests carried out using the iron sand mixture and under aerobic conditions exhibited tce reduction close to the ones obtained using iron only at anaerobic conditions these results are encouraging in view of the field scale application of this technique in the unsaturated zone nevertheless another issue to be further investigated in view of a field scale application concerns the installation of the horizontal barrier in the subsurface in principle considering the particle size of the iron samples the installation can be performed either by realizing a trench with traditional excavation equipment and placing the zvi directly into the trench or by high pressure zvi slurry injection in the unsaturated zone we believe that the former option could be preferable since it seems more effective in ensuring the continuity and homogeneity of the reactive zone furthermore we believe that from an economical point of view future studies are needed for better assessing the applicability of using mixtures of zvi with sand in this case the installation of the barrier by high pressure slurry injections could be unfeasible another aspect that needs to be investigated in view of an in situ application is the permeability of the reactive material especially when the hprbs are foreseen to be installed in coarse soils e g sandy soils the permeability of the barrier could indeed affect the lateral migration along the soil to hprb interface while it is not expected to have significant effects on the performance of the mitigation system it is indeed recognized that the transport of volatile compounds in the subsurface is governed by diffusion u s epa 2015a and hence the intrusion of vapors into the barrier depends on the concentration gradient and on the air filled porosity of the barrier but not on the permeability of the material however it is reasonable to expect that using fine grained reactive materials the air filled porosity could be lower than surrounding native soils leading to an accumulation of vapors at the soil to the hprb interface that can promote lateral concentration gradients to limit this lateral by pass a barrier wider than the source footprint could be foreseen alternatively using a mixture of sand and zvi could ensure a higher air filled porosity of the reactive material compared to of zvi powders alone declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

stochastic simulation statistic method 1 introduction groundwater contaminant source characterization gcsc refers to the characterization of the number location and release history of contaminant sources according to limited on site monitoring data and supplementary information jin et al 2009 amirabdollahian and datta 2013 shi et al 2014a srivastava and singh 2015 which can be determined by solving a groundwater contaminant transport simulation model mahar and datta 2001 jha and datta 2014 gcsc plays an important role in remediation strategy design contaminant responsibility confirmation

statistic ss method is very popular haario et al 2006 laloy and vrugt 2012 laloy et al 2013 based on ss methods a heuristic search strategy was first proposed in this study taking full advantage of the guidance and correction function of groundwater monitoring data groundwater level and contaminant concentration monitoring data wang and jin 2013 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 a heuristic search iterative process considering both search ergodicity and efficiency was designed and each round of iteration included determination of candidate point and state transition the starting point of the first round of iteration the whole process was determined on the basis of field investigation data analysis and specialty knowledge the starting point of subsequent iterations was determined by the judging criterion of state transition repetitive invocation of the numerical simulation model results in huge computational load while evaluating the likelihood luo et al 2013 luo and lu 2014 zhao et al 2016 this can be alleviated by use of surrogate system smith et al 2010 hou et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 the kernel extreme learning machine kelm surrogate system has been proposed recently hou and lu 2018 however the fitting ability and applicability of a single kelm surrogate system often varies from one problem to another and different single kelm surrogate system has different approximation accuracy to the numerical simulation model in order to take advantage of the merit and makes up for the shortcoming of each single kernel function we first presented a multi kernel extreme learning machine mk elm surrogate system in this paper this research is important because the mk elm surrogate system was not proposed before in gcsc issues and it also improved the approximation accuracy of the surrogate system to the simulation model the accuracy of surrogate system is of great significance to identification of unknown variables razavi et al 2012 chakraborty et al 2017 gong and duan 2017 parussini et al 2017 generally accuracy of surrogate system is greatly influenced by the training samples recently self adaptive sampling method attracted much interest and was proved to be more efficient than one time sampling pan et al 2010 xu et al 2012a guénot et al 2013 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 however limited research was carried out on adaptive sampling method for gcsc issues so far thus this research is important and we first propose the use of adaptive sampling in s s methods we insert the self adaptive feedback correction step to ameliorate the training samples of the surrogate system in the posterior region thus the surrogate system will be continuously updated and the accuracy of the simultaneous identification results will be improved there were several stages in this study beginning with stage 1 the establishment of mk elm surrogate system for the numerical simulation model in stage 2 the state evaluation function was built based on bayesian formula and mk elm surrogate system and in stage 3 the multi vector and variable step size random walk mvrw method was used to select the candidate point in stage 4 the calculated result of the metropolis formula based on the state evaluation function was used as the criterion to determine state transition in stage 5 a self adaptive feedback correction step was inserted into the heuristic search iteration process to refine the surrogate system and finally in stage 6 a statistical analysis of the latest iterations of the heuristic search iterative process was conducted for the point and interval estimation of unknown variables 2 methodology 2 1 the simulation model the equation governing steady state saturated subsurface groundwater flow in a two

solution in the modflow and mt3dms numerical models 2 2 the mk elm surrogate system the elm was proposed as a feed forward neural network with a single hidden layer based on the moore penrose generalized inverse matrix theory it can determine the weighted output of the network after further calculation which greatly improves the learning speed and network generalization ability although the generalization ability is sometimes not stable shi et al 2014b chen et al 2014 basic components of elm are shown in fig 1 here x is the input data from the input layer a i is input weight of the ith hidden node b i is bias of the ith hidden node β i is the output weight of the ith hidden node see fig 1 the output function from the output layer f l x is as follows 4 f l x i 1 l β i g i x where g i x is the output function of the ith hidden node based on elm kelm introduces a kernel function into the training of the elm and replaces the traditional random map in the elm with a kernel map to produce a more stable output thus its classification and fitting ability are better than the non kernel elm method the fundamental theory of kelm is as follows given n training samples x j t j j 1 2 n original optimization problem of kelm is expressed as follows 5 min 1 2 β 2 c 2 j 1 n ξ j 2 subject to h x j t β t j ξ j where β β 1 β k t is a vector in feature space c is regularization parameter

polynomial kernel functionk 1 x y 1 x t y d the gaussian kernel functionk 2 x y exp x y 2 σ 2 the linear kernel functionk 3 x y x t y and the laplace kernel functionk 4 x y exp x y p the kernel function of mk elm surrogate system was a linear combination of above four kernel functions 2 3 state evaluation function the product of prior probability and likelihood was taken as the state evaluation function in this study and was to quantify the approximation degree of the unknown variable values in the current state to the true values the bayesian formula is used to infer the parameters x via noisy and indirect measurements y under certain experiential conditions s this was expressed as follows 12 p x y s p x s p y x s p y s where x x 1 x 2 x n are unknown variables for the gcsc problem y is the actual contaminant concentration monitoring data s is the sampling location design p x y s is the posterior probability p x s is the prior probability p y x s is the likelihood p y s p x s p y x s dxcan be regarded as a normalizing constant since the prior probability p x s is independent of the sampling location design s p x s p x the numerator term p x p y x s is regarded as the state evaluation functionη x η x p x p y x s the prior probability as well as the joint prior probability of unknown variables can be determined according to their physical meanings and inherent attributes the likelihood reflects the difference between the output response value and the actual monitoring value after inputting the unknown variables under the current state into the simulation model in this study it was assumed that the observation errorεof the contamination concentration monitoring data obeyed a normal distributionε n μ σ 2 the specific expression of likelihood can be written as follows 13 p y x s 1 2 π n 2 σ 1 2 exp 1 2 y i x y i 2 σ 1 wherey i x is the contaminant concentration output of the simulation model y i is the actual contaminant concentration obtained from monitoring data and n is the number of groundwater contaminant concentration monitoring data 2 4 multi vector and variable step size random walk method the mvrw method was applied to determine the candidate point of each round of iteration first multiple random vectors were produced to obtain multiple alternative candidate points then the state evaluation function was applied to select the best candidate point the size of the random walk step was constantly adjusted during the heuristic iteration process the step size was large in the early stage to enhance the global search and improve the search ergodicity while it was small in the later stage to enhance the local search and enable a rapid convergence to the posterior distribution of unknown variables for the detailed operating steps see section 2 5 2 5 metropolis formula based on the state evaluation function the state evaluation function was implanted into the metropolis formula and the calculated result was used as the judging criterion of the state transition the heuristic information in the state evaluation function provided guidance for the search path to the target state by adjusting the direction of state transition the value of the controlling parameter in the metropolis formula constantly changed during the heuristic iterative process helping the search for a balance between ergodicity and efficiency the heuristic information included the actual monitoring data and supplementary information the field investigation data analysis and specialist knowledge the metropolis formula was calculated in each round of heuristic iteration if the state transition condition was satisfied the candidate point was used as the starting point for the next iteration otherwise the starting point of this iteration was used as the starting point of the next iteration the basic operation of the mvrw methodology and the application of the metropolis formula can be summarized as follows step 1 set the initial valuet 1 the current valuet l and the final value t f of the controlling parameter t l frepresents the numeral numbering the reduction factor isβ t l βt l 1 set the initial value of the

feedback correction step in this study we adopted a self adaptive feedback correction step that was inserted into the heuristic search iterative process to ameliorate the training samples of the surrogate systems in the posterior region thus the surrogate system was updated continuously and the accuracy of the simultaneous identification results was improved in the heuristic search iteration process a statistical analysis of the latest several iterations of variables was undertaken every certain number of iterations so that the values of the unknown variables are updated as a consequence the value ranges of unknown variables were updated and the training and testing samples of the surrogate systems were updated after that the updated surrogate systems were then used to continue the heuristic search iterative process the correction of unknown variable values acts on the correction of the surrogate systems in turn the correction of the surrogate systems can further improve the subsequent iterative updating of unknown variable values in this way the correction of unknown variable values and the surrogate systems promoted each other using the heuristic search iteration process the iteration stopped when the termination condition was satisfied and all unknown variables were finally identified the whole heuristic search iterative process in this study is briefly shown in the flowchart in fig 2 3 case study 3 1 site overview a hypothetical heterogeneous and isotropic phreatic aquifer was chosen for use in our case study as shown in fig 3 the flow domain was discretized into 9276 grid blocks ad and bc boundaries were first type boundaries and the others were no flux boundaries there were six different hydraulic parameter zones in the aquifer and the groundwater flow direction was from southeast to northwest there was one contaminant source and five sampling locations in the aquifer the entire simulation time was three years 36 months which was divided into six equal stress periods the contaminant source was assumed to release contaminants with different intensities during six stress periods and the concentrations at five sampling locations were gathered at the end of each stress period in this case unknown variables for simultaneous identification were hydraulic conductivity in zones 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 contaminant source release intensities in sp1 sp2 sp3 sp4 sp5 and sp6 their true values were given in table 1 other parameters were assumed to be known table 2 based on above true values of unknown variables and other parameters the numerical simulation model was operated to attain output values of contaminant concentration at five sampling locations in six stress periods which served as the accurate monitoring data fig 4 because the observation errorεof the contamination concentration monitoring data was considered during the likelihood calculation εwas attached to the accurate monitoring data in fig 4 as actual monitoring data to simulate the practical conditions for subsequent simultaneous identification 3 2 application of mk elm surrogate system according to the unknown variables listed in section 3 1 the input vector of surrogate system for each sampling location is 12 dimensional outputs of surrogate system are contaminant concentrations at five sampling locations at the end of six stress periods value ranges of unknown variables at the beginning were estimated according to field investigation data analysis and specialist knowledge value ranges were constantly updated during the heuristic search iterative process next the cross validation method was used to establish mk elm surrogate system first of all 500 samples were divided into two parts 350 training samples and 150 testing samples the input variables of samples were obtained by latin hypercube sampling method in their feasible regions the corresponding contaminant concentrations outputs were obtained by running the numerical simulation model and 500 input output samples were obtained in total then 350 training samples were used to establish mk elm surrogate system for five sampling locations and five surrogate systems were established the parameters for the kernel functions were set in advance asd 2 σ 2 20 p 5 lanckriet et al 2004 for the linear combination of four kernel functions ω j 1 4 θ j k j explained in section 2 2 all kernels were regularized and the unit matrix was obtained by replacing k j m n with k j m n k j m m k j n n the mk elm surrogate system was built on matlab platform the procedure code was shown in section 2 2 and the weights of individual kernel functions were obtained we used the 150 testing samples to test the surrogate system and weights after that we scrambled the 500 samples reselected 350 training samples and 150 testing samples continued to train and test the surrogate system we conducted ten rounds of cross validation in total relative errors between contaminant concentrations obtained by numerical simulation model and surrogate system were calculated finally we chose the surrogate system and weights with the minimum relative errors 3 3 application of the state evaluation function 3 3 1 prior information first according to the field investigation data analysis and specialist knowledge the values of the unknown variables and their prior distributions were estimated preliminarily the preliminary estimation was used for the determination of the starting point of the whole heuristic search iterative process because all unknown variables were independent of each other the joint prior distribution was a continuous multiplication of the prior distributions of all unknown variables the prior information of 12 unknown variables is shown in table 3 3 3 2 likelihood function to reduce the huge computational burden of the heuristic iterative process and retain the calculation accuracy we used the mk elm surrogate system instead of the simulation model to calculate the output response value for the likelihood in our case the observation error ε n 0 0 052 and the specific expression of likelihood was 16 p y x s 1 2 π n 2 σ 1 2 exp 1 2 i 1 b j 1 a y i j x y i j 2 σ 1 where the sampling location number b 5 the stress period number a 6 σ 0 05 and y i j x is the contaminant concentration output of mk elm surrogate system at the ith sampling location in the jth stress period y i j is the corresponding actual contaminant concentration monitoring data 3 4 the heuristic search iterative process and self adaptive feedback correction step a heuristic search iterative process was designed which took full advantage of the guidance and correction function of actual monitoring data the process took both search ergodicity and efficiency into consideration each round of iteration included the determination of the candidate point and the state transition the starting point preliminary estimations of unknown variables of the first round of iteration the whole process was determined according to supplementary information field investigation data analysis and specialist knowledge the starting point of subsequent iterations was determined by the assessment of the state transition the candidate point was selected by the mvrw methodology and the criterion used to assess the state transition was the calculated result of the metropolis formula as the iteration progressed a statistical analysis of the latest several iterations of variables was made every 3000 iterations enabling the unknown variable values to be updated consequently the value ranges of the unknown variables were updated and the training samples together with the testing samples for the surrogate systems were updated after that the updated surrogate systems were then used to continue the heuristic search iterative process the iterations topped when the termination condition was satisfied and the simultaneous identification results were finally obtained the heuristic search iterative process started from the initial state preliminary estimations of unknown variables and finally reached the target state true values of unknown variables through the heuristic search path 4 results and discussions 4 1 performance of the mk elm surrogate system ten rounds of cross validation were conducted in total relative errors between contaminant concentrations obtained by numerical simulation model and surrogate systems were calculated finally we chose the surrogate system and weights with the minimum relative errors here are the final selected trained and tested surrogate systems for each sampling location the kernel function of mk elm was a linear combination of four individual kernel functions weights of individuals were shown in table 4 four single kelm surrogate systems based on four single kernel functions were built and compared with mk elm surrogate system table 5 performance of mk elm surrogate systems was shown in table 6 using different indexes compared with other single kelms mk elm has the highest accuracy as shown in table 6 mk elm performed well in all indexes taking sampling location 1 as an example the maximum relative error absolute value of mk elm was 5 52 the certainty coefficient was 0 995 and mean relative error was only 2 41 thus the mk elm surrogate system was able to replace the simulation model for simultaneous identification 4 2 analysis of the identification results the total heuristic search iteration number in this paper was set to 30 000 as a consequence the numerical simulation model was repeatedly invoked 30 000 times to calculate the likelihood during the iterative process which resulted in a large computational workload running the simulation model cost 20s of central processing unit cpu time whereas operating the mk elm surrogate system only cost 0 5 s during the heuristic search iterative process a statistical analysis of the latest several iterations of the variables was made every 3000 iterations so that ranges of unknown variable values were updated consequently the training samples were updated together with the testing samples for surrogate systems the updated surrogate systems were then used to continue the heuristic search iterative process the training samples were updated nine times therefore there were a total of nine corrections the last 1000 iterations of each unknown variable in nine corrections were recorded to verify the validity of the self adaptive feedback correction we took the mean of the last 1000 values as point estimation for variable value in nine corrections relative errors between point estimations and true values were calculated the mean relative errors of all unknown variables gradually diminished in nine corrections fig 5 the ninth correction was illustrated here as an example table 7 as the ninth correction has the minimum relative error the final 1000 values in the ninth correction was used as a final sample for identification above variation of relative error indicated that the self adaptive feedback correction improved the identification accuracy in addition in order to compare the influence of self adaptive sampling method with one time sampling method on identification accuracy we also implemented a one time heuristic search iterative process of 30 000 iterations without self adaptive feedback correction the last 1000 values of the one time iterative process were regarded as a sample for identification of 12 variables the mean of 1000 values was regarded as point estimations mean relative errors between point estimations and true values of 12 variables were compared using different sampling methods table 7 as shown in table 7 the identification accuracy of 12 variables was improved by using the self adaptive sampling method there were three parts to the identification results nonparametric hypothesis testing for the type of posterior distribution estimations of parameters in posterior distribution and statistical analysis of values of 12 variables because the prior distribution was gaussian distribution we first determined whether the posterior distribution was gaussian distribution according to the ks test in spss software at the 0 05 significance level 12 variables all obeyed gaussian distribution based on the final 1000 values in the ninth correction since the types of posterior distribution were ascertained the parameter estimations in gaussian distribution included point and interval estimations for mean μ and variance σ 2 of 12 variables the mean x and variance s 2 of 1000 values could be regarded as μ and σ 2 in gaussian distribution according to maximum likelihood estimation method point estimations for μ and σ 2 in gaussian distribution were shown in table 8 different confidence intervals of μ and σ 2 at different confidence levels were calculated for interval estimations table 9 a statistical analysis based on the last 1000 values in the ninth correction was conducted to determine values of 12 variables the histograms were shown in fig 6 which clearly indicated interval estimations for values of 12 variables the posterior probability density function ppdf curves were also shown 4 3 influence of the observation error groundwater contaminant source characterization is essentially an inverse problem of a mathematical equation in which the outputs of the system are known and the inputs are unknown therefore as the output of the system the groundwater contaminant concentration monitoring data is quite significant there are always observation errors noise in groundwater contaminant concentration monitoring data in practical gcsc issues previous studies have shown that the identification results are highly sensitive to observation error therefore the gcsc issues require the monitoring data to be very accurate the identification results of the unknown variables are expected to be more accurate after denoising the groundwater contaminant concentration monitoring data future studies will concentrate on effective denoising methods for the monitoring data to improve the accuracy of identification results 5 conclusions this paper developed a heuristic search strategy based on the stochastic simulation statistic method for groundwater contaminant source characterization with simulation model parameter estimation compared with the single kelm the mk elm is more flexible for large amounts of data an mk elm surrogate system was therefore constructed to increase the approximation accuracy of the surrogate system to the simulation model a heuristic search iterative process was designed for groundwater contaminant source characterization with simulation model parameter estimation the mvrw method was used to determine the candidate point and the calculated result of the metropolis formula was used as the judging criterion to assess state transition furthermore a self adaptive feedback correction step was incorporated into the heuristic search iterative process to refine the surrogate systems and improve the accuracy of simultaneous identification results the results were obtained when the iteration terminated a numerical hypothesis case was used to test the applicability of our heuristic search strategy it was found that the heuristic search strategy assisted in simultaneously characterizing the groundwater contaminant source and estimating the simulation model parameters with high levels of accuracy and efficiency data

solution in the modflow and mt3dms numerical models 2 2 the mk elm surrogate system the elm was proposed as a feed forward neural network with a single hidden layer based on the moore penrose generalized inverse matrix theory it can determine the weighted output of the network after further calculation which greatly improves the learning speed and network generalization ability although the generalization ability is sometimes not stable shi et al 2014b chen et al 2014 basic components of elm are shown in fig 1 here x is the input data from the input layer a i is input weight of the

g i x is the output function of the ith hidden node based on elm kelm introduces a kernel function into the training of the elm and replaces the traditional random map in the elm with a kernel map to produce a more stable output thus its classification and fitting ability are better than the non kernel elm method the fundamental theory of kelm is as follows given n training samples x j t j j 1 2 n

polynomial kernel functionk 1 x y 1 x t y d the gaussian kernel functionk 2 x y exp x y 2 σ 2 the linear kernel functionk 3 x y x t y and the laplace kernel functionk 4 x y exp x y p the kernel function of mk elm surrogate system was a linear combination of above four kernel functions 2 3 state evaluation function the product of prior probability and likelihood was taken as the state evaluation function in this study and was to quantify the approximation degree of the unknown variable values in the current state to the true values the bayesian formula is used to infer the parameters x via noisy and indirect measurements y under certain experiential conditions s this was expressed as follows 12 p x y s p x s p y x s p y s where x x 1 x 2 x n are unknown variables for the gcsc problem y is the actual contaminant concentration monitoring data s is the sampling location design p x y s is the posterior probability p x s is the prior probability p y x s is the likelihood p y s p x s p y x s dxcan be regarded as a normalizing constant since the prior probability p x s is independent of the sampling location design s p x s p x the numerator term p x p y x s is regarded as the state evaluation functionη x η x p x p y x s the prior probability as well as the joint prior probability of unknown variables can be determined according to their physical meanings and inherent attributes the likelihood reflects the difference between the output response value and the actual monitoring value after inputting the unknown variables under the current state into the simulation model in this study it was assumed that the observation errorεof the contamination concentration monitoring data obeyed a normal distributionε n μ σ 2 the specific expression of likelihood can be written as follows 13 p y x s 1 2 π n 2 σ 1 2 exp 1 2 y i x y i 2 σ 1 wherey i x is the contaminant concentration output of the simulation model y i is the actual contaminant concentration obtained from monitoring data and n is the number of groundwater contaminant concentration monitoring data 2 4 multi vector and variable step size random walk method the mvrw method was applied to determine the candidate point of each round of iteration first multiple random vectors were produced to obtain multiple alternative candidate points then the state evaluation function was applied to select the best candidate point the size of the random walk step was constantly adjusted during the heuristic iteration process the step size was large in the early stage to enhance the global search and improve the search ergodicity while it was small in the later stage to enhance the local search and enable a rapid convergence to the posterior distribution of unknown variables for the detailed operating steps see section 2 5 2 5 metropolis formula based on the state evaluation function the state evaluation function was implanted into the metropolis formula and the calculated result was used as the judging criterion of the state transition the heuristic information in the state evaluation function provided guidance for the search path to the target state by adjusting the direction of state transition the value of the controlling parameter in the metropolis formula constantly changed during the heuristic iterative process helping the search for a balance between ergodicity and efficiency the heuristic information included the actual monitoring data and supplementary information the field investigation data analysis and specialist knowledge the metropolis formula was calculated in each round of heuristic iteration if the state transition condition was satisfied the candidate point was used as the starting point for the next iteration otherwise the starting point of this iteration was used as the starting point of the next iteration the basic operation of the mvrw methodology and the application of the metropolis formula can be summarized as follows step 1 set

feedback correction step in this study we adopted a self adaptive feedback correction step that was inserted into the heuristic search iterative process to ameliorate the training samples of the surrogate systems in the posterior region thus the surrogate system was updated continuously and the accuracy of the simultaneous identification results was improved in the heuristic search iteration process a statistical analysis of the latest several iterations of variables was undertaken every certain number of iterations so that the values of the unknown variables are updated as a consequence the value ranges of unknown variables were updated and the training and testing samples of the surrogate systems were updated after that the updated surrogate systems were then used to continue the heuristic search iterative process the correction of unknown variable values acts on the correction of the surrogate systems in turn the correction of the surrogate systems can further improve the subsequent iterative updating of unknown variable values in this way the correction of unknown variable values and the surrogate systems promoted each other using the heuristic search iteration process the iteration stopped when the termination condition was satisfied and all unknown variables were finally identified the whole heuristic search iterative process in this study is briefly shown in the flowchart in fig 2 3 case study 3 1 site overview a hypothetical heterogeneous and isotropic phreatic aquifer was chosen for use in our case study as shown in fig 3 the flow domain was discretized into 9276 grid blocks ad and bc boundaries were first type boundaries and the others were no flux boundaries there were six different hydraulic parameter zones in the aquifer and the groundwater flow direction was from southeast to northwest there was one contaminant source and five sampling locations in the aquifer the entire simulation time was three years 36 months which was divided into six equal stress periods the contaminant source was assumed to release contaminants with different intensities during six stress periods and the concentrations at five sampling locations were gathered at the end of each stress period in this case unknown variables for simultaneous identification were hydraulic conductivity in zones 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 contaminant source release intensities in sp1 sp2 sp3 sp4 sp5 and sp6 their true values were given in table 1 other parameters were assumed to be known table 2 based on above true values of unknown variables and other parameters the numerical simulation model was operated to attain output values of contaminant concentration at five sampling locations in six stress periods which served as the accurate monitoring data fig 4 because the observation errorεof the contamination concentration monitoring data was considered during the likelihood calculation εwas attached to the accurate monitoring data in fig 4 as actual monitoring data to simulate the practical conditions for subsequent simultaneous identification 3 2 application of mk elm surrogate system according to the unknown variables listed in section 3 1 the input vector of surrogate system for each sampling location is 12 dimensional outputs of surrogate system are contaminant concentrations at five sampling locations at the end of six stress periods value ranges of unknown variables at the beginning were estimated according to field investigation data analysis and specialist knowledge value ranges were constantly updated during the heuristic search iterative process next the cross validation method was used to establish mk elm surrogate system first of all 500 samples were divided into two parts 350 training samples and 150 testing samples the input variables of samples were obtained by latin hypercube sampling method in their feasible regions the corresponding contaminant concentrations outputs were obtained by running the numerical simulation model and 500 input output samples were obtained in total then 350 training samples were used to establish mk elm surrogate system for five sampling locations and five surrogate systems were established the parameters for the kernel functions were set in advance asd 2 σ 2 20 p 5 lanckriet et al 2004 for the linear combination of four kernel functions ω j 1 4 θ j k j explained in section 2 2 all kernels were regularized and the unit matrix was obtained by replacing k j m n with k j m n k j m m k j n n the mk elm surrogate system was built on matlab platform the procedure code was shown in section 2 2 and the weights of individual kernel functions were obtained we used the 150 testing samples to test the surrogate system and weights after that we scrambled the 500 samples reselected 350 training samples and 150 testing samples continued to train and test the surrogate system we conducted ten rounds of cross validation in total relative errors between contaminant concentrations obtained by numerical simulation model and surrogate system were calculated finally we chose the surrogate system and weights with the minimum relative errors 3 3 application of the state evaluation function 3 3 1 prior information first according to the field investigation data analysis and specialist knowledge the values of the unknown variables and their prior distributions were estimated preliminarily the preliminary estimation was used for the determination of the starting point of the whole heuristic search iterative process because all unknown variables were independent of each other the joint prior distribution was a continuous multiplication of the prior distributions of all unknown variables the prior information of 12 unknown variables is shown in table 3 3 3 2 likelihood function to reduce the huge computational burden of the heuristic iterative process and retain the calculation accuracy we used the mk elm surrogate system instead of the simulation model to calculate the output response value for the likelihood in our case the observation error ε n 0 0 052 and the specific expression of likelihood was 16 p y x s 1 2 π n 2 σ 1 2 exp 1 2 i 1 b j 1 a y i j x y i j 2 σ 1 where the sampling location number b 5 the stress period number a 6 σ 0 05 and y i j x is the contaminant concentration output of mk elm surrogate system at the ith sampling location in the jth stress period y i j is the corresponding actual contaminant concentration monitoring data 3 4 the heuristic search iterative process and self adaptive feedback correction step a heuristic search iterative process was designed which took full advantage of the guidance and correction function of actual monitoring data the process took both search ergodicity and efficiency into consideration each round of iteration included the determination of the candidate point and the state transition the starting point preliminary estimations of unknown variables of the first round of iteration the whole process was determined according to supplementary information field investigation data analysis and specialist knowledge the starting point of subsequent iterations was determined by the assessment of the state transition the candidate point was selected by the mvrw methodology and the criterion used to assess the state transition was the calculated result of the metropolis formula as the iteration progressed a statistical analysis of the latest several iterations of variables was made every 3000 iterations enabling the unknown variable values to be updated consequently the value ranges of the unknown variables were updated and the training samples together with the testing samples for the surrogate systems were updated after that the updated surrogate systems were then used to continue the heuristic search iterative process the iterations topped when the termination condition was satisfied and the simultaneous identification results were finally obtained the heuristic search iterative process started from the initial state preliminary estimations of unknown variables and finally reached the target state true values of unknown variables through the heuristic search path 4 results and discussions 4 1 performance of the mk elm surrogate system ten rounds of cross validation were conducted in total relative errors between contaminant concentrations obtained by numerical simulation model and surrogate systems were calculated finally we chose the surrogate system and weights with the minimum relative errors here are the final selected trained and tested surrogate systems for each sampling location the kernel function of mk elm was a linear combination of four individual kernel functions weights of individuals were shown in table 4 four single kelm surrogate systems based on four single kernel functions were built and compared with mk elm surrogate system table 5 performance of mk elm surrogate systems was shown in table 6 using different indexes compared with other single kelms mk elm has the highest accuracy as shown in table 6 mk elm performed well in all indexes taking sampling location 1 as an example the maximum relative error absolute value of mk elm was 5 52 the certainty coefficient was 0 995 and mean relative error was only 2 41 thus the mk elm surrogate system was able to replace the simulation model for simultaneous identification 4 2 analysis of the identification results the total heuristic search iteration number in this paper was set to 30 000 as a consequence the numerical simulation model was repeatedly invoked 30 000 times to calculate the likelihood during the iterative process which resulted in a large computational workload running the simulation model cost 20s of central processing unit cpu time whereas operating the mk elm surrogate system only cost 0 5 s during the heuristic search iterative process a statistical analysis of the latest several iterations of the variables was made every 3000 iterations so that ranges of unknown variable values were updated consequently the training samples were updated together with the testing samples for surrogate systems the updated surrogate systems were then used to continue the heuristic search iterative process the training samples were updated nine times therefore there were a total of nine corrections the last 1000 iterations of each unknown variable in nine corrections were recorded to verify the validity of the self adaptive feedback correction we took the mean of the last 1000 values as point estimation for variable value in nine corrections relative errors between point estimations and true values were calculated the mean relative errors of all unknown variables gradually diminished in nine corrections fig 5 the ninth correction was illustrated here as an example table 7 as the ninth correction has the minimum relative error the final 1000 values in the ninth correction was used as a final sample for identification above variation of relative error indicated that the self adaptive feedback correction improved the identification accuracy in addition in order to compare the influence of self adaptive sampling method with one time sampling method on identification accuracy we also implemented a one time heuristic search iterative process of 30 000 iterations without self adaptive feedback correction the last 1000 values of the one time iterative process were regarded as a sample for identification of 12 variables the mean of 1000 values was regarded as point estimations mean relative errors between point estimations and true values of 12 variables were compared using different sampling methods table 7 as shown in table 7 the identification accuracy of 12 variables was improved by using the self adaptive sampling method there were three parts to the identification results nonparametric hypothesis testing for the type of posterior distribution estimations of parameters in posterior distribution and statistical analysis of values of 12 variables because the prior distribution was gaussian distribution we first determined whether the posterior distribution was gaussian distribution according to the ks test in spss software at the 0 05 significance level 12 variables all obeyed gaussian distribution based on the final 1000 values in the ninth correction since the types of posterior distribution were ascertained the parameter estimations in gaussian distribution included point and interval estimations for mean μ and variance σ 2 of 12 variables the mean x and variance s 2 of 1000 values could be regarded as μ and σ 2 in gaussian distribution according to maximum likelihood estimation method point estimations for μ and σ 2 in gaussian distribution were shown in table 8 different confidence intervals of μ and σ 2 at different confidence levels were calculated for interval estimations table 9 a statistical analysis based on the last 1000 values in the ninth correction was conducted to determine values of 12 variables the histograms were shown in fig 6 which clearly indicated interval estimations for values of 12 variables the posterior probability density function ppdf curves were also shown 4 3 influence of the observation error groundwater contaminant source characterization is essentially an inverse problem of a mathematical equation in which the outputs of the system are known and the inputs are unknown therefore as the output of the system the groundwater contaminant concentration monitoring data is quite significant there are always observation errors noise in groundwater contaminant concentration monitoring data in practical gcsc issues previous studies have shown that the identification results are highly sensitive to observation error therefore the gcsc issues require the monitoring data to be very accurate the identification results of the unknown variables are expected to be more accurate after denoising the groundwater contaminant concentration monitoring data future studies will concentrate on effective denoising methods for the monitoring data to improve the accuracy of identification results 5 conclusions this paper developed a heuristic search strategy based on the stochastic simulation statistic method for groundwater contaminant source characterization with simulation model parameter estimation compared with the single kelm the mk elm is more flexible for large amounts of data an mk elm surrogate system was therefore constructed to increase the approximation accuracy of the surrogate system to the simulation model a heuristic search iterative process was designed for groundwater contaminant source characterization with simulation model parameter estimation the mvrw method was used to determine the candidate point and the calculated result of the metropolis formula was used as the judging criterion to assess state transition furthermore a self adaptive feedback correction step was incorporated into the heuristic search iterative process to refine the surrogate systems and improve the accuracy of simultaneous identification results the results were obtained when the iteration terminated a numerical hypothesis case was used to test the applicability of our heuristic search strategy it was found that the heuristic search strategy assisted in simultaneously characterizing the groundwater contaminant source and estimating the simulation model parameters with high levels of accuracy and efficiency data

1497,when seawater intrudes into a subterranean estuary there is interaction between groundwater and surface water and ocean tides and waves can influence the salt concentration distribution in subsurface of the estuary however numerical simulations of seawater intrusion into a subterranean estuary often neglect the atmosphere and surface water and simply specify hydrostatic pressure and a constant seawater salt concentration this study examined the influence of fluid flow and pressure in a surface water atmosphere system consisting of both atmosphere and surface water on the salt distribution in subsurface and in the surface water by a numerical simulation that couples fluid flows in the surface water atmosphere system and groundwater this study first confirmed the precision of the simulation method by comparing experimentally determined salt concentration distributions in silica beads unsaturated with water this study then conducted an experiment in a two dimensional tank filled with seawater and glass beads mean diameter 0 2 mm and carried out two simulations of this tank experiment one of a limited system consisting of the porous medium and surface water only and the other of a full system consisting of the porous medium surface water and atmosphere darcy s law has frequently been applied in limited system simulations by assigning extremely high permeability to the surface water this study therefore also conducted a third simpler numerical simulation of the limited system that used only darcy s law the salt concentration distribution obtained by the full system simulation was closer to the experimental distribution than that obtained by the limited system simulation this result implies that fluid flow and pressure in both the atmosphere and surface water influence water flow and water pressure in the porous medium furthermore the third simulation using darcy s law only could not precisely reproduce flow in the surface water therefore when variable density flow in surface water and a shallow subsurface are numerically simulated the simulation system needs to include atmosphere and surface water to take account of the influence of fluid flow and fluid pressure in both the atmosphere and surface water on the fluid flow and transport of salt in a shallow subsurface keywords variable density flow multiphase flow navier stokes equations water saturation equation semi lagrange method asgmf 1 introduction groundwater interacts with surface water and around the groundwater surface water boundary chemicals can migrate from groundwater to surface water or from surface water to groundwater scientists and engineers in fields such as hydrogeology fluid mechanics and coastal engineering have developed many numerical methods to simulate interactions between surface water and groundwater these numerical simulation methods typically employ 1 a diffusive wave equation e g delfs et al 2013 tosaka 2002 weill et al 2011 2 shallow water equations e g discacciati et al 2002 maxwell and kollet 2008 xin et al 2010 2011 yuan et al 2011 or 3 navier stokes eqs ns equations bakhtyar et al 2011 2012 2013 maeda and sakai 2010 maeda et al 2006 onda et al 2014 to simulate surface water flow and 1 darcy s law or 2 the darcy brinkman model anderson and jackson 1967 bars and worster 2006 hill and straughan 2009 to simulate groundwater flow the groundwater formulations are then merged with those for surface water by imposing a pressure continuity across the interface and normal and tangential flow velocities or by considering the exchange of water across the groundwater surface water boundary when diffusive wave and shallow water equations are employed to simulate surface water flow darcy s law is always applied to simulate the groundwater flow however when ns equations are applied to simulate surface water flow either darcy s law or the darcy brinkman model which adds the resistance of subsurface to ns equations is used to describe groundwater flow seawater intrusion into a subterranean estuary has been simulated mostly by using variable density saturated or unsaturated flow models for groundwater coupled with a solute transport equation for saltwater e g langevin et al 2010 lin et al 2009 nishikawa et al 2009 pool and carrera 2010 webb and howard 2011 robinson et al 2007a 2007b and bakhtyar et al 2013 who conducted numerical simulations of the flow and transport of saltwater by tidal forcing have shown that the submarine groundwater discharge associated with tide induced and density driven circulation depends on tidal amplitude their findings indicate that water pressure and water flow in surface seawater surface water influences the salt concentration distribution in an onshore subsurface environment however in their simulations they assigned a high hydraulic conductivity value 106 m d to the subsurface and assumed that the seawater salt concentration was constant at 35 ppt in addition they applied darcy s law to simulate surface seawater surface water flow simplified the water flow and neglected salt transport in the seawater in reality however the salt concentration of seawater is not always constant either spatially or temporally and the variations in the salt concentration of seawater might influence the salt concentration distribution beneath the seafloor feistel et al 2016 yanagi and abe 2005 in contrast xin et al 2010 used shallow water equations to more rigorously simulate wave driven seawater flow and combined groundwater and seawater flows under high hydraulic conductivity conditions however they did not address salt transport in the seawater and they assigned salt concentrations and concentration gradients at the interface between groundwater and seawater by assuming that the direction of the salt flux was normal to the interface although yuan et al 2011 like xin et al 2010 employed shallow water equations to simulate seawater flow they used only a diffusion equation to simulate salt solute transport in the surface water without accounting for the advective transport of salt in the surface water a number of studies langevin et al 2010 lin et al 2009 nishikawa et al 2009 pool and carrera 2010 webb and howard 2011 have rigorously solved salt solute transport in groundwater by considering molecular diffusion along with tortuosity dispersion and advection furthermore recent simulations of the temporal features of seawater intrusion in response to a sea level rise have neglected marine transgression and land surface overtopping by seawater werner et al 2013 therefore free convection due to transgression and land surface overtopping associated with current rates of sea level rise requires further analysis to assess its importance relative to lateral seawater intrusion yu et al 2016 similarly a sea level fall is expected to influence both seawater transgression and its lateral intrusion into subsurface however the simulation methods described above have mostly not reproduced seawater flow and salt solute transport in surface seawater rigorously and they cannot estimate the influence of fluid flow in a surface water atmosphere system that includes both atmosphere and surface water on the salt concentration distribution in groundwater and surface seawater accordingly it is still needed to estimate how flow in a surface water atmosphere system influences seawater transgression and intrusion and the surface water salt solute concentration in other words the migration of the seawater freshwater boundary in subsurface and the overlying surface water thus this study used the atmosphere surface water groundwater multiphase flow asgmf numerical simulation method which was developed in previous work by the author and his colleagues hibi and tomigashi 2015 2018 and hibi et al 2015 first the asgmf was verified by reproducing variable density flow in a porous medium and in surface water then this study conducted experiments in a two dimensional tank filled with saltwater and glass beads mean diameter 0 2 mm and performed three different simulations to clarify how flow in the surface water atmosphere system influenced the migration of the interface between saltwater and freshwater the first simulation considered contact between the porous medium and the atmosphere whereas the second simulation assumed no contact between the porous medium and the atmosphere the third simpler numerical simulation had the same domain as the second simulation but used only darcy s law to describe flow this study then compared the simulation results with the experimental findings to evaluate how conditions in the surface water atmosphere system above the subsurface affected the migration of the seawater freshwater boundary in the surface water and porous medium 2 numerical simulation theory 2 1 coupled subsurface surface water atmosphere system fluid flows in surface water and the subsurface should be rigorously solved by applying the ns equations with a multiphase flow numerical technique and by considering water retention in the subsurface the asgmf numerical simulation method employs a one field model for multiple immiscible fluids to simulate surface water flow because the mach number of the flow simulated in this study was very small fluids in the water surface atmosphere system were treated as incompressible considering the mass conservation law and assuming fluid incompressibility ns equations are solved by a semi lagrange method with cubic interpolated propagation cip yabe et al 1991 and by the backward difference method as follows 1 δ t ρ t p t δ t ρ t g v 2 v t δ t μ t ρ t δ t 2 v t δ t v δ t ρ t p t δ t ρ t g where t is elapsed time δt is the time increment v t δt and p t δt are the velocity and the pressure of the fluid at time t δt respectively g is the gravity vector when the vertical coordinate z is positive upward μ t and ρ t are the viscosity and density respectively of the fluid at time t and v is the velocity at the position vector r i v t δt in the velocity field at time t where r i is the position vector at nodal point i and v t is velocity at time t v t δt and p t δt at each nodal point are obtained by the galerkin finite element method fem for discretization of space direct numerical simulation dns which was applied in this study requires many nodal points to fulfill the criterion of kolmogorov effect length the asgmf method was originally developed without a turbulence closure model and an extremely fine mesh was not needed to deal with large circulations and stably solve flows in the surface water atmosphere system the mean flow velocity and large circulation patterns in the surface water atmosphere system are the primary influences on the migration of salt in surface water furthermore they also influence the distribution of salt in groundwater thus employment of dns in this study is justifiable in the future it is planned to add a turbulence closure model to the asgmf method because there is a free water surface inside some of the elements of the finite element grid viscosity μ t and density ρ t are expressed in terms of the void fraction of water s w t which is the ratio of the water volume to the total fluid volume of the surface water at time t in the surface water atmosphere system 3 ρ t s w t ρ w 1 s w t ρ g 4 μ t s w t μ w 1 s w t μ g here the void fraction of water at the free water surface is 0 5 in the surface water atmosphere system the void fraction of water s w is defined as s w at the position vector r i v t δt in the s w field at time t by using s w the change of the void fraction of water at time t δt s w t δt can be represented by cip as follows when water is incompressible 5 s w t δ t s w the governing equation for fluid in the subsurface assuming that water and gas are incompressible and the subsurface does not become consolidated is obtained by substituting the darcy s law equation into the mass conservation equations for gas and water in the subsurface and then summing these mass conservation equations chavent and jaffre 1986 chen and ewing 1997 chen et al 1994 dahle et al 2002 this equation is solved by the backward difference method as follows 6 λ t k s p t δ t λ t k s p c t λ t k s f w t ρ w f g t ρ g g where k s is intrinsic permeability p t δt is

groundwater flows the water saturation equation for migration of effective water saturation in the subsurface s w t δt which is the effective water saturation at time t δt is derived by using the semi lagrange method with cip and the backward difference method for discretization of time peaceman 1977 as follows 9 s w t δ t δ t d soil t s w t δ t s w δ t where s w is effective water saturation at

system the numerical simulations reproduced the movement of saltwater which is heavier than water in surface water and groundwater accordingly this simulation method should be able to handle variable density flows in subsurface and surface waters these flows reflect the variation of seawater density as a function of the salt concentration in a solution as follows 20 ρ w ρ w freshwater c ρ w seawater ρ w freshwater c seawater where ρ w freshwater is the density of freshwater ρ w seawater is the density of seawater and c seawater is the salt concentration in the original seawater because the time increment δt used in this simulation method is very small 0 05 s variable density flows in the subsurface and surface water flow can be explicitly solved by this simulation method 2 2 situation at the boundary between the subsurface and the surface water atmosphere system the migration of water can be expressed as the change of water saturation in the subsurface and as the change of the void fraction of water in surface water both water saturation and the void fraction of water range from 0 0 to 1 0 in the whole cross section normal to fluid flow thus water saturation and the void fraction of water s w are able to preserve continuity of the water volume or water mass at the boundary between the surface water atmosphere system and the subsurface unsaturated with water when stationary water saturation is disturbed in a saturated or unsaturated subsurface as shown in fig 1 a water pressure and gas pressure become hydrostatic pressure and static pressure respectively fig 1 b in this case the global pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure at the boundary between the subsurface and the atmosphere because the subsurface is in contact with the atmosphere fig 1 d and fluid pressure should be continuous across this boundary furthermore global pressure is equal to the sum of synthetic pressure p and synthetic capillary pressure p c in the subsurface and decreases from atmospheric pressure at the boundary to p p c in the subsurface fig 1 c and e because p cgw p g po p w po and f n f n 1 eq 7 can be rearranged as follows 21 p f w p w po f g p g po p g po f w p cwg where p cgw is the capillary pressure between gas and water and p g po is gas pressure in the subsurface from eq 21 the difference between synthetic pressure p and p g po is f w p cgw thus p g po in the subsurface at the boundary between the subsurface and atmosphere should be equal to the atmospheric pressure p g su thus the unsaturated subsurface is in contact with the atmosphere global pressure including both synthetic pressure p and synthetic capillary pressure p c is effective in the subsurface including at the nodal points on the boundary because as mentioned above p g po in eq 21 is equal to p g su at this boundary and the global pressure is effective in the subsurface f w p cgw must be imposed at the nodal points on the boundary including in some elements neighboring the boundary in the subsurface fig 1 c d and e therefore p c and f w p cgw should be imposed at both the nodal points on the boundary and in the elements in the subsurface neighboring the boundary fig 1 e consequently global pressure can be expressed at the boundary between the unsaturated subsurface and atmosphere ω as follows 22a p p g su p c f w p cwg on ω vol po if s w 1 22b p p g su on ω vol su if s w 1 where vol su and vol po are the domains of the surface water atmosphere system and the subsurface respectively 2 3 numerical simulation procedure we can divide the numerical simulation procedure for the asgmf described in section 2 into four parts calculation of 1 fluid pressure surface water atmosphere system or synthetic pressure subsurface boxes 3 to 9 in fig 2 2 fluid velocity surface water atmosphere system or total velocity subsurface box 10 in fig 2 3 the void fraction of water surface water atmosphere system or water saturation subsurface boxes 11 to 15 in fig 2 and 4 salt concentration in water boxes 16 to 21 in fig 2 in part 1 the position vector r i v i t δt must first be determined at every nodal point i from the position vector r i velocity at time t and the time increment then v i is obtained by interpolation of the velocity field at time t next each of ρ i t μ i t k rw i t k rg i t λ w i t λ g i t λ i t f w i t f g i t p ci t κ i t df g ds w i dκ ds w i dp cgw ds w i and p c i is calculated at every nodal point and averaged within each element the p c values at every point in the subsurface are obtained by integrating sw p cgw df g ds w ds w using the trapezoidal rule after p cgw is calculated by eq 8 and df g ds w i is calculated at each integration point by using the water saturation at that point furthermore f w p cwg is calculated at nodal points on the boundary between the surface water atmosphere system and the subsurface then the per element average of the parameter values which was calculated above is inserted into eq 1 to obtain the fluid pressure in the surface water and atmosphere and into eq 6 to obtain that in the subsurface then those two equations are simultaneously solved to get the fluid pressure and the synthetic pressure p at every point in the analytical domain at time t δt in part 2 the fluid pressure and the synthetic pressure are inserted into eq 2 to obtain the fluid velocity in the surface water atmosphere system and into eq 12 to obtain the total velocity in the subsurface respectively then the recent fluid velocity in the surface water atmosphere system v and the total velocity in the subsurface v t at every point and time t δt are determined by solving those equations simultaneously in part 3 v soil at every nodal point in the subsurface is calculated with eq 10a from df g ds w and dκ ds w at the elapsed time t to obtain the water saturation in the medium the position vector r v t δt with respect to every point in the surface water atmosphere system and the position vector r v soil t δt with respect to every point in the subsurface are determined and then s w at the position vector r v t δt and at the position vector r v soil t δt is obtained by interpolation with cip in the water saturation field in the subsurface or the void fraction of water field in the surface water atmosphere system at time t finally the void fraction of water s w t δt at time t δt is equal to s w in eq 5 for the surface water atmosphere system and the water saturation s w t δt at time t δt in the subsurface is obtained by solving eq 9 using the values of s w calculated above and d soil t calculated by using eq 10b in part 4 water velocity in the subsurface v w t δt is calculated with eq 16a using p w which is obtained with eq 15 from the synthetic pressure p the position vector r v w t δt δt with respect to every point in the surface water and the subsurface is determined and c at the position vector r v w t δt δt is obtained by interpolation with cip in the salt concentration field in the subsurface and the surface water at time t the dispersion coefficient d ij is calculated with eq 19 at every nodal point and averaged within each element the recent salt concentration c t δt at nodal points at the elapsed time t δt is obtained by solving eq 18 using the determined values of c and d ij and recent water density ρ w t δt is calculated from the obtained value of c t δt if time t is less than the final time t max the time increment δt is added to time t and v at the next time step is computed the entire procedure is repeated until time t is greater than t max numerical simulation results and discussion this study first conducted simulations to verify that the asgmf numerical simulation method could reproduce variable density flow in a porous medium and in surface water this study conducted a simulation of variable density flow in a porous medium with transient variable flow in silica beads that included a partly water unsaturated domain and then compared the results with experimentally obtained results in addition this study carried out three numerical simulations to evaluate how contact with a surface water atmosphere system composed of atmosphere and surface water affected variable density water flows in a porous medium 2 4 simulation of salt transport in a porous medium goswami and clement 2007 filled a two dimensional plexiglas tank with a length of 53 cm a height of 30 5 cm and width of 2 7 cm with freshwater and uniform silica beads with an average diameter of 1 1 mm fig 3 during their experiment the water level in the saltwater reservoir on the left side of the tank was always controlled at z 25 5 cm above the bottom but the water level in the freshwater reservoir on the right side of the tank was varied three steady state conditions ss1 ss3 were then examined under three freshwater heads the water level in the freshwater reservoir was initially controlled at z 26 7 cm ss1 next the water level in the freshwater reservoir was lowered to 26 2 cm ss2 finally the water level in the freshwater reservoir was raised to 26 55 cm ss3 they also conducted a numerical simulation of their experiment with the seawat finite difference model this study used the asgmf numerical simulation method with the simulation domain and the boundary and initial conditions shown in fig 3 to simulate ss1 ss2 and ss3 saltwater was injected into the tank from the bottom of the saltwater reservoir by imposing a water pressure of 0 2616 kpa which was equal to the hydrostatic water pressure when the water level in the saltwater reservoir was z 25 5 cm the injected saltwater infiltrated into the silica beads or was discharged from the tank via a hole at z 25 5 to 26 0 cm on the left wall of the saltwater reservoir similarly freshwater was injected into the tank from the bottom of the freshwater reservoir by imposing a hydrostatic water pressure of 0 274 kpa ss1 0 269 kpa ss2 or 0 2724 kpa ss3 for a water level of z 26 7 cm 26 2 cm or 26 55 cm respectively freshwater that did not infiltrate into the silica beads was discharged from the tank via a hole at z 26 7 to 27 0 cm ss1 26 2 to 26 5 ss2 or 26 55 to 26 85 cm ss3 in the right wall of the freshwater reservoir in the numerical simulation the fluid and silica bead parameter values were set to those shown in table 1 which are consistent with the values used by goswami and clement 2007 in their numerical simulation in their numerical simulation goswami and clement 2007 used a salt concentration of 0 0372 mg ml thus the saltwater density was 1 026 g cm3 however these simulations used the relative salt concentration that is the concentration relative to the concentration of 0 0372 mg ml used by goswami and clement 2007 which ranged between 0 and 1 parameters of gas in the atmosphere are not used in seawat the model employed by goswami and clement 2007 for their numerical simulation whereas the asgmf numerical simulation method uses parameters for gas above the free water surface in the freshwater reservoir the finite element grid used in this simulation consisted of 12 373 nodes defining 12 060 rectangular elements in the analytical domain the analytical domain was vertically divided at 0 5 cm intervals from z 0 cm to 25 0 cm the vertical dimension of each element was 0 1 cm above z 25 0 cm in the saltwater and freshwater reservoirs the elements were finer than elsewhere with a horizontal dimension ranging from 0 063 to 0 25 cm in contrast the horizontal dimension of each element in the silica beads ranged from 0 25 to 0 5 cm the asgmf method employs cip developed by yabe et al 1991 to express the interface between freshwater and saltwater because cip can conserve the salt concentration gradient independently of the element width even over time the element width of 0 5 cm was adequate to express the interface between freshwater and saltwater in the present simulations the visually observed experimental boundary was located between the 0 1 and 0 3 relative salt concentration contours obtained by the asgmf numerical simulation method regardless of whether saltwater was intruding or regressing in their experiment goswami and clement 2007 did not measure salt concentrations thus salt concentration distributions obtained by the asgmf numerical simulation method cannot be compared with their experiment however it can be inferred that the salt concentration distribution obtained by the asgmf numerical simulation method are similar to the distribution obtained experimentally by goswami and clement 2007 because the 0 1 to 0 3 salt concentration contours in the present simulations are consistent with the experimentally observed boundaries between saltwater and freshwater thus this result shows that the asgmf numerical simulation method could reproduce transient variable density flow in the silica beads figs 4 and 5 2 5 coupled simulation of the saltwater distribution in groundwater freshwater and surface water saltwater in this section three numerical simulations are described to confirm the effects of fluid flow and fluid pressure in a surface water atmosphere system on variable density flow in the surface water and in a porous medium composed of 0 2 mm glass beads two simulations were performed with the asgmf numerical simulation method one for a limited system consisting of 0 2 mm glass beads and surface water and the other for a full system consisting of 0 2 mm glass beads surface water and atmosphere the third simulation was conducted with a numerical simulation method for variable density flow in a porous medium and applied to a limited darcy system consisting of only 0 2 mm glass beads and surface water the results of all three simulations were then compared with the results of an experiment conducted as part of this study with a two dimensional tank apparatus in the limited darcy system simulation as in robinson et al 2007a 2007b and bakhtyar et al 2013 darcy s law was applied not only to flow in the subsurface but also to the surface water flow by assigning a high permeability value to the surface water here this study applied the dtransu method which was developed by nishigaki et al 1993 and is extensively used in japan in the limited darcy system simulation the dtransu method employs darcy s law to describe variable density flow in subsurface whether saturated or unsaturated with water and a semi lagrangian method to describe saltwater transport using the dtransu method nishigaki et al 1993 accurately reproduced the experiments of hosokawa et al 1989 thereby verifying that the method could simulate variable density flow and salt transport in a porous medium the experimental apparatus used for the present experiment consisted of a tank with a length of 190 cm a height of 60 cm and a width of 13 5 cm and two bottles one for supplying freshwater and the other for supplying saltwater to the tank an acrylic board and an aluminum plate were fitted to the front and back of the tank respectively and two stainless steel nets were installed 4 cm from each end of the tank glass beads with a mean diameter of 0 2 mm range 0 177 0 250 mm and a mean density of 2 5 g cm3 were packed into the space between the two stainless steel nets freshwater was stored on the left side of the tank to the left of the stainless steel net at the left end the freshwater reservoir and saltwater was stored on the right side of the tank to the right of the stainless steel net at the right end the saltwater reservoir silicon hoses with an inner diameter of 6 mm connected the freshwater supply bottle to the freshwater reservoir and the saltwater supply bottle to the saltwater reservoir freshwater entered the freshwater reservoir from the freshwater supply bottle via a hole drilled in the left wall of the tank between z 31 0 and 32 0 cm the inflow of freshwater into the freshwater reservoir was regulated with a needle valve koyo corp needle valve vrb 10838 so that the water level in the reservoir was always at z 38 8 cm saltwater with density 1 024 g cm3 flowed into the saltwater reservoir from the saltwater supply bottle through a hole drilled in the right wall between z 20 0 and 21 0 cm and was discharged from the tank through a hole drilled in the right wall between z 35 and 36 cm the continuous inflow of saltwater prevented dilution of the salt concentration in the saltwater reservoir fig 6 at the start of the experiment the outlet and inlet valves in the walls on both sides of the tank were closed and saltwater which was colored yellow with fluorescein sodium salt uranine nacalai tesque inc was poured into the tank until the water level was z 43 cm next glass beads were packed into the tank by dropping them into the tank until they reached a height of 42 5 cm at the left stainless steel net and a height of 20 0 cm at the right stainless steel net thus the surface of the glass beads sloped with a gradient of 1 8 and the porosity of the medium calculated from the mass volume and density of the glass beads was 0 405 after the glass beads were packed into the tank the valve installed in the upper hole on the right side wall was opened and water was allowed to flow out of the tank until the water level in the tank was z 35 5 cm i e until the discharge of saltwater ceased finally the inlet valves were opened and both freshwater and saltwater began to flow into their respective reservoirs from the supply bottles the water level in the freshwater reservoir was allowed to rise to z 38 8 cm and then was kept constant at this level throughout the rest of the experiment variable density flow was observed visually by using a video camera jvckenwood inc everio gz e241 1 000 000 to 2 300 000 pixels in the video images freshwater and saltwater could be distinguished by color freshwater was colorless or the color of the glass beads gray and the saltwater was yellow although as the salt concentration decreased the shade of the yellow became lighter as a result the interface boundary between freshwater and saltwater and its migration could be identified in the video images the experiment was completed when the boundary between freshwater and saltwater no longer moved in all three simulations the same values table 2 were assigned to all parameters except that gas parameters were not used in the limited system or the limited darcy system simulations the densities of the freshwater and saltwater used in the experiment were measured with a boikosu density meter yokota keiki manufacturing co ltd range 0 995 1 050 g cm3 accuracy 0 001 g cm3 both water and air viscosity and density values were appropriate for the temperature at which the two dimensional tank experiment was conducted 17 c japan national astronomical observatory 2004 porosity of the medium was determined from the total mass and volume of the 0 2 mm glass beads packed into the two dimensional tank and the density of the beads intrinsic permeability was obtained by a water permeability test a difference in water head was maintained during this test and the van genuchten parameters residual gas saturation and water residual saturation with respect to the water retention curve were measured by the water head method longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were obtained from the results of a tracer test for salt conducted in a column filled with 0 2 mm glass beads and water during this test a solution with a salt mass concentration of 3 infiltrated into the column at various velocities these tests and measurements were conducted in author s laboratory but the results are unpublished both the limited system and full system simulations excluded the freshwater and saltwater reservoirs above their respective water levels which were held constant at 0 388 m freshwater reservoir and 0 355 m saltwater reservoir furthermore to exclude the effects of gas flow and gas pressure the limited system did not include atmosphere the upper surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads in contact with the atmosphere was specified as an impermeable boundary so that gas and water could not flow into or out of the limited system across that surface in addition in the limited system simulation the surface water was restricted to below the water level of z 0 355 m and this boundary was specified as a slippery wall therefore surface water could not flow along the boundary between the glass beads and the atmosphere and furthermore the surface water level was always constant during the simulation freshwater flowed into the freshwater reservoir from z 0 31 m to 0 32 m by the imposition of a water head of 0 397 m which is equal to the product of the water level 0 388 m in the freshwater reservoir and the density of the saltwater 1 024 g cm3 thus freshwater was able to flow into the reservoir even when the freshwater reservoir was filled with saltwater the water in the two dimensional tank was discharged from the analytical domain from z 0 345 m to 0 355 m on the right side of the saltwater reservoir where a water head of 0 355 m was imposed the upper boundaries of the freshwater and saltwater reservoirs were specified as slippery boundaries so that water flowed parallel to the water surface the left boundary of the glass beads from z 0 388 m to 0 425 m was specified as permeable to permit flow out of the analytical domain through the stainless steel net but the bottom boundary of the glass beads was specified as impermeable and the reservoir bottoms were specified as non slippery walls both the left wall of the freshwater reservoir except from z 0 310 m to 0 320 m and the right wall of the saltwater reservoir except from z 0 345 m to 0 355 m were specified as non slippery initial gas pressure was static zero at z 0 60 cm and the initial water pressure was equal to the gas pressure at the water level of 0 355 m and to the hydrostatic pressure below that water level in the limited system gas pressure was not imposed but was always variable at the upper surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads furthermore gas pressure was not considered in the limited system simulation because no gas phase existed above the surface water overlying the 0 2 mm glass beads and water pressure was variable only at the upper boundary of the surface water zone the initial salt concentration was 1 0 because in the experiment the two dimensional tank was initially filled with saltwater however above z 0 355 m the initial water pressure in the freshwater reservoir was specified as hydrostatic when the water level was 0 388 m and the initial salt concentration was specified as 0 0 thus the freshwater reservoir above z 0 355 m was initially filled with freshwater the gas pressure at the upper boundary of the freshwater reservoir was added to the initial water pressure above 0 355 m in the freshwater reservoir both the initial void fraction of water in the surface water and the initial water saturation in the glass beads below z 0 355 m were specified as 1 0 and the void fraction of water in the atmosphere was specified as 0 0 initial water saturation in the glass beads above 0 355 m was calculated by using the van genuchten model as follows fig 7 23 s w 1 1 αp cwg β γ the limited darcy system consisted of only glass beads and surface water and excluded the reservoirs at either side of the tank water pressure was imposed as hydrostatic pressure when the water level was z 0 388 m and salt concentration and water saturation were imposed as 0 0 and 1 0 respectively below z 0 388 cm water saturation was calculated with eq 23 using the gas water capillary pressure at the left boundary of the analytical domain at the right boundary water pressure was imposed as hydrostatic pressure when the water level was z 0 355 m saturation was imposed as 1 0 however a salt concentration was not imposed at this boundary the right boundary was surface water above z 0 200 m and glass beads below z 0 200 m the boundary conditions at the top of the glass beads and surface water and at the bottom of the analytical domain were the same as those of the limited system initial water pressure was specified as hydrostatic pressure when the initial water level was z 35 5 cm initial saturation was 1 0 below that water level and elsewhere it was derived by using eq 23 and the gas water capillary pressure which was equal to the difference between gas pressure i e 0 and the water pressure the dtransu method nishigaki et al 1993 cannot deal with gas pressure variation in a porous medium because the gas pressure is 0 0 everywhere and at all times and also because darcy s law and the mass conservation law are applied to describe water flow but not gas flow darcy s law was therefore applied to the surface water flow in the limited darcy system where the permeability of the surface water which must be much greater than that of the glass beads was set to 1 05 10 2 m2 hydraulic conductivity of 115 7 cm s in addition porosity in the surface water was specified as 1 0 fig 7 in the full system simulation atmosphere was added to the limited system thus the boundary and initial conditions of the reservoirs surface water and 0 2 mm glass beads except for the upper surfaces of the surface water and glass beads in the space between the stainless steel nets were the same as those in the limited system simulation in the full system simulation the upper surfaces of the surface water and glass beads in the space between the stainless steel nets in contact with the atmosphere could move and be permeable respectively the upper and side boundaries of the atmosphere in the full system were specified as non slippery walls gas pressure was imposed as 0 0 at the upper boundary of the atmosphere and was initially static within the atmosphere fig 8 the finite element grid for the limited system simulation consisted of 4214 nodes 4095 rectangular elements and some triangular elements the analytical domain for the limited darcy system simulation included 13 419 nodes and was divided into 13 248 elements and the analytical domain for the full system simulation included 15 705 nodes and 15 516 elements the elements in the limited darcy and full system domains were mostly rectangular but some were triangular the analytical domain for the full system was divided vertically at intervals of 0 25 cm to 1 0 cm the part of the analytical domain from z 0 300 m to z 0 425 m where the 0 2 mm glass beads were unsaturated with water and where freshwater flowed into the freshwater reservoir and water was discharged from the tank was more finely divided than the other parts the full system domain was divided horizontally on the left side at intervals of 0 50 cm to 1 011 cm and on the right side at intervals of 2 022 cm in contrast the limited system domain was divided vertically at intervals of 0 241 cm to 2 0 cm and horizontally at intervals of 0 50 cm to 1 999 cm the finite element grid of the limited system was also finer where the glass beads were unsaturated and around the freshwater inlet and tank outlet the finite element grid of the full system was finer than that of the limited system so that the movement of the free water surface would be rigorously reproduced in the full system simulation with atmosphere the analytical domain for the limited darcy system was divided vertically at intervals of 0 25 cm and horizontally at intervals of 2 021 cm thus the finite element grid of the limited darcy system was finer than that of the limited system but slightly coarser than that of the full system the boundaries between saltwater and freshwater in the experiment could be visually identified in the video images by color furthermore the salt concentration in the images could be qualitatively estimated from the intensity of the yellow color in the experiment the main freshwater front arrived at about x 42 cm measured from the left wall of the tank on the upper surface of the glass beads at the elapsed time of 5 h the main freshwater front obtained by the simulation with the full system moved similarly to the one in the experiment however the main freshwater front obtained by the simulation with the limited system moved faster than the one in the experiment the simulated front had moved about 15 cm beyond the experimental front at the elapsed time of 5 h thus the front configuration obtained by the limited system simulation differed from the configuration of both the experiment and the full system simulation at the elapsed time of 5 h the surface water level in the experiment was at z 36 7 cm the height above the bottom of the tank which was 1 2 cm higher than the water level of z 35 5 cm imposed in the simulations however the freshwater layer at the top of the surface water observed in the experiment was not present in the simulation results fig 9 as was the case at the elapsed time of 5 h at the elapsed time of 10 h the position of the freshwater front obtained by the simulation with the full system was similar to that in the experiment and different from that obtained by the simulation with the limited system furthermore in both the full system and limited system simulations a freshwater layer appeared at the top of the surface water in the distributions of the void fraction of water the minimum salt concentration in the surface water obtained by the full system simulation was about 0 6 at about 2 cm below the water level compared with 0 0 at the water level in the limited system simulation in this respect the limited system simulation result was similar to the experimental result however the freshwater thickness of 8 5 cm in the full system simulation was closer to the experimental thickness than the thickness in the limited system simulation in the salt concentration distribution obtained by the full system simulation a small saltwater zone with the maximum salt concentration 1 0 remained in the freshwater zone 3 to 8 cm behind the main freshwater front because this small saltwater zone was still connected to the main saltwater zone at the elapsed time of 10 h in the full system simulation the salt concentration at the top of the surface water was larger than that at about 2 cm below the water level fig 10 the difference in the position of the main freshwater front within the glass beads between the limited system simulation and the experiment became slightly smaller at elapsed times exceeding 10 h however the location and configuration of the main freshwater front within the glass beads obtained by the full system simulation continued to be similar to those of the experiment the main freshwater front in the limited system simulation always moved faster in the glass beads than it did in the full system simulation or in the experiment therefore the simulation with the full system could more accurately reproduce the movement of saltwater in the 0 2 mm glass beads than the simulation with the limited system could figs 9 12 the salt concentration became progressively more diluted with freshwater as time elapsed and at 20 h it was 0 0 in the area of the separate small saltwater zone seen at 10 h the small saltwater zone in the glass beads could also be observed by close inspection of the video image obtained at the elapsed time of 10 h in the experiment although its pale yellow color was hard to distinguish from the gray color of the surrounding freshwater at 15 and 20 h this saltwater zone could no longer be seen in the video images although it could be detected in the salt concentration distributions obtained by the full system simulation from 10 to 15 h this result that the present full system simulation but not the present limited system simulation could reproduce the small separated saltwater zone indicates that fluid pressure and flow in a surface water atmosphere system must be considered to precisely simulate the movement of salt in a porous medium that is in contact with the atmosphere the thickness of the freshwater layer at the top of the surface water obtained by the limited system simulation increased with elapsed time and was 7 5 cm at 20 h in contrast the thickness of the freshwater layer in the experiment and in the full system simulation increased to 6 8 cm and 8 5 cm respectively at 10 h and it decreased in both to 5 0 cm at 15 h then after 15 h it remained approximately steady in both at 20 h this layer was 5 9 and 5 3 cm thick in the experiment and the full system simulation respectively at 20 h therefore the freshwater layer thickness simulated with the full system was closer to the experimental result than that simulated with the limited system these results showed that the full system simulation better reproduced the freshwater thickness variation obtained experimentally in the limited system simulation conducted with the asgmf numerical simulation method the 0 9 salt concentration contour was 11 cm ahead of the experimental boundary between freshwater and saltwater at the elapsed time of 20 h and in the limited darcy system simulation conducted with the dtransu method this contour was 10 cm ahead of the experimental boundary furthermore the salt concentration distribution in the glass beads obtained by the asgmf numerical simulation method for the limited system was similar to that obtained by the dtransu method for the limited darcy system compare fig 12b and c however the salt concentration distribution in the surface water differed between these two simulation methods and systems at 20 h the surface water salt concentration obtained by the dtransu method for the limited darcy system was still 1 0 close to the right boundary even though a salt concentration was not imposed at this boundary in contrast in the limited system simulation result as indicated above a 7 5 cm thick layer of freshwater had formed on the top of the surface water at 20 h that extended all the way to the right boundary therefore the surface water flow could not be accurately reproduced by treating the surface water as an extremely high permeability layer and applying darcy s law furthermore the boundary between freshwater and saltwater obtained by both the limited darcy system simulation and the limited system simulation differed from the experimental boundary therefore accurate numerical simulation of variable density flow in subsurface in contact with the atmosphere and surface water requires consideration of both gas and water flow and pressure variations in a surface water atmosphere system in summary the saltwater distributions obtained by the asgmf numerical simulation method differed somewhat between the limited system and the full system simulations in particular between the elapsed times of 5 and 10 h moreover the small saltwater zone that appeared below the top of the glass beads in the main freshwater zone in the full system simulation at 10 h which influenced the salt concentration distribution in the surface water was not seen in the limited system simulation at the elapsed time of 10 h the salt concentration in the surface water had decreased to only about 0 5 in the full system simulation in the experimental results as in the full system simulation results a small indistinct saltwater zone appeared in the vicinity of the surface of the main freshwater zone at 10 h but its yellow color was lighter than the saltwater color suggesting a lower salt concentration although the salt concentration in this zone was not quantified by measurement with a salinometer the yellow color of the surface water near the water level above the glass beads was slightly lighter at 10 h than at 15 h compare figs 10a and 11a thus at the elapsed time of 10 h the experimental salt concentration in the surface water was not zero and it was also consistent with the salt concentration in surface water in the full system simulation though the salt concentration was not quantitatively determined during the experiment furthermore the thickness of the freshwater layer at the top of the surface water obtained by the full system simulation was closer to the experimental thickness than the thickness obtained by the other simulations thus on the whole the salt concentration distribution in the surface water obtained by the full system simulation was similar to that obtained by the experiment conducted for this study the flow in the surface water was not turbulent an eddy was observed neither in the surface water in the experiment nor in the full limited system figs 9 12 therefore using dns to simulate the 2 d tank experiment was appropriate even though the mesh was too coarse for dns to capture small scale turbulence in addition the limited system results differed from the full system results because of the different boundary conditions between the atmosphere and the glass beads or surface water in particular the flow pattern in the upper part of the glass beads in the limited system simulation was clearly inconsistent with that of the full system simulation a variable water pressure cannot generally be imposed at the upper surface of a porous medium that is unsaturated with water but gas pressure can be imposed as zero which is equal to atmospheric pressure in the present simulations with both the limited system and the full system gas pressure was not imposed at the surface of the glass beads so gas pressure could vary at this surface thus the water saturation could also vary at this surface the boundary conditions at the surface of the glass beads in the limited system were similar to those in the full system except for the presence of atmosphere or surface water above the surface in the full system however after the appearance of surface water at the surface of the glass beads gas in the atmosphere was permitted to flow through this upper surface of the glass beads in the full system simulation streamlines and water flow directions obtained by the limited system simulation at the elapsed time of 20 h indicated that water in the 0 2 mm glass beads flowed parallel to the upper surface of the porous medium where it was not in contact with surface water and it did not flow out across the surface of the medium instead water in the porous medium flowed into the surface water except at the left side of the porous medium water flow within the surface water was complicated and displayed no particular trend fig 13 in the full system simulation freshwater under the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads flowed to the atmosphere and a very thin layer of surface water flowed down and to the right along the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads at the elapsed time of 20 h furthermore water in the 0 2 mm glass beads where they underlay the surface water flowed into the surface water across the surface of the beads at x 60 cm to x 154 cm freshwater flowed one way horizontally into the saltwater reservoir and in the surface water layer saltwater circulated clockwise under the freshwater layer at the surface the water in the beads was exchanged through the surface of beads with surface water at three points from x 154 cm to 190 cm furthermore saltwater in the glass beads circulated above the bottom of the tank close to the freshwater front at the elapsed time 10 h in the full system simulation saltwater was transported into the surface water in the area where a small saltwater zone formed by flows between the glass beads and the surface water near the intersection between the surface of the beads and the free water surface consequently a small saltwater zone with a higher salt concentration than the concentration below the zone formed beneath the free water surface at the elapsed time of 20 h water flow occurred from left to right above the small saltwater zone which was located on the upstream side of x 50 cm this point was itself on the upstream side of the intersection between the surface of the beads and the free water surface in detail the water flowed over the top of the small saltwater zone from its upstream side to its downstream side and then into the surface water water also flowed out of the 0 2 mm glass beads across the surface of the beads on the downstream side of the small saltwater zone whereas surface water above the small saltwater zone flowed parallel to the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads as a result water could not stream through the small saltwater zone or transport saltwater in this zone this small saltwater zone eventually disappeared as the salt concentration became diluted through dispersion it can be inferred that the water flow above the small saltwater zone resulted from the fluid pressure balance at the intersection between the porous medium 0 2 mm glass beads the surface water and the atmosphere however it is necessary to confirm that this phenomenon can be reproduced by additional experiments and numerical simulations under the same conditions in contrast in the limited system simulation the water beneath the upper surface of the glass beads flowed parallel to the surface of the beads and then out into the surface water where it overlay the beads consequently in the limited system saltwater in the beads was washed out into the surface water in the vicinity of the intersection between the water surface and the upper surface of the glass beads but this flow in the limited system was not consistent with the flow observed in the experiment figs 13 and 14 water flows in the 0 2 mm glass beads differed between the limited system and full system simulations in the limited system simulation the water flow in the glass beads was simpler than that in the full system simulation but the flow trends in the full system simulation were clearer than those in the limited system simulation in the full system simulation gas circulated counterclockwise in the atmosphere and then flowed in the direction of the outlet at the surface of the glass beads fig 15 the horizontal gas flow at the free water surface influenced the surface water flow causing saltwater in the surface water to circulate fig 14 furthermore this saltwater circulation in the surface water caused the water flow at the surface of the glass beads to be complicated in the full system simulation as in many multi phase flow simulations gas flow in the atmosphere was caused by the surface water flow and at the boundary between the surface water and the atmosphere the flow velocity in the atmosphere should be equal to that in the surface water the simulated flows in the atmosphere and surface water were both moderate and real the maximum velocities in the atmosphere and surface water were 0 214 and 0 290 m s respectively however in the full system simulation the gas might be incompressible because the mach number of the gas reached a maximum of 6 45 10 4 and is very small the flow trends simulated in the 0 2 mm glass beads in contact with the surface water atmosphere system differed greatly between the limited system and the full system simulations because of the different boundary conditions at the surface of the glass beads and at the free water surface in the limited system simulation water in the glass beads was not permitted to flow out across the surface of the beads into the atmosphere thus a thin surface water layer could not form above the glass beads in contrast in the full system simulation fluid could freely flow out of the glass beads into the atmosphere and a thin layer of surface water formed on the surface of the beads that was above the free water surface further gas in the atmosphere flowed parallel to the surface of the glass beads fig 15 and this gas flow was influenced by the formation of the thin surface water layer and by water flow in that layer accordingly both the gas flow in the atmosphere and surface water flow could influence water flow in the 0 2 mm glass beads and therefore the final saltwater distribution however additional investigations of the influence of gas flow on fluid flow in subsurface are needed in the future to clarify the influence of gas and surface water flows simulations of practical scale analytical domains such as the simulations of robinson et al 2007a will be conducted the maximum velocities v in the 0 2 glass beads surface water and atmosphere were 1 03 10 3 0 290 and 0 214 m s respectively at the elapsed time of 20 h thus by using the typical length l of 1 800 m and the densities ρ and viscosities μ shown in table 2 the reynolds numbers lv μ ρ in the 0 2 mm glass beads surface water and atmosphere were calculated to be 1717 483 333 and 25 680 respectively and the froude numbers v gl 0 5 were calculated to be 2 45 10 4 6 90 10 2 and 5 10 10 2 respectively next practical velocities in the 0 2 glass beads surface water and atmosphere were computed by using the practical length lp 200 m which is the practical length used in the numerical simulations conducted by robinson et al 2007a reynolds numbers and froude numbers in actual field experiments should be equal to those in the two dimensional tank experiment but usually this condition is not met in many cases however either the reynolds numbers or the froude numbers in field studies conducted at practical scale are equal to those in laboratory experiments the froude number at practical scale was set to be the same in both systems when the reciprocal of the reynolds number is smaller than that of the froude number thus the practical velocities v p calculated by using v p v lp l 0 5 in the 0 2 mm glass beads surface water and atmosphere were 1 11 10 2 3 06 and 2 26 m s respectively which are moderate flows at the elapsed time of 20 h in the two dimensional tank experiment the non dimensional time t in the surface water when maximum velocity was reached obtained by using t v l t was 3 22 the practical time t p was then obtained by using t p t lp v p because the non dimensional time at practical scale should be consistent with that in the laboratory experiment thus t p in the 0 2 glass beads surface water and atmosphere was calculated to be 2473 days 211 h and 286 h respectively this result shows that time period of the experiment was adequate to estimate flows at practical scale because the practical time was 2473 days in the 0 2 mm glass beads water pressure under the free water surface was similar between the full system and limited system simulations however water pressure under the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads that were in contact with the atmosphere was smaller in the full system simulation than in the limited system simulation at the elapsed time of 20 h water pressure was less than 0 5 kpa at the top of the glass beads in the full system simulation and in the limited system simulation the minimum water pressure value exceeded 0 5 kpa everywhere within the glass beads fig 16 in the full system simulation some water pressure contours under the surface of the glass beads where they were in contact with the atmosphere were concave whereas these contours were convex in the limited system simulation this difference in contour shape was caused by the differences in the direction of water flow described above and these different trends were attributable to the different boundary conditions at the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads consequently these results indicated that gas in the atmosphere above the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads interacted with the water within the 0 2 mm glass beads they also indicated therefore that even though many researchers have ignored surface water and atmosphere and specified the water pressure as hydrostatic in numerical simulations of variable density water flow in subsurface coupled with a surface water atmosphere system in some situations it might be necessary to take account of the atmosphere and surface water to improve the accuracy of in such simulations furthermore in the future the detected influences of the surface water atmosphere system on subsurface need to be verified by conducting simulations with a turbulence closure model instead of by using dns as in the present simulations as shown by the above results it is hard to accurately reproduce the salt concentration and variable density flows in surface water by the simple simulation methods used previously however it is not necessary to use the asgmf numerical simulation method to reproduce variable density flow deep under the ground where the variation in the salt concentration in surface water has little or no influence in such cases the previous simple simulation methods might be better than the asgmf numerical simulation method the asgmf numerical simulation method would be best employed to accurately reproduce the salt concentration distribution and variable density flow in surface water in situations where they influence the flow in the underlying subsurface 3 conclusion this study first conducted numerical simulations of variable density flow and transport of salt in a porous medium consisting of silica beads with the asgmf numerical simulation method and then compared the simulated salt concentration distributions with the visually observed boundary between freshwater and saltwater obtained by experiment the 0 1 to 0 3 salt concentration contours in the steady and transient flow fields obtained by the asgmf numerical simulation method were consistent with the visually observed boundary between freshwater and saltwater obtained experimentally these results confirm that the asgmf numerical simulation method can accurately reproduce salt concentration distributions due to variable density flow and salt transport in a porous medium next this study conducted a two dimensional tank experiment with a porous medium 0 2 mm glass beads and a surface water atmosphere system and two simulations using the asgmf numerical simulation method and a third simulation using a simpler simulation method the dtransu method this study then compared the simulated salt concentration distributions in the surface water atmosphere system and 0 2 mm glass beads with the visually observed boundary between saltwater and freshwater in the experiment salt concentration distributions obtained by the asgmf numerical simulation method differed between a full system simulation atmosphere surface water and 0 2 mm glass beads and a limited system simulation surface water and 0 2 mm glass beads in the limited system simulation water under the surface of the glass beads where they were in contact with the atmosphere flowed parallel to the surface and then out of the glass beads into the surface water in the full system simulation however water under the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads first flowed out to the atmosphere and then into the surface water and surface water that infiltrated into the glass beads flowed in and out of the glass beads several times on the right side of the two dimensional tank surface water flows obtained by the limited system simulation did not display any consistent pattern whereas in the full system simulation water in the top surface water layer flowed horizontally in the direction of the tank outlet and water under the horizontal flow circulated the water flow and salt concentration distribution in the full system simulation were similar to those in the experiment salt concentration distributions in glass beads in contact with surface water have frequently been simulated by a simple numerical method based on darcy s law for water flow and a semi lagrangian method for salt transport in the surface water which is modeled as a layer with extremely high permeability the salt concentration distribution of the present two dimensional tank experiment reproduced by the simulation with the simpler method that used darcy s law was similar only to that reproduced deep within the glass beads by the limited system simulation but this simpler numerical simulation method could not accurately reproduce the salt concentration distribution in the surface water in the full system simulation a thin layer of surface water formed on the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads because water beneath the surface of the beads was able to flow out to the atmosphere water flow in this thin surface water layer influenced not only the water pressure at the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads but also water flow in the beads under the surface water furthermore the surface water circulation affected water flow at the surface of the glass beads and caused complicated flows close to the saltwater reservoir furthermore the experimental salt concentration distribution was similar to that obtained by the full system simulation that included the atmosphere therefore water flow and water pressure in a porous medium can be influenced by water flow and water pressure in the surface water many studies have ignored the influence of flow and pressure in the atmosphere and surface water on flow in the subsurface and have treated water pressure in surface water as hydrostatic however fluid flow and fluid pressure in both the atmosphere and surface water might need to be considered to accurately simulate variable density flow and salt transport in surface water and a shallow subsurface in the vicinity of the atmosphere and surface water in a future study a practical scale simulation is required to further investigate and clarify the influence of gas and water flow on groundwater flow and salt transport in the subsurface furthermore to confirm the influence of the surface water atmosphere system on subsurface flows

1497,when seawater intrudes into a subterranean estuary there is interaction between groundwater and surface water and ocean tides and waves can influence the salt concentration distribution in subsurface of the estuary however numerical simulations of seawater intrusion into a subterranean estuary often neglect the atmosphere and surface water and simply specify hydrostatic pressure and a constant seawater salt concentration this study examined the influence of fluid flow and pressure in a surface water atmosphere system consisting of both atmosphere and surface water on the salt distribution in subsurface and in the surface water by a numerical simulation that couples fluid flows in the surface water atmosphere system and groundwater this study first confirmed the precision of the simulation method by comparing experimentally determined salt concentration distributions in silica beads unsaturated with water this study then conducted an experiment in a two dimensional tank filled with seawater and glass beads mean diameter 0 2 mm and carried out two simulations of this tank experiment one of a limited system consisting of the porous medium and surface water only and the other of a full system consisting of the porous medium surface water and atmosphere darcy s law has frequently been applied in limited system simulations by assigning extremely high permeability to the surface water this study therefore also conducted a third simpler numerical simulation of the limited system that used only darcy s law the salt concentration distribution obtained by the full system simulation was closer to the experimental distribution than that obtained by the limited system simulation this result implies that fluid flow and pressure in both the atmosphere and surface water influence water flow and water pressure in the porous medium furthermore the third simulation using darcy s law only could not precisely reproduce flow in the surface water therefore when variable density flow in surface water and a shallow subsurface are numerically simulated the simulation system needs to include atmosphere and surface water to take account of the influence of fluid flow and fluid pressure in both the atmosphere and surface water on the fluid flow and transport of salt in a shallow subsurface keywords variable density flow multiphase flow navier stokes equations water saturation equation semi lagrange method asgmf 1 introduction groundwater interacts with surface water and around the groundwater surface water boundary chemicals can migrate from groundwater to surface water or from surface water to groundwater scientists and engineers in fields such as hydrogeology fluid mechanics and coastal engineering have developed many numerical methods to simulate interactions between surface water and groundwater these numerical simulation methods typically employ 1 a diffusive wave equation e g delfs et al 2013 tosaka 2002 weill et al 2011 2 shallow water equations e g discacciati et al 2002 maxwell and kollet 2008 xin et al 2010 2011 yuan et al 2011 or 3 navier stokes eqs ns equations bakhtyar et al 2011 2012 2013 maeda and sakai 2010 maeda et al 2006 onda et al 2014 to simulate surface water flow and 1 darcy s law or 2 the darcy brinkman model anderson and jackson 1967 bars and worster 2006 hill and straughan 2009 to simulate groundwater flow the groundwater formulations are then merged with those for surface water by imposing a pressure continuity across the interface and normal and tangential flow velocities or by considering the exchange of water across the groundwater surface water boundary when diffusive wave and shallow water equations are employed to simulate surface water flow darcy s law is always applied to simulate the groundwater flow however when ns equations are applied to simulate surface water flow either darcy s law or the darcy brinkman model which adds the resistance of subsurface to ns equations is used to describe groundwater flow seawater intrusion into a subterranean estuary has been simulated mostly by using variable density saturated or unsaturated flow models for groundwater coupled with a solute transport equation for saltwater e g langevin et al 2010 lin et al 2009 nishikawa et al 2009 pool and carrera 2010 webb and howard 2011 robinson et al 2007a 2007b and bakhtyar et al 2013 who conducted numerical simulations of the flow and transport of saltwater by tidal forcing have shown that the submarine groundwater discharge associated with tide induced and density driven circulation depends on tidal amplitude their findings indicate that water pressure and water flow in surface seawater surface water influences the salt concentration distribution in an onshore subsurface environment however in their simulations they assigned a high hydraulic conductivity value 106 m d to the subsurface and assumed that the seawater salt concentration was constant at 35 ppt in addition they applied darcy s law to simulate surface seawater surface water flow simplified the water flow and neglected salt transport in the seawater in reality however the salt concentration of seawater is not always constant either spatially or temporally and the variations in the salt concentration of seawater might influence the salt concentration distribution beneath the seafloor feistel et al 2016 yanagi and abe 2005 in contrast xin et al 2010 used shallow water equations to more rigorously simulate wave driven seawater flow and combined groundwater and seawater flows under high hydraulic conductivity conditions however they did not address salt transport in the seawater and they assigned salt concentrations and concentration gradients at the interface between groundwater and seawater by assuming that the direction of the salt flux was normal to the interface although yuan et al 2011 like xin et al 2010 employed shallow water equations to simulate seawater flow they used only a diffusion equation to simulate salt solute transport in the surface water without accounting for the advective transport of salt in the surface water a number of studies langevin et al 2010 lin et al 2009 nishikawa et al 2009 pool and carrera 2010 webb and howard 2011 have rigorously solved salt solute transport in groundwater by considering molecular diffusion along with tortuosity dispersion and advection furthermore recent simulations of the temporal features of seawater intrusion in response to a sea level rise have neglected marine transgression and land surface overtopping by seawater werner et al 2013 therefore free convection due to transgression and land surface overtopping associated with current rates of sea level rise requires further analysis to assess its importance relative to lateral seawater intrusion yu et al 2016 similarly a sea level fall is expected to influence both seawater transgression and its lateral intrusion into subsurface however the simulation methods described above have mostly not reproduced seawater flow and salt solute transport in surface seawater rigorously and they cannot estimate the influence of fluid flow in a surface water atmosphere system that includes both atmosphere and surface water on the salt concentration distribution in groundwater and surface seawater accordingly it is still needed to estimate how flow in a surface water atmosphere system influences seawater transgression and intrusion and the surface water salt solute concentration in other words the migration of the seawater freshwater boundary in subsurface and the overlying surface water thus this study used the atmosphere surface water groundwater multiphase flow asgmf numerical simulation method which was developed in previous work by the author and his colleagues hibi and tomigashi 2015 2018 and hibi et al 2015 first the asgmf was verified by reproducing variable density flow in a porous medium and in surface water then this study conducted experiments in a two dimensional tank filled with saltwater and glass beads mean diameter 0 2 mm and performed three different simulations to clarify how flow in the surface water atmosphere system influenced the migration of the interface between saltwater and freshwater the first simulation considered contact between the porous medium and the atmosphere whereas the second simulation assumed no contact between the porous medium and the atmosphere the third simpler numerical simulation had the same domain as the second simulation but used only darcy s law to describe flow this study then compared the simulation results with the experimental findings to evaluate how conditions in the surface water atmosphere system above the subsurface affected the migration of the seawater freshwater boundary in the surface water and porous medium 2 numerical simulation theory 2 1 coupled subsurface surface water atmosphere system fluid flows in surface water and the subsurface should be rigorously solved by applying the ns equations with a multiphase flow numerical technique and by considering water retention in the subsurface the asgmf numerical simulation method employs a one field model for multiple immiscible fluids to simulate surface water flow because the mach number of the flow simulated in this study was very small fluids in the water surface atmosphere system were treated as incompressible considering the mass conservation law and assuming fluid incompressibility ns equations are solved by a semi lagrange method with cubic interpolated propagation cip yabe

time t v t δt and p t δt at each nodal point are obtained by the galerkin finite element method fem for discretization of space direct numerical simulation dns which was applied in this study requires many nodal points to fulfill the criterion of kolmogorov effect length the asgmf method was originally developed without a turbulence closure model and an extremely fine mesh was not needed to deal with large circulations and stably solve flows in the surface water atmosphere system the mean flow velocity and large circulation patterns in the surface water atmosphere system are the primary influences on the migration of salt in surface water furthermore they also influence the distribution of salt in groundwater thus employment of dns in this study is justifiable in the future it is planned to add a turbulence closure model to the asgmf method because there is a free water surface inside some of the elements of the finite element grid viscosity μ t and density ρ t are expressed in terms of the void fraction of water s w t which is the ratio of the water volume to the total fluid volume of the surface water at time t in the surface water atmosphere system 3 ρ t s w t ρ w 1 s

algebraic equations by the fem d ij t is dispersion in the i and j directions as follows 19a d ij t d d in surface water 19b d ij t τd d α t δ ij δ km α l α t δ ik δ jm δ im δ jk 2 v w k t v w m t v w t in subsurface water where d d is the molecular diffusion coefficient α l and α t are longitudinal and transverse dispersivity respectively v w k t and v w m t are the norm of the velocities in directions k and m at time t respectively v w is the norm of the velocity at time t τ is tortuosity δ ij is the kronecker delta and i j k and m are directions in a right handed cartesian coordinate system the numerical simulations reproduced the movement of saltwater which is heavier than water in surface water and groundwater accordingly this simulation method should be able to handle variable density flows in subsurface and surface waters these flows reflect the variation of seawater density as a function of the salt concentration in a solution as follows 20 ρ w ρ w freshwater c ρ w seawater ρ w freshwater c seawater where ρ w freshwater is the density of freshwater ρ w seawater is the density of seawater and c seawater is the salt concentration in the original seawater because the time increment δt used in this simulation method is very small 0 05 s variable density flows in the subsurface and surface water flow can be explicitly solved by this simulation method 2 2 situation at the boundary between the subsurface and the surface water atmosphere system the migration of water can be expressed as the change of water saturation in the subsurface and as the change of the void fraction of water in surface water both water saturation and the void fraction of water range from 0 0 to 1 0 in the whole cross section normal to fluid flow thus water saturation and the void fraction of water s w are able to preserve continuity of the water volume or water mass at the boundary between the surface water atmosphere system and the subsurface unsaturated with water when stationary water saturation is disturbed in a saturated or unsaturated subsurface as shown in fig 1 a water pressure and gas pressure become hydrostatic pressure and static pressure respectively fig 1 b in this case the global pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure at the boundary between the subsurface and the atmosphere because the subsurface is in contact with the atmosphere fig 1 d and fluid pressure should be continuous across this boundary furthermore global pressure is equal to the sum of synthetic pressure p and synthetic capillary pressure p c in the subsurface and decreases from atmospheric pressure at the boundary to p p c in the subsurface fig 1 c and e because p cgw p g po p w po and f n f n 1 eq 7 can be rearranged as follows 21 p f w p w po f g p g po p g po f w p cwg where p cgw is the capillary pressure between gas and water and p g po is gas pressure in the subsurface from eq 21 the difference between synthetic pressure p and p g po is f w p cgw thus p g po in the subsurface at the boundary between the subsurface and atmosphere should be equal to the atmospheric pressure p g su thus the unsaturated subsurface is in contact with the atmosphere global pressure including both synthetic pressure p and synthetic capillary pressure p c is effective in the subsurface including at the nodal points on the boundary because as mentioned above p g po in eq 21 is equal to p g su at this boundary and the global pressure is effective in the subsurface f w p cgw must be imposed at the nodal points on the boundary including in some elements neighboring the boundary in the subsurface fig 1 c d and e therefore p c and f w p cgw should be imposed at both the nodal points on the boundary and in the elements in the subsurface neighboring the boundary fig 1 e consequently global pressure can be expressed at the boundary between the unsaturated subsurface and atmosphere ω as follows 22a p p g su p c f w p cwg on ω vol po if s w 1 22b p p g su on ω vol su if s w 1 where vol su and vol po are the domains of the surface water atmosphere system and the subsurface respectively 2 3 numerical simulation procedure we can divide the numerical simulation procedure for the asgmf described in section 2 into four parts calculation of 1 fluid pressure surface water atmosphere system or synthetic pressure subsurface boxes 3 to 9 in fig 2 2 fluid velocity surface water atmosphere system or total velocity subsurface box 10 in fig 2 3 the void fraction of water surface water atmosphere system or water saturation subsurface boxes 11 to 15 in fig 2 and 4 salt concentration in water boxes 16 to 21 in fig 2 in part 1 the position vector r i v i t δt must first be determined at every nodal point i from the position vector r i velocity at time t and the time increment then v i is obtained by interpolation of the velocity field at time t next each of ρ i t μ i t k rw i t k rg i t λ w i t λ g i t λ i t f w i t f g i t p ci t κ i t df g ds w i dκ ds w i dp cgw ds w i and p c i is calculated at every nodal point and averaged within each element the p c values at every point in the subsurface are obtained by integrating sw p cgw df g ds w ds w using the trapezoidal rule after p cgw is calculated by eq 8 and df g ds w i is calculated at each integration point by using the water saturation at that point furthermore f w p cwg is calculated at nodal points on the boundary between the surface water atmosphere system and the subsurface then the per element average of the parameter values which was calculated above is inserted into eq 1 to obtain the fluid pressure in the surface water and atmosphere and into eq 6 to obtain that in the subsurface then those two equations are simultaneously solved to get the fluid pressure and the synthetic pressure p at every point in the analytical domain at time t δt in part 2 the fluid pressure and the synthetic pressure are inserted into eq 2 to obtain the fluid velocity in the surface water atmosphere system and into eq 12 to obtain the total velocity in the subsurface respectively then the recent fluid velocity in the surface water atmosphere system v and the total velocity in the subsurface v t at every point and time t δt are determined by solving those equations simultaneously in part 3 v soil at every nodal point in the subsurface is calculated with eq 10a from df g ds w and dκ ds w at the elapsed time t to obtain the water saturation in the medium the position vector r v t δt with respect to every point in the surface water atmosphere system and the position vector r v soil t δt with respect to every point in the subsurface are determined and then s w at the position vector r v t δt and at the position vector r v soil t δt is obtained by interpolation with cip in the water saturation field in the subsurface or the void fraction of water field in the surface water atmosphere system at time t finally the void fraction of water s w t δt at time t δt is equal to s w in eq 5 for the surface water atmosphere system and the water saturation s w t δt at time t δt in the subsurface is obtained by solving eq 9 using the values of s w calculated above and d soil t calculated by using eq 10b in part 4 water velocity in the subsurface v w t δt is calculated with eq 16a using p w which is obtained with eq 15 from the synthetic pressure p the position vector r v w t δt δt with respect to every point in the surface water and the subsurface is determined and c at the position vector r v w t δt δt is obtained by interpolation with cip in the salt concentration field in the subsurface and the surface water at time t the dispersion coefficient d ij is calculated with eq 19 at every nodal point and averaged within each element the recent salt concentration c t δt at nodal points at the elapsed time t δt is obtained by solving eq 18 using the determined values of c and d ij and recent water density ρ w t δt is calculated from the obtained value of c t δt if time t is less than the final time t max the time increment δt is added to time t and v at the next time step is computed the entire procedure is repeated until time t is greater than t max numerical simulation results and discussion this study first conducted simulations to verify that the asgmf numerical simulation method could reproduce variable density flow in a porous medium and in surface water this study conducted a simulation of variable density flow in a porous medium with transient variable flow in silica beads that included a partly water unsaturated domain and then compared the results with experimentally obtained results in addition this study carried out three numerical simulations to evaluate how contact with a surface water atmosphere system composed of atmosphere and surface water affected variable density water flows in a porous medium 2 4 simulation of salt transport in a porous medium goswami and clement 2007 filled a two dimensional plexiglas tank with a length of 53 cm a height of 30 5 cm and width of 2 7 cm with freshwater and uniform silica beads with an average diameter of 1 1 mm fig 3 during their experiment the water level in the saltwater reservoir on the left side of the tank was always controlled at z 25 5 cm above the bottom but the water level in the freshwater reservoir on the right side of the tank was varied three steady state conditions ss1 ss3 were then examined under three freshwater heads the water level in the freshwater reservoir was initially controlled at z 26 7 cm ss1 next the water level in the freshwater reservoir was lowered to 26 2 cm ss2 finally the water level in the freshwater reservoir was raised to 26 55 cm ss3 they also conducted a numerical simulation of their experiment with the seawat finite difference model this study used the asgmf numerical simulation method with the simulation domain and the boundary and initial conditions shown in fig 3 to simulate ss1 ss2 and ss3 saltwater was injected into the tank from the bottom of the saltwater reservoir by imposing a water pressure of 0 2616 kpa which was equal to the hydrostatic water pressure when the water level in the saltwater reservoir was z 25 5 cm the injected saltwater infiltrated into the silica beads or was discharged from the tank via a hole at z 25 5 to 26 0 cm on the left wall of the saltwater reservoir similarly freshwater was injected into the tank from the bottom of the freshwater reservoir by imposing a hydrostatic water pressure of 0 274 kpa ss1 0 269 kpa ss2 or 0 2724 kpa ss3 for a water level of z 26 7 cm 26 2 cm or 26 55 cm respectively freshwater that did not infiltrate into the silica beads was discharged from the tank via a hole at z 26 7 to 27 0 cm ss1 26 2 to 26 5 ss2 or 26 55 to 26 85 cm ss3 in the right wall of the freshwater reservoir in the numerical simulation the fluid and silica bead parameter values were set to those shown in table 1 which are consistent with the values used by goswami and clement 2007 in their numerical simulation in their numerical simulation goswami and clement 2007 used a salt concentration of 0 0372 mg ml thus the saltwater density was 1 026 g cm3 however these simulations used the relative salt concentration that is the concentration relative to the concentration of 0 0372 mg ml used by goswami and clement 2007 which ranged between 0 and 1 parameters of gas in the atmosphere are not used in seawat the model employed by goswami and clement 2007 for their numerical simulation whereas the asgmf numerical simulation method uses parameters for gas above the free water surface in the freshwater reservoir the finite element grid used in this simulation consisted of 12 373 nodes defining 12 060 rectangular elements in the analytical domain the analytical domain was vertically divided at 0 5 cm intervals from z 0 cm to 25 0 cm the vertical dimension of each element was 0 1 cm above z 25 0 cm in the saltwater and freshwater reservoirs the elements were finer than elsewhere with a horizontal dimension ranging from 0 063 to 0 25 cm in contrast the horizontal dimension of each element in the silica beads ranged from 0 25 to 0 5 cm the asgmf method employs cip developed by yabe et al 1991 to express the interface between freshwater and saltwater because cip can conserve the salt concentration gradient independently of the element width even over time the element width of 0 5 cm was adequate to express the interface between freshwater and saltwater in the present simulations the visually observed experimental boundary was located between the 0 1 and 0 3 relative salt concentration contours obtained by the asgmf numerical simulation method regardless of whether saltwater was intruding or regressing in their experiment goswami and clement 2007 did not measure salt concentrations thus salt concentration distributions obtained by the asgmf numerical simulation method cannot be compared with their experiment however it can be inferred that the salt concentration distribution obtained by the asgmf numerical simulation method are similar to the distribution obtained experimentally by goswami and clement 2007 because the 0 1 to 0 3 salt concentration contours in the present simulations are consistent with the experimentally observed boundaries between saltwater and freshwater thus this result shows that the asgmf numerical simulation method could reproduce transient variable density flow in the silica beads figs 4 and 5 2 5 coupled simulation of the saltwater distribution in groundwater freshwater and surface water saltwater in this section three numerical simulations are described to confirm the effects of fluid flow and fluid pressure in a surface water atmosphere system on variable density flow in the surface water and in a porous medium composed of 0 2 mm glass beads two simulations were performed with the asgmf numerical simulation method one for a limited system consisting of 0 2 mm glass beads and surface water and the other for a full system consisting of 0 2 mm glass beads surface water and atmosphere the third simulation was conducted with a numerical simulation method for variable density flow in a porous medium and applied to a limited darcy system consisting of only 0 2 mm glass beads and surface water the results of all three simulations were then compared with the results of an experiment conducted as part of this study with a two dimensional tank apparatus in the limited darcy system simulation as in robinson et al 2007a 2007b and bakhtyar et al 2013 darcy s law was applied not only to flow in the subsurface but also to the surface water flow by assigning a high permeability value to the surface water here this study applied the dtransu method which was developed by nishigaki et al 1993 and is extensively used in japan in the limited darcy system simulation the dtransu method employs darcy s law to describe variable density flow in subsurface whether saturated or unsaturated with water and a semi lagrangian method to describe saltwater transport using the dtransu method nishigaki et al 1993 accurately reproduced the experiments of hosokawa et al 1989 thereby verifying that the method could simulate variable density flow and salt transport in a porous medium the experimental apparatus used for the present experiment consisted of a tank with a length of 190 cm a height of 60 cm and a width of 13 5 cm and two bottles one for supplying freshwater and the other for supplying saltwater to the tank an acrylic board and an aluminum plate were fitted to the front and back of the tank respectively and two stainless steel nets were installed 4 cm from each end of the tank glass beads with a mean diameter of 0 2 mm range 0 177 0 250 mm and a mean density of 2 5 g cm3 were packed into the space between the two stainless steel nets freshwater was stored on the left side of the tank to the left of the stainless steel net at the left end the freshwater reservoir and saltwater was stored on the right side of the tank to the right of the stainless steel net at the right end the saltwater reservoir silicon hoses with an inner diameter of 6 mm connected the freshwater supply bottle to the freshwater reservoir and the saltwater supply bottle to the saltwater reservoir freshwater entered the freshwater reservoir from the freshwater supply bottle via a hole drilled in the left wall of the tank between z 31 0 and 32 0 cm the inflow of freshwater into the freshwater reservoir was regulated with a needle valve koyo corp needle valve vrb 10838 so that the water level in the reservoir was always at z 38 8 cm saltwater with density 1 024 g cm3 flowed into the saltwater reservoir from the saltwater supply bottle through a hole drilled in the right wall between z 20 0 and 21 0 cm and was discharged from the tank through a hole drilled in the right wall between z 35 and 36 cm the continuous inflow of saltwater prevented dilution of the salt concentration in the saltwater reservoir fig 6 at the start of the experiment the outlet and inlet valves in the walls on both sides of the tank were closed and saltwater which was colored yellow with fluorescein sodium salt uranine nacalai tesque inc was poured into the tank until the water level was z 43 cm next glass beads were packed into the tank by dropping them into the tank until they reached a height of 42 5 cm at the left stainless steel net and a height of 20 0 cm at the right stainless steel net thus the surface of the glass beads sloped with a gradient of 1 8 and the porosity of the medium calculated from the mass volume and density of the glass beads was 0 405 after the glass beads were packed into the tank the valve installed in the upper hole on the right side wall was opened and water was allowed to flow out of the tank until the water level in the tank was z 35 5 cm i e until the discharge of saltwater ceased finally the inlet valves were opened and both freshwater and saltwater began to flow into their respective reservoirs from the supply bottles the water level in the freshwater reservoir was allowed to rise to z 38 8 cm and then was kept constant at this level throughout the rest of the experiment variable density flow was observed visually by using a video camera jvckenwood inc everio gz e241 1 000 000 to 2 300 000 pixels in the video images freshwater and saltwater could be distinguished by color freshwater was colorless or the color of the glass beads gray and the saltwater was yellow although as the salt concentration decreased the shade of the yellow became lighter as a result the interface boundary between freshwater and saltwater and its migration could be identified in the video images the experiment was completed when the boundary between freshwater and saltwater no longer moved in all three simulations the same values table 2 were assigned to all parameters except that gas parameters were not used in the limited system or the limited darcy system simulations the densities of the freshwater and saltwater used in the experiment were measured with a boikosu density meter yokota keiki manufacturing co ltd range 0 995 1 050 g cm3 accuracy 0 001 g cm3 both water and air viscosity and density values were appropriate for the temperature at which the two dimensional tank experiment was conducted 17 c japan national astronomical observatory 2004 porosity of the medium was determined from the total mass and volume of the 0 2 mm glass beads packed into the two dimensional tank and the density of the beads intrinsic permeability was obtained by a water permeability test a difference in water head was maintained during this test and the van genuchten parameters residual gas saturation and water residual saturation with respect to the water retention curve were measured by the water head method longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were obtained from the results of a tracer test for salt conducted in a column filled with 0 2 mm glass beads and water during this test a solution with a salt mass concentration of 3 infiltrated into the column at various velocities these tests and measurements were conducted in author s laboratory but the results are unpublished both the limited system and full system simulations excluded the freshwater and saltwater reservoirs above their respective water levels which were held constant at 0 388 m freshwater reservoir and 0 355 m saltwater reservoir furthermore to exclude the effects of gas flow and gas pressure the limited system did not include atmosphere the upper surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads in contact with the atmosphere was specified as an impermeable boundary so that gas and water could not flow into or out of the limited system across that surface in addition in the limited system simulation the surface water was restricted to below the water level of z 0 355 m and this boundary was specified as a slippery wall therefore surface water could not flow along the boundary between the glass beads and the atmosphere and furthermore the surface water level was always constant during the simulation freshwater flowed into the freshwater reservoir from z 0 31 m to 0 32 m by the imposition of a water head of 0 397 m which is equal to the product of the water level 0 388 m in the freshwater reservoir and the density of the saltwater 1 024 g cm3 thus freshwater was able to flow into the reservoir even when the freshwater reservoir was filled with saltwater the water in the two dimensional tank was discharged from the analytical domain from z 0 345 m to 0 355 m on the right side of the saltwater reservoir where a water head of 0 355 m was imposed the upper boundaries of the freshwater and saltwater reservoirs were specified as slippery boundaries so that water flowed parallel to the water surface the left boundary of the glass beads from z 0 388 m to 0 425 m was specified as permeable to permit flow out of the analytical domain through the stainless steel net but the bottom boundary of the glass beads was specified as impermeable and the reservoir bottoms were specified as non slippery walls both the left wall of the freshwater reservoir except from z 0 310 m to 0 320 m and the right wall of the saltwater reservoir except from z 0 345 m to 0 355 m were specified as non slippery initial gas pressure was static zero at z 0 60 cm and the initial water pressure was equal to the gas pressure at the water level of 0 355 m and to the hydrostatic pressure below that water level in the limited system gas pressure was not imposed but was always variable at the upper surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads furthermore gas pressure was not considered in the limited system simulation because no gas phase existed above the surface water overlying the 0 2 mm glass beads and water pressure was variable only at the upper boundary of the surface water zone the initial salt concentration was 1 0 because in the experiment the two dimensional tank was initially filled with saltwater however above z 0 355 m the initial water pressure in the freshwater reservoir was specified as hydrostatic when the water level was 0 388 m and the initial salt concentration was specified as 0 0 thus the freshwater reservoir above z 0 355 m was initially filled with freshwater the gas pressure at the upper boundary of the freshwater reservoir was added to the initial water pressure above 0 355 m in the freshwater reservoir both the initial void fraction of water in the surface water and the initial water saturation in the glass beads below z 0 355 m were specified as 1 0 and the void fraction of water in the atmosphere was specified as 0 0 initial water saturation in the glass beads above 0 355 m was calculated by using the van genuchten model as follows fig 7 23 s w 1 1 αp cwg β γ the limited darcy system consisted of only glass beads and surface water and excluded the reservoirs at either side of the tank water pressure was imposed as hydrostatic pressure when the water level was z 0 388 m and salt concentration and water saturation were imposed as 0 0 and 1 0 respectively below z 0 388 cm water saturation was calculated with eq 23 using the gas water capillary pressure at the left boundary of the analytical domain at the right boundary water pressure was imposed as hydrostatic pressure when the water level was z 0 355 m saturation was imposed as 1 0 however a salt concentration was not imposed at this boundary the right boundary was surface water above z 0 200 m and glass beads below z 0 200 m the boundary conditions at the top of the glass beads and surface water and at the bottom of the analytical domain were the same as those of the limited system initial water pressure was specified as hydrostatic pressure when the initial water level was z 35 5 cm initial saturation was 1 0 below that water level and elsewhere it was derived by using eq 23 and the gas water capillary pressure which was equal to the difference between gas pressure i e 0 and the water pressure the dtransu method nishigaki et al 1993 cannot deal with gas pressure variation in a porous medium because the gas pressure is 0 0 everywhere and at all times and also because darcy s law and the mass conservation law are applied to describe water flow but not gas flow darcy s law was therefore applied to the surface water flow in the limited darcy system where the permeability of the surface water which must be much greater than that of the glass beads was set to 1 05 10 2 m2 hydraulic conductivity of 115 7 cm s in addition porosity in the surface water was specified as 1 0 fig 7 in the full system simulation atmosphere was added to the limited system thus the boundary and initial conditions of the reservoirs surface water and 0 2 mm glass beads except for the upper surfaces of the surface water and glass beads in the space between the stainless steel nets were the same as those in the limited system simulation in the full system simulation the upper surfaces of the surface water and glass beads in the space between the stainless steel nets in contact with the atmosphere could move and be permeable respectively the upper and side boundaries of the atmosphere in the full system were specified as non slippery walls gas pressure was imposed as 0 0 at the upper boundary of the atmosphere and was initially static within the atmosphere fig 8 the finite element grid for the limited system simulation consisted of 4214 nodes 4095 rectangular elements and some triangular elements the analytical domain for the limited darcy system simulation included 13 419 nodes and was divided into 13 248 elements and the analytical domain for the full system simulation included 15 705 nodes and 15 516 elements the elements in the limited darcy and full system domains were mostly rectangular but some were triangular the analytical domain for the full system was divided vertically at intervals of 0 25 cm to 1 0 cm the part of the analytical domain from z 0 300 m to z 0 425 m where the 0 2 mm glass beads were unsaturated with water and where freshwater flowed into the freshwater reservoir and water was discharged from the tank was more finely divided than the other parts the full system domain was divided horizontally on the left side at intervals of 0 50 cm to 1 011 cm and on the right side at intervals of 2 022 cm in contrast the limited system domain was divided vertically at intervals of 0 241 cm to 2 0 cm and horizontally at intervals of 0 50 cm to 1 999 cm the finite element grid of the limited system was also finer where the glass beads were unsaturated and around the freshwater inlet and tank outlet the finite element grid of the full system was finer than that of the limited system so that the movement of the free water surface would be rigorously reproduced in the full system simulation with atmosphere the analytical domain for the limited darcy system was divided vertically at intervals of 0 25 cm and horizontally at intervals of 2 021 cm thus the finite element grid of the limited darcy system was finer than that of the limited system but slightly coarser than that of the full system the boundaries between saltwater and freshwater in the experiment could be visually identified in the video images by color furthermore the salt concentration in the images could be qualitatively estimated from the intensity of the yellow color in the experiment the main freshwater front arrived at about x 42 cm measured from the left wall of the tank on the upper surface of the glass beads at the elapsed time of 5 h the main freshwater front obtained by the simulation with the full system moved similarly to the one in the experiment however the main freshwater front obtained by the simulation with the limited system moved faster than the one in the experiment the simulated front had moved about 15 cm beyond the experimental front at the elapsed time of 5 h thus the front configuration obtained by the limited system simulation differed from the configuration of both the experiment and the full system simulation at the elapsed time of 5 h the surface water level in the experiment was at z 36 7 cm the height above the bottom of the tank which was 1 2 cm higher than the water level of z 35 5 cm imposed in the simulations however the freshwater layer at the top of the surface water observed in the experiment was not present in the simulation results fig 9 as was the case at the elapsed time of 5 h at the elapsed time of 10 h the position of the freshwater front obtained by the simulation with the full system was similar to that in the experiment and different from that obtained by the simulation with the limited system furthermore in both the full system and limited system simulations a freshwater layer appeared at the top of the surface water in the distributions of the void fraction of water the minimum salt concentration in the surface water obtained by the full system simulation was about 0 6 at about 2 cm below the water level compared with 0 0 at the water level in the limited system simulation in this respect the limited system simulation result was similar to the experimental result however the freshwater thickness of 8 5 cm in the full system simulation was closer to the experimental thickness than the thickness in the limited system simulation in the salt concentration distribution obtained by the full system simulation a small saltwater zone with the maximum salt concentration 1 0 remained in the freshwater zone 3 to 8 cm behind the main freshwater front because this small saltwater zone was still connected to the main saltwater zone at the elapsed time of 10 h in the full system simulation the salt concentration at the top of the surface water was larger than that at about 2 cm below the water level fig 10 the difference in the position of the main freshwater front within the glass beads between the limited system simulation and the experiment became slightly smaller at elapsed times exceeding 10 h however the location and configuration of the main freshwater front within the glass beads obtained by the full system simulation continued to be similar to those of the experiment the main freshwater front in the limited system simulation always moved faster in the glass beads than it did in the full system simulation or in the experiment therefore the simulation with the full system could more accurately reproduce the movement of saltwater in the 0 2 mm glass beads than the simulation with the limited system could figs 9 12 the salt concentration became progressively more diluted with freshwater as time elapsed and at 20 h it was 0 0 in the area of the separate small saltwater zone seen at 10 h the small saltwater zone in the glass beads could also be observed by close inspection of the video image obtained at the elapsed time of 10 h in the experiment although its pale yellow color was hard to distinguish from the gray color of the surrounding freshwater at 15 and 20 h this saltwater zone could no longer be seen in the video images although it could be detected in the salt concentration distributions obtained by the full system simulation from 10 to 15 h this result that the present full system simulation but not the present limited system simulation could reproduce the small separated saltwater zone indicates that fluid pressure and flow in a surface water atmosphere system must be considered to precisely simulate the movement of salt in a porous medium that is in contact with the atmosphere the thickness of the freshwater layer at the top of the surface water obtained by the limited system simulation increased with elapsed time and was 7 5 cm at 20 h in contrast the thickness of the freshwater layer in the experiment and in the full system simulation increased to 6 8 cm and 8 5 cm respectively at 10 h and it decreased in both to 5 0 cm at 15 h then after 15 h it remained approximately steady in both at 20 h this layer was 5 9 and 5 3 cm thick in the experiment and the full system simulation respectively at 20 h therefore the freshwater layer thickness simulated with the full system was closer to the experimental result than that simulated with the limited system these results showed that the full system simulation better reproduced the freshwater thickness variation obtained experimentally in the limited system simulation conducted with the asgmf numerical simulation method the 0 9 salt concentration contour was 11 cm ahead of the experimental boundary between freshwater and saltwater at the elapsed time of 20 h and in the limited darcy system simulation conducted with the dtransu method this contour was 10 cm ahead of the experimental boundary furthermore the salt concentration distribution in the glass beads obtained by the asgmf numerical simulation method for the limited system was similar to that obtained by the dtransu method for the limited darcy system compare fig 12b and c however the salt concentration distribution in the surface water differed between these two simulation methods and systems at 20 h the surface water salt concentration obtained by the dtransu method for the limited darcy system was still 1 0 close to the right boundary even though a salt concentration was not imposed at this boundary in contrast in the limited system simulation result as indicated above a 7 5 cm thick layer of freshwater had formed on the top of the surface water at 20 h that extended all the way to the right boundary therefore the surface water flow could not be accurately reproduced by treating the surface water as an extremely high permeability layer and applying darcy s law furthermore the boundary between freshwater and saltwater obtained by both the limited darcy system simulation and the limited system simulation differed from the experimental boundary therefore accurate numerical simulation of variable density flow in subsurface in contact with the atmosphere and surface water requires consideration of both gas and water flow and pressure variations in a surface water atmosphere system in summary the saltwater distributions obtained by the asgmf numerical simulation method differed somewhat between the limited system and the full system simulations in particular between the elapsed times of 5 and 10 h moreover the small saltwater zone that appeared below the top of the glass beads in the main freshwater zone in the full system simulation at 10 h which influenced the salt concentration distribution in the surface water was not seen in the limited system simulation at the elapsed time of 10 h the salt concentration in the surface water had decreased to only about 0 5 in the full system simulation in the experimental results as in the full system simulation results a small indistinct saltwater zone appeared in the vicinity of the surface of the main freshwater zone at 10 h but its yellow color was lighter than the saltwater color suggesting a lower salt concentration although the salt concentration in this zone was not quantified by measurement with a salinometer the yellow color of the surface water near the water level above the glass beads was slightly lighter at 10 h than at 15 h compare figs 10a and 11a thus at the elapsed time of 10 h the experimental salt concentration in the surface water was not zero and it was also consistent with the salt concentration in surface water in the full system simulation though the salt concentration was not quantitatively determined during the experiment furthermore the thickness of the freshwater layer at the top of the surface water obtained by the full system simulation was closer to the experimental thickness than the thickness obtained by the other simulations thus on the whole the salt concentration distribution in the surface water obtained by the full system simulation was similar to that obtained by the experiment conducted for this study the flow in the surface water was not turbulent an eddy was observed neither in the surface water in the experiment nor in the full limited system figs 9 12 therefore using dns to simulate the 2 d tank experiment was appropriate even though the mesh was too coarse for dns to capture small scale turbulence in addition the limited system results differed from the full system results because of the different boundary conditions between the atmosphere and the glass beads or surface water in particular the flow pattern in the upper part of the glass beads in the limited system simulation was clearly inconsistent with that of the full system simulation a variable water pressure cannot generally be imposed at the upper surface of a porous medium that is unsaturated with water but gas pressure can be imposed as zero which is equal to atmospheric pressure in the present simulations with both the limited system and the full system gas pressure was not imposed at the surface of the glass beads so gas pressure could vary at this surface thus the water saturation could also vary at this surface the boundary conditions at the surface of the glass beads in the limited system were similar to those in the full system except for the presence of atmosphere or surface water above the surface in the full system however after the appearance of surface water at the surface of the glass beads gas in the atmosphere was permitted to flow through this upper surface of the glass beads in the full system simulation streamlines and water flow directions obtained by the limited system simulation at the elapsed time of 20 h indicated that water in the 0 2 mm glass beads flowed parallel to the upper surface of the porous medium where it was not in contact with surface water and it did not flow out across the surface of the medium instead water in the porous medium flowed into the surface water except at the left side of the porous medium water flow within the surface water was complicated and displayed no particular trend fig 13 in the full system simulation freshwater under the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads flowed to the atmosphere and a very thin layer of surface water flowed down and to the right along the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads at the elapsed time of 20 h furthermore water in the 0 2 mm glass beads where they underlay the surface water flowed into the surface water across the surface of the beads at x 60 cm to x 154 cm freshwater flowed one way horizontally into the saltwater reservoir and in the surface water layer saltwater circulated clockwise under the freshwater layer at the surface the water in the beads was exchanged through the surface of beads with surface water at three points from x 154 cm to 190 cm furthermore saltwater in the glass beads circulated above the bottom of the tank close to the freshwater front at the elapsed time 10 h in the full system simulation saltwater was transported into the surface water in the area where a small saltwater zone formed by flows between the glass beads and the surface water near the intersection between the surface of the beads and the free water surface consequently a small saltwater zone with a higher salt concentration than the concentration below the zone formed beneath the free water surface at the elapsed time of 20 h water flow occurred from left to right above the small saltwater zone which was located on the upstream side of x 50 cm this point was itself on the upstream side of the intersection between the surface of the beads and the free water surface in detail the water flowed over the top of the small saltwater zone from its upstream side to its downstream side and then into the surface water water also flowed out of the 0 2 mm glass beads across the surface of the beads on the downstream side of the small saltwater zone whereas surface water above the small saltwater zone flowed parallel to the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads as a result water could not stream through the small saltwater zone or transport saltwater in this zone this small saltwater zone eventually disappeared as the salt concentration became diluted through dispersion it can be inferred that the water flow above the small saltwater zone resulted from the fluid pressure balance at the intersection between the porous medium 0 2 mm glass beads the surface water and the atmosphere however it is necessary to confirm that this phenomenon can be reproduced by additional experiments and numerical simulations under the same conditions in contrast in the limited system simulation the water beneath the upper surface of the glass beads flowed parallel to the surface of the beads and then out into the surface water where it overlay the beads consequently in the limited system saltwater in the beads was washed out into the surface water in the vicinity of the intersection between the water surface and the upper surface of the glass beads but this flow in the limited system was not consistent with the flow observed in the experiment figs 13 and 14 water flows in the 0 2 mm glass beads differed between the limited system and full system simulations in the limited system simulation the water flow in the glass beads was simpler than that in the full system simulation but the flow trends in the full system simulation were clearer than those in the limited system simulation in the full system simulation gas circulated counterclockwise in the atmosphere and then flowed in the direction of the outlet at the surface of the glass beads fig 15 the horizontal gas flow at the free water surface influenced the surface water flow causing saltwater in the surface water to circulate fig 14 furthermore this saltwater circulation in the surface water caused the water flow at the surface of the glass beads to be complicated in the full system simulation as in many multi phase flow simulations gas flow in the atmosphere was caused by the surface water flow and at the boundary between the surface water and the atmosphere the flow velocity in the atmosphere should be equal to that in the surface water the simulated flows in the atmosphere and surface water were both moderate and real the maximum velocities in the atmosphere and surface water were 0 214 and 0 290 m s respectively however in the full system simulation the gas might be incompressible because the mach number of the gas reached a maximum of 6 45 10 4 and is very small the flow trends simulated in the 0 2 mm glass beads in contact with the surface water atmosphere system differed greatly between the limited system and the full system simulations because of the different boundary conditions at the surface of the glass beads and at the free water surface in the limited system simulation water in the glass beads was not permitted to flow out across the surface of the beads into the atmosphere thus a thin surface water layer could not form above the glass beads in contrast in the full system simulation fluid could freely flow out of the glass beads into the atmosphere and a thin layer of surface water formed on the surface of the beads that was above the free water surface further gas in the atmosphere flowed parallel to the surface of the glass beads fig 15 and this gas flow was influenced by the formation of the thin surface water layer and by water flow in that layer accordingly both the gas flow in the atmosphere and surface water flow could influence water flow in the 0 2 mm glass beads and therefore the final saltwater distribution however additional investigations of the influence of gas flow on fluid flow in subsurface are needed in the future to clarify the influence of gas and surface water flows simulations of practical scale analytical domains such as the simulations of robinson et al 2007a will be conducted the maximum velocities v in the 0 2 glass beads surface water and atmosphere were 1 03 10 3 0 290 and 0 214 m s respectively at the elapsed time of 20 h thus by using the typical length l of 1 800 m and the densities ρ and viscosities μ shown in table 2 the reynolds numbers lv μ ρ in the 0 2 mm glass beads surface water and atmosphere were calculated to be 1717 483 333 and 25 680 respectively and the froude numbers v gl 0 5 were calculated to be 2 45 10 4 6 90 10 2 and 5 10 10 2 respectively next practical velocities in the 0 2 glass beads surface water and atmosphere were computed by using the practical length lp 200 m which is the practical length used in the numerical simulations conducted by robinson et al 2007a reynolds numbers and froude numbers in actual field experiments should be equal to those in the two dimensional tank experiment but usually this condition is not met in many cases however either the reynolds numbers or the froude numbers in field studies conducted at practical scale are equal to those in laboratory experiments the froude number at practical scale was set to be the same in both systems when the reciprocal of the reynolds number is smaller than that of the froude number thus the practical velocities v p calculated by using v p v lp l 0 5 in the 0 2 mm glass beads surface water and atmosphere were 1 11 10 2 3 06 and 2 26 m s respectively which are moderate flows at the elapsed time of 20 h in the two dimensional tank experiment the non dimensional time t in the surface water when maximum velocity was reached obtained by using t v l t was 3 22 the practical time t p was then obtained by using t p t lp v p because the non dimensional time at practical scale should be consistent with that in the laboratory experiment thus t p in the 0 2 glass beads surface water and atmosphere was calculated to be 2473 days 211 h and 286 h respectively this result shows that time period of the experiment was adequate to estimate flows at practical scale because the practical time was 2473 days in the 0 2 mm glass beads water pressure under the free water surface was similar between the full system and limited system simulations however water pressure under the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads that were in contact with the atmosphere was smaller in the full system simulation than in the limited system simulation at the elapsed time of 20 h water pressure was less than 0 5 kpa at the top of the glass beads in the full system simulation and in the limited system simulation the minimum water pressure value exceeded 0 5 kpa everywhere within the glass beads fig 16 in the full system simulation some water pressure contours under the surface of the glass beads where they were in contact with the atmosphere were concave whereas these contours were convex in the limited system simulation this difference in contour shape was caused by the differences in the direction of water flow described above and these different trends were attributable to the different boundary conditions at the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads consequently these results indicated that gas in the atmosphere above the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads interacted with the water within the 0 2 mm glass beads they also indicated therefore that even though many researchers have ignored surface water and atmosphere and specified the water pressure as hydrostatic in numerical simulations of variable density water flow in subsurface coupled with a surface water atmosphere system in some situations it might be necessary to take account of the atmosphere and surface water to improve the accuracy of in such simulations furthermore in the future the detected influences of the surface water atmosphere system on subsurface need to be verified by conducting simulations with a turbulence closure model instead of by using dns as in the present simulations as shown by the above results it is hard to accurately reproduce the salt concentration and variable density flows in surface water by the simple simulation methods used previously however it is not necessary to use the asgmf numerical simulation method to reproduce variable density flow deep under the ground where the variation in the salt concentration in surface water has little or no influence in such cases the previous simple simulation methods might be better than the asgmf numerical simulation method the asgmf numerical simulation method would be best employed to accurately reproduce the salt concentration distribution and variable density flow in surface water in situations where they influence the flow in the underlying subsurface 3 conclusion this study first conducted numerical simulations of variable density flow and transport of salt in a porous medium consisting of silica beads with the asgmf numerical simulation method and then compared the simulated salt concentration distributions with the visually observed boundary between freshwater and saltwater obtained by experiment the 0 1 to 0 3 salt concentration contours in the steady and transient flow fields obtained by the asgmf numerical simulation method were consistent with the visually observed boundary between freshwater and saltwater obtained experimentally these results confirm that the asgmf numerical simulation method can accurately reproduce salt concentration distributions due to variable density flow and salt transport in a porous medium next this study conducted a two dimensional tank experiment with a porous medium 0 2 mm glass beads and a surface water atmosphere system and two simulations using the asgmf numerical simulation method and a third simulation using a simpler simulation method the dtransu method this study then compared the simulated salt concentration distributions in the surface water atmosphere system and 0 2 mm glass beads with the visually observed boundary between saltwater and freshwater in the experiment salt concentration distributions obtained by the asgmf numerical simulation method differed between a full system simulation atmosphere surface water and 0 2 mm glass beads and a limited system simulation surface water and 0 2 mm glass beads in the limited system simulation water under the surface of the glass beads where they were in contact with the atmosphere flowed parallel to the surface and then out of the glass beads into the surface water in the full system simulation however water under the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads first flowed out to the atmosphere and then into the surface water and surface water that infiltrated into the glass beads flowed in and out of the glass beads several times on the right side of the two dimensional tank surface water flows obtained by the limited system simulation did not display any consistent pattern whereas in the full system simulation water in the top surface water layer flowed horizontally in the direction of the tank outlet and water under the horizontal flow circulated the water flow and salt concentration distribution in the full system simulation were similar to those in the experiment salt concentration distributions in glass beads in contact with surface water have frequently been simulated by a simple numerical method based on darcy s law for water flow and a semi lagrangian method for salt transport in the surface water which is modeled as a layer with extremely high permeability the salt concentration distribution of the present two dimensional tank experiment reproduced by the simulation with the simpler method that used darcy s law was similar only to that reproduced deep within the glass beads by the limited system simulation but this simpler numerical simulation method could not accurately reproduce the salt concentration distribution in the surface water in the full system simulation a thin layer of surface water formed on the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads because water beneath the surface of the beads was able to flow out to the atmosphere water flow in this thin surface water layer influenced not only the water pressure at the surface of the 0 2 mm glass beads but also water flow in the beads under the surface water furthermore the surface water circulation affected water flow at the surface of the glass beads and caused complicated flows close to the saltwater reservoir furthermore the experimental salt concentration distribution was similar to that obtained by the full system simulation that included the atmosphere therefore water flow and water pressure in a porous medium can be influenced by water flow and water pressure in the surface water many studies have ignored the influence of flow and pressure in the atmosphere and surface water on flow in the subsurface and have treated water pressure in surface water as hydrostatic however fluid flow and fluid pressure in both the atmosphere and surface water might need to be considered to accurately simulate variable density flow and salt transport in surface water and a shallow subsurface in the vicinity of the atmosphere and surface water in a future study a practical scale simulation is required to further investigate and clarify the influence of gas and water flow on groundwater flow and salt transport in the subsurface furthermore to confirm the influence of the surface water atmosphere system on subsurface flows

1498,groundwater and surface water contamination by nitrogen can produce serious health issues particularly regarding the contraction of methemoglobinemia in infants prevention of this disorder is a main reason for regulating drinking water quality in new zealand to assist the management of water quality in the upper waikato catchment in the light of growing intensification of nitrogen producing land uses a regional groundwater flow and contamination transport model was developed to assess probable future nitrogen concentrations calibration of the steady state model was achieved with a root mean square error of 4 7 for groundwater levels and 7 9 for gains and losses in river flow within the catchment model performance was assisted by relationships determined between sio2 concentrations in groundwater and water age modelling coupled with water aging indicates that the mean residence time of contributing water in the upper waikato catchment ranges from 5 to 101 years with an average of 50 years some 77 of surface water is sourced from groundwater which is likely to convey the predominant contribution to the total nitrogen load nitrogen concentrations are increasing but the long term total load is difficult to estimate owing largely to lack of information about historical land use and the degree of attenuation of nitrogen the model and results obtained may be employed to provide information on water travel time distributions appropriate source location and surface water receiving reaches in rivers and streams all of which is important and necessary for effective water quality management in the catchment keywords groundwater nitrogen non point source contamination water age water management 1 introduction freshwater resources on earth make up less than 1 of water availability for human consumption du plessis 2017 lui et al 2011 it is important to be able to understand and measure the quality status of water used for drinking domestic irrigation and industrial purposes numerous natural and anthropogenic factors control the chemistry of surface and groundwater in an area appelo and postma 2005 hounslow 2018 lockhart et al 2013 pauwels et al 2010 contamination and overexploitation of water resources owing to anthropogenic activities in particular is a serious and increasing issue around the world including in new zealand nitrogen n contamination in water resources can lead to a condition known as methemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrome and has also been linked to cancer through the formation of carcinogenic n nitroso compounds wedge et al 2001 to spontaneous abortions centers for disease control and prevention 1996 and to non hodgkin lymphoma ward et al 1996 nitrogen occurs naturally in low concentrations in surface stream and groundwater but n fertilizer and animal manure applied to soil for example in dairying can through leaching or surface runoff to streams cause elevation of levels above safe values for human health owens et al 1992 other activities of human beings which have changed the balance of nitrogen include burning fossil fuels for energy barnyards septic systems feedlots silos buried waste fertilizer storage and disposal of organic wastes nowatzki 2001 here concern lies with the upper waikato catchment where groundwater quality is naturally high but is deteriorating as a result of land use intensification and deforestation weir and rajanayaka 2014 compounding this concern is the lag time between increasing land use changes whose subsequent effects on water quality will take years to manifest elliott and semadeni davies 2013 used a catchment model to predict long term equilibrium nitrogen concentrations at various water quality measuring sites in the upper waikato catchment for current contaminant loadings from diffuse and point sources municipal industrial wastewater and geothermal as to when an equilibrium concentration might be achieved was not considered one approach to estimating catchment water quality response to increased n loading is to assume it results from two processes firstly a rapid adjustment to land use changes primarily from forest to dairying transmitted through runoff and shallow groundwater flow paths and secondly a slower adjustment or lag resulting from a component of the load moving through the deeper groundwater system based on these assumptions and with the aim of estimating groundwater flow paths and travel times to surface water bodies our approach was to develop a regional groundwater flow and contaminant transport model with inputs from water aging measurements this general modelling approach has been investigated or applied internationally by for instance abrams et al 2015 furlong et al 2011 harman 2019 koh et al 2018 molenat and gascuel odoux 2002 weissmann et al 2002 and puckett and cowdery 2002 the use of water aging has been employed in numerous studies of n in groundwater see for example böhlke and denver 1995 da pelo et al 2018 katz et al 2004 katz et al 2001 tesoriero et al 2007 in new zealand gusyev et al 2015 2014 employed modflow modpath methods with modflow mt3dms and lumped parameter models to estimate transit times of n to streams similarly environment canterbury 2019 used stochastic modelling techniques with modflow modpath particle tracking to predict mean residence times and source zones for groundwater supply bores and groundwater fed streams water aging studies of n contamination have been conducted by for example morgenstern and daughney 2012 and stewart et al 2011 the objective of this study is to provide information and a model for assessing probable future nitrogen contamination of water resources in the upper waikato catchment and the likely time for the change to equilibrate in stream waters to assist in the management of water quality and in policy development for appropriate land uses 2 study area the study area comprises the upper waikato river surface water catchment from the outflow at lake taupo through to lake karapiro the catchment is situated in the central north island of new zealand fig 1 and has an area of approximately 436 000 ha the area has a largely temperate climate with average maximum temperatures ranging between 13 8 and 30 c in summer dec feb and 5 and 17 7 c in winter june aug mean annual rainfall varies between 1100 and 1950 mm year within the catchment tait and woods 2007 predominately due to topographic influences and wind direction while weather extremes can be experienced at any time of year the highest rainfalls occur in winter the study area is a nationally important agricultural and power generation catchment which comprises eight hydro electric dams on the waikato river fig 1 producing around 13 of electricity needs in new zealand waikato river authority 2010 the state of environment report of the waikato regional council shows that 91 of water within the catchment is allocated for agriculture and horticulture related activities with 5 for domestic and municipal water supply and 4 for industries waikato regional council 2019a 2 1 geology catchment geology is dominated by pleistocene volcanic rocks associated with three periods of eruptions over the past 300 000 years superimposed on basement greywacke aquifers in the catchment consist of geological units of ignimbrite rhyolite and volcanoclastic sediments white et al 2015 wilson et al 2009 due to the high porosity of these volcanic pumice sediments water storage is relatively large and surface quickflow is relatively small consequently surface flows in the area are dominated by baseflow white et al 2015 surface recharge from relatively high rainfalls increases nutrient leaching of n into groundwater aquifers 2 2 land use current land use comprises 53 pasture 32 production forestry 13 native vegetation less than 1 urban and 1 open water dairying forestry energy production hydroelectricity and geothermal and the tourism industry are the dominant economic activities within the catchment forestry and pastoral farming are the predominant land uses but in recent years there has been a marked increase in forest to dairy conversions and land use intensification waikato regional council 2019b 2 3 hydrology the main hydrological feature of the catchment is the upper section of the 425 km long waikato river the longest river in new zealand mean discharge of the river within the catchment is 260 m3 s at karapiro and 340 m3 s at the river mouth below our study area river flows are controlled by the eight dams and control gates at the lake taupo outflow fig 1 for which the mean annual outflow is 156 m3 s highest flows generally occur in winter it has been estimated that there is little or no change in small 1 in 5 year or medium 1 20 year floods as a result of land use changes which occurred prior to 2010 however using the same analysis it has been estimated that on average there has been a 4 increase in large floods due to the occurrence of 1 in 100 year rainfalls and reductions in rainfall losses owing to land use changes environment waikato 2010 a number of tributaries contribute approximately 100 m3 s within the catchment aquifers provide sustained flows during droughts and the dams also moderate flood flows generated by high rainfall events brown 2010 waikato regional council 2019b 3 materials and methods 3 1 data topographical groundwater well information n and tritium concentrations surface water flow n and tritium concentrations and land use data for the model were supplied by waikato regional council wrc note that long term n data is only available for total n for the catchment consequently this study employs total n to assess changes in n concentration in groundwater owing to land use changes locations of water quality measuring sites are shown in fig 2 geological formation data and estimates of water age based on tritium analysis were supplied by the institute of geological and nuclear sciences new zealand climate data was obtained from the virtual climate station network of the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa tait and woods 2007 and soil water holding properties profile available water from the new zealand fundamental soil layer newsome et al 2008 groundwater recharge under diferent climate soil land use combinations were calculated using the soil crop water balance model irricalc bright 2009 irricalc uses the theoretical framework of the daily soil moisture water balance modelling by the food and agricultural organization allen et al 1998 as outlined above there are diverse current land uses within the study area however there are also significant areas of forest which have recently been converted to farming especially dairying hawke 2004 the parliamentary commission for the environment 2013 demonstrated that there is a clear correlation between large scale land use change to dairy farming and increases in the n stress on waterways in new zealand there are also growing public concerns about this connection parliamentary commission for the environment 2015 todd and kerr 2009 consequently this analysis included identification of areas that currently are or are likely to be in the future utilised for farming activities the groundwater flow paths that start under these farmed areas were assessed separately from flow paths originating under other land uses such as forestry based on the land cover database version 3 lcdbv3 landcare 2013 to try to identify the likely water quality response time to changes in land use intensity in these areas fig 3 shows the different land use areas farm forest and other urban built up areas and surface water bodies 3 2 quickflow the quickflow component of the rainfall surface runoff interflow and laterally moving shallow groundwater was estimated using a simple quickflow separation process involving calibrating parameters using the measured mean daily flows the net groundwater recharge was calculated as drainage estimated by the soil crop water balance model minus quickflow to estimate quickflow for the model area the measured flows in the waiotapu stream from 2002 to 2014 were firstly separated into baseflow from groundwater and quickflow components using the method of ladson et al 2013 as the potential quickflow component from different combinations of land use climate slope soil characteristics can be different the drainage outputs of the irricalc model bright 2009 for the waiotapu catchment above a threshold value were separated into deep drainage and lateral flow which generates quickflow the difference between the daily quickflow of the observed flow data estimated using ladson et al 2013 and the lateral flow component of the irricalc model was minimised through calibration in the calibration process quickflow contribution from each combination plus the threshold that generates lateral flow were changed using an optimisation process additionally a five day running weighted average was used to represent the quickflow time series to account for lag times and storage in the upper soils the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 of the calibration is 0 58 the optimised values for each combination were used to estimate quickflow for the other sub catchments the estimated quickflow of each sub catchment was added to relevant tributary flows 3 3 flows at water quality sites the modelled age distribution of surface water was obtained at the surface water quality monitoring sites which are shown in fig 3 the modelled average river and stream flows along with wrc measured flows and estimations based from a rainfall runoff model topnet bandaragoda et al 2004 are given in table 1 topnet uses topmodel beven et al 1995 beven and kirkby 1979 concepts for the representation of sub surface storage controlling the dynamics of the saturated contributing area and baseflow recession the topnet model is widely used for estimating river flows within new zealand niwa 2019 results of flows against n concentrations at water quality monitoring sites are discussed in section 4 4 for reasons of brevity we introduce the n concentration data in that section 3 4 model development the conceptual groundwater model was developed based on the existing understanding of geology and hydrology of the area as outlined in section 2 details of the conceptual model development can be found in weir and rajanayaka 2014 the commonly employed modflow harbaugh 2005 flow model and mt3dms zheng 2010 zheng 1992 transport model termed the combined modflow mt3dms model as the model in this paper were adopted to simulate steady state saturated flow and contaminant transport in the groundwater system the model was also used to simulate flows in the waikato river and all major tributaries in the study area by means of the str1 package prudic 1989 this integrated regional model was constructed on a 1 km 1 km grid with 20 numerical layers to represent complex geological formations the 20 layers are of equal thickness at any given location but the total thickness varies spatially for example where the total thickness to basement rock is 400 m each numerical layer is 20 m thick but where the basement rock is 200 m deep each numerical layer is only 10 m thick model zonification was based on the geological formations shown in appendix a hydraulic properties were allowed to vary spatially to accommodate hydraulic variability within any geological formation using pilot points doherty et al 2010 initial conditions for the model were set as the results of the previous steady state calibration run which provided a stable simulation boundary conditions of the model are land surface recharge calculated as the long term average using the irricalc model with spatially variable soils land use and rain rivers simulated using modflow s str1 package with inflow at lake taupo fig 1 and all other boundaries are no flow boundaries numerical modelling generally contains several inherent complications which can amplify when the model domain is large these complications include determining trade off between model accuracy and runtime parametrisation based on available data spatio temporal resolution to ensure model stability and spatial resolution grid size to preserve realistic numerical dispersion gelhar 1986 in transport modelling these issues are described in detailed in weir and rajanayaka 2014 uncertainty analyses were carried out to inform the confidence of model results and identify the areas where more monitoring is needed to improve the accuracy of the model in the future a detailed description of the uncertainty analyses is given in rajanayaka 2017 the integrated model along with forward particle tracking using the modpath package pollock 2016 was used to estimate flow paths and particle travel times for groundwater this was undertaken by releasing particles at the surface of every cell in the model to calculate the travel time for particles to reach surface water bodies our approach is to use mean residence time mrt of water and its distribution to assess changes in n contamination in groundwater water at a given location has different ages which were placed in different bins based on the age as shown in section 4 3 the mrt was calculated by multiplying the volume of water within each age bin by the mean age of the bin and then dividing by the total water volume to assist with the validation of the integrated model estimates of mrt at various water quality measuring sites were made by determining a relationship between sio2 concentrations in surface water and mrt estimated using tritium as suggested by morgenstern et al 2010 the basis of this relationship is that sio2 concentrations are generally very low in rainfall in humid regions but increase as water infiltrates deep into the soil and passes through sub surface materials owing to dissolution of silicate minerals where these exist white 1995 the longer water resides in a zone with silicate minerals the higher sio2 concentrations become because the geological composition of the sub surface material affects the relationship between sio2 concentrations and water age the relationship was only applied in catchments with ignimbrite geology where the relationship was comparable catchments subject to geothermal effects were not included in the analysis because elevated water temperatures enhance the dissolution of sio2 monthly samples were taken for a year september 2010 to 2011 from water quality measuring sites located in non geothermal sites in the lake taupo and upper waikato regions fig 1 as surface water sio2 concentrations are related to the source of water that is near surface versus deeper groundwater the 12 monthly sio2 data were correlated for the effect of flow by removing any samples taken at high flows where surface sources would have been contributing to and diluting sio2 concentrations the relevant mrt values determined from tritium analysis and the corresponding sio2 values as listed in table 2 and are well modelled by an exponential relationship fig 4 while this relationship is subject to some uncertainty it assists in developing an expanded spatial dataset of the mrt which is limited within the study catchment for enhanced verification of the mean age and estimation of age distribution benefits of this approach are expected to outweigh the potential introduced uncertainty the additional estimated mrt values using measured sio2 were used in the modflow mt3dms model calibration 3 5 model calibration the groundwater flow component of the model was calibrated using parameter estimation software pest developed by doherty 2018 with a combination of pilot points doherty et al 2010 and parameter zones the integrated model was calibrated simultaneously against measured groundwater levels river gains losses and both surface and groundwater concentrations of n and tritium during the calibration process porosity and dispersivity parameters of the mt3dms model were calibrated against both tritium and nitrate concentration observations the flow calibration achieved a normalised root mean square error rmse of 4 7 for groundwater levels with a coefficient of determination of r2 0 95 fig 5 the model volumetric water budget error for the entire model domain was 0 25 the normalised rmse for the river gains was 7 9 fig 6 the calibrated horizontal hydraulic conductivity ranges from 0 03 to 100 m day and vertical hydraulic conductivity was kept to 10 of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity at each cell the porosity of model domain varies between 0 0035 and 0 6 3 5 1 particle tracking and age distribution the age distribution of water at surface water quality monitoring sites was estimated using the model the surface water quality monitoring sites were chosen for this analysis as both flow and n data are available there the model estimates the saturated groundwater travel time from different locations in a catchment or sub catchment to its end point discharge into surface water using particle tracking the time each particle which is released into the groundwater table takes to travel to the water quality site is calculated this enables the mean age and age distribution of water at a water quality site to be estimated independently of estimates described in section 3 4 particle tracking from farmed lands which are classified as high producing exotic grassland in lcdbv3 landcare 2013 was conducted separately from other land use types it is highly likely that these lands are being used or will be used for intensification will tend to produce higher n loads consequently it was considered important to determine whether travel time from these land areas is materially different from travel times from the catchment as a whole 3 5 2 vadose zone the modflow model described in section 3 4 does not simulate flow through the vadose unsaturated zone however it was expected that travel times through the vadose zone in parts of the catchment would be significant given the depths to groundwater in some areas of the catchment the average simulated vadose zone thickness for the model area is approximately 60 m an estimate of the travel time through the shallow vadose zone has been derived from tracer experiments completed at the tutaeuaua sub catchment within the taupo catchment barkle et al 2011 tracer experiments in the taupo ignimbrite horizon have yielded an average travel rate of between 2 5 and 6 0 mm for every 1 mm of drainage below the root zone wöhling et al 2012 and barkle pers comm however these rates are applicable only for the shallow vadose zone within the depth the experiments were conducted hence it was assumed that the average travel rate of water is 4 mm for every 1 mm of drainage within the first 10 m below ground level the travel rate below 10 m will likely be lower as soil structure allows more lateral flow near the water table and declines in vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity as shown in many previous studies ameli et al 2016 anderson and burt 1978 harr 1977 weyman 1973 in the absence of measurement based estimates a vertical travel rate within the deeper vadose zone i e below 10 m of 2 mm for every 1 mm of drainage was assumed the average vadose zone travel time estimated by this method is 10 years for the modelled area with a range of approximately zero to 109 years depending on the total unsaturated thickness 4 results and discussion in what follows results relating to flow paths flows at surface water quality monitoring sites mean water age n in surface flows and trends in groundwater n concentrations are presented and discussed 4 1 flow paths the flow paths by which n reaches surface water are conceptually divided into either quickflow or baseflow which is assumed to be sourced from groundwater at times of low flow baseflow groundwater is assumed to be the only source of water contributing to surface water flow when precipitation occurs and flow increases the majority of the increase in flow is considered to be generated from quickflow the simulated water travel paths by the model are shown in fig 7 the flow paths originate at the centre of each of the uppermost layer model cells fig 7 shows the plan view of the 3d particle travel paths through all the layers to assist the reader with identifying general flow patterns from different parts of the model area a few selected flow paths are shown in fig 8 4 2 flows at water quality sites modelled measured and estimated flows at the surface water quality monitoring sites listed in table 1 show that the modelled flows are in reasonably good agreement with the measured and estimated flows it is important that the model accurately simulates the measured flows at these water quality monitoring sites as these sites were used to develop the water age distribution in section 4 3 to assess changes in n contamination in groundwater 4 3 mean age the modelled mean age of water at each of the water quality monitoring sites at mean flow are given in table 3 this table shows that the mean age for waters coming from farmed land are less compared to all waters in the upper parts of the catchment i e towards lake taupo first five rows in table 3 the ages of water coming from farmed areas were separately analysed because n concentrations of these waters are largely related to anthropogenic influences and can be managed through changes in land use management and regulation the locations of farmed lands shown in fig 3 are consistent with the lower ages as they are largely located at lower parts of each sub catchment closer to the water quality sites requiring relatively short travel distances and therefore times the mean ages for surface water quality monitoring sites in lower parts of the catchment i e near karapiro last five rows in table 3 show that there is no significant difference between the age for all waters compared to that coming from farmed lands fig 9 presents the age distribution for the waiotapu stream at campbell road bridge for both the whole sub catchment all waters and water leaching just through farmed lands as stated in section 3 2 surface water inflows have been assigned to tributaries to account for quickflow this is more relevant as the modflow model is a saturated groundwater model and it does not simulate the vadose zone and near surface water movements accurately so assigned surface water inflows offset the model s limitations however it is not possible to accurately assign surface water inflows at correct locations along the surface water tributaries and at correct ages this analysis assumes that the age of assigned quickflows is between 0 and 5 years which is plausible nevertheless there will be some uncertainties associated with model estimates of lag times primarily for steep head water sub catchments but as the contributions of flows from these small catchments are relatively minor table 1 the overall errors at the larger catchment level are probably insignificant as the age distribution of the lake taupo water is unknown overall distribution of water for the water quality sites in the waikato river cannot be estimated however the distributions for in catchment waters at water quality sites are given in appendix b these figures and fig 9 show that it is important to identify the age distribution in addition to the mean age which can be somewhat misleading the mean age of all water of the waiotapu stream at campbell road bridge fig 9 is 47 years but the age of approximately 80 of flows from all water is less than the mean age fig 9a as the mean age can be skewed by smaller flows with large ages consequently it is important to consider the age distribution when assessing water quality trends against land use trends and not just the mean age the mean age for waters coming from farming is 5 years which is significantly less than that of all water at the waiotapu stream water quality site 4 4 n in surface water flow there are a total of 16 surface water quality monitoring sites in tributary catchments in the upper waikato catchment that have monthly n concentration data starting from 1993 wrc 2018 at five of these sites 786 2 pokaiwhenua 388 1 mangakino 934 1 tahunaatara 683 4 otamakokore 1186 4 waiotapu where flow data was available the change in n concentrations in the groundwater contributing to surface water flow was estimated from the n concentrations in surface water samples collected only at low flows not all water leaving a tributary surface water catchment is occurring as surface water flow a proportion leaves the catchment by way of groundwater flow near surface flow interflow and laterally moving shallow groundwater generation in the upper waikato catchment generally occurs in areas where water tables are high under high water table conditions the lateral quicker pathways become an important mechanism for the export of n to the surface water in locations where the water table is deep and vertical sub surface flow is prevalent deeper groundwater flow paths are likely to dominate the export of n from the land and the catchment under this scenario n exits a tributary catchment predominantly via groundwater rather than surface water flow at four of the five water quality monitoring sites where the relationship between flow rate and n concentrations was available with time for the majority of the flow range the nitrogen concentrations increase linearly with flow this linear relationship holds until the concentrations are approaching their maximum the rate of increase in the concentration with flow then reduces see fig 10 for examples from the otamakokore and tahunaatara catchments the exception to this strong relationship between flow and nitrogen concentration is at the mangakino water quality site as also shown in fig 10 here the n concentration in the stream demonstrates a weaker relationship with flow with an explanation of variance r2 of 4 3 fig 10c this could be because quickflow has a nitrogen concentration similar to the deeper groundwater so the change in n concentration with increasing flow cannot be discerned the increase in nitrogen concentration with flow evident in fig 10 informs us that quickflow has an elevated n concentration compared to groundwater quickflow has a faster response to changes in land use for example from forestry to pastoral farming and is therefore expected to have a higher n concentration than the deeper groundwater which largely consists of older water as a consequence of this faster response of quickflow to land use changes it is also assumed that this pathway provides a mechanism by which the effects of changes in land use will manifest themselves sooner in surface water than in groundwater it is also reasonable to assume due to closer connection that quickflow will reach equilibrium concentrations with land use sooner than deeper groundwater flow the time for n in groundwater to reach an equilibrium concentration with land use is difficult to estimate and is related to a number of factors including the spatial distribution of changes in land use intensity in the catchment the network of surface water streams in a catchment the mrt and the age distributions of the water occurring in the groundwater consequently this model has been developed to help in assessing changes in n concentration owing to land use changes primarily from forestry to dairying using water aging 4 5 trend in groundwater n at the five water quality monitoring sites where both flow and nitrogen concentration data were available two linear regression lines were fitted to the data fig 11 the range of baseflow indices in these five catchments is 0 85 to 0 97 averaging 0 9 stdev 0 04 demonstrating that groundwater is the major contributor to streamflow therefore the slope of the trend line fitted through all stream data is also a good indicator of the trend in n concentrations in the groundwater to ensure a more robust estimation the slope of the trend line is additionally fitted through the lowest 10 of surface flow to confirm this trend in the groundwater only component the red line was fitted through all of the data and the second line blue was fitted through only those samples for which the flow rate at the time of sampling was within the lowest 10 of flow rates data points coloured blue while numerical values are obtained for the slopes these are only considered indicative of the rate of change in the groundwater as this method is a simplification of the actual processes occurring it should be noted that simple linear regressions were used in this study as the aim of trend analysis was to merely demonstrate the presence of high level trend rather than quantification of trends which was not within the scope of this study however linear regression techniques may not be suitable for trend detection analysis if the dataset is not normally distributed aguilar et al 2007 asfaw et al 2018 visser et al 2009 all lines fitted in fig 11 were significant at the 0 5 level table 4 contains information on the slopes of the fitted lines in all cases the slope of the lines fitted to the lowest 10 of flows was positive this implies that n concentrations in groundwater are increasing with time from groundwater modelling of the average flows in the tributary catchments it is estimated that 77 of the surface water flow is contributed by groundwater this indicates that at mean flow conditions groundwater is still making a significant contribution to flow at water quality sites 4 6 future work water ages can be modelled as contaminants as proposed by zheng 2009 this approach enables modelling both advection and hydrodynamic dispersion into the movement of water particles specifically a zero order decay constant can be set to 1 with appropriate initial conditions so that values of concentration at the end of the simulation then equate to the mrt 5 conclusions calibration of the steady state regional groundwater flow and contaminant transport model was achieved with a root mean square error of 4 7 for groundwater levels and 7 9 for gains and losses in river flow within the catchment a relationship between sio2 concentrations in surface water and mrt measured using tritium assisted in the verification of the groundwater flow component of the model the mrt for all water contributing to the mean flow at tributary water quality monitoring sites can vary between 5 and 101 years with an average of 51 years the estimated mean time of travel of water infiltrating from land areas that are most likely to have been subjected to intensification to the tributary water quality monitoring sites ranges between 1 and 112 years with an average time of 41 years the age of quickflows is considerably lower than the mrt of groundwater at average flow conditions the model predicts that 77 of the surface water at the tributary water quality monitoring sites is sourced from groundwater this indicates that groundwater is the predominant contributor to flow and it is also likely that the predominant contribution to the total load of nitrogen comes from groundwater in many of the catchments located in the central and lower parts of the upper waikato region the time of travel from the higher quality land which is more likely to have been intensively developed is generally of a similar age to the travel time from the catchment as a whole nitrogen concentrations measured at the surface water monitoring sites are increasing in the catchment it is likely that nitrogen concentrations in the surface water that is sourced from groundwater will continue to increase estimating the eventual load of nitrogen when the catchment comes to equilibrium is very difficult because there is little known about land use change the degree of attenuation of nitrogen and groundwater flow paths in future development water ages or mrt can be modelled as contaminants that allow including hydrodynamic dispersion processes for estimating travel time as proposed by zheng 2009 the approach employed in this study may also be used in other catchments within new zealand and internationally to better assess changes in n concentration in groundwater owing to land use changes declaration of

1498,groundwater and surface water contamination by nitrogen can produce serious health issues particularly regarding the contraction of methemoglobinemia in infants prevention of this disorder is a main reason for regulating drinking water quality in new zealand to assist the management of water quality in the upper waikato catchment in the light of growing intensification of nitrogen producing land uses a regional groundwater flow and contamination transport model was developed to assess probable future nitrogen concentrations calibration of the steady state model was achieved with a root mean square error of 4 7 for groundwater levels and 7 9 for gains and losses in river flow within the catchment model performance was assisted by relationships determined between sio2 concentrations in groundwater and water age modelling coupled with water aging indicates that the mean residence time of contributing water in the upper waikato catchment ranges from 5 to 101 years with an average of 50 years some 77 of surface water is sourced from groundwater which is likely to convey the predominant contribution to the total nitrogen load nitrogen concentrations are increasing but the long term total load is difficult to estimate owing largely to lack of information about historical land use and the degree of attenuation of nitrogen the model and results obtained may be employed to provide information on water travel time distributions appropriate source location and surface water receiving reaches in rivers and streams all of which is important and necessary for effective water quality management in the catchment keywords groundwater nitrogen non point source contamination water age water management 1 introduction freshwater resources on earth make up less than 1 of water availability for human consumption du plessis 2017 lui et al 2011 it is important to be able to understand and measure the quality status of water used for drinking domestic irrigation and industrial purposes numerous natural and anthropogenic factors control the chemistry of surface and groundwater in an area appelo and postma 2005 hounslow 2018 lockhart et al 2013 pauwels et al 2010 contamination and overexploitation of water resources owing to anthropogenic activities in particular is a serious and increasing issue around the world including in new zealand nitrogen n contamination in water resources can lead to a condition known as methemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrome and has also been linked to cancer through the formation of carcinogenic n nitroso compounds wedge et al 2001 to spontaneous abortions centers for disease control and prevention 1996 and to non hodgkin lymphoma ward et al 1996 nitrogen occurs naturally in low concentrations in surface stream and groundwater but n fertilizer and animal manure applied to soil for example in dairying can through leaching or surface runoff to streams cause elevation of levels above safe values for human health owens et al 1992 other activities of human beings which have changed the balance of nitrogen include burning fossil fuels for energy barnyards septic systems feedlots silos buried waste fertilizer storage and disposal of organic wastes nowatzki 2001 here concern lies with the upper waikato catchment where groundwater quality is naturally high but is deteriorating as a result of land use intensification and deforestation weir and rajanayaka 2014 compounding this concern is the lag time between increasing land use changes whose subsequent effects on water quality will take years to manifest elliott and semadeni davies 2013 used a catchment model to predict long term equilibrium nitrogen concentrations at various water quality measuring sites in the upper waikato catchment for current contaminant loadings from diffuse and point sources municipal industrial wastewater and geothermal as to when an equilibrium concentration might be achieved was not considered one approach to estimating catchment water quality response to increased n loading is to assume it results from two processes firstly a rapid adjustment to land use changes primarily from forest to dairying transmitted through runoff and shallow groundwater flow paths and secondly a slower adjustment or lag resulting from a component of the load moving through the deeper groundwater system based on these assumptions and with the aim of estimating groundwater flow paths and travel times to surface water bodies our approach was to develop a regional groundwater flow and contaminant transport model with inputs from water aging measurements this general modelling approach has been investigated or applied internationally by for instance abrams et al 2015 furlong et al 2011 harman 2019 koh et al 2018 molenat and gascuel odoux 2002 weissmann et al 2002 and puckett and cowdery 2002 the use of water aging has been employed in numerous studies of n in groundwater see for example böhlke and denver 1995 da pelo et al 2018 katz et al 2004 katz et al 2001 tesoriero et al 2007 in new zealand gusyev et al 2015 2014 employed modflow modpath methods with modflow mt3dms and lumped parameter models to estimate transit times of n to streams similarly environment canterbury 2019 used stochastic modelling techniques with modflow modpath particle tracking to predict mean residence times and source zones for groundwater supply bores and groundwater fed streams water aging studies of n contamination have been conducted by for example morgenstern and daughney 2012 and stewart et al 2011 the objective of this study is to provide information and a model for assessing probable future nitrogen contamination of water resources in the upper waikato catchment and the likely time for the change to equilibrate in stream waters to assist in the management of water quality and in policy development for appropriate land uses 2 study area the study area comprises the upper waikato river surface water catchment from the outflow at lake taupo through to lake karapiro the catchment is situated in the central north island of new zealand fig 1 and has an area of approximately 436 000 ha the area has a largely temperate climate with average maximum temperatures ranging between 13 8 and 30 c in summer dec feb and 5 and 17 7 c in winter june aug mean annual rainfall varies between 1100 and 1950 mm year within the catchment tait and woods 2007 predominately due to topographic influences and wind direction while weather extremes can be experienced at any time of year the highest rainfalls occur in winter the study area is a nationally important agricultural and power generation catchment which comprises eight hydro electric dams on the waikato river fig 1 producing around 13 of electricity needs in new zealand waikato river authority 2010 the state of environment report of the waikato regional council shows that 91 of water within the catchment is allocated for agriculture and horticulture related activities with 5 for domestic and municipal water supply and 4 for industries waikato regional council 2019a 2 1 geology catchment geology is dominated by pleistocene volcanic rocks associated with three periods of eruptions over the past 300 000 years superimposed on basement greywacke aquifers in the catchment consist of geological units of ignimbrite rhyolite and volcanoclastic sediments white et al 2015 wilson et al 2009 due to the high porosity of these volcanic pumice sediments water storage is relatively large and surface quickflow is relatively small consequently surface flows in the area are dominated by baseflow white et al 2015 surface recharge from relatively high rainfalls increases nutrient leaching of n into groundwater aquifers 2 2 land use current land use comprises 53 pasture 32 production forestry 13 native vegetation less than 1 urban and 1 open water dairying forestry energy production hydroelectricity and geothermal and the tourism industry are the dominant economic activities within the catchment forestry and pastoral farming are the predominant land uses but in recent years there has been a marked increase in forest to dairy conversions and land use intensification waikato regional council 2019b 2 3 hydrology the main hydrological feature of the catchment is the upper section of the 425 km long waikato river the longest river in new zealand mean discharge of the river within the catchment is 260 m3 s at karapiro and 340 m3 s at the river mouth below our study area river flows are controlled by the eight dams and control gates at the lake taupo outflow fig 1 for which the mean annual outflow is 156 m3 s highest flows generally occur in winter it has been estimated that there is little or no change in small 1 in 5 year or medium 1 20 year floods as a result of land use changes which occurred prior to 2010 however using the same analysis it has been estimated that on average there has been a 4 increase in large floods due to the occurrence of 1 in 100 year rainfalls and reductions in rainfall losses owing to land use changes environment waikato 2010 a number of tributaries contribute approximately 100 m3 s within the catchment aquifers provide sustained flows during droughts and the dams also moderate flood flows generated by high rainfall events brown 2010 waikato regional council 2019b 3 materials and methods 3 1 data topographical groundwater well information n and tritium concentrations surface water flow n and tritium concentrations and land use data for the model were supplied by waikato regional council wrc note that long term n data is only available for total n for the catchment consequently this study employs total n to assess changes in n concentration in groundwater owing to land use changes locations of water quality measuring sites are shown in fig 2 geological formation data and estimates of water age based on tritium analysis were supplied by the institute of geological and nuclear sciences new zealand climate data was obtained from the virtual climate station network of the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa tait and woods 2007 and soil water holding properties profile available water from the new zealand fundamental soil layer newsome et al 2008 groundwater recharge under diferent climate soil land use combinations were calculated using the soil crop water balance model irricalc bright 2009 irricalc uses the theoretical framework of the daily soil moisture water balance modelling by the food and agricultural organization allen et al 1998 as outlined above there are diverse current land uses within the study area however there are also significant areas of forest which have recently been converted to farming especially dairying hawke 2004 the parliamentary commission for the environment 2013 demonstrated that there is a clear correlation between large scale land use change to dairy farming and increases in the n stress on waterways in new zealand there are also growing public concerns about this connection parliamentary commission for the environment 2015 todd and kerr 2009 consequently this analysis included identification of areas that currently are or are likely to be in the future utilised for farming activities the groundwater flow paths that start under these farmed areas were assessed separately from flow paths originating under other land uses such as forestry based on the land cover database version 3 lcdbv3 landcare 2013 to try to identify the likely water quality response time to changes in land use intensity in these areas fig 3 shows the different land use areas farm forest and other urban built up areas and surface water bodies 3 2 quickflow the quickflow component of the rainfall surface runoff interflow and laterally moving shallow groundwater was estimated using a simple quickflow separation process involving calibrating parameters using the measured mean daily flows the net groundwater recharge was calculated as drainage estimated by the soil crop water balance model minus quickflow to estimate quickflow for the model area the measured flows in the waiotapu stream from 2002 to 2014 were firstly separated into baseflow from groundwater and quickflow components using the method of ladson et al 2013 as the potential quickflow component from different combinations of land use climate slope soil characteristics can be different the drainage outputs of the irricalc model bright 2009 for the waiotapu catchment above a threshold value were separated into deep drainage and lateral flow which generates quickflow the difference between the daily quickflow of the observed flow data estimated using ladson et al 2013 and the lateral flow component of the irricalc model was minimised through calibration in the calibration process quickflow contribution from each combination plus the threshold that generates lateral flow were changed using an optimisation process additionally a five day running weighted average was used to represent the quickflow time series to account for lag times and storage in the upper soils the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 of the calibration is 0 58 the optimised values for each combination were used to estimate quickflow for the other sub catchments the estimated quickflow of each sub catchment was added to relevant tributary flows 3 3 flows at water quality sites the modelled age distribution of surface water was obtained at the surface water quality monitoring sites which are shown in fig 3 the modelled average river and stream flows along with wrc measured flows and estimations based from a rainfall runoff model topnet bandaragoda et al 2004 are given in table 1 topnet uses topmodel beven et al 1995 beven and kirkby 1979 concepts for the representation of sub surface storage controlling the dynamics of the saturated contributing area and baseflow recession the topnet model is widely used for estimating river flows within new zealand niwa 2019 results of flows against n concentrations at water quality monitoring sites are discussed in section 4 4 for reasons of brevity we introduce the n concentration data in that section 3 4 model development the conceptual groundwater model was developed based on the existing understanding of geology and hydrology of the area as outlined in section 2 details of the conceptual model development can be found in weir and rajanayaka 2014 the commonly employed modflow harbaugh 2005 flow model and mt3dms zheng 2010 zheng 1992 transport model termed the combined modflow mt3dms model as the model in this paper were adopted to simulate steady state saturated flow and contaminant transport in the groundwater system the model was also used to simulate flows in the waikato river and all major tributaries in the study area by means of the str1 package prudic 1989 this integrated regional model was constructed on a 1 km 1 km grid with 20 numerical layers to represent complex geological formations the 20 layers are of equal thickness at any given location but the total thickness varies spatially for example where the total thickness to basement rock is 400 m each numerical layer is 20 m thick but where the basement rock is 200 m deep each numerical layer is only 10 m thick model zonification was based on the geological formations shown in appendix a hydraulic properties were allowed to vary spatially to accommodate hydraulic variability within any geological formation using pilot points doherty et al 2010 initial conditions for the model were set as the results of the previous steady state calibration run which provided a stable simulation boundary conditions of the model are land surface recharge calculated as the long term average using the irricalc model with spatially variable soils land use and rain rivers simulated using modflow s str1 package with inflow at lake taupo fig 1 and all other boundaries are no flow boundaries numerical modelling generally contains several inherent complications which can amplify when the model domain is large these complications include determining trade off between model accuracy and runtime parametrisation based on available data spatio temporal resolution to ensure model stability and spatial resolution grid size to preserve realistic numerical dispersion gelhar 1986 in transport modelling these issues are described in detailed in weir and rajanayaka 2014 uncertainty analyses were carried out to inform the confidence of model results and identify the areas where more monitoring is needed to improve the accuracy of the model in the future a detailed description of the uncertainty analyses is given in rajanayaka 2017 the integrated model along with forward particle tracking using the modpath package pollock 2016 was used to estimate flow paths and particle travel times for groundwater this was undertaken by releasing particles at the surface of every cell in the model to calculate the travel time for particles to reach surface water bodies our approach is to use mean residence time mrt of water and its distribution to assess changes in n contamination in groundwater water at a given location has different ages which were placed in different bins based on the age as shown in section 4 3 the mrt was calculated by multiplying the volume of water within each age bin by the mean age of the bin and then dividing by the total water volume to assist with the validation of the integrated model estimates of mrt at various water quality measuring sites were made by determining a relationship between sio2 concentrations in surface water and mrt estimated using tritium as suggested by morgenstern et al 2010 the basis of this relationship is that sio2 concentrations are generally very low in rainfall in humid regions but increase as water infiltrates deep into the soil and passes through sub surface materials owing to dissolution of silicate minerals where these exist white 1995 the longer water resides in a zone with silicate minerals the higher sio2 concentrations become because the geological composition of the sub surface material affects the relationship between sio2 concentrations and water age the relationship was only applied in catchments with ignimbrite geology where the relationship was comparable catchments subject to geothermal effects were not included in the analysis because elevated water temperatures enhance the dissolution of sio2 monthly samples were taken for a year september 2010 to 2011 from water quality measuring sites located in non geothermal sites in the lake taupo and upper waikato regions fig 1 as surface water sio2 concentrations are related to the source of water that is near surface versus deeper groundwater the 12 monthly sio2 data were correlated for the effect of flow by removing any samples taken at high flows where surface sources would have been contributing to and diluting sio2 concentrations the relevant mrt values determined from tritium analysis and the corresponding sio2 values as listed in table 2 and are well modelled by an exponential relationship fig 4 while this relationship is subject to some uncertainty it assists in developing an expanded spatial dataset of the mrt which is limited within the study catchment for enhanced verification of the mean age and estimation of age distribution benefits of this approach are expected to outweigh the potential introduced uncertainty the additional estimated mrt values using measured sio2 were used in the modflow mt3dms model calibration 3 5 model calibration the groundwater flow component of the model was calibrated using parameter estimation software pest developed by doherty 2018 with a combination of pilot points doherty et al 2010 and parameter zones the integrated model was calibrated simultaneously against measured groundwater levels river gains losses and both surface and groundwater concentrations of n and tritium during the calibration process porosity and dispersivity parameters of the mt3dms model were calibrated against both tritium and nitrate concentration observations the flow calibration achieved a normalised root mean square error rmse of 4 7 for groundwater levels with a coefficient of determination of r2 0 95 fig 5 the model volumetric water budget error for the entire model domain was 0 25 the normalised rmse for the river gains was 7 9 fig 6 the calibrated horizontal hydraulic conductivity ranges from 0 03 to 100 m day and vertical hydraulic conductivity was kept to 10 of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity at each cell the porosity of model domain varies between 0 0035 and 0 6 3 5 1 particle tracking and age distribution the age distribution of water at surface water quality monitoring sites was estimated using the model the surface water quality monitoring sites were chosen for this analysis as both flow and n data are available there the model estimates the saturated groundwater travel time from different locations in a catchment or sub catchment to its end point discharge into surface water using particle tracking the time each particle which is released into the groundwater table takes to travel to the water quality site is calculated this enables the mean age and age distribution of water at a water quality site to be estimated independently of estimates described in section 3 4 particle tracking from farmed lands which are classified as high producing exotic grassland in lcdbv3 landcare 2013 was conducted separately from other land use types it is highly likely that these lands are being used or will be used for intensification will tend to produce higher n loads consequently it was considered important to determine whether travel time from these land areas is materially different from travel times from the catchment as a whole 3 5 2 vadose zone the modflow model described in section 3 4 does not simulate flow through the vadose unsaturated zone however it was expected that travel times through the vadose zone in parts of the catchment would be significant given the depths to groundwater in some areas of the catchment the average simulated vadose zone thickness for the model area is approximately 60 m an estimate of the travel time through the shallow vadose zone has been derived from tracer experiments completed at the tutaeuaua sub catchment within the taupo catchment barkle et al 2011 tracer experiments in the taupo ignimbrite horizon have yielded an average travel rate of between 2 5 and 6 0 mm for every 1 mm of drainage below the root zone wöhling et al 2012 and barkle pers comm however these rates are applicable only for the shallow vadose zone within the depth the experiments were conducted hence it was assumed that the average travel rate of water is 4 mm for every 1 mm of drainage within the first 10 m below ground level the travel rate below 10 m will likely be lower as soil structure allows more lateral flow near the water table and declines in vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity as shown in many previous studies ameli et al 2016 anderson and burt 1978 harr 1977 weyman 1973 in the absence of measurement based estimates a vertical travel rate within the deeper vadose zone i e below 10 m of 2 mm for every 1 mm of drainage was assumed the average vadose zone travel time estimated by this method is 10 years for the modelled area with a range of approximately zero to 109 years depending on the total unsaturated thickness 4 results and discussion in what follows results relating to flow paths flows at surface water quality monitoring sites mean water age n in surface flows and trends in groundwater n concentrations are presented and discussed 4 1 flow paths the flow paths by which n reaches surface water are conceptually divided into either quickflow or baseflow which is assumed to be sourced from groundwater at times of low flow baseflow groundwater is assumed to be the only source of water contributing to surface water flow when precipitation occurs and flow increases the majority of the increase in flow is considered to be generated from quickflow the simulated water travel paths by the model are shown in fig 7 the flow paths originate at the centre of each of the uppermost layer model cells fig 7 shows the plan view of the 3d particle travel paths through all the layers to assist the reader with identifying general flow patterns from different parts of the model area a few selected flow paths are shown in fig 8 4 2 flows at water quality sites modelled measured and estimated flows at the surface water quality monitoring sites listed in table 1 show that the modelled flows are in reasonably good agreement with the measured and estimated flows it is important that the model accurately simulates the measured flows at these water quality monitoring sites as these sites were used to develop the water age distribution in section 4 3 to assess changes in n contamination in groundwater 4 3 mean age the modelled mean age of water at each of the water quality monitoring sites at mean flow are given in table 3 this table shows that the mean age for waters coming from farmed land are less compared to all waters in the upper parts of the catchment i e towards lake taupo first five rows in table 3 the ages of water coming from farmed areas were separately analysed because n concentrations of these waters are largely related to anthropogenic influences and can be managed through changes in land use management and regulation the locations of farmed lands shown in fig 3 are consistent with the lower ages as they are largely located at lower parts of each sub catchment closer to the water quality sites requiring relatively short travel distances and therefore times the mean ages for surface water quality monitoring sites in lower parts of the catchment i e near karapiro last five rows in table 3 show that there is no significant difference between the age for all waters compared to that coming from farmed lands fig 9 presents the age distribution for the waiotapu stream at campbell road bridge for both the whole sub catchment all waters and water leaching just through farmed lands as stated in section 3 2 surface water inflows have been assigned to tributaries to account for quickflow this is more relevant as the modflow model is a saturated groundwater model and it does not simulate the vadose zone and near surface water movements accurately so assigned surface water inflows offset the model s limitations however it is not possible to accurately assign surface water inflows at correct locations along the surface water tributaries and at correct ages this analysis assumes that the age of assigned quickflows is between 0 and 5 years which is plausible nevertheless there will be some uncertainties associated with model estimates of lag times primarily for steep head water sub catchments but as the contributions of flows from these small catchments are relatively minor table 1 the overall errors at the larger catchment level are probably insignificant as the age distribution of the lake taupo water is unknown overall distribution of water for the water quality sites in the waikato river cannot be estimated however the distributions for in catchment waters at water quality sites are given in appendix b these figures and fig 9 show that it is important to identify the age distribution in addition to the mean age which can be somewhat misleading the mean age of all water of the waiotapu stream at campbell road bridge fig 9 is 47 years but the age of approximately 80 of flows from all water is less than the mean age fig 9a as the mean age can be skewed by smaller flows with large ages consequently it is important to consider the age distribution when assessing water quality trends against land use trends and not just the mean age the mean age for waters coming from farming is 5 years which is significantly less than that of all water at the waiotapu stream water quality site 4 4 n in surface water flow there are a total of 16 surface water quality monitoring sites in tributary catchments in the upper waikato catchment that have monthly n concentration data starting from 1993 wrc 2018 at five of these sites 786 2 pokaiwhenua 388 1 mangakino 934 1 tahunaatara 683 4 otamakokore 1186 4 waiotapu where flow data was available the change in n concentrations in the groundwater contributing to surface water flow was estimated from the n concentrations in surface water samples collected only at low flows not all water leaving a tributary surface water catchment is occurring as surface water flow a proportion leaves the catchment by way of groundwater flow near surface flow interflow and laterally moving shallow groundwater generation in the upper waikato catchment generally occurs in areas where water tables are high under high water table conditions the lateral quicker pathways become an important mechanism for the export of n to the surface water in locations where the water table is deep and vertical sub surface flow is prevalent deeper groundwater flow paths are likely to dominate the export of n from the land and the catchment under this scenario n exits a tributary catchment predominantly via groundwater rather than surface water flow at four of the five water quality monitoring sites where the relationship between flow rate and n concentrations was available with time for the majority of the flow range the nitrogen concentrations increase linearly with flow this linear relationship holds until the concentrations are approaching their maximum the rate of increase in the concentration with flow then reduces see fig 10 for examples from the otamakokore and tahunaatara catchments the exception to this strong relationship between flow and nitrogen concentration is at the mangakino water quality site as also shown in fig 10 here the n concentration in the stream demonstrates a weaker relationship with flow with an explanation of variance r2 of 4 3 fig 10c this could be because quickflow has a nitrogen concentration similar to the deeper groundwater so the change in n concentration with increasing flow cannot be discerned the increase in nitrogen concentration with flow evident in fig 10 informs us that quickflow has an elevated n concentration compared to groundwater quickflow has a faster response to changes in land use for example from forestry to pastoral farming and is therefore expected to have a higher n concentration than the deeper groundwater which largely consists of older water as a consequence of this faster response of quickflow to land use changes it is also assumed that this pathway provides a mechanism by which the effects of changes in land use will manifest themselves sooner in surface water than in groundwater it is also reasonable to assume due to closer connection that quickflow will reach equilibrium concentrations with land use sooner than deeper groundwater flow the time for n in groundwater to reach an equilibrium concentration with land use is difficult to estimate and is related to a number of factors including the spatial distribution of changes in land use intensity in the catchment the network of surface water streams in a catchment the mrt and the age distributions of the water occurring in the groundwater consequently this model has been developed to help in assessing changes in n concentration owing to land use changes primarily from forestry to dairying using water aging 4 5 trend in groundwater n at the five water quality monitoring sites where both flow and nitrogen concentration data were available two linear regression lines were fitted to the data fig 11 the range of baseflow indices in these five catchments is 0 85 to 0 97 averaging 0 9 stdev 0 04 demonstrating that groundwater is the major contributor to streamflow therefore the slope of the trend line fitted through all stream data is also a good indicator of the trend in n concentrations in the groundwater to ensure a more robust estimation the slope of the trend line is additionally fitted through the lowest 10 of surface flow to confirm this trend in the groundwater only component the red line was fitted through all of the data and the second line blue was fitted through only those samples for which the flow rate at the time of sampling was within the lowest 10 of flow rates data points coloured blue while numerical values are obtained for the slopes these are only considered indicative of the rate of change in the groundwater as this method is a simplification of the actual processes occurring it should be noted that simple linear regressions were used in this study as the aim of trend analysis was to merely demonstrate the presence of high level trend rather than quantification of trends which was not within the scope of this study however linear regression techniques may not be suitable for trend detection analysis if the dataset is not normally distributed aguilar et al 2007 asfaw et al 2018 visser et al 2009 all lines fitted in fig 11 were significant at the 0 5 level table 4 contains information on the slopes of the fitted lines in all cases the slope of the lines fitted to the lowest 10 of flows was positive this implies that n concentrations in groundwater are increasing with time from groundwater modelling of the average flows in the tributary catchments it is estimated that 77 of the surface water flow is contributed by groundwater this indicates that at mean flow conditions groundwater is still making a significant contribution to flow at water quality sites 4 6 future work water ages can be modelled as contaminants as proposed by zheng 2009 this approach enables modelling both advection and hydrodynamic dispersion into the movement of water particles specifically a zero order decay constant can be set to 1 with appropriate initial conditions so that values of concentration at the end of the simulation then equate to the mrt 5 conclusions calibration of the steady state regional groundwater flow and contaminant transport model was achieved with a root mean square error of 4 7 for groundwater levels and 7 9 for gains and losses in river flow within the catchment a relationship between sio2 concentrations in surface water and mrt measured using tritium assisted in the verification of the groundwater flow component of the model the mrt for all water contributing to the mean flow at tributary water quality monitoring sites can vary between 5 and 101 years with an average of 51 years the estimated mean time of travel of water infiltrating from land areas that are most likely to have been subjected to intensification to the tributary water quality monitoring sites ranges between 1 and 112 years with an average time of 41 years the age of quickflows is considerably lower than the mrt of groundwater at average flow conditions the model predicts that 77 of the surface water at the tributary water quality monitoring sites is sourced from groundwater this indicates that groundwater is the predominant contributor to flow and it is also likely that the predominant contribution to the total load of nitrogen comes from groundwater in many of the catchments located in the central and lower parts of the upper waikato region the time of travel from the higher quality land which is more likely to have been intensively developed is generally of a similar age to the travel time from the catchment as a whole nitrogen concentrations measured at the surface water monitoring sites are increasing in the catchment it is likely that nitrogen concentrations in the surface water that is sourced from groundwater will continue to increase estimating the eventual load of nitrogen when the catchment comes to equilibrium is very difficult because there is little known about land use change the degree of attenuation of nitrogen and groundwater flow paths in future development water ages or mrt can be modelled as contaminants that allow including hydrodynamic dispersion processes for estimating travel time as proposed by zheng 2009 the approach employed in this study may also be used in other catchments within new zealand and internationally to better assess changes in n concentration in groundwater owing to land use changes declaration of

1499,stormwater management practices smps rely on infiltration and adsorption capabilities of soil and vegetative cover to mitigate the harmful impacts of contaminants in stormwater runoff including potentially toxic elements ptes under chemical equilibrium conditions the soil water distribution coefficient kd quantifies the relationship between the solid and aqueous phase pte concentrations and thus the pte removal efficiency and mobility through the smp soil layers during the infiltration process the smp loading ratio lr the ratio of the drainage area to the smp infiltration area combined with runoff concentration determines smp mass loading and is also expected to impact pte transport in this study a simulation model was developed to investigate pte breakthrough and build up in smp media considering the impacts of kd and lr eight ptes were simulated cl cr fe zn cu as cd and pb and cl was the only pte that showed high mobility and reached the groundwater table e g 1 year for breakthrough conversely other ptes were effectively immobilized in the top 60 cm of soil for a simulated lifespan of 20 years soil and porewater contaminant indices as indicators of smp lifespan were estimated based on the ratio of pte porewater and soil concentrations after 20 years to published standards suggesting the following order of environmental significance most concern to least cl cr as pb fe cu cd zn after 20 years of simulated use only cl pore water concentrations at the groundwater table exceeded regulatory values with porewater contamination index values of 4 to 7 5 chloride also exceeded the surficial media soil contamination index as did as and cr though these exceedences were largely associated with media background concentrations generally higher lr and kd contributed to higher accumulation of ptes in top layers however simulations showed that the combination of low lr and high kd may result in lower pte accumulation in the media such that the pte concentration in soil may decrease in deeper layers in these scenarios a notable fraction of pte load was adsorbed on top layers and considerably lower pte concentrations reached the lower layers sensitivity analysis revealed that dispersion infiltration rate and kinetically limited sorption did not impact the pte accumulation and mobility to a practical extent the results from this simulation may be adapted to various environmental conditions to enhance the design and maintenance of smps keywords stormwater management practice long term performance potentially toxic element transport soil water distribution

including as cd and pb are not beneficial at any exposure levels jaishankar et al 2014 drinking water maximum contaminant levels mcl us epa 2017a and aquatic life regulatory standards us epa 2017b have been developed for several potentially toxic elements ptes ptes are ubiquitous in urban areas owing to their broad daily usages in different aspects such as industry transportation systems and households such anthropogenic activities increase the pte load on impervious urban surfaces which are highly susceptible to being washed off during a storm barbosa et al 2012 ptes have also been found in many environmental media including the atmosphere soil plant tissues surface water and groundwater jiang et al 2013 and are concern worthy because they are non degradable and in some cases may bioaccumulate moore et al 2011 these forms of ptes in urban streams are potentially hazardous to both aquatic life and water resources which may serve as drinking water sources for municipalities therefore it is crucial to determine the fate and transport of ptes in infiltration based stormwater management areas stormwater management practices smps also known as best management practice bmp incorporate retention vegetation and infiltration processes to mitigate the potentially harmful impacts of stormwater runoff from quality and quantity perspectives purvis et al 2018 smps are designed to perform two seemingly contradictory tasks provide rapid infiltration to control hydrograph runoff peak discharge tixier et al 2011 and provide sufficient contact time between the porous media soil and the infiltrated water to facilitate contaminant removal xiao et al 2017 smp porous media is commonly comprised of sand with some amount of loam and organic matter davis et al 2001 high sand content promotes rapid infiltration of stormwater while loamy materials containing natural organic matter nom contribute to substantial contaminant removal including ptes during the infiltration process davis et al 2001 media characteristics including the distribution coefficient kd and hydraulic conductivity are critical components to the simultaneous achievement of water quantity and quality design goals as well as the longer term operation and maintenance of smps tixier et al 2011 loading ratio lr is another important design concept that affects both the hydrologic and the contaminant loading of infiltration based smps the hydrologic concept of lr defined as the ratio of the drainage area to the infiltration area is often limited by available land area and other site constraints smp designs with lr values greater than 16 often are reported to fail in managing the stormwater peak discharge pennsylvania department of environmental protection 2006 and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection recommends smp lr of 8 or less in delaware lr should not exceed 8 rocco 2009 but in new york and michigan maximum recommended lr values for smps are 5 southeast michigan council of governments 2008 new york state stormwater management design manual 2017 conventionally lrs are designed based on stormwater quantity control using hydrological data such as precipitation intensity and depth runoff rate and depth soil infiltration rate and in rare cases evapotranspiration coupling stormwater quality parameters with hydrology will help achieve a smp design that attains effective reliable and long term treatment of stormwater anderson et al 2016 reported that smps receiving runoff from impervious catchments achieved an average of 81 removal across all metals evaluated similarly davis et al 2001 used synthetic stormwater in a pilot scale infiltration basin and observed that the sandy loam media showed an excellent reduction in metal concentrations average of larger than 90 in a study of metal adsorption by soil pitt et al 1995 found ptes with a high kd i e pb zn cd cu and ni were removed efficiently by porous media in line with these findings nieber et al 2014 studied impacts of infiltration basins on groundwater quality and found that pb removal efficiency was the highest while cd removal efficiency was the lowest which was consistent with observed sorption affinities i e kd taken together soil media properties represented by kd are a significant factor in the pte removal from the infiltrating runoff anderson et al 2016 nieber et al 2014 davis et al 2001 pitt et al 1995 therefore long term ptes accumulation in the smp media and the potential implications on media lifespan limitations should be considered previous studies have evaluated the impacts of the lr on runoff volume management e g lindsay et al 2016 however long term smp performance with regards to water quality is of critical interest and the interactions among lr media properties and media effective lifespan have not been previously considered computational approaches were used in this study to simulate transport and accumulation of a suite of ptes cl cr fe zn cu as cd and pb in smp media and assess potential impacts of lr and kd the soil and porewater contaminations during the effective lifespan were estimated by comparing the simulation results with published standards additionally simulation results were employed to prioritize the risk associated with ptes based on the accumulation in the soil and breakthrough to the groundwater 2 methods a simulation model was developed to study pte concentrations in both soil and porewater which facilitated the pte impact assessment as it is related to kd and lr values two critical design factors lrs from 2 to 16 were selected based on typical design recommendations southeast michigan council of governments 2008 new york stormwater management design manual 2017 pennsylvania department of environmental protection 2006 rocco 2009 loamy sand has shown appropriate infiltration and moisture retention characteristics alfakih et al 1999 pennsylvania department of environmental protection 2006 however to cover various scenarios more types of soil were considered by applying a range of distribution coefficients and corresponding soil characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity and density the simulation model was developed in matlab mathworks 2017 to evaluate pte transport and accumulation for a 20 year simulated lifespan and consisted of two main components 1 a hydrogeologic component which simulates one dimensional water flow through the smp soil and 2 a solute transport component which simulates pte mass distribution between aqueous and solid phases fig 1 shows a schematic of different system compartments 2 1 simulation characteristics the simulation approach required three input data sets initial soil associated pte concentrations hydrologic precipitation record and runoff pte concentration the approach could be applied for any location with information on these parameters for this study applied rainfall data were extracted from the precipitation records provided by the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa 2018 at the kpne station northeastern philadelphia from january 1998 to august 2018 highway stormwater runoff concentration distributions were derived from an ongoing field study from interstate 95 in northeastern philadelphia pa samples were collected monthly from october 2016 to august 2018 si 1 pte concentrations quantified and the resultant data used to evaluate pte concentration distributions a time series prediction model was used to synthesize runoff concentrations based on the measured concentrations in sampled events pte concentration for a given simulated storm event was randomly sampled from the appropriate lognormal distributions where the mean and standard deviation for a select pte matched those of the field monitoring data further details regarding the prediction of concentration time series are provided in si 1 table 1 summarizes the selected ptes and their mean and standard deviation of influent concentrations c0 toran et al 2017 and soil background concentrations us epa 2003 2 2 water transport component a 20 year precipitation data record with data reported every 24 h from philadelphia was used to provide a realistic precipitation pattern employing higher resolution precipitation data would become important for intense rainfall events but can add sophistication to the model for the purpose of this study the focus was on water quality rather than flood control therefore a high resolution rainfall record was considered less crucial for a given time interval the precipitation depth was multiplied by the lr to determine an applied runoff depth and total incoming volume for infiltration previous research has revealed that hydraulic conductivity depends on temperature and saturation conditions fetter 2008 however this was beyond the scope of this study and a constant value corresponding to the saturated condition was used e g 55 cm day for loamy sand fetter 2008 the infiltration rate f l t depends on the pressure head and the tortuosity coefficient which represents non homogeneity of the media but in this study the infiltration rate was assumed equal to saturated hydraulic conductivity which implies unit hydraulic gradient also the adsorption simulation model assumed equilibrium conditions instantaneous phase transfer independent of contact time and thus variable infiltration rates would have negligible impacts more information in si2 the estimated infiltration rate f was used to simulate water infiltration from the surface to the groundwater table 500 cm below based on the field data from philadelphia interstate 95 smps toran et al 2017 discretized into finite sub sections of 1 cm parameters may be different between the smp media and the underlying media e g native or fill material however those are likely site specific in this study the entire media depth was modeled with the same parameter values but the pte transport sensitivity was evaluated using a range of kd values 2 3 solute transport component solute transport was modeled using linear adsorption under equilibrium conditions eq 1 to calculate the distribution of the pte mass between aqueous and solid phases at any time t and depth z 1 c s t z 0 001 k d c w t z in which cs t z is the pte concentration in the soil mg kg at time t and at the bottom of layer z kd is the soil water distribution coefficient for each pte l kg and cw t z is the pte concentration in porewater μg l at time t at the bottom of the layer z hence the total mass mg present at time t and depth z is 2 l t z 0 001 c w t z v t c s t z m s where l t z is total pte mass mg at time t and at the bottom of layer z v t is stormwater runoff volume present in the control volume during time t and ms is the soil control volume mass kg in this model the dimensions of the soil control volume are 1 m 1 m 1 cm l w d initially the total mass available for distribution is 3 l t z 1 0 001 c w t z 1 v t c s t z 1 m s in which l t z 1 is total pte mass mg at time t and at the top of layer z cs t z 1 is the initial pte concentration in the

in the porewater at the end of time t and the bottom of layer z is 4 c w t z c w t z 1 v t 1000 c s t z 1 m s k d m s v t by solving eqs 1 and 4 simultaneously the pte concentrations in each phase at a desired time and depth can be calculated the accuracy of these equations to simulate water and solute transport through the media was evaluated and confirmed by applying hydrus 1 d simunek 2015 in two cases si 2 2 4 modeling assumptions this transport simulation model was built on several initial simplifying assumptions only vertical infiltration was considered one dimensional infiltration and the depth to the water table which is representative of the unsaturated zone was assumed to be fixed at 500 cm and unaffected by stormwater infiltration it is assumed that no overflow will occur i e ponded depth does not reach the outlet overflow depth in the basin and evapotranspiration et is negligible hence all stormwater entering the basin exits via infiltration chances of overflow are normally low in well designed infiltration based smps which implies that neglecting overflow does not notably change the results of a long term simulation si 2 for further information nonetheless when overflow through the smp outlet structure occurs the runoff volume and associated contaminant load available for infiltration is reduced in this study we made the conservative assumption that all runoff would be infiltrated and no overflow would occur heterogeneities associated with soil and plants make the estimation of stormwater loss via et a complex process which was not addressed in this research solute fate and transport generally have four main phenomena advection dispersion retardation and attenuation the infiltration rate can be considered as the advective factor in this one dimensional transport model in the case of groundwater flow the seepage velocities are relatively small therefore dispersion becomes an important factor in contaminant transport however in the case of typical smp infiltration rates the transport would be dominated by advection i e high peclet number and dispersion could be neglected retardation was addressed in the modeled pte by adsorption to soil particles which was assumed to be an instantaneous phase transfer resulting in equilibrium condition this assumption was evaluated through sensitivity analysis si 2 it is also noteworthy that the potential competition for sorption sites among different ptes was not reflected in this model furthermore removal via other compartments e g plants gas phase was not included in the current model which is supported by ongoing project work to measure plant uptake and translocation of ptes toran et al 2017 ptes in the study are stable isotopes and thus attenuation was not considered 2 5 contaminant indices calculated soil associated and porewater concentrations were compared to regulatory human health and aquatic life criteria table 2 after calculating the pte concentrations in the solid phase for each specified depth and time the soil contaminant index sci was calculated using eq 5 which is similar to an approach applied by hakanson 1980 5 sci c s s x in which cs is the soil pte concentration and sx is the recommended soil pte screening value for the pte and varies with land use category us epa 2002 soil effective lifespan can be considered exhausted when sci at a chosen depth exceeds unity similarly the porewater contaminant index pwci was evaluated using the same approach from eq 6 hakanson 1980 6 pwci c w l x in which cw is porewater pte concentration and lx is the more stringent value of epa aquatic life criteria or drinking water mcl us epa 2017a us epa 2017b where values higher than unity for porewater at the groundwater table indicate concern worthy contamination with regard to a given pte the total contaminant index tci is the geometric average of sci and pwci eq 7 and provides complementary value for the holistic pte prioritization 7 tci sci pwci 3 results and discussion the transport simulation model was employed to estimate the pte concentration in both aqueous and solid phases over a 20 year period to address the study objectives the results are presented in four sections model assumption validation description of pte accumulation and breakthrough pte prioritization based on contaminant indices and sensitivity analysis on lr and kd to evaluate the smp performance in pte removal under various scenarios in the first two sections the initial surface runoff pte concentrations were fixed at the average field measured concentrations i e the constant value shown in the first row of table 1 and the smp loading ratio was fixed at 8 to evaluate pte accumulation and breakthrough in the smp medium while the study approach was employed to evaluate smp performance for interstate 95 in the philadelphia pa area this framework can be readily adapted for other locations of interest 3 1 the sensitivity of model output to modeling assumptions the simplifying assumptions used in this simulation model were validated by applying the model to simple cases i e short term transport simulation of a pte with constant load and fixed precipitation and comparing the model outputs to results from other available tools e g hydrus and similar studies i e literature review diffusion which was neglected in the matlab simulation code was determined to have negligible impact on pte transport si fig 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 in regard to infiltration rates and its impact on solute transport buffle et al 2007 compared infiltration rates with some typical pte diffusion coefficients and found that the vertical component of transport i e infiltration rate is orders of magnitude faster than the diffusive component implying that overlooking the diffusive part of dispersion will not significantly affect the accuracy of the transport model additionally under the assumption of a chemically equilibrated system the decreased infiltration rate in an unsaturated zone would have no effect unsaturated zones have lower hydraulic conductivity compared to saturated zones due to more limited water transmission in air containing pores fetter 2008 instantaneous sorption reactions were generally assumed but the impact of rate limited sorption was considered for multiple cases and determined to have minimal effects in the case of non equilibrium adsorption in which contact time becomes important varying hydraulic conductivity particularly in the soil upper layers i e top 150 cm had a negligible impact si fig 2 3 1 additionally kinetic limitations may be present in high darcy velocity scenarios including rapid infiltration the impact of rate limited sorption was evaluated for cr and fe based on the experimentally derived rate constant of k 0 005 per day lee et al 2012 cr exhibited minimal differences between rate limited and equilibrium scenarios but modest differences were observed for fe where kinetic limitations resulted in greater transport into the media si figs 2 4 1 and 2 4 2 for all four scenarios the pte load is immobilized within the top 100 cm of media although differences between the equilibrium and non equilibrium cases were observed the impacts on smp functionality are insignificant the impact on long term surficial soil concentrations and associated soil lifespan are not substantially different equilibrium conditions may provide more conservative pte soil accumulation estimates while kinetic models more conservatively simulate contaminant transport toward the groundwater table neither scenario suggested a risk and chemical equilibrium was selected to address the goals of this study 3 2 pte accumulation and breakthrough pte accumulation and breakthrough were initially evaluated for specific soil kd values and runoff concentrations where the simplified system enabled a clear demonstration of trends a literature assessment of pte distribution coefficients revealed substantial variability for ptes of interest typical distribution coefficients for ptes in this study si 3 suggests that they may be categorized as mobile ptes including cl with a small kd value of 1 l kg marginally mobile ptes including cr cu zn as and cd with kd values between 200 and 1000 l kg and significantly immobilized ptes such as pb and fe with high kd values of 2000 and 7500 l kg respectively pte accumulation and breakthrough are discussed according to this classification for mass transport in the porous media retardation factor r can be a surrogate of kd to elaborate on the combined role of kd as a chemical property and media characteristics in slowing the pte transport process eq 8 usepa 1999 8 r 1 ρ k d n in which ρ is dry bulk density kg l and n is the porosity of the media using typical loamy sand values of 1 6 kg l and 0 41 for density and porosity fetter 2008 respectively corresponding r values can be computed for this case r for cl as a mobile pte is 4 9 while it ranges from 780 to 3900 for marginally mobile ptes and r values greater than 7800 for significantly immobile ptes i e fe and pb to enable easy comparison both kd and r values have been provided throughout the discussion and table 3 summarizes the typical kd and r values for the studied ptes in a loamy sand media limited sorption and elevated mass load resulted in a rapid breakthrough of cl to the groundwater table after 1 1 years in the case of loamy sand media with r 4 9 fig 2 kd 1 l kg sheppard et al 2009 however using a media with higher kd r 40 drastically delayed breakthrough but was not able to protect the underlying water body in the long term this finding agrees with field monitoring by li 2007 which showed that smps were incapable of intercepting cl salinization of urban streams and other waterways has gained national attention particularly in northern climates where road de icing salts typically composed of nacl are widely utilized fleming 2015 despite the low sorption capacity of cl some studies have shown that cl mobility in the soil can be reduced due to the formation of chlorinated organic matter that is subsequently adsorbed onto the media bastviken et al 2007 also cl can accumulate in the plant tissues which can potentially reach toxic levels hajrasuliha 1980 but this may not substantially affect the cl flux via the infiltration process as can be seen from fig 3 full breakthrough at 5 cm below the surface is achieved for ptes with an r value less than 2000 pte removal by the upper most soil layer results in elevated soil associated pte concentrations simulated trends agree with a field study of smps serving highways in essen germany by dierkes and geiger 1999 where soil samples showed elevated concentrations for a suite of metals pb zn cu and cd in the top 5 cm layer and then the concentrations substantially decreased in deeper layers the change in pb concentration with depth was the sharpest while the cd concentration change was the least sharp assessment of field dierkes and geiger 1999 and modeling results in this study confirms the importance of adsorption to smp media in limiting the vertical mobility of ptes and suggests that infiltration based smps may be protective of water that receives infiltrated stormwater i e underlying groundwater and downstream water resources ptes in this study were retained in the top 60 cm of media i e r 780 save cl for the specified lr 8 and chemical equilibrium fig 4 for instance at 20 years complete cu breakthrough is observed at 3 cm below the surface indicating this soil layer has reached its cu adsorption capacity partial cu breakthrough is observed no deeper than 19 cm indicating porewater cu concentrations that are essentially zero at deeper layers in contrast porewater cr achieves complete breakthrough at almost 30 cm below the surface with partial breakthrough up to 57 cm below the surface since the expected lifespan of infiltration basins is 10 to 15 years department of industry and science 2015 after which the smp media needs replacement the slow transport of ptes observed in this study suggests the time for breakthrough to groundwater exceeds the smp lifespan these model results are in line with other studies that reported metals are trapped in the top 50 cm of the media nieber et al 2014 similarly the complementary field monitoring efforts at the philadelphia interstate 95 site porewater samples collected via suction lysimeters since 2017 installed at 15 and 30 cm below the surface have shown that the smps are far from pte breakthrough and the upper layers are still effectively removing metals caplan et al 2018 3 3 pte prioritization for pte prioritization efforts the model complexity was increased to reflect varying pte loads from the surface runoff i e historic precipitation record and statistically sampled concentrations and the calculated soil and porewater concentrations were compared to relevant regulatory standards pedestrian and pet exposure to smp media is most relevant for the top layers e g 1 5 cm as a result surficial soil concentrations were compared to soil screening values of residential areas pennsylvania department of environmental protection 2016 exposure risk to porewater was likely the greatest concern relating to impacting groundwater due to contamination of drinking water resources or potential effects on groundwater impacted surface water systems porewater contamination was evaluated at the modeled groundwater table 500 cm below the smp surface to develop the contaminant indices published standards for pennsylvania table 2 were used table 4 presents the contaminant indices from the upper most soil layer which suggest that some pte may accumulate to concentrations exceeding screening levels chloride exceeds the regulatory soil screening values after 0 03 year while high background concentrations of cr and as resulted in scis greater than unity though these could be mitigated through a selection of soil media with lower cr and as initial concentrations however fe cu zn cd and pb concentrations are noticeably below the soil screening value after a 20 year simulation comprehensive results of contaminant indices for different scenarios i e soil type and lrs are presented in si 4 the results of the contamination assessment in the layer adjacent to groundwater are summarized in table 5 based on a 20 year simulation of pte dynamics in the smp media cl is the only pte among those studied which reaches the lower layer and exceeds screening criteria by a considerable amount i e 6 1 times the regulatory value the complete breakthrough of cl from the surface to groundwater is rapid and occurs after approximately 2 5 years also pwci 1 reflecting the variable concentration and precipitation constant in section 3 2 tables 4 and 5 suggest cl cr and as might be problematic in the infiltration basins because of relatively high contaminant indices and ptes can be prioritized as follows ranked from greatest to least risk cl cr as pb fe cu cd zn the above prioritization has been established using the quality of the stormwater runoff in the interstate 95 smps pennsylvania water quality standards and assumed lr and kd values other values could be employed to calculate indices and this would change the results accordingly generally ptes in stormwater runoff can be prioritized based on their environmental concerns including chronic toxicity thresholds eriksson et al 2006 eriksson et al 2006 found the suite of cd cr cu ni pb pt and zn in stormwater runoff possess toxicity risk for chronic exposure scenarios and therefore are categorized as high priority metals nieber et al 2014 reported the high priority metals in the stormwater as pb zn cu and cd due to their abundance in the environment and toxicity the study also found that their associated hazards as a result of breakthrough to groundwater is a long process pitt et al 1995 found that metals introduced to infiltration basins from surface runoff would be unlikely to impact underlying water bodies however in contrast zn can impose a potential contamination hazard for groundwater due to its abundance in the media chloride concentrations in soil at different depths were simulated using variable precipitation and surface load despite environmental variabilities the fluctuation of cl in the media attenuated with depth due to the media sorption capacity but soil cl concentration typically exceeded the published screening standard in all reported depths after 20 years of simulation fig 5 relatively similar median cl concentrations in the media during 20 years of simulation indicates that the breakthrough has occurred and the media would no longer protect the groundwater from cl leakage numerous stormwater studies also found cl is not effectively removed by the stormwater infiltration process and therefore poses a high risk of groundwater contamination kaushal et al 2005 pitt et al 1995 figs 6 and 7 depict the concentrations of cr and as respectively in the soil at different depths over time for both cases a limited breakthrough is predicted for depths greater than 60 cm as can be seen after 5 years of simulation cr reached complete breakthrough at 5 cm below the surface and did not reach to 30 cm below the surface at the same time a complete breakthrough of as at 5 cm below the surface did not occur and as was found in trivial concentrations in 15 cm below the surface at 15 cm below the surface the complete breakthrough of cr occurred after 10 2 years while breakthrough of as to the same depth required 19 2 years it highlights the importance of retardation factor as well as incoming contaminant load and background contamination of the media the findings in this study are in line with a hydrus 2d simulations of an agricultural field where non equilibrium and non linear sorption model were employed and the suite of metals were largely intercepted by top 60 cm of the media xiao et al 2015 3 4 effects of varying lr and kd on the performance of infiltration basins a wide range of kd values representative of the ptes for various soil types based on published literature in conjunction with lrs ranging from 2 to 16 were used to envision the interacting effects of lr and kd the results for cl and as are presented here and a complete presentation of the results can be found in si 5 for cl which potentially reaches the groundwater table the results are illustrated at 500 cm below the surface after 20 years figs 8 and si6 and for the case of as which proved to be more problematic in top layers the results at 5 cm below the surface after 20 years are shown fig 9 fig 8 uses a heatmap to provide a visual overview of how applying varying lrs and kd values impact the cl pwci at the groundwater table the heatmap is generally divided by an imaginary line into areas with pwci lower than unity and the areas at which pwci ranges from 1 to 7 5 for any given lr there is an upper limit of kd above which a limited amount of cl reaches the groundwater table for instance with a lr of 8 and kd value greater than 6 5 l kg the majority of the cl load is sorbed onto the soil particles in top layers however for a lr of 8 and kd less than 6 5 l kg pwci exceeds unity and groundwater contamination may occur the variability in the region where pwci 1 is due to the stochastic influent concentration reflecting the observed variability in stormwater concentrations e g due to deicer salt use and the effects of exchange between the solid and liquid matrices i e both adsorption and desorption this reversible process means that cl will desorb when the runoff is relatively less concentrated e g no de icing salt which results in an attenuated cl concentration fig 5 with non uniform concentration through depth and time fig 8 such heatmaps at different depths can be useful design tools to evaluate the combination of lr and kd that meets smp design goals si 7 surficial as concentration is further explored in fig 9 where the interactions between lr and kd are evaluated for porewater and soil concentrations i e concentrations at 5 cm depth in fig 9a and b respectively fig 9a shows that for low kd values e g 100 l kg the porewater concentration is highly dependent on the lr but kd values greater than 400 l kg coupled with low lr values cause declining porewater concentration which highlights the important interaction between lr and kd in contaminant dynamics the quasi straight line reveals that the porewater concentration at 5 cm depth after 20 years is generally insensitive to both lr and kd values and that the porewater concentration is similar to the mean influent as concentration i e complete breakthrough fig 9b demonstrates as soil concentration largely follows a quasi linear trend associated with full breakthrough though some deviations are observed for low lr elevated kd systems the interaction between lr and kd values indicates that if higher kd values can be coupled with lower lr values then as contamination can be limited using lr 6 and kd 400 critical distribution coefficient may be associated with a supply limitation resulting in incomplete breakthrough for a wide range of lrs and distribution coefficients the sci for as exceeds 1 12 at 5 cm below the surface after 20 years which implies the importance of monitoring as in the system to evaluate the effective lifespan of the system however for this particular case high as background concentration in the soil 13 mg kg was the primary reason and the rate of accumulation in top layers played a less important role elevated as concentrations highlight the importance of ensuring clean media during smp construction 4 conclusions prioritization of ptes based on comparing their presence in the infiltration based smps with published standards indicated higher environmental risk from cl cr and as chloride most commonly from applying deicing salts in colder regions is mobile and can readily migrate from the surface through the porous media and into groundwater in smps with lifespans of 20 years marginally mobile ptes such as cr and as can accumulate in the top 60 cm of soil which is protective of the underlying groundwater but may eventually result in scis greater than unity lead pb and fe which have high distribution coefficients were intercepted in the top 10 cm of the soil but did not exceed soil screening levels however soil background concentration may also be a major factor in determining the sci the contaminant indices at each time and depth were impacted by both lr and kd for a given pte and a low lr at a given depth there is a critical kd at which soil adsorption will be maximized distribution coefficients higher than the critical value result in lower pte contamination in deeper layers due to pte sorption at shallower media depths by conducting this simulation for any pte of interest designers and other stakeholders can readily recognize the effects of each set of lr and kd combination on the performance of an infiltration smp in terms of contaminant build up and breakthrough in the smp porous media the output would also assist in identifying an appropriate maintenance timetable to limit contaminant concentrations and migration beyond a specified depth which can be adjusted to address the specific constraints of a site if unacceptable values are predicted a designer can improve the design by incorporating a soil amendment to sequester a contaminant of interest or by providing detailed operation and maintenance schedules for media replacement declaration of

1499,stormwater management practices smps rely on infiltration and adsorption capabilities of soil and vegetative cover to mitigate the harmful impacts of contaminants in stormwater runoff including potentially toxic elements ptes under chemical equilibrium conditions the soil water distribution coefficient kd quantifies the relationship between the solid and aqueous phase pte concentrations and thus the pte removal efficiency and mobility through the smp soil layers during the infiltration process the smp loading ratio lr the ratio of the drainage area to the smp infiltration area combined with runoff concentration determines smp mass loading and is also expected to impact pte transport in this study a simulation model was developed to investigate pte breakthrough and build up in smp media considering the impacts of kd and lr eight ptes were simulated cl cr fe zn cu as cd and pb and cl was the only pte that showed high mobility and reached the groundwater table e g 1 year for breakthrough conversely other ptes were effectively immobilized in the top 60 cm of soil for a simulated lifespan of 20 years soil and porewater contaminant indices as indicators of smp lifespan were estimated based on the ratio of pte porewater and soil concentrations after 20 years to published standards suggesting the following order of environmental significance most concern to least cl cr as pb fe cu cd zn after 20 years of simulated use only cl pore water concentrations at the groundwater table exceeded regulatory values with porewater contamination index values of 4 to 7 5 chloride also exceeded the surficial media soil contamination index as did as and cr though these exceedences were largely associated with media background concentrations generally higher lr and kd contributed to higher accumulation of ptes in top layers however simulations showed that the combination of low lr and high kd may result in lower pte accumulation in the media such that the pte concentration in soil may decrease in deeper layers in these scenarios a notable fraction of pte load was adsorbed on top layers and considerably lower pte concentrations reached the lower layers sensitivity analysis revealed that dispersion infiltration rate and kinetically limited sorption did not impact the pte accumulation and mobility to a practical extent the results from this simulation may be adapted to various environmental conditions to enhance the design and maintenance of smps keywords stormwater management practice long term performance potentially toxic element transport soil water distribution coefficient loading ratio contaminant index 1 introduction stormwater runoff in urban areas can be problematic due to potential flooding and water quality deterioration in nearby water bodies park and roesner 2012 urbanization contributes to increased impervious areas and consequently the hazards associated with stormwater runoff intensify purvis et al 2018 stormwater runoff entrains built up

disassociated from the particles e g desorb or dissolve resulting in dissolved contaminants with varying fate and transport properties compared to their particle associated counterparts at elevated concentrations some metals and metalloids have been observed to cause toxic effects on a range of organisms for example while fe is a trace mineral necessary to maintain biochemical reactions of

including as cd and pb are not beneficial at any exposure levels jaishankar et al 2014 drinking water maximum contaminant levels mcl us epa 2017a and aquatic life regulatory standards us epa 2017b have been developed for several potentially toxic elements ptes ptes are ubiquitous in urban areas owing to their broad daily usages in different aspects such as industry transportation systems and households such anthropogenic activities increase the pte load on impervious urban surfaces which are highly susceptible to being washed off during a storm barbosa et al 2012 ptes have also been found in many environmental media including the atmosphere soil plant tissues surface water and groundwater jiang et al 2013 and are concern worthy because they are non degradable and in some cases may bioaccumulate moore et al 2011 these forms of ptes in urban streams are potentially hazardous to both aquatic life and water resources which may serve as drinking water sources for municipalities therefore it is crucial to determine the fate and transport of ptes in infiltration based stormwater management areas stormwater management practices smps also known as best management practice bmp incorporate retention vegetation and infiltration processes to mitigate the potentially harmful impacts of stormwater runoff from quality and quantity perspectives purvis et al 2018 smps are designed to perform two seemingly contradictory tasks provide rapid infiltration to control hydrograph runoff peak discharge tixier et al 2011 and provide sufficient contact time between the porous media soil and the infiltrated water to facilitate contaminant removal xiao et al 2017 smp porous media is commonly comprised of sand with some amount of loam and organic matter davis et al 2001 high sand content promotes rapid infiltration of stormwater while loamy materials containing natural organic matter nom contribute to substantial contaminant removal including ptes during the infiltration process davis et al 2001 media characteristics including the distribution coefficient kd and hydraulic conductivity are critical components to the simultaneous achievement of water quantity and quality design goals as well as the longer term operation and maintenance of smps tixier et al 2011 loading ratio lr is another important design concept that affects both the hydrologic and the contaminant loading of infiltration based smps the hydrologic concept of lr defined as the ratio of the drainage area to the infiltration area is often limited by available land area and other site constraints smp designs with lr values greater than 16 often are reported to fail in managing the stormwater peak discharge pennsylvania department of environmental protection 2006 and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection recommends smp lr of 8 or less in delaware lr should not exceed 8 rocco 2009 but in new york and michigan maximum recommended lr values for smps are 5 southeast michigan council of governments 2008 new york state stormwater management design manual 2017 conventionally lrs are designed based on stormwater quantity control using hydrological data such as precipitation intensity and depth runoff rate and depth soil infiltration rate and in rare cases evapotranspiration coupling stormwater quality parameters with hydrology will help achieve a smp design that attains effective reliable and long term treatment of stormwater anderson et al 2016 reported that smps receiving runoff from impervious catchments achieved an average of 81 removal across all metals evaluated similarly davis et al 2001 used synthetic stormwater in a pilot scale infiltration basin and observed that the sandy loam media showed an excellent reduction in metal concentrations average of larger than 90 in a study of metal adsorption by soil pitt et al 1995 found ptes with a high kd i e pb zn cd cu and ni were removed efficiently by porous media in line with these findings nieber et al 2014 studied impacts of infiltration basins on groundwater quality and found that pb removal efficiency was the highest while cd removal efficiency was the lowest which was consistent with observed sorption affinities i e kd taken together soil media properties represented by kd are a significant factor in the pte removal from the infiltrating runoff anderson et al 2016 nieber et al 2014 davis et al 2001 pitt et al 1995 therefore long term ptes accumulation in the smp media and the potential implications on media lifespan limitations should be considered previous studies have evaluated the impacts of the lr on runoff volume management e g lindsay et al 2016 however long term smp performance with regards to water quality is of critical interest and the interactions among lr media properties and media effective lifespan have not been previously considered computational approaches were used in this study to simulate transport and accumulation of a suite of ptes cl cr fe zn cu as cd and pb in smp media and assess potential impacts of lr and kd the soil and porewater contaminations during the effective lifespan were estimated by comparing the simulation results with published standards additionally simulation results were employed to prioritize the risk associated with ptes based on the accumulation in the soil and breakthrough to the groundwater 2 methods a simulation model was developed to study pte concentrations in both soil and porewater which facilitated the pte impact assessment as it is related to kd and lr values two critical design factors lrs from 2 to 16 were selected based on typical design recommendations southeast michigan council of governments 2008 new york stormwater management design manual 2017 pennsylvania department of environmental protection 2006 rocco 2009 loamy sand has shown appropriate infiltration and moisture retention characteristics alfakih et al 1999 pennsylvania department of environmental protection 2006 however to cover various scenarios more types of soil were considered by applying a range of distribution coefficients and corresponding soil characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity and density the simulation model was developed in matlab mathworks 2017 to evaluate pte transport and accumulation for a 20 year simulated lifespan and consisted of two main components 1 a hydrogeologic component which simulates one dimensional water flow through the smp soil and 2 a solute transport component which simulates pte mass distribution between aqueous and solid phases fig 1 shows a schematic of different system compartments 2 1 simulation characteristics the simulation approach required three input data sets initial soil associated pte concentrations hydrologic precipitation record and runoff pte concentration the approach could be applied for any location with information on these parameters for this study applied rainfall data were extracted from the precipitation records provided by the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa 2018 at the kpne station northeastern philadelphia from january 1998 to august 2018 highway stormwater runoff concentration distributions were derived from an ongoing field study from interstate 95 in northeastern philadelphia pa samples were collected monthly from october 2016 to august 2018 si 1 pte concentrations quantified and the resultant data used to evaluate pte concentration distributions a time series prediction model was used to synthesize runoff concentrations based on the measured concentrations in sampled events pte concentration for a given simulated storm event was randomly sampled from the appropriate lognormal distributions where the mean and standard deviation for a select pte matched those of the field monitoring data further details regarding the prediction of concentration time series are provided in si 1 table 1 summarizes the selected ptes and their mean and standard deviation of influent concentrations c0 toran et al 2017 and soil background concentrations us epa 2003 2 2 water transport component a 20 year precipitation data record with data reported every 24 h from philadelphia was used to provide a realistic precipitation pattern employing higher resolution precipitation data would become important for intense rainfall events but can add sophistication to the model for the purpose of this study the focus was on water quality rather than flood control therefore a high resolution rainfall record was considered less crucial for a given time interval the precipitation depth was multiplied by the lr to determine an applied runoff depth and total incoming volume for infiltration previous research has revealed that hydraulic conductivity depends on temperature and saturation conditions fetter 2008 however this was beyond the scope of this study and a constant value corresponding to the saturated condition was used e g 55 cm day for loamy sand fetter 2008 the infiltration rate f l t depends on the pressure head and the tortuosity coefficient which represents non homogeneity of the media but in this study the infiltration rate was assumed equal to saturated hydraulic conductivity which implies unit hydraulic gradient also the adsorption simulation model assumed equilibrium conditions instantaneous phase transfer independent of contact time and thus variable infiltration rates would have negligible impacts more information in si2 the estimated infiltration rate f was used to simulate water infiltration from the surface to the groundwater table 500 cm below based on the field data from philadelphia interstate 95 smps toran et al 2017 discretized into finite sub sections of 1 cm parameters may be different between the smp media and the underlying media e g native or fill material however those are likely site specific in this study the entire media depth was modeled with the same parameter values but the pte transport sensitivity was evaluated using a range of kd values 2 3 solute transport component solute transport was modeled using linear adsorption under equilibrium conditions eq 1 to calculate the distribution of the pte mass between aqueous and solid phases at any time t and depth z 1 c s t z 0 001 k d c w t z in which cs t z is the pte concentration in the soil mg kg at time t and at the bottom of layer z kd is the soil water distribution coefficient for each pte l kg and cw t z is the pte concentration in porewater μg l at time t at the bottom of the layer z hence the total mass mg present at time t and depth z is 2 l t z 0 001 c w t z v t c s t z m s where l t z is total pte mass mg at time t and at the bottom of layer z v t is stormwater runoff volume present in the control volume during time t and ms is the soil control volume mass kg in this model the dimensions of the soil control volume are 1 m 1 m 1 cm l w d initially the total mass available for distribution is 3 l t z 1 0 001 c w t z 1 v t c s t z 1 m s in which l t z 1 is total pte mass mg at time t and at the top of layer z cs t z 1 is the initial pte concentration in the soil mg kg at time t and at the top of layer z and cw t z 1 is the pte concentration in pore water ug l at the same time and depth i e top of the layer combining eqs 1 2 and 3 the concentration of pte in the porewater at the end of time t and the bottom of layer z is 4 c w t z c w t z 1 v t 1000 c s t z 1 m s k d m s v t by solving eqs 1 and 4 simultaneously the pte concentrations in each phase at a desired time and depth can be calculated the accuracy of these equations to simulate water and solute transport through the media was evaluated and confirmed by applying hydrus 1 d simunek 2015 in two cases si 2 2 4 modeling assumptions this transport simulation model was built on several initial simplifying assumptions only vertical infiltration was considered one dimensional infiltration and the depth to the water table which is representative of the unsaturated zone was assumed to be fixed at 500 cm and unaffected by stormwater infiltration it is assumed that no overflow will occur i e ponded depth does not reach the outlet overflow depth in the basin and evapotranspiration et is negligible hence all stormwater entering the basin exits via infiltration chances of overflow are normally low in well designed infiltration based smps which implies that neglecting overflow does not notably change the results of a long term simulation si 2 for further information nonetheless when overflow through the smp outlet structure occurs the runoff volume and associated contaminant load available for infiltration is reduced in this study we made the conservative assumption that all runoff would be infiltrated and no overflow would occur heterogeneities associated with soil and plants make the estimation of stormwater loss via et a complex process which was not addressed in this research solute fate and transport generally have four main phenomena advection dispersion retardation and attenuation the infiltration rate can be considered as the advective factor in this one dimensional transport model in the case of groundwater flow the seepage velocities are relatively small therefore dispersion becomes an important factor in contaminant transport however in the case of typical smp infiltration rates the transport would be dominated by advection i e high peclet number and dispersion could be neglected retardation was addressed in the modeled pte by adsorption to soil particles which was assumed to be an instantaneous phase transfer resulting in equilibrium condition this assumption was evaluated through sensitivity analysis si 2 it is also noteworthy that the potential competition for sorption sites among different ptes was not reflected in this model furthermore removal via other compartments e g plants gas phase was not included in the current model which is supported by ongoing project work to measure plant uptake and translocation of ptes toran et al 2017 ptes in the study are stable isotopes and thus attenuation was not considered 2 5 contaminant indices calculated soil associated and porewater concentrations were compared to regulatory human health and aquatic life criteria table 2 after calculating the pte concentrations in the solid phase for each specified depth and time the soil contaminant index sci was calculated using eq 5 which is similar to an approach applied by hakanson 1980 5 sci c s s x in which cs is the soil pte concentration and sx is the recommended soil pte screening value for the pte and varies with land use category us epa 2002 soil effective lifespan can be considered exhausted when sci at a chosen depth exceeds unity similarly the porewater contaminant index pwci was evaluated using the same approach from eq 6 hakanson 1980 6 pwci c w l x in which cw is porewater pte concentration and lx is the more stringent value of epa aquatic life criteria or drinking water mcl us epa 2017a us epa 2017b where values higher than unity for porewater at the groundwater table indicate concern worthy contamination with regard to a given pte the total contaminant index tci is the geometric average of sci and pwci eq 7 and provides complementary value for the holistic pte prioritization 7 tci sci pwci 3 results and discussion the transport simulation model was employed to estimate the pte concentration in both aqueous and solid phases over a 20 year period to address the study objectives the results are presented in four sections model assumption validation description of pte accumulation and breakthrough pte prioritization based on contaminant indices and sensitivity analysis on lr and kd to evaluate the smp performance in pte removal under various scenarios in the first two sections the initial surface runoff pte concentrations were fixed at the average field measured concentrations i e the constant value shown in the first row of table 1 and the smp loading ratio was fixed at 8 to evaluate pte accumulation and breakthrough in the smp medium while the study approach was employed to evaluate smp performance for interstate 95 in the philadelphia pa area this framework can be readily adapted for other locations of interest 3 1 the sensitivity of model output to modeling assumptions the simplifying assumptions used in this simulation model were validated by applying the model to simple cases i e short term transport simulation of a pte with constant load and fixed precipitation and comparing the model outputs to results from other available tools e g hydrus and similar studies i e literature review diffusion which was neglected in the matlab simulation code was determined to have negligible impact on pte transport si fig 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 in regard to infiltration rates and its impact on solute transport buffle et al 2007 compared infiltration rates with some typical pte diffusion coefficients and found that the vertical component of transport i e infiltration rate is orders of magnitude faster than the diffusive component implying that overlooking the diffusive part of dispersion will not significantly affect the accuracy of the transport model additionally under the assumption of a chemically equilibrated system the decreased infiltration rate in an unsaturated zone would have no effect unsaturated zones have lower hydraulic conductivity compared to saturated zones due to more limited water transmission in air containing pores fetter 2008 instantaneous sorption reactions were generally assumed but the impact of rate limited sorption was considered for multiple cases and determined to have minimal effects in the case of non equilibrium adsorption in which contact time becomes important varying hydraulic conductivity particularly in the soil upper layers i e top 150 cm had a negligible impact si fig 2 3 1 additionally kinetic limitations may be present in high darcy velocity scenarios including rapid infiltration the impact of rate limited sorption was evaluated for cr and fe based on the experimentally derived rate constant of k 0 005 per day lee et al 2012 cr exhibited minimal differences between rate limited and equilibrium scenarios but modest differences were observed for fe where kinetic limitations resulted in greater transport into the media si figs 2 4 1 and 2 4 2 for all four scenarios the pte load is immobilized within the top 100 cm of media although differences between the equilibrium and non equilibrium cases were observed the impacts on smp functionality are insignificant the impact on long term surficial soil concentrations and associated soil lifespan are not substantially different equilibrium conditions may provide more conservative pte soil accumulation estimates while kinetic models more conservatively simulate contaminant transport toward the groundwater table neither scenario suggested a risk and chemical equilibrium was selected to address the goals of this study 3 2 pte accumulation and breakthrough pte accumulation and breakthrough were initially evaluated for specific soil kd values and runoff concentrations where the simplified system enabled a clear demonstration of trends a literature assessment of pte distribution coefficients revealed substantial variability for ptes of interest typical distribution coefficients for ptes in this study si 3 suggests that they may be categorized as mobile ptes including cl with a small kd value of 1 l kg marginally mobile ptes including cr cu zn as and cd with kd values between 200 and 1000 l kg and significantly immobilized ptes such as pb and fe with high kd values of 2000 and 7500 l kg respectively pte accumulation and breakthrough are discussed according to this classification for mass transport in the porous media retardation factor r can be a surrogate of kd to elaborate on the combined role of kd as a chemical property and media characteristics in slowing the pte transport process eq 8 usepa 1999 8 r 1 ρ k d n in which ρ is dry bulk density kg l and n is the porosity of the media using typical loamy sand values of 1 6 kg l and 0 41 for density and porosity fetter 2008 respectively corresponding r values can be computed for this case r for cl as a mobile pte is 4 9 while it ranges from 780 to 3900 for marginally mobile ptes and r values greater than 7800 for significantly immobile ptes i e fe and pb to enable easy comparison both kd and r values have been provided throughout the discussion and table 3 summarizes the typical kd and r values for the studied ptes in a loamy sand media limited sorption and elevated mass load resulted in a rapid breakthrough of cl to the groundwater table after 1 1 years in the case of loamy sand media with r 4 9 fig 2 kd 1 l kg sheppard et al 2009 however using a media with higher kd r 40 drastically delayed breakthrough but was not able to protect the underlying water body in the long term this finding agrees with field monitoring by li 2007 which showed that smps were incapable of intercepting cl salinization of urban streams and other waterways has gained national attention particularly in northern climates where road de icing salts typically composed of nacl are widely utilized fleming 2015 despite the low sorption capacity of cl some studies have shown that cl mobility in the soil can be reduced due to the formation of chlorinated organic matter that is subsequently adsorbed onto the media bastviken et al 2007 also cl can accumulate in the plant tissues which can potentially reach toxic levels hajrasuliha 1980 but this may not substantially affect the cl flux via the infiltration process as can be seen from fig 3 full breakthrough at 5 cm below the surface is achieved for ptes with an r value less than 2000 pte removal by the upper most soil layer results in elevated soil associated pte concentrations simulated trends agree with a field study of smps serving highways in essen germany by dierkes and geiger 1999 where soil samples showed elevated concentrations for a suite of metals pb zn cu and cd in the top 5 cm layer and then the concentrations substantially decreased in deeper layers the change in pb concentration with depth was the sharpest while the cd concentration change was the least sharp assessment of field dierkes and geiger 1999 and modeling results in this study confirms the importance of adsorption to smp media in limiting the vertical mobility of ptes and suggests that infiltration based smps may be protective of water that receives infiltrated stormwater i e underlying groundwater and downstream water resources ptes in this study were retained in the top 60 cm of media i e r 780 save cl for the specified lr 8 and chemical equilibrium fig 4 for instance at 20 years complete cu breakthrough is observed at 3 cm below the surface indicating this soil layer has reached its cu adsorption capacity partial cu breakthrough is observed no deeper than 19 cm indicating porewater cu concentrations that are essentially zero at deeper layers in contrast porewater cr achieves complete breakthrough at almost 30 cm below the surface with partial breakthrough up to 57 cm below the surface since the expected lifespan of infiltration basins is 10 to 15 years department of industry and science 2015 after which the smp media needs replacement the slow transport of ptes observed in this study suggests the time for breakthrough to groundwater exceeds the smp lifespan these model results are in line with other studies that reported metals are trapped in the top 50 cm of the media nieber et al 2014 similarly the complementary field monitoring efforts at the philadelphia interstate 95 site porewater samples collected via suction lysimeters since 2017 installed at 15 and 30 cm below the surface have shown that the smps are far from pte breakthrough and the upper layers are still effectively removing metals caplan et al 2018 3 3 pte prioritization for pte prioritization efforts the model complexity was increased to reflect varying pte loads from the surface runoff i e historic precipitation record and statistically sampled concentrations and the calculated soil and porewater concentrations were compared to relevant regulatory standards pedestrian and pet exposure to smp media is most relevant for the top layers e g 1 5 cm as a result surficial soil concentrations were compared to soil screening values of residential areas pennsylvania department of environmental protection 2016 exposure risk to porewater was likely the greatest concern relating to impacting groundwater due to contamination of drinking water resources or potential effects on groundwater impacted surface water systems porewater contamination was evaluated at the modeled groundwater table 500 cm below the smp surface to develop the contaminant indices published standards for pennsylvania table 2 were used table 4 presents the contaminant indices from the upper most soil layer which suggest that some pte may accumulate to concentrations exceeding screening levels chloride exceeds the regulatory soil screening values after 0 03 year while high background concentrations of cr and as resulted in scis greater than unity though these could be mitigated through a selection of soil media with lower cr and as initial concentrations however fe cu zn cd and pb concentrations are noticeably below the soil screening value after a 20 year simulation comprehensive results of contaminant indices for different scenarios i e soil type and lrs are presented in si 4 the results of the contamination assessment in the layer adjacent to groundwater are summarized in table 5 based on a 20 year simulation of pte dynamics in the smp media cl is the only pte among those studied which reaches the lower layer and exceeds screening criteria by a considerable amount i e 6 1 times the regulatory value the complete breakthrough of cl from the surface to groundwater is rapid and occurs after approximately 2 5 years also pwci 1 reflecting the variable concentration and precipitation constant in section 3 2 tables 4 and 5 suggest cl cr and as might be problematic in the infiltration basins because of relatively high contaminant indices and ptes can be prioritized as follows ranked from greatest to least risk cl cr as pb fe cu cd zn the above prioritization has been established using the quality of the stormwater runoff in the interstate 95 smps pennsylvania water quality standards and assumed lr and kd values other values could be employed to calculate indices and this would change the results accordingly generally ptes in stormwater runoff can be prioritized based on their environmental concerns including chronic toxicity thresholds eriksson et al 2006 eriksson et al 2006 found the suite of cd cr cu ni pb pt and zn in stormwater runoff possess toxicity risk for chronic exposure scenarios and therefore are categorized as high priority metals nieber et al 2014 reported the high priority metals in the stormwater as pb zn cu and cd due to their abundance in the environment and toxicity the study also found that their associated hazards as a result of breakthrough to groundwater is a long process pitt et al 1995 found that metals introduced to infiltration basins from surface runoff would be unlikely to impact underlying water bodies however in contrast zn can impose a potential contamination hazard for groundwater due to its abundance in the media chloride concentrations in soil at different depths were simulated using variable precipitation and surface load despite environmental variabilities the fluctuation of cl in the media attenuated with depth due to the media sorption capacity but soil cl concentration typically exceeded the published screening standard in all reported depths after 20 years of simulation fig 5 relatively similar median cl concentrations in the media during 20 years of simulation indicates that the breakthrough has occurred and the media would no longer protect the groundwater from cl leakage numerous stormwater studies also found cl is not effectively removed by the stormwater infiltration process and therefore poses a high risk of groundwater contamination kaushal et al 2005 pitt et al 1995 figs 6 and 7 depict the concentrations of cr and as respectively in the soil at different depths over time for both cases a limited breakthrough is predicted for depths greater than 60 cm as can be seen after 5 years of simulation cr reached complete breakthrough at 5 cm below the surface and did not reach to 30 cm below the surface at the same time a complete breakthrough of as at 5 cm below the surface did not occur and as was found in trivial concentrations in 15 cm below the surface at 15 cm below the surface the complete breakthrough of cr occurred after 10 2 years while breakthrough of as to the same depth required 19 2 years it highlights the importance of retardation factor as well as incoming contaminant load and background contamination of the media the findings in this study are in line with a hydrus 2d simulations of an agricultural field where non equilibrium and non linear sorption model were employed and the suite of metals were largely intercepted by top 60 cm of the media xiao et al 2015 3 4 effects of varying lr and kd on the performance of infiltration basins a wide range of kd values representative of the ptes for various soil types based on published literature in conjunction with lrs ranging from 2 to 16 were used to envision the interacting effects of lr and kd the results for cl and as are presented here and a complete presentation of the results can be found in si 5 for cl which potentially reaches the groundwater table the results are illustrated at 500 cm below the surface after 20 years figs 8 and si6 and for the case of as which proved to be more problematic in top layers the results at 5 cm below the surface after 20 years are shown fig 9 fig 8 uses a heatmap to provide a visual overview of how applying varying lrs and kd values impact the cl pwci at the groundwater table the heatmap is generally divided by an imaginary line into areas with pwci lower than unity and the areas at which pwci ranges from 1 to 7 5 for any given lr there is an upper limit of kd above which a limited amount of cl reaches the groundwater table for instance with a lr of 8 and kd value greater than 6 5 l kg the majority of the cl load is sorbed onto the soil particles in top layers however for a lr of 8 and kd less than 6 5 l kg pwci exceeds unity and groundwater contamination may occur the variability in the region where pwci 1 is due to the stochastic influent concentration reflecting the observed variability in stormwater concentrations e g due to deicer salt use and the effects of exchange between the solid and liquid matrices i e both adsorption and desorption this reversible process means that cl will desorb when the runoff is relatively less concentrated e g no de icing salt which results in an attenuated cl concentration fig 5 with non uniform concentration through depth and time fig 8 such heatmaps at different depths can be useful design tools to evaluate the combination of lr and kd that meets smp design goals si 7 surficial as concentration is further explored in fig 9 where the interactions between lr and kd are evaluated for porewater and soil concentrations i e concentrations at 5 cm depth in fig 9a and b respectively fig 9a shows that for low kd values e g 100 l kg the porewater concentration is highly dependent on the lr but kd values greater than 400 l kg coupled with low lr values cause declining porewater concentration which highlights the important interaction between lr and kd in contaminant dynamics the quasi straight line reveals that the porewater concentration at 5 cm depth after 20 years is generally insensitive to both lr and kd values and that the porewater concentration is similar to the mean influent as concentration i e complete breakthrough fig 9b demonstrates as soil concentration largely follows a quasi linear trend associated with full breakthrough though some deviations are observed for low lr elevated kd systems the interaction between lr and kd values indicates that if higher kd values can be coupled with lower lr values then as contamination can be limited using lr 6 and kd 400 critical distribution coefficient may be associated with a supply limitation resulting in incomplete breakthrough for a wide range of lrs and distribution coefficients the sci for as exceeds 1 12 at 5 cm below the surface after 20 years which implies the importance of monitoring as in the system to evaluate the effective lifespan of the system however for this particular case high as background concentration in the soil 13 mg kg was the primary reason and the rate of accumulation in top layers played a less important role elevated as concentrations highlight the importance of ensuring clean media during smp construction 4 conclusions prioritization of ptes based on comparing their presence in the infiltration based smps with published standards indicated higher environmental risk from cl cr and as chloride most commonly from applying deicing salts in colder regions is mobile and can readily migrate from the surface through the porous media and into groundwater in smps with lifespans of 20 years marginally mobile ptes such as cr and as can accumulate in the top 60 cm of soil which is protective of the underlying groundwater but may eventually result in scis greater than unity lead pb and fe which have high distribution coefficients were intercepted in the top 10 cm of the soil but did not exceed soil screening levels however soil background concentration may also be a major factor in determining the sci the contaminant indices at each time and depth were impacted by both lr and kd for a given pte and a low lr at a given depth there is a critical kd at which soil adsorption will be maximized distribution coefficients higher than the critical value result in lower pte contamination in deeper layers due to pte sorption at shallower media depths by conducting this simulation for any pte of interest designers and other stakeholders can readily recognize the effects of each set of lr and kd combination on the performance of an infiltration smp in terms of contaminant build up and breakthrough in the smp porous media the output would also assist in identifying an appropriate maintenance timetable to limit contaminant concentrations and migration beyond a specified depth which can be adjusted to address the specific constraints of a site if unacceptable values are predicted a designer can improve the design by incorporating a soil amendment to sequester a contaminant of interest or by providing detailed operation and maintenance schedules for media replacement declaration of
