19770,comprehensive monitoring of water pollution is challenging with the increasing amount and types of anthropogenic compounds being released into water there are rising concerns of undetected toxicity this is especially true for municipal wastewater effluents that are discharged to surface waters this study was designed to integrate zebrafish toxicogenomics targeted gene expression and morphological analyses for toxicity evaluation of effluent discharged from two previously characterized wastewater treatment plants wwtps in pima county arizona and their receiving surface water zebrafish embryos were exposed to organic extracts from the wwtp1 effluent that were reconstituted to represent 1 and 0 5 of the original concentration microarray analyses identified deregulated gene probes that mapped to 1666 779 and 631 unique human homologs in the 1 0 5 and the intersection of both groups respectively these were associated with 18 cellular and molecular functions ranging from cell cycle to metabolism and are involved in the development and function of 10 organ systems including nervous cardiovascular haematological reproductive and hepatic systems superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis retinoic acid receptor activation glucocorticoid receptor and prolactin signaling were among the top 11 perturbed canonical pathways real time quantitative pcr validated the expression changes of 12 selected genes these genes were then tested on zebrafish embryos exposed to the reconstituted extract of water sampled downstream of wwtp1 and another nearby wwtp2 the expression of several targeted genes were significantly affected by the wwtp effluents and some of the downstream receiving waters morphological analyses using four transgenic zebrafish lines revealed potential toxicity associated with nervous hepatic endothelial vascular and myeloid systems this study demonstrated how information can be obtained using adverse outcome pathway framework to derive biological effect based monitoring tools this integrated approach using zebrafish can supplement analytical chemistry to provide more comprehensive monitoring of discharged effluents and their receiving waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords zebrafish toxicogenomics secondary effluent biomonitoring bioassay water reuse 1 introduction the monitoring of water quality is challenging due to the numerous natural and anthropogenic chemicals found in the water bodies with the increasing amount and types of anthropogenic compounds being introduced into water in addition to transformation products formed during water treatment it is not feasible to analytically detect and quantify every chemical contaminant in water merel et al 2015 moreover even if individual chemicals are detectable multiple chemicals may interact to induce toxicity in aquatic organisms via mechanisms such antagonism additivity or synergism adebambo et al 2015 carvalho et al 2014 therefore biomonitoring is recommended as a complementary approach to assess the potential toxicity of water altenburger et al 2015 gerbersdorf et al 2015 escher et al 2014 leusch and snyder 2015 fish are the most commonly used vertebrates for biomonitoring of water quality acute tests in adult fish oecd 1992 and fish embryo tests oecd 2013 based on mortality rate and gross morphological changes have been used to assess toxicity of aquatic contaminants in the laboratory and field however gross morphological changes can be difficult to quantify or lack adequate sensitivity transgenic fish with fluorescent proteins expressed in specific tissues can facilitate the visualization kim et al 2013 and enable the quantitative measurement of changes in these tissues even when no gross morphological changes can be observed in wild type fish chen et al 2010 fetter et al 2014 kim et al 2013 ng and gong 2013 yet current application of transgenic fish in biomonitoring is still limited especially transgenic fish with specific compound inducible reporter gene partly because they lack sensitivity to detect the specific compounds at environmentally relevant concentrations lee et al 2015b expression analysis of targeted genes that are known to be impacted by specific compounds is also used for example biomarker genes for oxidative stress estrogenic and androgenic compounds were used to evaluate whether water downstream from a wwtp discharge could change the expression of these genes in fish jasinska et al 2015 toxicogenomic approaches that capture genome wide expression changes induced by contaminants can provide insight on 1 the molecular mechanism of toxicity 2 candidate biomarkers for exposure to toxicants and 3 inference of the potential effects that have not yet reflected as morphological changes chen et al 2012 naciff and daston 2004 for instance certain transcriptome profiles were identifiable in rats hamadeh et al 2002 in zebrafish embryos yang et al 2007 and in whole adult zebrafish lam et al 2008 exposed to certain compounds moreover transcriptomic profiling of fish such as largescale suckers christiansen et al 2014 fathead minnows sellin jeffries et al 2012 and zebrafish bluhm et al 2014 kosmehl et al 2012 exposed to environmental samples with unknown chemical composition can reveal affected biology and provide information on the exposure conditions or presence of potential classes of contaminants however challenges still remain in distinguishing between responses induced by specific classes of contaminants and the more universal detoxification mechanisms bluhm et al 2014 moreover molecular changes are influenced more by the bioavailability of the compounds in sample mixture which is determined by sample processing and exposure methods than the original composition of the mixture kosmehl et al 2012 therefore the transcriptomic changes detected are only molecular changes that may or may not be directly driven by the compound s being studied nevertheless candidate biomarkers identified from toxicogenomic studies can be used as effect based monitoring tools in future studies or facilitate the development of environmental risk assessment that is based on the adverse outcome pathway aop framework by providing evidence for molecular initiating events or cellular key events in the toxicity pathways that lead to organ key events and adverse outcome at the organism and population levels ankley et al 2010 lee et al 2015a the santa cruz river in pima county arizona usa is an effluent dependent stream receiving effluent from two wwtps previous studies have been performed using chemical analyses in vitro bioassays and expression analysis of target genes for glucocorticoid results of which have raised concern on the potential toxicity of the effluent especially the glucocorticoid activity and estrogenic activity chen et al 2016 dong et al 2015 jia et al 2015 yet it is not known whether other pathways or expression of other genes can also be affected in vivo by this effluent dependent stream given the availability of transgenic lines genomic platforms and the advantages of zebrafish as a model scholz et al 2008 the current study aimed to integrate zebrafish approaches involving microarray based toxicogenomics targeted gene expression and transgenic embryos to assess the potential toxicity of the effluent from the two wwtps and the receiving effluent dependent segment of the santa cruz river 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and extraction effluent samples were collected from two wwtps located in pima county arizona usa which receive predominantly municipal sewage from over half a million domestic residents at the time of sample collection wwtp1 used a trickling filter treatment system with a capacity of 1 80 m3 s wwtp2 is located approximately 6 km downstream to wwtp1 along the santa cruz river which uses an activated sludge treatment system and has a treatment capacity of 1 64 m3 s both facilities include disinfection in the treatment process using chlorine or chloramine which is subsequently de chlorinated following regulatory disinfection requirements effluents of both wwtps are directly discharged into the santa cruz river a toxicity study and a transcriptomic analysis were performed using effluent of wwtp1 with 0 05 dmso as the control in the multi site study water samples were collected at five santa cruz river sites assigned as s1 to s5 together with a field blank supplementary figs s1 and s2 s1 and s3 were the points of discharge for wwtp1 and wwtp2 respectively s2 was immediately upstream of wwtp2 and is surface water consisting of only wwtp1 effluent s4 and s5 were downstream of wwtp2 and approximately 10 km and 12 km away from wwtp1 respectively the field blank was the control it consisted of ultra pure water and it went through identical procedures as the other samples from collection through sample preparation all sampling equipment was triple rinsed with the sample water at each site before sample collection for each sample 10 l was collected in a polypropylene bucket then poured into amber glass bottles ten extractions of one liter aliquots of water were conducted using a solid phase extraction technique described previously anumol et al 2013 with the resulting extracts combined and concentrated into 1 ml of dmso briefly samples were filtered through a 0 7 μm filter and then solid phase extracted spe using 200 mg hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb cartridges waters corporation millford ma samples were eluted with 5 ml of a 10 90 v v methanol mtbe solution the 10 resulting extracts were combined evaporated to near dryness and re solvated in 1 ml of dmso the concentration factor from the original water sample to the final dmso extract was 10 000 fold 2 2 wild type and transgenic zebrafish husbandry all experiments using zebrafish were conducted following the protocol approved by the

randomly placed into 6 well plates containing 4 ml well of exposure media control medium for wwtp1 effluent was e3 medium with 0 05 v v dmso while control medium for santa cruz river samples was 1 reconstitution of the field blank duration of all exposure was five days and all media were renewed every 24 h in the toxicity study all five concentrations of wwtp1 effluent were tested selected morphological end points were recorded for wild type fish and tg nkx2 2a megfp were used for image analysis n 10 for microarray study only wild type was used and they were exposed to 0 5 and 1 wwtp1

based data mining for the microarray experiment only wild type embryos to 1 and 0 5 reconstituted wwtp1 effluent were compared to the dmso control group a total of 14 hybridizations four control replicates and five replicates for 1 and 0 5 groups were performed using agilent zebrafish whole genome oligo microarray ver3 0 4 44k agilent ca usa as previously described chen et al 2017 the raw data have been deposited in the ncbi geo database gse93532 batch normalized signal intensity were statistically analysed the gene probes with adjusted p value 05 in one way anova and fold change fc 1 3 were evaluated at different tukey p values threshold after which those with tukey p value 01 were considered deregulated genes the deregulated gene lists were denoted as 1 and 0 5 for the respective treatment groups and 1 0 5 for their intersection which were then used for knowledge based functional analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis ipa ingenuity ca usa in the following categories molecular and cellular function physiological system development and function and canonical signaling pathways details of microarray experiment and analysis can be found in supplementary information 2

institute of health usa software was used to quantify the length of axons for tg nkx2 2 megfp and the rfp intensity in the liver for lipan imaris 8 bitplane switzerland software was used to quantify the number of neutrophils rfp spots in tg lyz dsred2 and the gfp intensity of tg fli1 egfp in the posterior region from the anus to the caudal fin tip while the anterior trunk and the head region are excluded due to overlapping or saturation of the fluorescent signals the image analysis data were presented as mean measurement standard error s e 2 7 total rna extraction dna synthesis and real time

analyses on δct values for real time pcr data and on measurements of imaging data were performed using ibm spss statistics ibm corporation usa normality and homogeneity of variances were tested using shapiro wilk and levene s tests respectively for data that assumed normality one way anova was performed and those with p value 05 were subjected to tukey for homogeneous variances or dunnett t3 post hoc test for heterogeneous variances for data that did not assume normality kruskal wallis test was performed and those with p value 05 were subjected to mann whitney u test in post hoc tests p value 05 was indicated as statistically significant while 0 05 p value 1 is marginally significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 embryo toxicity testing of effluent from wwtp1 a 5 day embryo toxicity test was performed using wwtp1 effluent extract that has been reconstituted to 0 2 to 5 of the original concentration before hatching no difference was observed in the number of embryos with coagulation 2 embryos of all groups showed normal tail detachment somite development eye development blood circulation and spontaneous movement at 24 hpf and 48 hpf heartbeat rate was counted at 48 hpf and there was a notable reduction of 5 13 in 0 5 and higher concentration groups fig 1 a and supplementary fig s3a in addition about 25 embryos of the 5 group had developed edema at 48 hpf although embryos from other groups were normal hatching rate at 3 dpf was 100 in all groups pigmentation development and touch response of all larvae were normal survival rate during the 5 day exposure was not affected by 2 5 or lower concentrations of the reconstituted effluent extract however all larvae in the 5 group died by 4 dpf fig 1b tg nkx2 2a egfp larvae in all treatment groups had shorter motor axon along the spinal cord despite normal touch response fig 1c d and supplementary fig s2b taken together the 5 concentration of the original effluent was acutely lethal to embryos while the 1 and 0 5 concentrations of the effluent could affect the cardiovascular and nervous system despite normal gross appearance the reduced heartbeat rate can be regarded as altered tissue function and the reduced axon length represents altered tissue development which are key events occurring at the organ level that could lead to adverse outcomes at the organism and population levels as inferred from the aop framework ankley et al 2010 browne et al 2017 zebrafish that have been genetically manipulated to model cardiovascular conditions with reduced heartbeat rate or bradycardia experienced earlier premature death huttner et al 2013 or lower viability although they may not display any obvious ill effects warren et al 2001 suggesting a lower general fitness impaired axonal outgrowth and reduced axonal length in zebrafish can be genetically and chemically modulated to model a group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as hereditary spastic paraplegias where morphant zebrafish displayed a range of phenotype from normal to impaired swimming behaviour to immotile wood et al 2006 butler et al 2010 previously we have tested the tg nkx2 2a egfp larvae which demonstrated dose dependent axon length reduction in larvae exposed to neurotoxic compounds but no significant reduction of axon length for non neurotoxic compounds zhang and gong 2013 therefore the reduced heart rate and axon length are altered tissue development function representing key events at the organ level that could lead to adverse outcome such as lower fitness lesser motility or impaired locomotion at the organism level which in turn could cause individuals to be more vulnerable to predation reduced survival chance and less successful in finding food reduced growth or mate reduced reproductive chance hence resulting in the decrease of population size in the wild however whether these key events of reduce heartbeat rate and axon length reduction detected in the present fish embryo toxicity test would lead to adverse outcome of lower fitness and motility defects can only be determined with a longer term exposure test 3 2 microarray based toxicogenomics revealed transcriptomic changes induced by effluent of wwtp1 to capture the transcriptomic changes 14 microarray experiments were performed using total rna from wild type larvae exposed to 1 and 0 5 wwtp1 effluent which are the two lowest concentrations that induced adverse effects in the toxicity study with the criterion of corrected p value 05 in one way anova 4915 gene probes were selected for tukey post hoc test and fc selection threshold of 1 3 the resulting number of significant gene probes was evaluated using tukey p value 001 0 005 0 01 and 0 05 fig 2 a the proportion of significant gene probes intersecting between the 1 and 0 5 groups was greater than 70 in all cases such a high overlap of deregulated genes suggests the effluent had induced robust transcriptomic changes to balance between statistical confidence and type 2 error tukey p value 01 was selected as the cut off which resulted in 3579 1732 and 1381 significant probes in the 1 0 5 and the intersection 1 0 5 group respectively fig 2b 3 3 knowledge based functional analysis of the deregulated genes revealed molecular effects induced by the effluent the deregulated probes for the three groups i e 1 0 5 and 1 0 5 were mapped respectively to 1666 779 and 631 unique human homologs in ipa supplementary tables s2 4 and analysed the distribution of the functional types and the cellular locations of the proteins encoded by these genes are presented in supplementary fig s3 enriched functional categories with fisher s exact p value 005 in all three groups were highlighted in fig 3 the top enriched categories under molecular and cellular functions fig 3a were cellular growth and proliferation cell morphology cell death and survival gene expression and cellular development p value 7 68e 20 to 3 03e 08 under physiological system development and function fig 3b the top enriched categories were organismal survival development and embryonic development p value 3 44e 23 to 3 05e 07 followed by organ tissue morphology and development as well as nervous digestive cardiovascular haematological reproductive and hepatic systems p value 5 04e 25 to 5 24e 05 these gene expression changes provided gene activation and altered signaling information at the cellular level as part of the toxicity pathway associated with key events as outlined within aop framework ankley et al 2010 browne et al 2017 these altered gene expression associated with cardiovascular or nervous systems could indicate cellular key events that could be associated respectively to reduced heartbeat rate and axon length detected at the organ level by the embryo toxicity tests for example when the detailed functional annotations associated with nervous system category were examined it was found that growth of neurites p value 6 74e 04 was predicted to be decreased activation z score 2 computed by the ipa algorithm indicated significant down regulation of neurite growth which could represent cellular key events for the reduced axon length observed at the organ level deregulated canonical pathways were examined fig 3d the top two pathways were glucocorticoid receptor gr signaling and retinoic acid receptor rar activation p value 5 37e 06 to 1 20e 04 which are both nuclear receptor and transcriptional factor signaling pathways two cancer related pathways small cell lung cancer signaling and hereditary breast cancer signaling two pathways related to b cell activation of the immune system april mediated signaling and b cell activating factor signaling and two phosphoinositides related pathways for the metabolism of intracellular signal transduction molecules d myo inositol 5 phosphate metabolism and 3 phosphoinositide biosynthesis were also enriched p value 3 89e 05 to 4 47e 03 the superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis was the top enriched pathway in 1 group p value 3 89e 05 a hormonal related pathway prolactin signaling and xenobiotic metabolism pathway aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr signaling were also enriched p value 3 89e 05 to 4 47e 03 results from ipa revealed potential cellular and physiological changes that were consistent with previous studies of the wwtp1 effluent as well as changes that were not reported before the effluent of wwtp1 has been shown to induce gc transcriptional activities in in vitro gr bioassay and in vivo in zebrafish larvae chen et al 2016 the current analysis provided strong evidence on the deregulation of gc target genes crosstalk between gr signaling and rar signaling has been previously described where a heterodimer of rar alpha and retinoid x receptor rxr was shown to enhance the transcriptional activity of gr toth et al 2011 crosstalk between gr and ahr has also been documented in vitro including enhanced gr activity but suppression of ahr mediated expressions wang et al 2009 however it is not clear if these signaling pathways were all directly perturbed by the effluent or indirectly as a result of crosstalk findings from this transcriptomic analysis could also be partly explained by the compounds that have been repeatedly detected in the wwtp1 effluent supplementary table s5 representative gcs such as prednisone and hydrocortisone have been repeatedly detected at low ng l concentrations yet the total gc concentration as reflected by in vitro gc activity can be much higher chen et al 2016 highlighting the importance of using bioassays to complement chemical analysis synthetic gcs could affect gr signaling as well as haematological and lymphoid systems of fish ribas et al 2016 which was consistent with our transcriptomic analysis fig 3b and this may increase susceptibility to infection and affect health of the organism another hormone detected at low ng l was progesterone which is a risk factor for breast cancer obr and edwards 2012 and is known to augment prolactin synthesis freeman et al 2000 both breast cancer and prolactin signaling pathways have been significantly associated with the deregulated genes in all three groups fig 3c hence suggesting potential endocrine disruption and effects on reproductive fitness two antibacterial agents triclosan and triclocarban are known endocrine disruptors that exert developmental reproductive toxicity halden 2014 and known to activate ahr responsive genes in vitro ahn et al 2008 hence possibly affecting endocrine and reproductive system fig 3b as well as deregulating ahr signaling fig 3c triclosan has been shown to cause subtle cardiac toxicity in developing zebrafish saley et al 2016 and cardiotoxicity was inferred fig 3b and detected fig 1a in our analyses triclosan has also been shown to delay development of secondary motor neurons muth köhne et al 2012 a possible contributor to inferred affects to nervous system fig 3b and the shortened axons fig 1c d taken together the biological inference was consistent with the known biological effects of the compounds that have been repeatedly detected from the aop framework some of these compounds would have operated through ligand receptor interaction as molecular initiating events that altered signaling pathways and gene expression at the cellular level and subsequently affected tissue development and function at the organ system level which are key events that can potentially lead to adverse outcomes at the organism and population levels however given that complex mixture of compounds were used in this study there will be multiple initiating events and the present experimental design will not be able to decipher the relationships between cellular key events that affected organ key events nevertheless based on the organ key events we could infer adverse outcomes which could only be verified through a longer term embryo to adult exposure test 3 4 real time qpcr validation of selected genes for exposure to wwtp1 effluent expression of the twelve genes selected from the transcriptome analysis was validated using real time qpcr three genes that ranked among the top in the deregulated gene list of 1 0 5 group aquaporin 10a aqp10a mitochondrial solute carrier slc25a25 and an uncharacterized cytochrome p450 family gene cyp2x12 were significantly upregulated by both 1 and 0 5 effluent as in the microarray data fig 4 a c functions of these three genes have not been well studied the expression of aqp10a in medaka has been shown to decrease when the fish was exposure to sea water suggesting its role in osmoregulation madsen et al 2014 the function of slc25a25 in fish is unknown but its human homolog encodes for a mitochondrial protein involved in the regulation of hepatocyte functions mashima et al 2003 nine genes involved in four selected functional categories were also validated these included two genes involved in cellular growth and proliferation dna damage inducible transcript 4 ddit4 and high mobility group at hook 2 hmga2 which increased moderately in both groups fig 4d e ddit4 played a role in the differentiation and migration of cerebral cortex neurons malagelada et al 2011 while hmga2 is abundantly expressed during embryonic development cleynen and van de ven 2008 and its overexpression contributes to proliferative haematopoiesis ikeda et al 2012 two genes involved in cholesterol synthesis pathway namely hmgcra encoding for 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa reductase and cyp51 encoding for lanosterol 14α demethylase were up regulated in both concentration groups fig 4f g two genes involved in gr signaling namely fk506 binding protein 5 fkbp5 and phosphoinositide 3 kinase regulatory subunit 3a pik3r3a were also robustly up regulated at both concentrations fig 4h i nadph dependent retinal reductase rdh12 associated with rar activation pathway was up regulated significantly only in 1 group fig 4j a marker gene of ahr signaling cyp1a cytochrome p450 family 1 subfamily a was induced only in the 1 group fig 4k while a transcription factor fos in the same pathway was up regulated only in the 0 5 group fig 4l in summary nine out of the twelve genes fig 4a i were up regulated robustly after exposure to 0 5 and 1 effluent from wwtp1 while three other genes fig 4j l showed consistent trend of change with the microarray data at both concentrations the real time qpcr data demonstrated the reproducibility of transcriptional changes and among the twelve genes cyp51 and cyp2x12 had the largest fc in both groups 3 5 targeted gene expression of zebrafish larvae exposed to reconstituted extracts of water sampled from santa cruz river sites s1 s5 the expression of the twelve genes selected from this study and three gc responsive genes in zebrafish larvae chen et al 2016 were examined in the multi site study fig 5 the expression of aqp10a was increased by samples from s1 and s2 consist of wwtp1 effluent but not s3 to s5 fig 5a slc25a25 was up regulated by the discharged effluents of both wwtps s1 and s3 but not surface water of the downstream sites fig 5b which suggests rapid inactivation degradation or dilution of the active compounds that were responsible for induction of slc25a25 interestingly cyp2x12 was increased by about 32 folds in all sites fig 5c suggesting presence of certain persistent and potent bioactive compounds in the effluent of both wwtps ddit4 was also deregulated in all groups although the trend was increase for s1 4 but decrease for s5 fig 5d despite a trend of increase by s1 expression of hmga2 was not significantly changed in any group fig 5e the expression of hmgcra cyp51 and rdh1 was increased in the s1 group but decreased downstream suggesting impact of the wwtp1 effluent on cholesterol synthesis pathway and rar pathway fig 5f h in human hmgcr is the rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis and a target for statins a class of cholesterol lowering drugs sharpe and brown 2013 statins are steric inhibitors of hmgcr enzymes but its inhibition leads to an up regulation of the mrna expression of the hmgcr gene clendening et al 2010 maciejak et al 2013 stormo et al 2012 statins were not targeted in the previous chemical analyses of wwtp1 effluent supplementary table s5 however the increasing concern of statins as emerging aquatic contaminants santos et al 2016 should warrant statins or other cholesterol lowering drugs into the list of targeted chemicals for future targeted analysis additionally non targeted chemical analysis could potentially identify additional bioactive compound s especially if combined with iterative fractionation and bioassay analyses snyder 2014 a trend of increase was observed for cyp1a and fos in all sites fig 5i j although the up regulation of cyp1a was significant only in s1 and marginally significant in s5 while the up regulation of fos was significant from s1 to s3 both cyp1a and fos can be up regulated by ahr agonists while fos expression can also be up regulated by transcription factors such as estrogen receptor duan et al 1999 and psychoactive drugs singewald et al 2003 therefore the up regulation of fos but not cyp1a by s3 sample wwtp2 effluent may be attributed to compounds other than ahr agonists the gr related genes tested were deregulated in different directions where fkbp5 and pdk2 were down regulated by s1 sample fig 5k and o but baiap2 and pxr were up regulated fig 5m n pik3r3a showed a similar trend to baiap2 but it was not significant in all sites fig 5i the divergent responses of gc pathway genes could be concurrent deregulation on fkbp5 and pdk2 but not baiap2 by other compounds for example expression of pdk2 is also affected by the level of glucose and fatty acid xu et al 2006 while fkbp5 transcription can also be affected by ar activation zannas et al 2016 or exposure to bisphenol a kitraki et al 2015 overall 11 of the 15 selected genes were significantly deregulated by wwtp1 effluent at s1 among which slc25a2 and fos were also up regulated by wwtp2 but not downstream samples it is of concern that expression of ddit4 and cyp2x12 was increased by water from all santa cruz river sites suggesting the presence of very persistent bioactive compounds 3 6 morphological analysis of transgenic zebrafish larvae exposed to reconstituted extracts of water sampled from santa cruz river sites s1 to s5 based on results from the toxicity study and transcriptomic analysis four transgenic lines were used to facilitate in vivo examination of subtle changes in the nervous system tg nkx2 2a megfp hepatic system lipan zhang et al 2014 endothelial vascular system tg fli1 egfp lawson and weinstein 2002 and myeloid system tg lyz dsred2 hall et al 2007 fig 6 despite normal gross appearance tg nkx2 2a megfp larvae exposed to all samples had shorter axon length 10 25 reduction when compared to the control group fig 6a b and supplementary fig s4a suggesting the presence of persistent neurotoxic compounds in all sites average liver rfp intensity increased p 05 by 4 8 in lipan larvae exposed to s1 to s4 suggesting the presence of compounds that may have effects on the liver but they were eventually degraded diluted downstream the gfp intensity of the posterior region the anus to tail region of tg fli1 egfp larvae exposed to s1 and s2 samples increased p 05 by 60 80 fig 5a and d but it remained unchanged in other exposure groups similarly neutrophil counts in the posterior part of tg lyz dsred2 larvae exposed to s1 and s2 samples increased by more than 20 but remained unchanged in other sites fig 5a and e changes in these two lines suggested that the endothelial vascular system and the myeloid system might have been perturbed by wwtp1 effluent but not wwtp2 or downstream sites taken together effluent from both wwtps may induce neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity while effluent from wwtp1 but not wwtp2 might affect the vascular and myeloid systems function and or development these subtle morphological changes supported the findings from the transcriptomic analysis and are consistent with the classes of compounds that have been detected in wwtp1 effluent supplementary table s2 for example perfluorohexanoic acid shown to be hepatotoxic and neurotoxic has been detected consistently 6 6 in wwtp1 effluent and it is extremely persistent steenland et al 2010 johansson et al 2009 similarly triclocarban and triclosan the persistent predioxins known to be hepatotoxic and neurotoxic halden 2014 ruszkiewicz et al 2017 have been detected repeatedly 5 6 in wwtp1 effluent triclosan induces pro inflammatory response and has been shown to induce cytokines that promote tumor angiogenesis and increased inflammatory leukocytes in mouse liver yueh et al 2014 prednisone another gc repeatedly detected 3 3 in wwtp1 could increase neutrophil count in human fleishaker et al 2016 which may affect the endothelial vascular and myeloid systems although it is not possible to attribute the morphological perturbations to specific compounds their probable presence indicate the toxic potency of the effluent 4 conclusion the present study demonstrates how molecular initiating events cellular and organ level key events within aop framework can be obtained or inferred using the zebrafish embryo exposed to an effluent and further applied for monitoring of the receiving waters although no adverse outcome was detected using a short term toxicity test in this study similar approaches would have been employed to obtain relevant and practical information if a more toxic effluent that causes malformation of embryos were to be used the present study therefore raises an important point regarding the need for longer term embryo to adult fish toxicity test if adverse outcomes were to be determined unless the effluent tested was highly toxic a longer exposure time would be required to develop adverse outcome but longer term exposure test requires strong justification due to the substantial increase in cost and research ethics involving animals most effluents having being treated prior to discharge are likely less toxic although they could still pose risks to the environment we propose that if a key event is detected at the organ level in a short term test and chemical analysis reveals compound s that could trigger the key event and adverse outcome at the organism level can be inferred as presented in this study then a longer term exposure test is justified where the inferred adverse outcome can be monitored over time this study has integrated toxicogenomics targeted gene expression and morphological analyses for biomonitoring of secondary effluent and its receiving river water that can be incorporated into regulatory monitoring this approach provides a tractable system to derive effect based monitoring tool with toxicity information from the molecular to the organismal level within a single species the deregulated genes and their biological associations can provide insights on possible categories of compounds that may be present but not targeted in the chemical analysis this

19770,comprehensive monitoring of water pollution is challenging with the increasing amount and types of anthropogenic compounds being released into water there are rising concerns of undetected toxicity this is especially true for municipal wastewater effluents that are discharged to surface waters this study was designed to integrate zebrafish toxicogenomics targeted gene expression and morphological analyses for toxicity evaluation of effluent discharged from two previously characterized wastewater treatment plants wwtps in pima county arizona and their receiving surface water zebrafish embryos were exposed to organic extracts from the wwtp1 effluent that were reconstituted to represent 1 and 0 5 of the original concentration microarray analyses identified deregulated gene probes that mapped to 1666 779 and 631 unique human homologs in the 1 0 5 and the intersection of both groups respectively these were associated with 18 cellular and molecular functions ranging from cell cycle to metabolism and are involved in the development and function of 10 organ systems including nervous cardiovascular haematological reproductive and hepatic systems superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis retinoic acid receptor activation glucocorticoid receptor and prolactin signaling were among the top 11 perturbed canonical pathways real time quantitative pcr validated the expression changes of 12 selected genes these genes were then tested on zebrafish embryos exposed to the reconstituted extract of water sampled downstream of wwtp1 and another nearby wwtp2 the expression of several targeted genes were significantly affected by the wwtp effluents and some of the downstream receiving waters morphological analyses using four transgenic zebrafish lines revealed potential toxicity associated with nervous hepatic endothelial vascular and myeloid systems this study demonstrated how information can be obtained using adverse outcome pathway framework to derive biological effect based monitoring tools this integrated approach using zebrafish can supplement analytical chemistry to provide more comprehensive monitoring of discharged effluents and their receiving waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords zebrafish toxicogenomics secondary effluent biomonitoring bioassay water reuse 1 introduction the monitoring of water quality is challenging due to the numerous natural and anthropogenic chemicals found in the water bodies with the increasing amount and types of anthropogenic compounds being introduced into water in addition to transformation products formed during water treatment it is not feasible to analytically detect and quantify every chemical contaminant in water merel et al 2015 moreover even if individual chemicals are detectable multiple chemicals may interact to induce toxicity in aquatic organisms via mechanisms such antagonism additivity or synergism adebambo et al 2015 carvalho et al 2014 therefore biomonitoring is recommended as a complementary approach to assess the potential toxicity of water altenburger et al 2015 gerbersdorf et al 2015 escher et al 2014 leusch and snyder 2015 fish are the most commonly used vertebrates for biomonitoring of water quality acute tests in adult fish oecd 1992 and fish embryo tests oecd 2013 based on mortality rate and gross morphological changes have been used to assess toxicity of aquatic contaminants in the laboratory and field however gross morphological changes can be difficult to quantify or lack adequate sensitivity transgenic fish with fluorescent proteins expressed in specific tissues can facilitate the visualization kim et al 2013 and enable the quantitative measurement of changes in these tissues even when no gross morphological changes can be observed in wild type fish chen et al 2010 fetter et al 2014 kim et al 2013 ng and gong 2013 yet current application of transgenic fish in biomonitoring is still limited especially transgenic fish with specific compound inducible reporter gene partly because they lack sensitivity to detect the specific compounds at environmentally relevant concentrations lee et al 2015b expression analysis of targeted genes that are known to be impacted by specific compounds is also used for example biomarker genes for oxidative stress estrogenic and androgenic compounds were used to evaluate whether water downstream from a wwtp discharge could change the expression of these genes in fish jasinska et al 2015 toxicogenomic approaches that capture genome wide expression changes induced by contaminants can provide insight on 1 the molecular mechanism of toxicity 2 candidate biomarkers for exposure to toxicants and 3 inference of the potential effects that have not yet reflected as morphological changes chen et al 2012 naciff and daston 2004 for instance certain transcriptome profiles were identifiable in rats hamadeh et al 2002 in zebrafish embryos yang et al 2007 and in whole adult zebrafish lam et al 2008 exposed to certain compounds moreover transcriptomic profiling of fish such as largescale suckers christiansen et al 2014 fathead minnows sellin jeffries et al 2012 and zebrafish bluhm et al 2014 kosmehl et al 2012 exposed to environmental samples with unknown chemical composition can reveal affected biology and provide information on the exposure conditions or presence of potential classes of contaminants however challenges still remain in distinguishing between responses induced by specific classes of contaminants and the more universal detoxification mechanisms bluhm et al 2014 moreover molecular changes are influenced more by the bioavailability of the compounds in sample mixture which is determined by sample processing and exposure methods than the original composition of the mixture kosmehl et al 2012 therefore the transcriptomic changes detected are only molecular changes that may or may not be directly driven by the compound s being studied nevertheless candidate biomarkers identified from toxicogenomic studies can be used as effect based monitoring tools in future studies or facilitate the development of environmental risk assessment that is based on the adverse outcome pathway aop framework by providing evidence for molecular initiating events or cellular key events in the toxicity pathways that lead to organ key events and adverse outcome at the organism and population levels ankley et al 2010 lee et al 2015a the santa cruz river in pima county arizona usa is an effluent dependent stream receiving effluent from two wwtps previous studies have been performed using chemical analyses in vitro bioassays and expression analysis of target genes for glucocorticoid results of which have raised concern on the potential toxicity of the effluent especially the glucocorticoid activity and estrogenic activity chen et al 2016 dong et al 2015 jia et al 2015 yet it is not known whether other pathways or expression of other genes can also be affected in vivo by this effluent dependent stream given the availability of transgenic lines genomic platforms and the advantages of zebrafish as a model scholz et al 2008 the current study aimed to integrate zebrafish approaches involving microarray based toxicogenomics targeted gene expression and transgenic embryos to assess the potential toxicity of the effluent from the two wwtps and the receiving effluent dependent segment of the santa cruz river 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and extraction effluent samples were collected from two wwtps located in pima county arizona usa which receive predominantly municipal sewage from over half a million domestic residents at the time of sample collection wwtp1 used a trickling filter treatment system with a capacity of 1 80 m3 s wwtp2 is located approximately 6 km downstream to wwtp1 along the santa cruz river which uses an activated sludge treatment system and has a treatment capacity of 1 64 m3 s both facilities include disinfection in the treatment process using chlorine or chloramine which is subsequently de chlorinated following regulatory disinfection requirements effluents of both wwtps are directly discharged into the santa cruz river a toxicity study and a transcriptomic analysis were performed using effluent of wwtp1 with 0 05 dmso as the control in the multi site study water samples were collected at five santa cruz river sites assigned as s1 to s5 together with a field blank supplementary figs s1 and s2 s1 and s3 were the points of discharge for wwtp1 and wwtp2 respectively s2 was immediately upstream of wwtp2 and is surface water consisting of only wwtp1 effluent s4 and s5 were downstream of wwtp2 and approximately 10 km and 12 km away from wwtp1 respectively the field blank was the control it consisted of ultra pure water and it went through identical procedures as the other samples from collection through sample preparation all sampling equipment was triple rinsed with the sample water at each site before sample collection for each sample 10 l was collected in a polypropylene bucket then poured into amber glass bottles ten extractions of one liter aliquots of water were conducted using a solid phase extraction technique described previously anumol et al 2013 with the resulting extracts combined and concentrated into 1 ml of dmso briefly samples were filtered through a 0 7 μm filter and then solid phase extracted spe using 200 mg hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb cartridges waters corporation millford ma samples were eluted with 5 ml of a 10 90 v v methanol mtbe solution the 10 resulting extracts were combined evaporated to near dryness and re solvated in 1 ml of dmso the concentration factor from the original water sample to the final dmso extract was 10 000 fold 2 2 wild type and transgenic zebrafish husbandry all experiments using zebrafish were conducted following the protocol approved by the

randomly placed into 6 well plates containing 4 ml well of exposure media control medium for wwtp1 effluent was e3 medium with 0 05 v v dmso while control medium for santa cruz river samples was 1 reconstitution of the field blank duration of all exposure was five days and all media were renewed every 24 h in the toxicity study all five concentrations of wwtp1 effluent were tested selected morphological end points were recorded for wild type fish and tg nkx2 2a megfp were used for image analysis n 10 for microarray study only wild type was used and they were exposed to 0 5 and 1 wwtp1

based data mining for the microarray experiment only wild type embryos to 1 and 0 5 reconstituted wwtp1 effluent were compared to the dmso control group a total of 14 hybridizations four control replicates and five replicates for 1 and 0 5 groups were performed using agilent zebrafish whole genome oligo microarray ver3 0 4 44k agilent ca usa as previously described chen et al 2017 the raw data have been deposited in the ncbi geo database gse93532 batch normalized signal intensity were statistically analysed the gene probes with adjusted p value 05 in one way anova and fold change fc 1 3 were evaluated at different tukey p values threshold after which those with tukey p value 01 were considered deregulated genes the deregulated gene lists were denoted as 1 and 0 5 for the respective treatment groups and 1 0 5 for their intersection which were then used for knowledge based functional analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis ipa ingenuity ca usa in the following categories

institute of health usa software was used to quantify the length of axons for tg nkx2 2 megfp and the rfp intensity in the liver for lipan imaris 8 bitplane switzerland software was used to quantify the number of neutrophils rfp spots in tg lyz dsred2 and the gfp intensity of tg fli1 egfp in the posterior region from the anus to the caudal fin tip while the anterior trunk and the head region are

shapiro wilk and levene s tests respectively for data that assumed normality one way anova was performed and those with p value 05 were subjected to tukey for homogeneous variances or dunnett t3 post hoc test for heterogeneous variances for data that did not assume normality kruskal wallis test was performed and those with p value 05 were subjected to mann whitney u test in post hoc tests p value 05 was indicated as statistically significant while 0 05 p value 1 is marginally significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 embryo toxicity testing of effluent from wwtp1 a 5 day embryo toxicity test was performed using wwtp1 effluent extract that has been reconstituted to 0 2 to 5 of the original concentration before hatching no difference was observed in the number of embryos with coagulation 2 embryos of all groups showed normal tail detachment somite development eye development blood circulation and spontaneous movement at 24 hpf and 48 hpf heartbeat rate was counted at 48 hpf and there was a notable reduction of 5 13 in 0 5 and higher concentration groups fig 1 a and supplementary fig s3a in addition about 25 embryos of the 5 group had developed edema at 48 hpf although embryos from other groups were normal hatching rate at 3 dpf was 100 in all groups pigmentation development and touch response of all larvae were normal survival rate during the 5 day exposure was not affected by 2 5 or lower concentrations of the reconstituted effluent extract however all larvae in the 5 group died by 4 dpf fig 1b tg nkx2 2a egfp larvae in all treatment groups had shorter motor axon along the spinal cord despite normal touch response fig 1c d and supplementary fig s2b taken together the 5 concentration of the original effluent was acutely lethal to embryos while the 1 and 0 5 concentrations of the effluent could affect the cardiovascular and nervous system despite normal gross appearance the reduced heartbeat rate can be regarded as altered tissue function and the reduced axon length represents altered tissue development which are key events occurring at the organ level that could lead to adverse outcomes at the organism and population levels as inferred from the aop framework ankley et al 2010 browne et al 2017 zebrafish that have been genetically manipulated to model cardiovascular conditions with reduced heartbeat rate or bradycardia experienced earlier premature death huttner et al 2013 or lower viability although they may not display any obvious ill effects warren et al 2001 suggesting a lower general fitness impaired axonal outgrowth and reduced axonal length in zebrafish can be genetically and chemically modulated to model a group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as hereditary spastic paraplegias where morphant zebrafish displayed a range of phenotype from normal to impaired swimming behaviour to immotile wood et al 2006 butler et al 2010 previously we have tested the tg nkx2 2a egfp larvae which demonstrated dose dependent axon length reduction in larvae exposed to neurotoxic compounds but no significant reduction of axon length for non neurotoxic compounds zhang and gong 2013 therefore the reduced heart rate and axon length are altered tissue development function representing key events at the organ level that could lead to adverse outcome such as lower fitness lesser motility or impaired locomotion at the organism level which in turn could cause individuals to be more vulnerable to predation reduced survival chance and less successful in finding food reduced growth or mate reduced reproductive chance hence resulting in the decrease of population size in the wild however whether these key events of reduce heartbeat rate and axon length reduction detected in the present fish embryo toxicity test would lead to adverse outcome of lower fitness and motility defects can only be determined with a longer term exposure test 3 2 microarray based toxicogenomics revealed transcriptomic changes induced by effluent of wwtp1 to capture the transcriptomic changes 14 microarray experiments were performed using total rna from wild type larvae exposed to 1 and 0 5 wwtp1 effluent which are the two lowest concentrations that induced adverse effects in the toxicity study with the criterion of corrected p value 05 in one way anova 4915 gene probes were selected for tukey post hoc test and fc selection threshold of 1 3 the resulting number of significant gene probes was evaluated using tukey p value 001 0 005 0 01 and 0 05 fig 2 a the proportion of significant gene probes intersecting between the 1 and 0 5 groups was greater than 70 in all cases such a high overlap of deregulated genes suggests the effluent had induced robust transcriptomic changes to balance between statistical confidence and type 2 error tukey p value 01 was selected as the cut off which resulted in 3579 1732 and 1381 significant probes in the 1 0 5 and the intersection 1 0 5 group respectively fig 2b 3 3 knowledge based functional analysis of the deregulated genes revealed molecular effects induced by the effluent the deregulated probes for the three groups i e 1 0 5 and 1 0 5 were mapped respectively to 1666 779 and 631 unique human homologs in ipa supplementary tables s2 4 and analysed the distribution of the functional types and the cellular locations of the proteins encoded by these genes are presented in supplementary fig s3 enriched functional categories with fisher s exact p value 005 in all three groups were highlighted in fig 3 the top enriched categories under molecular and cellular functions fig 3a were cellular growth and proliferation cell morphology cell death and survival gene expression and cellular development p value 7 68e 20 to 3 03e 08 under physiological system development and function fig 3b the top enriched categories were organismal survival development and embryonic development p value 3 44e 23 to 3 05e 07 followed by organ tissue morphology and development as well as nervous digestive cardiovascular haematological reproductive and hepatic systems p value 5 04e 25 to 5 24e 05 these gene expression changes provided gene activation and altered signaling information at the cellular level as part of the toxicity pathway associated with key events as outlined within aop framework ankley et al 2010 browne et al 2017 these altered gene expression associated with cardiovascular or nervous systems could indicate cellular key events that could be associated respectively to reduced heartbeat rate and axon length detected at the organ level by the embryo toxicity tests for example when the detailed functional annotations associated with nervous system category were examined it was found that growth of neurites p value 6 74e 04 was predicted to be decreased activation z score 2 computed by the ipa algorithm indicated significant down regulation of neurite growth which could represent cellular key events for the reduced axon length observed at the organ level deregulated canonical pathways were examined fig 3d the top two pathways were glucocorticoid receptor gr signaling and retinoic acid receptor rar activation p value 5 37e 06 to 1 20e 04 which are both nuclear receptor and transcriptional factor signaling pathways two cancer related pathways small cell lung cancer signaling and hereditary breast cancer signaling two pathways related to b cell activation of the immune system april mediated signaling and b cell activating factor signaling and two phosphoinositides related pathways for the metabolism of intracellular signal transduction molecules d myo inositol 5 phosphate metabolism and 3 phosphoinositide biosynthesis were also enriched p value 3 89e 05 to 4 47e 03 the superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis was the top enriched pathway in 1 group p value 3 89e 05 a hormonal related pathway prolactin signaling and xenobiotic metabolism pathway aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr signaling were also enriched p value 3 89e 05 to 4 47e 03 results from ipa revealed potential cellular and physiological changes that were consistent with previous studies of the wwtp1 effluent as well as changes that were not reported before the effluent of wwtp1 has been shown to induce gc transcriptional activities in in vitro gr bioassay and in vivo in zebrafish larvae chen et al 2016 the current analysis provided strong evidence on the deregulation of gc target genes crosstalk between gr signaling and rar signaling has been previously described where a heterodimer of rar alpha and retinoid x receptor rxr was shown to enhance the transcriptional activity of gr toth et al 2011 crosstalk between gr and ahr has also been documented in vitro including enhanced gr activity but suppression of ahr mediated expressions wang et al 2009 however it is not clear if these signaling pathways were all directly perturbed by the effluent or indirectly as a result of crosstalk findings from this transcriptomic analysis could also be partly explained by the compounds that have been repeatedly detected in the wwtp1 effluent supplementary table s5 representative gcs such as prednisone and hydrocortisone have been repeatedly detected at low ng l concentrations yet the total gc concentration as reflected by in vitro gc activity can be much higher chen et al 2016 highlighting the importance of using bioassays to complement chemical analysis synthetic gcs could affect gr signaling as well as haematological and lymphoid systems of fish ribas et al 2016 which was consistent with our transcriptomic analysis fig 3b and this may increase susceptibility to infection and affect health of the organism another hormone detected at low ng l was progesterone which is a risk factor for breast cancer obr and edwards 2012 and is known to augment prolactin synthesis freeman et al 2000 both breast cancer and prolactin signaling pathways have been significantly associated with the deregulated genes in all three groups fig 3c hence suggesting potential endocrine disruption and effects on reproductive fitness two antibacterial agents triclosan and triclocarban are known endocrine disruptors that exert developmental reproductive toxicity halden 2014 and known to activate ahr responsive genes in vitro ahn et al 2008 hence possibly affecting endocrine and reproductive system fig 3b as well as deregulating ahr signaling fig 3c triclosan has been shown to cause subtle cardiac toxicity in developing zebrafish saley et al 2016 and cardiotoxicity was inferred fig 3b and detected fig 1a in our analyses triclosan has also been shown to delay development of secondary motor neurons muth köhne et al 2012 a possible contributor to inferred affects to nervous system fig 3b and the shortened axons fig 1c d taken together the biological inference was consistent with the known biological effects of the compounds that have been repeatedly detected from the aop framework some of these compounds would have operated through ligand receptor interaction as molecular initiating events that altered signaling pathways and gene expression at the cellular level and subsequently affected tissue development and function at the organ system level which are key events that can potentially lead to adverse outcomes at the organism and population levels however given that complex mixture of compounds were used in this study there will be multiple initiating events and the present experimental design will not be able to decipher the relationships between cellular key events that affected organ key events nevertheless based on the organ key events we could infer adverse outcomes which could only be verified through a longer term embryo to adult exposure test 3 4 real time qpcr validation of selected genes for exposure to wwtp1 effluent expression of the twelve genes selected from the transcriptome analysis was validated using real time qpcr three genes that ranked among the top in the deregulated gene list of 1 0 5 group aquaporin 10a aqp10a mitochondrial solute carrier slc25a25 and an uncharacterized cytochrome p450 family gene cyp2x12 were significantly upregulated by both 1 and 0 5 effluent as in the microarray data fig 4 a c functions of these three genes have not been well studied the expression of aqp10a in medaka has been shown to decrease when the fish was exposure to sea water suggesting its role in osmoregulation madsen et al 2014 the function of slc25a25 in fish is unknown but its human homolog encodes for a mitochondrial protein involved in the regulation of hepatocyte functions mashima et al 2003 nine genes involved in four selected functional categories were also validated these included two genes involved in cellular growth and proliferation dna damage inducible transcript 4 ddit4 and high mobility group at hook 2 hmga2 which increased moderately in both groups fig 4d e ddit4 played a role in the differentiation and migration of cerebral cortex neurons malagelada et al 2011 while hmga2 is abundantly expressed during embryonic development cleynen and van de ven 2008 and its overexpression contributes to proliferative haematopoiesis ikeda et al 2012 two genes involved in cholesterol synthesis pathway namely hmgcra encoding for 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa reductase and cyp51 encoding for lanosterol 14α demethylase were up regulated in both concentration groups fig 4f g two genes involved in gr signaling namely fk506 binding protein 5 fkbp5 and phosphoinositide 3 kinase regulatory subunit 3a pik3r3a were also robustly up regulated at both concentrations fig 4h i nadph dependent retinal reductase rdh12 associated with rar activation pathway was up regulated significantly only in 1 group fig 4j a marker gene of ahr signaling cyp1a cytochrome p450 family 1 subfamily a was induced only in the 1 group fig 4k while a transcription factor fos in the same pathway was up regulated only in the 0 5 group fig 4l in summary nine out of the twelve genes fig 4a i were up regulated robustly after exposure to 0 5 and 1 effluent from wwtp1 while three other genes fig 4j l showed consistent trend of change with the microarray data at both concentrations the real time qpcr data demonstrated the reproducibility of transcriptional changes and among the twelve genes cyp51 and cyp2x12 had the largest fc in both groups 3 5 targeted gene expression of zebrafish larvae exposed to reconstituted extracts of water sampled from santa cruz river sites s1 s5 the expression of the twelve genes selected from this study and three gc responsive genes in zebrafish larvae chen et al 2016 were examined in the multi site study fig 5 the expression of aqp10a was increased by samples from s1 and s2 consist of wwtp1 effluent but not s3 to s5 fig 5a slc25a25 was up regulated by the discharged effluents of both wwtps s1 and s3 but not surface water of the downstream sites fig 5b which suggests rapid inactivation degradation or dilution of the active compounds that were responsible for induction of slc25a25 interestingly cyp2x12 was increased by about 32 folds in all sites fig 5c suggesting presence of certain persistent and potent bioactive compounds in the effluent of both wwtps ddit4 was also deregulated in all groups although the trend was increase for s1 4 but decrease for s5 fig 5d despite a trend of increase by s1 expression of hmga2 was not significantly changed in any group fig 5e the expression of hmgcra cyp51 and rdh1 was increased in the s1 group but decreased downstream suggesting impact of the wwtp1 effluent on cholesterol synthesis pathway and rar pathway fig 5f h in human hmgcr is the rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis and a target for statins a class of cholesterol lowering drugs sharpe and brown 2013 statins are steric inhibitors of hmgcr enzymes but its inhibition leads to an up regulation of the mrna expression of the hmgcr gene clendening et al 2010 maciejak et al 2013 stormo et al 2012 statins were not targeted in the previous chemical analyses of wwtp1 effluent supplementary table s5 however the increasing concern of statins as emerging aquatic contaminants santos et al 2016 should warrant statins or other cholesterol lowering drugs into the list of targeted chemicals for future targeted analysis additionally non targeted chemical analysis could potentially identify additional bioactive compound s especially if combined with iterative fractionation and bioassay analyses snyder 2014 a trend of increase was observed for cyp1a and fos in all sites fig 5i j although the up regulation of cyp1a was significant only in s1 and marginally significant in s5 while the up regulation of fos was significant from s1 to s3 both cyp1a and fos can be up regulated by ahr agonists while fos expression can also be up regulated by transcription factors such as estrogen receptor duan et al 1999 and psychoactive drugs singewald et al 2003 therefore the up regulation of fos but not cyp1a by s3 sample wwtp2 effluent may be attributed to compounds other than ahr agonists the gr related genes tested were deregulated in different directions where fkbp5 and pdk2 were down regulated by s1 sample fig 5k and o but baiap2 and pxr were up regulated fig 5m n pik3r3a showed a similar trend to baiap2 but it was not significant in all sites fig 5i the divergent responses of gc pathway genes could be concurrent deregulation on fkbp5 and pdk2 but not baiap2 by other compounds for example expression of pdk2 is also affected by the level of glucose and fatty acid xu et al 2006 while fkbp5 transcription can also be affected by ar activation zannas et al 2016 or exposure to bisphenol a kitraki et al 2015 overall 11 of the 15 selected genes were significantly deregulated by wwtp1 effluent at s1 among which slc25a2 and fos were also up regulated by wwtp2 but not downstream samples it is of concern that expression of ddit4 and cyp2x12 was increased by water from all santa cruz river sites suggesting the presence of very persistent bioactive compounds 3 6 morphological analysis of transgenic zebrafish larvae exposed to reconstituted extracts of water sampled from santa cruz river sites s1 to s5 based on results from the toxicity study and transcriptomic analysis four transgenic lines were used to facilitate in vivo examination of subtle changes in the nervous system tg nkx2 2a megfp hepatic system lipan zhang et al 2014 endothelial vascular system tg fli1 egfp lawson and weinstein 2002 and myeloid system tg lyz dsred2 hall et al 2007 fig 6 despite normal gross appearance tg nkx2 2a megfp larvae exposed to all samples had shorter axon length 10 25 reduction when compared to the control group fig 6a b and supplementary fig s4a suggesting the presence of persistent neurotoxic compounds in all sites average liver rfp intensity increased p 05 by 4 8 in lipan larvae exposed to s1 to s4 suggesting the presence of compounds that may have effects on the liver but they were eventually degraded diluted downstream the gfp intensity of the posterior region the anus to tail region of tg fli1 egfp larvae exposed to s1 and s2 samples increased p 05 by 60 80 fig 5a and d but it remained unchanged in other exposure groups similarly neutrophil counts in the posterior part of tg lyz dsred2 larvae exposed to s1 and s2 samples increased by more than 20 but remained unchanged in other sites fig 5a and e changes in these two lines suggested that the endothelial vascular system and the myeloid system might have been perturbed by wwtp1 effluent but not wwtp2 or downstream sites taken together effluent from both wwtps may induce neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity while effluent from wwtp1 but not wwtp2 might affect the vascular and myeloid systems function and or development these subtle morphological changes supported the findings from the transcriptomic analysis and are consistent with the classes of compounds that have been detected in wwtp1 effluent supplementary table s2 for example perfluorohexanoic acid shown to be hepatotoxic and neurotoxic has been detected consistently 6 6 in wwtp1 effluent and it is extremely persistent steenland et al 2010 johansson et al 2009 similarly triclocarban and triclosan the persistent predioxins known to be hepatotoxic and neurotoxic halden 2014 ruszkiewicz et al 2017 have been detected repeatedly 5 6 in wwtp1 effluent triclosan induces pro inflammatory response and has been shown to induce cytokines that promote tumor angiogenesis and increased inflammatory leukocytes in mouse liver yueh et al 2014 prednisone another gc repeatedly detected 3 3 in wwtp1 could increase neutrophil count in human fleishaker et al 2016 which may affect the endothelial vascular and myeloid systems although it is not possible to attribute the morphological perturbations to specific compounds their probable presence indicate the toxic potency of the effluent 4 conclusion the present study demonstrates how molecular initiating events cellular and organ level key events within aop framework can be obtained or inferred using the zebrafish embryo exposed to an effluent and further applied for monitoring of the receiving waters although no adverse outcome was detected using a short term toxicity test in this study similar approaches would have been employed to obtain relevant and practical information if a more toxic effluent that causes malformation of embryos were to be used the present study therefore raises an important point regarding the need for longer term embryo to adult fish toxicity test if adverse outcomes were to be determined unless the effluent tested was highly toxic a longer exposure time would be required to develop adverse outcome but longer term exposure test requires strong justification due to the substantial increase in cost and research ethics involving animals most effluents having being treated prior to discharge are likely less toxic although they could still pose risks to the environment we propose that if a key event is detected at the organ level in a short term test and chemical analysis reveals compound s that could trigger the key event and adverse outcome at the organism level can be inferred as presented in this study then a longer term exposure test is justified where the inferred adverse outcome can be monitored over time this study has integrated toxicogenomics targeted gene expression and morphological analyses for biomonitoring of secondary effluent and its receiving river water that can be incorporated into regulatory monitoring this approach provides a tractable system to derive effect based monitoring tool with toxicity information from the molecular to the organismal level within a single species the deregulated genes and their biological associations can provide insights on possible categories of compounds that may be present but not targeted in the chemical analysis this

19771,understanding the mechanisms of nitrogen n retention and loss from fertilized urban turfgrass is critical to develop practices that mitigate n transport and protect water quality in urban ecosystems we investigated the fate of n in lysimeters sodded with st augustine turfgrass and amended with labeled 15n from either ammonium sulfate or urea fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy fticr ms was employed to identify various biomolecular classes in the leached dissolved organic n don from one lysimeter for each treatment and the control mean don concentrations over 92 days were 88 94 and 94 of total n in the leachate from the control urea and ammonium sulfate treatments respectively isotopic analysis showed that 3 of n in the leachate originated from newly applied n fertilizer suggesting that the remainder of the n in the leachate was derived from the lysimeter soil or sod biomass pools the 15n fertilizer recovery was greatest in soil 44 48 followed by sod thatch 18 33 grass clippings 10 13 and leachate 3 despite isotopic evidence of little contribution of n from fertilizers in the leachate a fraction of ammonium sulfate fertilizer was recovered as don in the leachate likely after uptake and conversion of inorganic fertilizer to organic plant exudates and or microbial byproducts fticr ms identified n bearing organic molecular formulas in the leachate from urea and ammonium sulfate treatments providing evidence of n leaching from newly established turfgrass of don compounds in a range of biomolecular compositions such as lipid protein carbohydrate and lignin like molecules graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrogen dissolved organic nitrogen leaching turfgrass groundwater quality 1 introduction sources of anthropogenic nitrogen n pollution in watersheds are diverse but an increasing density of human populations due to urbanization is often one cause of elevated n in aquatic ecosystems fields 2004 lu et al 2015 nitrogen fertilizers used to maintain urban turfgrass are a major n input in urban landscapes and may be a source of n loss to water bodies since turfgrass is the dominant urban land cover covering 16 million ha or 35 of total urban land in the united states milesi et al 2005 therefore understanding of the mechanisms of n retention and loss from fertilized urban turfgrass is needed to develop practices that mitigate n transport and protect water quality in urban ecosystems a number of field scale studies using 15n labeled fertilizer to determine the fate of n added to turfgrass have shown that n loss via leaching from fertilized turf is minimal carey et al 2012 erickson et al 2001 however many studies have typically failed to account for and recover all the added 15n even after considering gaseous n loss via volatilization and denitrification engelsjord et al 2004 frank et al 2006 horgan et al 2002 none of these studies measured dissolved organic nitrogen don in leachate but instead analyzed only leached inorganic n since don is a major pathway of n loss from agricultural ecosystems van kessel et al 2009 willett et al 2004 and from natural grasslands dijkstra et al 2007 leimer et al 2016 we hypothesize that don also likely constitutes a significant n loss pathway from fertilized turfgrass there are scarce studies in the literature on don generation release and transport from fertilized urban turfgrass systems and those that have been done looked mostly at ecotypes of bluegrass a cool season turf barton et al 2009 lu et al 2015 pare et al 2008 in two of the studies quantifying don leaching from fertilized turf pare et al 2008 found that don was a significant portion of the total n leached from golf green bluegrass and barton et al 2009 observed that don constituted 43 53 of all n leached from kikuyu turfgrass pennisetum clandestinum hochst ex chiov a warm season grass during the first 12 months of growth pare et al 2008 applied 15n fertilizer as nh4 and no3 and found that the majority 75 of leached don was attributed to soil organic matter and the remainder 25 was from mineral fertilizer n that was taken up by plants and or microbes and released as don in substances such as plant root exudates or microbial metabolites the application of inorganic n fertilizer stimulate plant roots and soil microbes to produce n enriched organic products over relatively short time scales murphy et al 2000 at the field scale a number of researchers kalbitz et al 2000 magill et al 2000 have concluded that inorganic n fertilizer applied to landscapes is assimilated into vegetation and soil organic matter and is subsequently released as don thus suggesting that don is a significant form of n loss even when the n inputs are largely inorganic for example magill et al 2000 applied inorganic fertilizer n to plots in the harvard forest and observed increased don flux below the soil likewise kalbitz et al 2000 provided evidence that plant incorporation of inorganic fertilizer n was followed by increased release of don to groundwater pare et al 2008 found 15n don in turfgrass leachate within 14 days after application of labeled inorganic n fertilizer they attributed the short time period of transformation from inorganic n to non humified don in the form of fresh root exudates and microbial metabolites though they did not conduct further tests to confirm this suggestion from these handful of studies on the leaching losses of don from turfgrass it is clear that a failure to account for n export as don will underestimate the total n loss from turfgrass as well as the full extent of fertilizer n transport in urban watersheds since additions of anthropogenic fertilizers to turf systems may produce n enriched organic products such as microbial exudates kalbitz et al 2000 magill et al 2000 murphy et al 2000 it is also likely that urbanization and subsequent shifts to high input n fertilizer regimes may alter the biomolecular character of don leaching from these systems the use of fticr ms is a promising tool for identifying qualitative shifts in the don molecular character under different fertilizer regimes but we are not aware of any studies in the literature that have addressed this the main objective of this work was to quantify the leaching loss of don from fertilized st augustine stenotaphrum secundatum walter kuntze turfgrass a warm season grass that is the dominant urban land cover in florida erickson et al 2001 and for which we have no known reports in the literature on n loss via don leaching we asked the following research questions 1 how does the magnitude of don loss by leaching from fertilized st augustine compare to the leaching losses of inorganic n 2 what portion of applied fertilizer n is recovered as leachate don and 3 what biomolecular compound groups are present in the don fraction of the leachate the research reported here used soil lysimeters sodded with st augustine turfgrass and fertilized with a15n fertilizer label of either ammonium sulfate or urea fertilizer was added one month after the sod was planted therefore the results are for a young turfgrass system an important distinction since turfgrass systems typically lose more n as they age lu et al 2015 a novel component of this study is that we investigated don as well as inorganic n forms no3 and nh4 and characterized end of study don in leachate by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy fticr ms to provide molecular level characterization of leached don 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil lysimeter packing nine soil lysimeters were built by cutting 30 cm internal diameter polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe into 55 cm sections each pvc lysimeter total surface area 730 cm2 was packed with approximately 34 kg of soil taken from the a horizon 23 55 cm bulk density 1 52 mg m 3 of a seffner fine sand sandy siliceous hyperthermic aquic humic dystrudept this soil was collected in summer 2014 from the university of florida gulf coast research and education center in wimauma florida from a field that was taken out of citrus production in 2000 and had been since maintained as a mowed field soil was air dried and sieved through a standard no 10 2 mm sieve and analyzed for basic physical and chemical properties table 1 after packing the lysimeters with seffner fine sand soil from 23 to 55 cm depth approximately 17 kg of commercially fine sand from a lawn and garden store was packed from 6 to 23 cm depth bulk density 1 40 mg m 3 turfgrass st augustine was placed over the fine sand in each lysimeter 0 6 cm the bottom end cap of each lysimeter was filled with a mixture of 5 kg pea gravel and 3 kg coarse sand to promote free drainage a piece of cheesecloth was placed below the gravel sand layer to prevent any material sand loss from the lysimeters a hole was drilled at the bottom of each end cap and plastic tubing was attached to allow leachate collection leachate was directed via the tubing into dark glass bottles lysimeters were placed outside and subjected to natural rainfall and were manually irrigated with deionized water as necessary to maintain at least 2 54 cm 0 11 pore volume pv of water input per week per university of florida institute of food and agricultural sciences extension recommendations for irrigating st augustine turf in the region 2 2 turf establishment and treatments prior to the experiments lysimeters were equilibrated by applying approximately 1 pv 16 15 l of deionized water to remove entrapped air the pv was determined by calculating the product of soil porosity and volume of each layer sand and subsoil and then summing the two the lysimeters were then allowed to freely drain for 14 days before sodding after 28 days of sod establishment on 9 august 2014 three treatments with three replicates for each treatment were established ammonium sulfate as nh4 2so4 urea co nh4 2 and control no fertilizer the day of fertilization was designated as experiment day 1 fertilizer solutions were prepared in 2 l equivalent to 2 54 cm or 0 11 pv deionized water and applied over the top of each lysimeter treatments were made with 10 atom 15n as sigma aldrich product 348473 or 10 atom 15n urea sigma aldrich product 490970 treatments were applied to achieve 1 pound n per 1000 square feet of turfgrass equivalent to 49 kg ha which is the current recommended fertilizer application rate for lawns in central florida sartain 2000 this amount was equivalent to 355 mg of applied n per lysimeter based on the molar weights of 10 atom 15n as mw 132 34 g mol 1 or 10 atom 15n urea mw 60 25 g mol 1 after fertilizer application the experiment was conducted for 92 days from 9 august to 7 november 2014 2 3 leachate collection and analysis leachate was passed through anti microbial plastic tubing that drained from the bottom of each lysimeters into 4 l amber glass bottles that were housed in a cooler modified to allow insertion of the tubing leachate volume was measured after each rain or irrigation event and a 250 ml subsample was collected and stored at 4 c for analysis at the time of analysis all the samples from a given time interval were used to create flow weighted composites for that interval i e days 0 3 4 7 8 14 15 28 29 49 and 50 92 samples were analyzed for nox n nh3 n total n tn total dissolved n tdn and for 15n recovery in the dissolved inorganic n din nox n nh3 n and don pools for nh3 n and nox n analysis 0 45 μm filtered aliquots were analyzed using a discrete analyzer aq2 seal analytical inc mequon wi for tdn analysis a subsample of the filtered leachate was oxidized with the alkaline persulfate oxidation method described by hosomi and sudo 1986 and then analyzed for nox n with a discrete analyzer as above for tn analysis an aliquot of unfiltered sample was likewise oxidized and analyzed particulate organic n pon was calculated as the difference between tn and tdn and don was calculated as the difference between tdn and nox n nh3 n the persulfate oxidation method used for tdn and tn analysis involved preparation of a digestion reagent made by dissolving 20 g recrystallized k2so4 and 3 g naoh in 1 l of deionized water the samples were oxidized by adding digestion reagent to a sample 1 2 in a loosely capped screw cap glass culture tube and autoclaving at 110 c for 30 min determination of 15n recovery in the don pool in leachate required quantifying recovery in tdn pool and then subtracting the recovery in the din pool concentrations of nh3 n in the leachate were negligible and typically below the detection limit of 0 02 mg l therefore we only determined 15n recovery in no3 for the din pool in this way 15n don was calculated as 15n tdn 15n no3 n to quantify 15n tdn bulk filtered samples were first lyophilized to produce a powder that could produce the isotopic signatures of tdn the powder was transferred to a tin capsule for analysis of isotopic composition with a costech model 4010 elemental analyzer costech analytical industries valencia ca coupled to a finnigan mat deltaplusxl mass spectrometer continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry thermo finnigan san jose ca the next step was to determine the isotopic composition of the leachate no3 using the microbial denitrifier method sigman et al 2001 the recovery of labeled fertilizer was calculated for leachate n pools as follows 1 15 n r e c o v e r e d 100 x p c b f a b where p moles of n in the given leachate pool e g no3 don f moles of n in the fertilizer input c atom 15n in the given leachate pool a atom 15n in the fertilizer 10 b atom 15n in the control 2 4 molecular characterization of leachate at the conclusion of the experiment day 92 a flow weighted composite sample of leachate from each treatment and control was used to provide insights on the molecular character of don in leachate we accomplished this through fticr ms at the national high magnetic field laboratory in tallahassee florida methods used for this analysis were from lusk and toor 2016b and briefly involved concentrating 75 ml of 0 45 μm filtered leachate that had been acidified to approximately ph 2 0 with hydrochloric acid hcl through solid phase extraction spe with 1 g 6 ml varian bond elut ppl spe cartridges samples obtained through spe were analyzed by fticr ms via positive mode atmospheric pressure photoionization appi with toluene as the dopant on a modified thermo fisher appi source thermo fisher corp san jose ca we used appi because it has been shown to generate more n bearing molecules than electrospray ionization and can ionize both polar and nonpolar molecules osborne et al 2013 podgorski et al 2012 2 5 soil and plant analysis the sand and subsoil used to pack the lysimeters were characterized for basic properties including bulk density particle density porosity ph organic matter and n content bulk density was measured from undisturbed soil cores particle density was measured through the pycnometer method blake and hartge 1986 we used bulk density and particle density to calculate soil porosity organic matter content was determined by loss on ignition ball 1964 the tn content was determined with an elemental analyzer thermo flash ea 1112 coupled to a mass spectrometer during the experiment grass in the lysimeters was mowed clipped regularly to maintain 6 cm above ground biomass clippings were dried 60 c weighed and pooled over the course of the experiment and analyzed at the end of the study period for tn and 15n abundance with an elemental analyzer thermo flash ea 1112 coupled to a mass spectrometer at the end of the experiment the sod and thatch layers were removed from each lysimeter and also dried weighed and analyzed for tn and 15n abundance in the same manner as the grass clippings we considered the sod thatch layer to be the actively growing turfgrass surface layer roots and the dead stems and rhizomes that were not yet decayed further at the end of the experiment each lysimeter was emptied and a composite soil sample from the sand and subsoil layers of each lysimeter was collected field sieved 2 mm mesh to remove coarse roots and analyzed for tn and 15n abundance as above for grass sod and thatch the recovery of added fertilizer n in soil and plant tissue pools clippings sod thatch was calculated with equation 1 above 2 6 statistical analyses we conducted a one way anova using the statistical software jmp pro 11 to compare the means of cumulative leached tn din and don among treatments control as and urea using a significance level of 0 05 as reported in the results section the anova showed no statistically significant differences among treatment means thus no post hoc tests were conducted to confirm where significant group differences occurred 3 results 3 1 nitrogen leaching from the turfgrass cumulative tn and din were highest in leachate from the control followed by the urea and as treatments table 2 however these differences were not shown by the anova to be statistically significant nor were there any significant differences in don concentrations among groups consistent with findings of other researchers erickson et al 2001 trenholm et al 2012 leaching losses of inorganic n were low and don was the dominant form leached from the newly established turfgrass system table 2 for example over the 92 day experiment the cumulative mean don in leachate was 88 94 and 94 of tn for the control urea and as treatments respectively flow weighted din concentrations in leachate did not exceed 0 14 mg l and were often below 0 05 mg l fig 1 a concentrations of din in the leachate peaked at 7 days after fertilizer application for the as treatment and at 14 days for the control and urea treatment by the end of the experiment 92 days din concentrations were 0 04 mg l in all treatments and differences in din concentrations between treatments were not significant in contrast the don concentrations were much higher and ranged from 1 0 to 2 2 mg l fig 1b flow weighed don concentrations were variable but in general peaked between 7 and 14 days after fertilizer application and then decreased with time for the fertilized lysimeters 3 2 fate of nitrogen derived from fertilizer of the total din in the leachate din dff was 0 6 and 0 7 of tn for the urea and as treatments respectively table 2 of the total don in leachate the don dff was 1 6 and 1 8 of tn for the urea and as treatments respectively table 2 thus a small amount of tn leached from each treatment during the 92 day experiment 2 5 was derived from fertilizer and of this most of it was in the don form as such a small amount of the tn leached was derived from fertilizer we suggest that most of n that leached during the 92 days was derived from soil and or the initial sod biomass we determined 15n recovery in other pools to quantify the fate of fertilizer n table 3 we could account for 75 7 and 90 6 of the 355 mg of fertilizer n added with the urea and as treatments respectively the soil was the dominant 15n recovery pool followed by sod thatch and clippings the remainder 9 24 of the 15n was estimated to be lost via ammonia volatilization and or denitrification in both urea and the as treatments din dff and don dff were detected as early as after 0 3 day in the leachate fig 2 the mass of n derived from fertilizer ndff in both din and don leachate pools increased with time and was still increasing when the experiment ended at 92 days 3 3 molecular characterization of leached don our fticr ms data characterized only end of experiment don at one point in time thus we do not attempt to make broad conclusions about statistically significant differences in don composition between the treatments we instead describe the similarities and differences observed in the fticr ms data for one temporal point the fticr ms spectra contained 8 740 8 190 and 16 249 peaks for which molecular formulas were assigned in end of experiment leachates from the control as and urea treatments respectively in all samples the relative percent spectral abundance was highest for the heteroatom group cho 36 1 49 1 followed in order by the chon 24 5 33 2 chos 4 3 7 6 and chons 1 4 4 7 table 4 isolating only n bearing formulas those in the chn chon chons groups allows characterization of the don molecular groups found in each sample there were 3 960 4 304 and 8124 n bearing organic compounds in leachate from the control as and urea treatments respectively the majority of n bearing formulas were in the chon group table 4 fig 3 compares the treatments by relative spectral abundances of chn and chon formulas among the three treatments the urea amended lysimeters had a higher relative abundance of high o compounds o6 to o13 whereas the as amended lysimeters had a higher relative abundance of low o compounds o1 to o5 we used van krevelen diagrams to provide visual representations of the molecular character of compounds present in the bulk leached don fig 4 a van krevelen diagram plots the identified compounds according to their o c and h c atomic ratios kim et al 2003 and can be used to classify compounds into biomolecular regions such as a lipid like region a protein like region a lignin like region or a carbohydrate like region ohno et al 2010 in all three cases these compounds fall within a range of biomolecular compounds fig 4 lipid protein and lignin like compounds were the most common in all samples whereas carbohydrates and unsaturated hydrocarbons uhc accounted for less than 0 1 of assigned formulas the urea treatment contained a region of uhc not present in the other two samples fig 4 the control and both treatments contained several thousands of leached don compounds not found in either of the other samples there were 2518 64 6866 85 and 3035 71 unique n bearing formulas in the control urea and as treatments respectively fig 5 a c 4 discussion 4 1 importance of leaching of organic nitrogen from turfgrass understanding and properly managing n fertilizers in urban landscapes is an important part of urban nutrient management in florida a rapidly urbanizing state with numerous freshwater marine and estuarine water resources the fate of excess n in the environment is especially critical and is often a focus of regulatory activity aimed at preventing cultural eutrophication and water quality degradation for example more than 50 florida counties and municipalities currently have summer wet season june to september blackout periods or bans on the application of n bearing lawn fertilizers under the premise that summer rains drive fertilizer n into runoff and groundwater hartman 2008 our wet season application of either as or urea fertilizers to newly established st augustine turfgrass did not result in any significant differences when compared to unfertilized controls in leachate no3 or don concentrations during the first 92 days after fertilizer application organic n represented the dominant portion 88 94 of tn leached from both fertilized treatments and the control table 2 our results concerning inorganic n loss being much less important than organic n loss are consistent with those cited in reviews of turfgrass leaching by qian and follett 2012 who found that turf plots less than 10 years old presented a little risk for inorganic n leaching similarly petrovic 1990 concluded that leaching loss of inorganic fertilizer in turfgrass is almost always less than 10 of tn our study is also consistent with the sparse other studies that have looked at don from turfgrass systems for example barton et al 2009 observed that 43 of all n lost via leaching from 20 week old turfgrass was don that number increased to 53 for 20 year old turfgrass pare et al 2008 found that 10 70 of the n that leached from newly established bluegrass was don they also used a15n fertilizer label to conclude that most leached don was derived from residual soil pools and 15n don was present in leachates as early as 14 days after application our study highlights the leaching loss of don from newly established st augustine turf a warm season turfgrass for which we are aware of no other studies that have investigated don leaching during establishment in the scientific literature most studies of n leaching from turfgrass have ignored leaching loss via don petrovic 1990 our study shows that failure to account for don in leachate greatly underestimates n loss from urban residential landscapes we know from studies in natural ecosystems that don is an important pathway of n loss for forested watersheds regardless of soil n stock neff et al 2003 perakis and hedin 2002 scott and rothstein 2017 this observation leads to the characterization by some authors of don as an ecosystem n leak because unlike din which is tightly cycled when biotic demand is high don is observed to leach across a wide range of n availabilities neff et al 2003 the observation that don leaches from soils even during times of high biotic demand is likely due to the compositional variability of don it being comprised of both labile and refractory compounds that function ecologically in different ways perakis and hedin 2002 aside from this one physico chemical process that can limit don flux from soils is the formation of strong mineral organic matter associations with don fluxes higher in sandy textured soils than in fine textured soils campbell et al 2000 qualls et al 2002 the lysimeter soils used in this study were sandy textured with likely little capacity to retain don because of reduced soil solution contact time and few sorption opportunities our previous study of a highly urbanized florida watershed 56 83 urbanized showed that n in local streams is predominantly don 64 72 of tn lusk and toor 2016b and we believe the high don leaching observed in this study is representative of n fate in the turf dominated landscape 4 2 fate of fertilizer nitrogen often when 15n tracer studies have been applied to the fate of fertilizer n in turfgrass systems any 15n unaccounted for at the end of an experiment is attributed to gaseous loss via volatilization or denitrification engelsjord et al 2004 frank et al 2006 miltner et al 1996 without that assumption having actually been checked by measuring gaseous n loss horgan et al 2002 in a15n tracing study measured n loss via denitrification and found that 15n recovery in the turfgrass system was far from complete we suggest that a part of the fertilizer n can be converted in turfgrass systems to new organic n and leached quickly in days to weeks as don making don dff one vector of n loss in urban residential landscapes this also means that previous assumptions about all unrecovered 15n being attributable to gaseous loss may not hold true if we want to accurately determine the fate of added n to urban systems we need to recognize that a portion of that n is likely being lost as leached don it may be in the don form even if inputs are inorganic as we saw here for our as treatment table 2 and as corroborated by pare et al 2008 because 15n recovery as don dff occurred rapidly just days after fertilizer was added we contend that the leached don dff was not humified but instead was from fresh organic matter derived from root and microbial exudates in this case mineral n taken up by plant roots or soil microbes would have been rapidly turned over giving the system a form of fresh leachable don although portions of both din and don in leachate were attributable to fertilizer and that finding is important when we traced the applied 15n we observed that less than 1 of the inorganic n and less than 2 of the organic n in leachate was derived from fertilizer table 2 this means that the initial soil and or the sod that was used to plant the experimental lysimeters were the leading source of leachate n at least during the early 3 month period of sod establishment looked at in this study the sod thatch was not only a major source of leached n but also a sink for fertilizer n capturing 18 and 33 of applied fertilizer in the urea and as treatments respectively table 3 this is consistent with findings by raciti et al 2008 who found that 70 days after addition of a15n fertilizer label to turfgrass 28 and 36 was recovered in thatch and soil pools respectively by 365 days after the fertilizer addition in that study the soil alone dominated as the 15n sink holding 70 of the added n we found 44 48 of applied n in the lysimeter subsoils though we did not distinguish how much fertilizer n was recovered in organic versus inorganic n pools in the subsoils we hypothesize that much of the 15n recovered was in organic matter pool in young turfgrass systems like ours the soil organic matter is an important pool for n retention qian and follett 2012 when new urban land is developed and converted to turfgrass coverage soil organic matter pools are quickly built due to the fertilization and irrigation creating urban turfgrass systems with high root and shoot biomass productivity and with little tillage they begin to sequester soil organic carbon qian and follett 2012 during the first 20 30 years after turf establishment this build up of soil organic carbon favors n immobilization in soil organic matter qian and follett 2012 during this time inorganic n loss via leaching is minimal because n input from fertilization is retained by the system and it is not until generally after 25 30 years that turfgrass become carbon and n saturated causing n immobilization processes to give way to n mineralization processes lu et al 2015 in this way older turfgrass has frequently been shown to have lower n fertilizer needs than younger turf because of the soil s release of mineral n via mineralization barton et al 2009 lu et al 2015 qian and follett 2012 given this it could be argued that n fertilizer recommendation should be lowered for older turfgrass relative to the current recommendation 4 3 molecular composition of leachate don a novel component of our study was to investigate the end of season molecular character of leachate don the single samples analyzed for each treatment and the control showed that leachate don was present in a wide range of biomolecular compounds but that there were variations in don composition among treatments it is beyond the scope of this study to investigate why those differences are present and how much those differences are due to natural soil heterogeneity versus a response to experimental treatments as it was our intent to use the fticr ms analysis as a preliminary investigation into the general molecular character of leachate don future research should be conducted through replicated experimentation to parse out potential treatment effects and to trace how leachate don changes with time adding n fertilizer to the system can be expected to change the composition and biomass of the soil microbial community hartman and richardson 2013 sarathchandra et al 2001 this in turn may lead to accumulations of different organic compounds in the soil as the variable microbial communities exert differing influences on soil organic matter alteration and decomposition janssens et al 2010 peltre et al 2017 we cannot state with certainty that this is the case for our study but future research should be conducted to more closely investigate the effects of fertilizer inputs to turfgrass and microbial communities on leached don composition it is also known that root exudates can prime soil microbial communities and lead to increased alteration of low quality soil organic matter kuzyakov 2010 we did not quantify root biomass in our fertilized treatments but doing so would be an important next step in future studies as differences in root biomass may cause changes in microbial functioning that in turn lead to accumulation of a new suite of organic compounds in the system 4 4 practical implications of managing nitrogen fertilizers in urban landscapes nitrogen added to urban landscapes via fertilizers to managed turfgrass is a subject of intense scrutiny and concern for water quality issues and regulatory agencies are tasked with addressing those concerns this research offers insights on the fate of n in newly established st augustine turfgrass during the florida summer rainy season our study is representative of what might be expected to happen to fertilizer n soon after previously undeveloped pasture is converted to urban residential land and the ground is newly sodded with turfgrass such systems are shown here to be large exporters of n but the great majority of that n is present as don derived from the residual soil studies that seek to complete mass balances for inputs versus outputs of n in urban landscapes must account for leaching via don we have known for some time that don is a significant n loss vector in agroecosystems van kessel et al 2009 and we need to begin a new round of studies to quantify such loss in urban landscapes with high percentage of turfgrass coverage in particular the first important practical application of this work is that we likely make assumptions that overestimate n losses to the atmosphere via volatilization and or denitrification if we fail to account for leaching losses of don a second important implication of this work is that a portion of the inorganic n added to urban landscapes as fertilizer will be recovered as don we observed portions of the fertilizer n in leached don pools just days after adding fertilizer our study was temporally short 92 days but at the conclusion of the experiment the mass loadings of don dff were continuing an upward trend indicating that with time even greater loads of don dff would likely be recovered this finding is important because the don derived from fertilizer in the as treatment could only be originating from mineral n that was taken up by plants and or microbes and released back to the soil as root or microbial exudates these n bearing organic materials being comprised mostly of non humic proteins and amino acids have been shown to be highly bioreactive and hence have ecological significance in that they may be sources of reactive n to groundwater petrone et al 2009 important study for future work will be to look at don dff over longer periods of time coupled with more in depth investigations of the molecular structure and bioavailability of the don leached from urban turfgrass as done in urban waters in our previous work lusk and toor 2016a b a third important implication from this work is that the newly established turfgrass system leached very little inorganic n even during the summer rainy season although there were small increases in inorganic n leaching after fertilization there were no significant differences in n loss between the control and treated lysimeters indicating that adding a wet season application of fertilizer caused no significant increase in n leaching in our young turfgrass system understandably there are concerns about water quality whenever there are inputs of fertilizer n to urban watersheds this study however confirms the findings of other researchers baker et al 2001 groffman et al 2004 raciti et al 2008 wollheim et al 2005 that urban watersheds have a high capacity for inorganic n retention especially during the season of active turf growth however increased n mineralization with time has been reported for turfgrass soils such that n retention in turfgrass systems may decrease as the turf ages qian and follett 2012 other related research in the region has indicated that a part of urban n fertilizers can be subject to losses via stormwater runoff yang and toor 2016 2017 thus whole system studies that investigate n pools in surface runoff and leaching pathways should be considered we suggest that while a regulatory summer ban on fertilizer application may have little impact on the health of newly established turf we should recognize that older turf might be more prone to n leaching losses hence n fertilizer recommendations should be developed and fine tuned for new vs older turf systems to optimize nutrient management in urban watersheds that keeps n in the plant root zone and reduce losses to receiving waters 5 conclusions this study investigated the fate of fertilizer n to young newly established turfgrass here we determined the role of don leaching from st augustine turfgrass a warm season grass using a15n fertilizer label to quantify the extent of applied fertilizer n loss via leaching a key finding of the study was that don is the dominant form in leachate from both fertilized and unfertilized treatments while most of this don is derived from the residual soil it is important to note that both urea and ammonium sulfate fertilized turf leached don derived from fertilizer and that the mass loading of this don was increasing with time and that this don likely originated from root and microbial exudates for urban areas in which we are concerned about the fate of anthropogenic n we cannot ignore the large n losses that occur via don leaching from turfgrass and we need to acknowledge that a portion of fertilizer n may be recovered as potentially bioreactive don

19771,understanding the mechanisms of nitrogen n retention and loss from fertilized urban turfgrass is critical to develop practices that mitigate n transport and protect water quality in urban ecosystems we investigated the fate of n in lysimeters sodded with st augustine turfgrass and amended with labeled 15n from either ammonium sulfate or urea fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy fticr ms was employed to identify various biomolecular classes in the leached dissolved organic n don from one lysimeter for each treatment and the control mean don concentrations over 92 days were 88 94 and 94 of total n in the leachate from the control urea and ammonium sulfate treatments respectively isotopic analysis showed that 3 of n in the leachate originated from newly applied n fertilizer suggesting that the remainder of the n in the leachate was derived from the lysimeter soil or sod biomass pools the 15n fertilizer recovery was greatest in soil 44 48 followed by sod thatch 18 33 grass clippings 10 13 and leachate 3 despite isotopic evidence of little contribution of n from fertilizers in the leachate a fraction of ammonium sulfate fertilizer was recovered as don in the leachate likely after uptake and conversion of inorganic fertilizer to organic plant exudates and or microbial byproducts fticr ms identified n bearing organic molecular formulas in the leachate from urea and ammonium sulfate treatments providing evidence of n leaching from newly established turfgrass of don compounds in a range of biomolecular compositions such as lipid protein carbohydrate and lignin like molecules graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrogen dissolved organic nitrogen leaching turfgrass groundwater quality 1 introduction sources of anthropogenic nitrogen n pollution in watersheds are diverse but an increasing density of human populations due to urbanization is often one cause of elevated n in aquatic ecosystems fields 2004 lu et al 2015 nitrogen fertilizers used to maintain urban turfgrass are a major n input in urban landscapes and may be a source of n loss to water bodies since turfgrass is the dominant urban land cover covering 16 million ha or 35 of total urban land in the united states milesi et al 2005 therefore understanding of the mechanisms of n retention and loss from fertilized urban turfgrass is needed to develop practices that mitigate n transport and protect water quality in urban ecosystems a number of field scale studies using 15n labeled fertilizer to determine the fate of n added to turfgrass have shown that n loss via leaching from fertilized turf is minimal carey et al 2012 erickson et al 2001 however many studies have typically failed to account for and recover all the added 15n even after considering gaseous n loss via volatilization and denitrification engelsjord et al 2004 frank et al 2006 horgan et al 2002 none of these studies measured dissolved organic nitrogen don in leachate but instead analyzed only leached inorganic n since don is a major pathway of n loss from agricultural ecosystems van kessel et al 2009 willett et al 2004 and from natural grasslands dijkstra et al 2007 leimer et al 2016 we hypothesize that don also likely constitutes a significant n loss pathway from fertilized turfgrass there are scarce studies in the literature on don generation release and transport from fertilized urban turfgrass systems and those that have been done looked mostly at ecotypes of bluegrass a cool season turf barton et al 2009 lu et al 2015 pare et al 2008 in two of the studies quantifying don leaching from fertilized turf pare et al 2008 found that don was a significant portion of the total n leached from golf green bluegrass and barton et al 2009 observed that don constituted 43 53 of all n leached from kikuyu turfgrass pennisetum clandestinum hochst ex chiov a warm season grass during the first 12 months of growth pare et al 2008 applied 15n fertilizer as nh4 and no3 and found that the majority 75 of leached don was attributed to soil organic matter and the remainder 25 was from mineral fertilizer n that was taken up by plants and or microbes and released as don in substances such as plant root exudates or microbial metabolites the application of inorganic n fertilizer stimulate plant roots and soil microbes to produce n enriched organic products over relatively short time scales murphy et al 2000 at the field scale a number of researchers kalbitz et al 2000 magill et al 2000 have concluded that inorganic n fertilizer applied to landscapes is assimilated into vegetation and soil organic matter and is subsequently released as don thus suggesting that don is a significant form of n loss even when the n inputs are largely inorganic for example magill et al 2000 applied inorganic fertilizer n to plots in the harvard forest and observed increased don flux below the soil likewise kalbitz et al 2000 provided evidence that plant incorporation of inorganic fertilizer n was followed by increased release of don to groundwater pare et al 2008 found 15n don in turfgrass leachate within 14 days after application of labeled inorganic n fertilizer they attributed the short time period of transformation from inorganic n to non humified don in the form of fresh root exudates and microbial metabolites though they did not conduct further tests to confirm this suggestion from these handful of studies on the leaching losses of don from turfgrass it is clear that a failure to account for n export as don will underestimate the total n loss from turfgrass as well as the full extent of fertilizer n transport in urban watersheds since additions of anthropogenic fertilizers to turf systems may produce n enriched organic products such as microbial exudates kalbitz et al 2000 magill et al 2000 murphy et al 2000 it is also likely that urbanization and subsequent shifts to high input n fertilizer regimes may alter the biomolecular character of don leaching from these systems the use of fticr ms is a promising tool for identifying qualitative shifts in the don molecular character under different fertilizer regimes but we are not aware of any studies in the literature that have addressed this the main objective of this work was to quantify the leaching loss of don from fertilized st augustine stenotaphrum secundatum walter kuntze turfgrass a warm season grass that is the dominant urban land cover in florida erickson et al 2001 and for which we have no known reports in the literature on n loss via don leaching we asked the following research questions 1 how does the magnitude of don loss by leaching from fertilized st augustine compare to the leaching losses of inorganic n 2 what portion of applied fertilizer n is recovered as leachate don and 3 what biomolecular compound groups are present in the don fraction of the leachate the research reported here used soil lysimeters sodded with st augustine turfgrass and fertilized with a15n fertilizer label of either ammonium sulfate or urea fertilizer was added one month after the sod was planted therefore the results are for a young turfgrass system an important distinction since turfgrass systems typically lose more n as they age lu et al 2015 a novel component of this study is that we investigated don as well as inorganic n forms no3 and nh4 and characterized end of study don in leachate by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy fticr ms to provide molecular level characterization of leached don 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil lysimeter packing nine soil lysimeters were built by cutting 30 cm internal diameter polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe into 55 cm sections each pvc lysimeter total surface area 730 cm2 was packed with approximately 34 kg of soil taken from the a horizon 23 55 cm bulk density 1 52 mg m 3 of a seffner fine sand sandy siliceous hyperthermic aquic humic dystrudept this soil was collected in summer 2014 from the university of florida gulf coast research and education center in wimauma florida from a field that was taken out of citrus production in 2000 and had been since maintained as a mowed field soil was air dried and sieved through a standard no 10 2 mm sieve and analyzed for basic physical and chemical properties table 1 after packing the lysimeters with seffner fine sand soil from 23 to 55 cm depth approximately 17 kg of commercially fine sand from a lawn and garden store was packed from 6 to 23 cm depth bulk density 1 40 mg m 3 turfgrass st augustine was placed over the fine sand in each lysimeter 0 6 cm the bottom end cap of each lysimeter was filled with a mixture of 5 kg pea gravel and 3 kg coarse sand to promote free drainage a piece of cheesecloth was placed below the gravel sand layer to prevent any material sand loss from the lysimeters a hole was drilled at the bottom of each end cap and plastic tubing was attached to allow leachate collection leachate was directed via the tubing into dark glass bottles lysimeters were placed outside and subjected to natural rainfall and were manually irrigated with deionized water as necessary to maintain at least 2 54 cm 0 11 pore volume pv of water input per week per university of florida institute of food and agricultural sciences extension recommendations for irrigating st augustine turf in the region 2 2 turf establishment and treatments prior to the experiments lysimeters were equilibrated by applying approximately 1 pv 16 15 l of deionized water to remove entrapped air the pv was determined by calculating the product of soil porosity and volume of each layer sand and subsoil and then summing the two the lysimeters were then allowed to freely drain for 14 days before sodding after 28 days of sod establishment on 9 august 2014 three treatments with three replicates for each treatment were established ammonium sulfate as nh4 2so4 urea co nh4 2 and control no fertilizer the day of fertilization was designated as experiment day 1 fertilizer solutions were prepared in 2 l equivalent to 2 54 cm or 0 11 pv deionized water and applied over the top of each lysimeter treatments were made with 10 atom 15n as sigma aldrich product 348473 or 10 atom 15n urea sigma aldrich product 490970 treatments were applied to achieve 1 pound n per 1000 square feet of turfgrass equivalent to 49 kg ha which is the current recommended fertilizer application rate for lawns in central florida sartain 2000 this amount was equivalent to 355 mg of applied n per lysimeter based on the molar weights of 10 atom 15n as mw 132 34 g mol 1 or 10 atom 15n urea mw 60 25 g mol 1 after fertilizer application the experiment was conducted for 92 days from 9 august to 7 november 2014 2 3 leachate collection and analysis leachate was passed through anti microbial plastic tubing that drained from the bottom of each lysimeters into 4 l amber glass bottles that were housed in a cooler modified to allow insertion of the tubing leachate volume was measured after each rain or irrigation event and a 250 ml subsample was collected and stored at 4 c for analysis at the time of analysis all the samples from a given time interval were used to create flow weighted composites for that interval i e days 0 3 4 7 8 14 15 28 29 49 and 50 92 samples were analyzed for nox n nh3 n total n tn total dissolved n tdn and for 15n recovery in the dissolved inorganic n din nox n nh3 n and don pools for nh3 n and nox n analysis 0 45 μm filtered aliquots were analyzed using a discrete analyzer aq2 seal analytical inc mequon wi for tdn analysis a subsample of the filtered leachate was oxidized with the alkaline persulfate oxidation method described by hosomi and sudo 1986 and then analyzed for nox n with a discrete analyzer as above for tn analysis an aliquot of unfiltered sample was likewise oxidized and analyzed particulate organic n pon was calculated as the difference between tn and tdn and don was calculated as the difference between tdn and nox n nh3 n the persulfate oxidation method used for tdn and tn analysis involved preparation of a digestion reagent made by dissolving 20 g recrystallized k2so4 and 3 g naoh in 1 l of deionized water the samples were oxidized by adding digestion reagent to a sample 1 2 in a loosely capped screw cap glass culture tube and autoclaving at 110 c for 30 min determination of 15n recovery in the don pool in leachate required quantifying recovery in tdn pool and then subtracting the recovery in the din pool concentrations of nh3 n in the leachate were negligible and typically below the detection limit of 0 02 mg l therefore we only determined 15n recovery in no3 for the din pool in this way 15n don was calculated as 15n tdn 15n no3 n to quantify 15n tdn bulk filtered samples were first lyophilized to produce a powder that could produce the isotopic signatures of tdn the powder was transferred to a tin capsule for analysis of isotopic composition with a costech model 4010 elemental analyzer costech analytical industries valencia ca coupled to a finnigan mat deltaplusxl mass spectrometer continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry thermo finnigan san jose ca the next step was to determine the isotopic composition of the leachate no3 using the microbial denitrifier method sigman et al 2001 the recovery of labeled fertilizer was calculated for leachate n pools as follows 1 15 n r e c o v e r e d 100 x p c b f a b where p moles of n in the given leachate pool e g no3 don f moles of n in the fertilizer input c atom 15n in the given leachate pool a atom 15n in the fertilizer 10 b atom 15n in the control 2 4 molecular characterization of leachate at the conclusion of the experiment day 92 a flow weighted composite sample of leachate from each treatment and control was used to provide insights on the molecular character of don in leachate we accomplished this through fticr ms at the national high magnetic field laboratory in tallahassee florida methods used for this analysis were from lusk and toor 2016b and briefly involved concentrating 75 ml of 0 45 μm filtered leachate that had been acidified to approximately ph 2 0 with hydrochloric acid hcl through solid phase extraction spe with 1 g 6 ml varian bond elut ppl spe cartridges samples obtained through spe were analyzed by fticr ms via positive mode atmospheric pressure photoionization appi with toluene as the dopant on a modified thermo fisher appi source thermo fisher corp san jose ca we used appi because it has been shown to generate more n bearing molecules than electrospray ionization and can ionize both polar and nonpolar molecules osborne et al 2013 podgorski et al 2012 2 5 soil and plant analysis the sand and subsoil used to pack the lysimeters were characterized for basic properties including bulk density particle density porosity ph organic matter and n content bulk density was measured from undisturbed soil cores particle density was measured through the pycnometer method blake and hartge 1986 we used bulk density and particle density to calculate soil porosity organic matter content was determined by loss on ignition ball 1964 the tn content was determined with an elemental analyzer thermo flash ea 1112 coupled to a mass spectrometer during the experiment grass in the lysimeters was mowed clipped regularly to maintain 6 cm above ground biomass clippings were dried 60 c weighed and pooled over the course of the experiment and analyzed at the end of the study period for tn and 15n abundance with an elemental analyzer thermo flash ea 1112 coupled to a mass spectrometer at the end of the experiment the sod and thatch layers were removed from each lysimeter and also dried weighed and analyzed for tn and 15n abundance in the same manner as the grass clippings we considered the sod thatch layer to be the actively growing turfgrass surface layer roots and the dead stems and rhizomes that were not yet decayed further at the end of the experiment each lysimeter was emptied and a composite soil sample from the sand and subsoil layers of each lysimeter was collected field sieved 2 mm mesh to remove coarse roots and analyzed for tn and 15n abundance as above for grass sod and thatch the recovery of added fertilizer n in soil and plant tissue pools clippings sod thatch was calculated with equation 1 above 2 6 statistical analyses we conducted a one way anova using the statistical software jmp pro 11 to compare the means of cumulative leached tn din and don among treatments control as and urea using a significance level of 0 05 as reported in the results section the anova showed no statistically significant differences among treatment means thus no post hoc tests were conducted to confirm where significant group differences occurred 3 results 3 1 nitrogen leaching from the turfgrass cumulative tn and din were highest in leachate from the control followed by the urea and as treatments table 2 however these differences were not shown by the anova to be statistically significant nor were there any significant differences in don concentrations among groups consistent with findings of other researchers erickson et al 2001 trenholm et al 2012 leaching losses of inorganic n were low and don was the dominant form leached from the newly established turfgrass system table 2 for example over the 92 day experiment the cumulative mean don in leachate was 88 94 and 94 of tn for the control urea and as treatments respectively flow weighted din concentrations in leachate did not exceed 0 14 mg l and were often below 0 05 mg l fig 1 a concentrations of din in the leachate peaked at 7 days after fertilizer application for the as treatment and at 14 days for the control and urea treatment by the end of the experiment 92 days din concentrations were 0 04 mg l in all treatments and differences in din concentrations between treatments were not significant in contrast the don concentrations were much higher and ranged from 1 0 to 2 2 mg l fig 1b flow weighed don concentrations were variable but in general peaked between 7 and 14 days after fertilizer application and then decreased with time for the fertilized lysimeters 3 2 fate of nitrogen derived from fertilizer of the total din in the leachate din dff was 0 6 and 0 7 of tn for the urea and as treatments respectively table 2 of the total don in leachate the don dff was 1 6 and 1 8 of tn for the urea and as treatments respectively table 2 thus a small amount of tn leached from each treatment during the 92 day experiment 2 5 was derived from fertilizer and of this most of it was in the don form as such a small amount of the tn leached was derived from fertilizer we suggest that most of n that leached during the 92 days was derived from soil and or the initial sod biomass we determined 15n recovery in other pools to quantify the fate of fertilizer n table 3 we could account for 75 7 and 90 6 of the 355 mg of fertilizer n added with the urea and as treatments respectively the soil was the dominant 15n recovery pool followed by sod thatch and clippings the remainder 9 24 of the 15n was estimated to be lost via ammonia volatilization and or denitrification in both urea and the as treatments din dff and don dff were detected as early as after 0 3 day in the leachate fig 2 the mass of n derived from fertilizer ndff in both din and don leachate pools increased with time and was still increasing when the experiment ended at 92 days 3 3 molecular characterization of leached don our fticr ms data characterized only end of experiment don at one point in time thus we do not attempt to make broad conclusions about statistically significant differences in don composition between the treatments we instead describe the similarities and differences observed in the fticr ms data for one temporal point the fticr ms spectra contained 8 740 8 190 and 16 249 peaks for which molecular formulas were assigned in end of experiment leachates from the control as and urea treatments respectively in all samples the relative percent spectral abundance was highest for the heteroatom group cho 36 1 49 1 followed in order by the chon 24 5 33 2 chos 4 3 7 6 and chons 1 4 4 7 table 4 isolating only n bearing formulas those in the chn chon chons groups allows characterization of the don molecular groups found in each sample there were 3 960 4 304 and 8124 n bearing organic compounds in leachate from the control as and urea treatments respectively the majority of n bearing formulas were in the chon group table 4 fig 3 compares the treatments by relative spectral abundances of chn and chon formulas among the three treatments the urea amended lysimeters had a higher relative abundance of high o compounds o6 to o13 whereas the as amended lysimeters had a higher relative abundance of low o compounds o1 to o5 we used van krevelen diagrams to provide visual representations of the molecular character of compounds present in the bulk leached don fig 4 a van krevelen diagram plots the identified compounds according to their o c and h c atomic ratios kim et al 2003 and can be used to classify compounds into biomolecular regions such as a lipid like region a protein like region a lignin like region or a carbohydrate like region ohno et al 2010 in all three cases these compounds fall within a range of biomolecular compounds fig 4 lipid protein and lignin like compounds were the most common in all samples whereas carbohydrates and unsaturated hydrocarbons uhc accounted for less than 0 1 of assigned formulas the urea treatment contained a region of uhc not present in the other two samples fig 4 the control and both treatments contained several thousands of leached don compounds not found in either of the other samples there were 2518 64 6866 85 and 3035 71 unique n bearing formulas in the control urea and as treatments respectively fig 5 a c 4 discussion 4 1 importance of leaching of organic nitrogen from turfgrass understanding and properly managing n fertilizers in urban landscapes is an important part of urban nutrient management in florida a rapidly urbanizing state with numerous freshwater marine and estuarine water resources the fate of excess n in the environment is especially critical and is often a focus of regulatory activity aimed at preventing cultural eutrophication and water quality degradation for example more than 50 florida counties and municipalities currently have summer wet season june to september blackout periods or bans on the application of n bearing lawn fertilizers under the premise that summer rains drive fertilizer n into runoff and groundwater hartman 2008 our wet season application of either as or urea fertilizers to newly established st augustine turfgrass did not result in any significant differences when compared to unfertilized controls in leachate no3 or don concentrations during the first 92 days after fertilizer application organic n represented the dominant portion 88 94 of tn leached from both fertilized treatments and the control table 2 our results concerning inorganic n loss being much less important than organic n loss are consistent with those cited in reviews of turfgrass leaching by qian and follett 2012 who found that turf plots less than 10 years old presented a little risk for inorganic n leaching similarly petrovic 1990 concluded that leaching loss of inorganic fertilizer in turfgrass is almost always less than 10 of tn our study is also consistent with the sparse other studies that have looked at don from turfgrass systems for example barton et al 2009 observed that 43 of all n lost via leaching from 20 week old turfgrass was don that number increased to 53 for 20 year old turfgrass pare et al 2008 found that 10 70 of the n that leached from newly established bluegrass was don they also used a15n fertilizer label to conclude that most leached don was derived from residual soil pools and 15n don was present in leachates as early as 14 days after application our study highlights the leaching loss of don from newly established st augustine turf a warm season turfgrass for which we are aware of no other studies that have investigated don leaching during establishment in the scientific literature most studies of n leaching from turfgrass have ignored leaching loss via don petrovic 1990 our study shows that failure to account for don in leachate greatly underestimates n loss from urban residential landscapes we know from studies in natural ecosystems that don is an important pathway of n loss for forested watersheds regardless of soil n stock neff et al 2003 perakis and hedin 2002 scott and rothstein 2017 this observation leads to the characterization by some authors of don as an ecosystem n leak because unlike din which is tightly cycled when biotic demand is high don is observed to leach across a wide range of n availabilities neff et al 2003 the observation that don leaches from soils even during times of high biotic demand is likely due to the compositional variability of don it being comprised of both labile and refractory compounds that function ecologically in different ways perakis and hedin 2002 aside from this one physico chemical process that can limit don flux from soils is the formation of strong mineral organic matter associations with don fluxes higher in sandy textured soils than in fine textured soils campbell et al 2000 qualls et al 2002 the lysimeter soils used in this study were sandy textured with likely little capacity to retain don because of reduced soil solution contact time and few sorption opportunities our previous study of a highly urbanized florida watershed 56 83 urbanized showed that n in local streams is predominantly don 64 72 of tn lusk and toor 2016b and we believe the high don leaching observed in this study is representative of n fate in the turf dominated landscape 4 2 fate of fertilizer nitrogen often when 15n tracer studies have been applied to the fate of fertilizer n in turfgrass systems any 15n unaccounted for at the end of an experiment is attributed to gaseous loss via volatilization or denitrification engelsjord et al 2004 frank et al 2006 miltner et al 1996 without that assumption having actually been checked by measuring gaseous n loss horgan et al 2002 in a15n tracing study measured n loss via denitrification and found that 15n recovery in the turfgrass system was far from complete we suggest that a part of the fertilizer n can be converted in turfgrass systems to new organic n and leached quickly in days to weeks as don making don dff one vector of n loss in urban residential landscapes this also means that previous assumptions about all unrecovered 15n being attributable to gaseous loss may not hold true if we want to accurately determine the fate of added n to urban systems we need to recognize that a portion of that n is likely being lost as leached don it may be in the don form even if inputs are inorganic as we saw here for our as treatment table 2 and as corroborated by pare et al 2008 because 15n recovery as don dff occurred rapidly just days after fertilizer was added we contend that the leached don dff was not humified but instead was from fresh organic matter derived from root and microbial exudates in this case mineral n taken up by plant roots or soil microbes would have been rapidly turned over giving the system a form of fresh leachable don although portions of both din and don in leachate were attributable to fertilizer and that finding is important when we traced the applied 15n we observed that less than 1 of the inorganic n and less than 2 of the organic n in leachate was derived from fertilizer table 2 this means that the initial soil and or the sod that was used to plant the experimental lysimeters were the leading source of leachate n at least during the early 3 month period of sod establishment looked at in this study the sod thatch was not only a major source of leached n but also a sink for fertilizer n capturing 18 and 33 of applied fertilizer in the urea and as treatments respectively table 3 this is consistent with findings by raciti et al 2008 who found that 70 days after addition of a15n fertilizer label to turfgrass 28 and 36 was recovered in thatch and soil pools respectively by 365 days after the fertilizer addition in that study the soil alone dominated as the 15n sink holding 70 of the added n we found 44 48 of applied n in the lysimeter subsoils though we did not distinguish how much fertilizer n was recovered in organic versus inorganic n pools in the subsoils we hypothesize that much of the 15n recovered was in organic matter pool in young turfgrass systems like ours the soil organic matter is an important pool for n retention qian and follett 2012 when new urban land is developed and converted to turfgrass coverage soil organic matter pools are quickly built due to the fertilization and irrigation creating urban turfgrass systems with high root and shoot biomass productivity and with little tillage they begin to sequester soil organic carbon qian and follett 2012 during the first 20 30 years after turf establishment this build up of soil organic carbon favors n immobilization in soil organic matter qian and follett 2012 during this time inorganic n loss via leaching is minimal because n input from fertilization is retained by the system and it is not until generally after 25 30 years that turfgrass become carbon and n saturated causing n immobilization processes to give way to n mineralization processes lu et al 2015 in this way older turfgrass has frequently been shown to have lower n fertilizer needs than younger turf because of the soil s release of mineral n via mineralization barton et al 2009 lu et al 2015 qian and follett 2012 given this it could be argued that n fertilizer recommendation should be lowered for older turfgrass relative to the current recommendation 4 3 molecular composition of leachate don a novel component of our study was to investigate the end of season molecular character of leachate don the single samples analyzed for each treatment and the control showed that leachate don was present in a wide range of biomolecular compounds but that there were variations in don composition among treatments it is beyond the scope of this study to investigate why those differences are present and how much those differences are due to natural soil heterogeneity versus a response to experimental treatments as it was our intent to use the fticr ms analysis as a preliminary investigation into the general molecular character of leachate don future research should be conducted through replicated experimentation to parse out potential treatment effects and to trace how leachate don changes with time adding n fertilizer to the system can be expected to change the composition and biomass of the soil microbial community hartman and richardson 2013 sarathchandra et al 2001 this in turn may lead to accumulations of different organic compounds in the soil as the variable microbial communities exert differing influences on soil organic matter alteration and decomposition janssens et al 2010 peltre et al 2017 we cannot state with certainty that this is the case for our study but future research should be conducted to more closely investigate the effects of fertilizer inputs to turfgrass and microbial communities on leached don composition it is also known that root exudates can prime soil microbial communities and lead to increased alteration of low quality soil organic matter kuzyakov 2010 we did not quantify root biomass in our fertilized treatments but doing so would be an important next step in future studies as differences in root biomass may cause changes in microbial functioning that in turn lead to accumulation of a new suite of organic compounds in the system 4 4 practical implications of managing nitrogen fertilizers in urban landscapes nitrogen added to urban landscapes via fertilizers to managed turfgrass is a subject of intense scrutiny and concern for water quality issues and regulatory agencies are tasked with addressing those concerns this research offers insights on the fate of n in newly established st augustine turfgrass during the florida summer rainy season our study is representative of what might be expected to happen to fertilizer n soon after previously undeveloped pasture is converted to urban residential land and the ground is newly sodded with turfgrass such systems are shown here to be large exporters of n but the great majority of that n is present as don derived from the residual soil studies that seek to complete mass balances for inputs versus outputs of n in urban landscapes must account for leaching via don we have known for some time that don is a significant n loss vector in agroecosystems van kessel et al 2009 and we need to begin a new round of studies to quantify such loss in urban landscapes with high percentage of turfgrass coverage in particular the first important practical application of this work is that we likely make assumptions that overestimate n losses to the atmosphere via volatilization and or denitrification if we fail to account for leaching losses of don a second important implication of this work is that a portion of the inorganic n added to urban landscapes as fertilizer will be recovered as don we observed portions of the fertilizer n in leached don pools just days after adding fertilizer our study was temporally short 92 days but at the conclusion of the experiment the mass loadings of don dff were continuing an upward trend indicating that with time even greater loads of don dff would likely be recovered this finding is important because the don derived from fertilizer in the as treatment could only be originating from mineral n that was taken up by plants and or microbes and released back to the soil as root or microbial exudates these n bearing organic materials being comprised mostly of non humic proteins and amino acids have been shown to be highly bioreactive and hence have ecological significance in that they may be sources of reactive n to groundwater petrone et al 2009 important study for future work will be to look at don dff over longer periods of time coupled with more in depth investigations of the molecular structure and bioavailability of the don leached from urban turfgrass as done in urban waters in our previous work lusk and toor 2016a b a third important implication from this work is that the newly established turfgrass system leached very little inorganic n even during the summer rainy season although there were small increases in inorganic n leaching after fertilization there were no significant differences in n loss between the control and treated lysimeters indicating that adding a wet season application of fertilizer caused no significant increase in n leaching in our young turfgrass system understandably there are concerns about water quality whenever there are inputs of fertilizer n to urban watersheds this study however confirms the findings of other researchers baker et al 2001 groffman et al 2004 raciti et al 2008 wollheim et al 2005 that urban watersheds have a high capacity for inorganic n retention especially during the season of active turf growth however increased n mineralization with time has been reported for turfgrass soils such that n retention in turfgrass systems may decrease as the turf ages qian and follett 2012 other related research in the region has indicated that a part of urban n fertilizers can be subject to losses via stormwater runoff yang and toor 2016 2017 thus whole system studies that investigate n pools in surface runoff and leaching pathways should be considered we suggest that while a regulatory summer ban on fertilizer application may have little impact on the health of newly established turf we should recognize that older turf might be more prone to n leaching losses hence n fertilizer recommendations should be developed and fine tuned for new vs older turf systems to optimize nutrient management in urban watersheds that keeps n in the plant root zone and reduce losses to receiving waters 5 conclusions this study investigated the fate of fertilizer n to young newly established turfgrass here we determined the role of don leaching from st augustine turfgrass a warm season grass using a15n fertilizer label to quantify the extent of applied fertilizer n loss via leaching a key finding of the study was that don is the dominant form in leachate from both fertilized and unfertilized treatments while most of this don is derived from the residual soil it is important to note that both urea and ammonium sulfate fertilized turf leached don derived from fertilizer and that the mass loading of this don was increasing with time and that this don likely originated from root and microbial exudates for urban areas in which we are concerned about the fate of anthropogenic n we cannot ignore the large n losses that occur via don leaching from turfgrass and we need to acknowledge that a portion of fertilizer n may be recovered as potentially bioreactive don

19772,the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of high influent concentration suspended solids ss on the cultivation structure and long term stability of aerobic granular sludge ags cultivation and long term stability of ags were monitored in two pilot scale sequencing batch reactors fed with raw r1 and settled r2 domestic wastewater representing high and medium ss content respectively the real domestic wastewater had high chemical oxygen demand cod content 1100 270 mg cod l 1 aerobic granular sludge was cultivated in 44 days r1 and 25 days r2 under the conditions of high settling velocity 18 m h 1 and high organic loading rate olr 2 1 2 4 kg cod m3 day the ags in both reactors had similar structural properties during long term operation and remained structurally and functionally stable during the last five months of operation comparative evaluation of the results indicated that the high influent ss content of the real domestic wastewater had a positive influence on maintaining significantly lower svi30 and relatively lower effluent ss concentration moreover a higher influent ss content resulted in smaller mature granules during the stable period microbial community analyses helped to understand the aerobic granular sludge structure and showed that the sludge retention time and olr affected the granular sludge population the high influent ss increased biomass detachment from the granular sludge surface and caused wash out of some bacteria colonizing the exterior of the granular sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge domestic wastewater granule structure microbial community pilot scale influent suspended solids 1 introduction recently research on aerobic granular sludge ags technology has increased rapidly due to its advantages over conventional suspended activated sludge as technology aerobic granulation has been reported in well controlled lab scale reactors with high or middle strength synthetic wastewaters moy et al 2002 dulekgurgen et al 2003 2008 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 other lab scale studies utilized real wastewaters arrojo vd 2004 schwarzenbeck et al 2004a 2004b hailei et al 2006 yilmaz et al 2008 sam and dulekgurgen 2016 cultivation structure and stability problems encountered with aerobic granular sludge when treating real wastewaters were addressed in lab scale reactors de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 and those efforts became the driving force for moving from lab scale to pilot and full scale applications of the ags technology the first pilot scale ags reactor for treating real wastewater was reported in 2003 in ede the netherlands de kreuk 2006 nereda technology is considered the first ags technology applied at full scale giesen et al 2013 however pilot and full scale applications of ags technology for treatment of domestic municipal wastewaters ni et al 2009 liu et al 2010 2011 li et al 2014 pronk et al 2015 derlon et al 2016 and industrial wastewaters wei et al 2012 morales et al 2013 still have issues the issues involved for scaling up ags reactors to treat real wastewaters i long cultivation start up period ii problems in structural and functional stability of the ags and iii possible negative impacts of high suspended solid concentrations on aerobic granulation have not yet been fully resolved during the process of scaling up the ags technology aerobic granular sludge was cultivated in pilot and full scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs treating domestic municipal wastewater and utilizing a wide range of operating strategies ni et al 2009 reported that aerobic granules of 0 2 0 8 mm were dominant after 300 d of operation the volumetric exchange ratio and the settling time were found to be key factors in aerobic granulation with low strength municipal wastewaters another operational strategy combination of short settling time and high food microorganism f m ratio was suggested for rapid cultivation of ags in a pilot scale sbr fed with municipal wastewater in this case the ags was cultivated in 17 d liu et al 2011 while it took 400 d in a previous study by the same researchers liu et al 2010 cultivation and long term operation of ags in pilot and full scale sbrs were reported with non advantageous hydraulic conditions such as low height to diameter h d ratio of the sbr 2 5 and 0 09 respectively and long settling times 20 and 40 min respectively the main factors highlighted as affecting aerobic granulation were the composition of raw wastewater and periodic feast famine operation li et al 2014 in a full scale sbr treating domestic wastewater ags was formed in a reactor with h d ratio 0 19 and simultaneous feeding and effluent withdrawal aerobic granulation took 3 6 months to meet effluent quality standards during the start up period slow settling biomass was selected 15 min of settling time and 3 3 4 m h 1 up flow feeding velocity biomass was removed from the reactor with surplus sludge sludge retention time srt of 20 38 d pronk et al 2015 derlon et al 2016 reported aerobic granulation in an sbr operated at constant volume it was suggested that lowering the wastewater up flow velocity should ensure retention of enough biomass and efficient removal of substrate optimizing granule size distribution for structural and functional stability of aerobic granules presents a significant challenge zhou et al 2016 several strategies have been suggested to enhance the stability of ags increasing hydrodynamic shear stress to suppress the overgrowth of large granules liu and

organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos using an anaerobic static feeding strategy winkler et al 2011 others proposed using structures inside the reactors such as baffles stirring paddles and tubes van baten et al 2003 soos et al 2008 or a funnel shaped steel wire screen zhou et al 2016 utilizing a high olr wang et al 2009 and selective discharge of aging granular sludge zhu et al 2013 the presence of suspended organics or other slowly biodegradable substrate in the influent was mostly investigated in lab scale reactors fed with synthetic wastewater for conventional activated sludge martins et al 2011 biofilm mosquera corral et al 2003 and aerobic granular sludge systems de kreuk et al 2010 in as systems suspended solids led to formation of open fluffy and porous flocs and also reduced excessive outgrowth of filamentous organisms martins et al 2011 in contrast suspended solids in ags systems caused irregular filamentous outgrowth on the granules de kreuk et al 2010 wagner et al 2015 aerobic granular sludge was also cultivated using industrial wastewater containing influent suspended solids in the range 100 1000 mg l 1 ss from sources such as papermakers hailei et al 2006 dairy products pig farms val del río et al 2012 and swine slurry morales et al 2013 livestock othman et al 2013 rubber manufacturers rosman et al 2014 and breweries corsino et al 2017 none of these studies examined in detail the effect of suspended solids on aerobic granular sludge formation structure or performance microbial populations significantly shift during acclimation and granulation phases towards different conditions in the maturation phase abdullah et al 2013 some bacterial species play more important roles in the formation and growth of granular sludge bin et al 2011 therefore the community structure of bacterial populations should be monitored to understand the relationship between the microbial community and the mechanism of aerobic granulation microbial community analyses of aerobic granular sludge for treating synthetic and real wastewater with high suspended solids are still scarce this paper presents the results of long term monitoring of two pilot scale ags sbrs to determine the effect of high suspended solid ss concentrations on cultivation long term stability and structure of aerobic granular sludge for treating real domestic wastewater two pilot scale sbrs fed with raw r1 and settled r2 wastewater were operated in parallel for 500 d raw domestic wastewater with high ss concentration was used to evaluate the impact of ss on aerobic granulation and to compare the case where settled wastewater with lower ss content was used in addition to the analytic measurements used to determine the performance of the reactors comparative

1 pilot scale sbr and operation two pilot scale sbrs fed with raw r1 and settled r2 wastewater were operated in parallel for 500 d the sbrs had a working volume of 28 7 l with internal diameter of 15 4 cm and height of 154 cm h d 10 fig s1 the volumetric exchange ratio was 60 the sbrs were operated automatically by a programmable logic controller plc the total cycle time was 6 h 60 min of anaerobic feeding an aeration period a settling period 3 min of decanting and 7 min idle the settling time was steadily reduced from 15 to 3 min over 14 d and the remaining cycle time was adjusted as an aeration period the minimum settling velocity vs was 18 m h 1 when the settling time was 3 min diffusers placed at the bottom of the reactors with the same cross sectional area as the reactor diameter were used both for feeding and for aeration hence mixing and were controlled with a solenoid valve during the aerobic phase air was supplied at a flow rate of 18 l min 1 resulting in an up flow air velocity of 1 6 cm s 1 dissolved oxygen do concentration typically 0 8 5 mg o2 l 1 and ph 6 5 8 5 were monitored but not controlled the reactors were operated in a temperature controlled room 22 3 c 2 2 wastewater characterization and seed sludge the wastewater used in this study was taken from a manhole shaft on the istanbul university avcilar campus the wastewater originated from the engineering faculty technical sciences high school and the main refectory dining hall the wastewater was pumped to storage tanks after coarse screening the raw wastewater fed to r1 from the first storage tank was mixed to keep the particulate matter in suspension during the feeding phase while the wastewater fed to r2 from the second storage tank was settled at least 2 h to remove all settle able solids all tanks were cleaned before wastewater collection the wastewater was collected three times a week and stored at 4 c characterizations of raw and settled domestic wastewater are summarized in table 1 the cod concentration for high strength domestic wastewater is 1200 mg l 1 and the concentrations of ss for high and medium strength domestic wastewaters are 350 and 220 mg l 1 respectively metcalf eddy 1991 accordingly the raw domestic wastewater was classified as high strength domestic wastewater in terms of its cod content however the ss content was significantly higher 700 310 mg l 1 than that of a high strength domestic wastewater the settled domestic wastewater presented the characteristics of a medium strength domestic wastewater in terms of its ss content 200 65 mg l 1 micrographs of the raw and settled wastewater are shown in fig s2 the raw wastewater contained much more and larger suspended solids 220 130 μm than the settled wastewater 60 40 μm significant biodiversity was not observed in either of the wastewaters possibly due to the short time of retention in the sewage system the seed sludge was obtained from a full scale wastewater treatment plant in istanbul and acclimated to real domestic wastewater for 3 weeks the mlss concentration mlvss mlss ratio and svi of the seed sludge were 6 4 g l 1 0 39 and 185 ml g 1 respectively the acclimated seed sludge had 5 75 g l 1 of mlss 0 71 mlvss mlss ratio and 40 ml g 1 of svi the srt selected was 10 d during the acclimation period 2 3 eps extraction and analysis the extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted using the method proposed by frølund et al 1996 at the end of the aeration phase a mixed liquor sample was collected from the reactor the supernatant harvested from the first centrifuge of the sample was decanted and considered to represent the soluble microbial product of the sample smp the pellet was re suspended in phosphate buffered saline pbs and eps was extracted using dowex cation exchange resin 0 5 g mlvss extracted using 35 g dowex the extraction was carried out in the dark on ice for 4 h and using a magnetic stirrer set at 750 r m 1 the protein content pn of the extracted eps was determined using the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin bsa as the standard walker 1996 the polysaccharide content ps of the extracted eps was measured using the dubois method with alginic acid as the standard dubois et al 1956 2 4 particle size measurements and macro structural properties of the biomass mixed liquor samples were collected from both reactors once in two weeks and transferred to the lab freshly for analyses both the original samples and those with flocculants removed were transferred to petri dishes and the samples were examined using a stereomicroscope mikrosistem turkey a minimum of 10 representative images captured by a digital camera kameram 318cu turkey mounted on the microscope were recorded for each sample the digital images were then processed using image analysis ia software imagepro plus v4 0 media cybernetics to determine the mean granule diameter mean of values recorded at 1 steps over 360 the average dgra value for each biomass sample was determined as the arithmetic average of the mean diameters of all granules in all digital images processed for a biomass sample dulekgurgen et al 2008 using the ia software the roundness aspect ratio of each granule was determined as the ratio between the minimum and maximum ferret or the ratio between the minor and major axis of ellipse equivalent to an object similarly the smoothness shape factor or capriciousness of each granule was calculated as 4 π area perimeter2 where perimeter was the length of the granule outline average values of roundness and smoothness for each biomass sample collected on a particular day were then calculated in ways similar to that of average dgra 2 5 microbiological examinations and monitoring of aerobic granular sludge mixed liquor samples were collected from both reactors on a weekly basis for microscopic examination and monitoring which lasted for 500 days after sampling the original samples were examined with bright field and phase contrast microscopy by preparing wet mounts using 0 5 ml of activated sludge on a glass slide air dried smear samples were also prepared for gram staining the gram staining method applied was according to the modifications of jenkins et al 1993 the wet mount slides were examined using 40 100 200 and 400 magnifications of phase contrast and bright field microscope fields the gram stained slides were examined with a bright field microscope at 40 100 200 400 and 1000 magnifications the microscopic analyses were performed using an olympus bx50 model research microscope with attachments for bright field and phase contrast microscopy photomicrographs of the granules and mix culture activated sludge microorganisms were taken using a digital camera cameram 3 mikrosistem turkey mounted on the microscope then recorded and processed using available ia software spot analysis programme mikrosistem turkey calibrations of the measurements were done using an ocular and objective micrometre the filamentous bacteria were identified using schemes pictures and microbiological characteristics defined by jenkins et al 1993 and eikelboom 2000 macro structures of the activated sludge flocs were interpreted according to sezgin et al 1978 2 6 microbial community analyses 2 6 1 dna extraction and real time pcr nucleic acids were extracted in triplicate from the granular sludge samples taken at

v3 reagent kits were used for the runs each run included a minimum of 5 phix that served as an internal control the raw sequence data concatenated forward and reverse sequence reads were cleaned reduced and analysed using mothur version 1 36 1 schloss et al 2009 firstly the barcode and the primer sequences were trimmed and then unique sequences were identified the trimmed unique sequences

sludge volume index svi30 in accordance with standard methods apha 1995 in addition to using the microscopic data and the ia software to determine granule size as described above particle size during the start up period was measured directly using a laser particle size analysis system mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments uk when the size of the sludge particles was in the range 0 02 2000 μm during the first 200 d scanning electron microscopy sem philips xl30 esem was employed to visualize the micro scale structure of the aerobic granules energy dispersive x ray edx analysis was used to obtain quantitative analysis of the granule surfaces for that granules were dehydrated in successive 25 50 75 80 90 and 100 ethanol baths and dried in dust free air samples were covered with platinum before the analyses 3 results 3 1 cultivation of aerobic granular sludge the strategies of high olr and short settling time or high settling velocity were found to be the main factors for rapid cultivation of ags liu et al 2011 in our systems the olr was 2 4 0 6 kg cod m3 day for r1 and 2 1 0 3 kg cod m3 day for r2 during the cultivation period therefore the olr in our study was favourable for the rapid cultivation of ags in addition to high olr a short settling time was also selected for rapid cultivation the settling time was shortened from 15 to 3 min during the first 14 d of operation the settling time was reduced to 10 min at the end of the first day of operation the mlss concentration in r2 decreased from 2900 to 2580 mg l 1 whereas it slightly increased from 3000 to 3160 mg l 1 in r1 this was probably due to the high ss concentration and good settling properties of the solids fig 1 further decrease in the settling time of 5 min on day 3 caused a decline in the mlss concentration in both reactors to 2160 mg l 1 in r1 and to 1560 mg l 1 in r2 after the first decrease in the mlss concentrations at the settling time of 5 min the mlss concentrations slightly decreased in both reactors without any further reduction of settling time until day 11 the settling time decreased to 3 min on day 14 then the mlss concentrations in r1 and r2 declined to 1000 and 400 mg l 1 respectively the higher mlss concentration in r1 on day 14 could have resulted from the high ss concentration of the wastewater irregular biofilm structures zoogleal matrices in the flocculants fig s3a were observed when the mlss concentrations reached minimal values then zoogleal out growth was observed on the surfaces of the granular sludge obtained fig s3b the svi30 values in both reactors simultaneously increased from about 60 to 170 ml g 1 the svi30 values decreased and the mlss concentration increased when the first aerobic granular sludge was obtained the concentration of mlss in r2 sharply increased to 4000 mg l 1 while the concentration of mlss in r1 slowly increased to reach 2500 mg l 1 during the cultivation period the difference between the mlss concentrations originated from the mean granule size and the granule size distribution fig 1e f g and h an increase in the mlss concentration in r2 was observed with increase in the mean granule size while a slow increase in the mean granule size in r1 reflected a lower increase in the mlss concentration the mlvss mlss ratio in r2 was more stable than that in r1 and reached 90 when the mlss concentration increased but the ratio in r1 varied between 75 and 85 fig 1a and b a high influent ss concentration fig 1c in the raw wastewater caused a lower and fluctuating mlvss mlss ratio in r1 during the cultivation period the effluent ss concentrations in r1 and r2 increased with decrease in the settling time and also with increase in the influent ss concentration fig 1 c and d morales et al 2013 the influent ss concentration in r1 was 795 250 mg l 1 whereas the average in r2 was 290 98 mg l 1 during the cultivation period the effluent ss concentration averaged 910 280 mg l 1 in r1 and 500 180 mg l 1 in r2 fig 1 c and d the percentage volume of sludge particles of 200 μm svp sb200 liu et al 2010 and the svi30 svi5 ratio schwarzenbeck et al 2005 are good indicators of granulation it is assumed that granular sludge is the dominant form of reactor sludge when svp sb200 is below 50 and the svi30 svi5 ratio is 90 100 liu et al 2010 the granulation was firstly obtained in r2 on day 25 the granule mean size and svi30 svi5 ratio in r2 improved to 900 μm and 90 on day 25 fig 1 f the svi30 svi5 ratio was stable and 90 after day 25 the svp sb200 was 12 fig 1 h and 50 of the granules was in the range 600 1200 μm when granulation was obtained the mean granule size decreased to 615 μm between day 39 and 60 and the sludge volume percentages reflected decrease in the mean granule size fig 1 f and h the granulation in r1 was achieved on day 44 when the svp sb200 was 43 fig 1 g the granule mean size reached 600 μm but the svi30 svi5 ratio fluctuated from 70 to 90 fig 1 e svi30 in r1 firstly decreased to 25 ml g 1 and then reached 44 ml g 1 at the end of the cultivation period the lowest svi30 in r2 was 40 ml g 1 which later reached 52 ml g 1 interestingly svi30 in r1 was better than that in r2 during the cultivation period at the end of the cultivation period the svp sb200 in r2 was 23 whereas it was 37 in r1 3 2 long term operation of aerobic granular sludge reactors after the cultivation period the reactors were operated for 440 d the concentrations of mlss influent and effluent ss mlvss mlss ratio svi30 and the svi30 svi5 ratio in both reactors were monitored to evaluate the stability of aerobic granular sludge during long term operation fig 2 the concentration of mlss in r1 generally fluctuated more than that in r2 during the long term operation the mlss concentration in r1 varied from 550 to 9500 mg l 1 average 5350 2650 mg l 1 between day 210 and 350 decrease in the mlss concentration was observed from 8000 to 550 mg l 1 in 30 d but then increased again to 9500 mg l 1 in the following 30 d fig 2a the high fluctuation in the mlss concentration in r1 was attributed to the high influent ss concentration which varied from 200 to 1600 mg l 1 average 710 345 mg l 1 while the effluent ss concentration was 530 270 mg l 1 fig 2c the mlss concentration in r2 was more stable 3350 1250 mg l 1 fig 2b during this period the influent and effluent concentrations in r2 fluctuated less 200 55 mg l 1 and 310 150 mg l 1 respectively as is well known the mlss concentrations in ags reactors operated in fill and draw batch mode are dynamic because the srt is not adjusted the srt in our reactors was not adjusted but was controlled by the influent and effluent ss and biological growth in the reactor the srt in r1 in days 200 350 and days 350 500 were 6 5 5 d and 6 5 3 d respectively the srt in r2 in these two periods was 5 2 5 d and 15 5 d respectively therefore within the period from day 350 until the end of the study the mlss concentration in r1 fluctuated less whereas it gradually increased in r2 discussed in sections 3 6 and 4 3 the mlss concentrations in both reactors reached the maximum and average values of 14 000 and 8000 3000 mg l 1 respectively in this period the concentrations of the influent and effluent ss in both reactors remained similar to those in the previous period the mlvss mlss ratios in both reactors were 90 after day 200 svi30 and the svi30 svi5 ratio fluctuated in both reactors before day 350 fig 2 e and f svi30 decreased to 32 10 ml g 1 in r1 and 38 10 ml g 1 in r2 during the last period of granulation between day 350 and 500 the svi30 svi5 ratio stabilized at 100 after day 300 in both reactors the composition protein pn and polysaccharide ps of eps and smp in both reactors are given in fig s4 a and b biomass associated eps pn and ps values were similar in both reactors and fluctuated during the entire study it was clearly recorded that the eps pn concentration in both reactors were much lower than those of eps ps these results contradict some others reported in the ags literature mcswain et al 2005 dulekgurgen et al 2008 martins et al 2011 wang et al 2014 the amount of eps pn was 11 2 10 6 mg g 1 mlvss in r1 and 10 8 9 2 mg g 1 mlvss in r2 while the amounts of eps ps were one order of magnitude higher than those of eps pn 224 93 mg g 1 mlvss in r1 and 252 101 mg g 1 mlvss in r2 the concentrations of smp ps from both reactors were comparable 43 18 mg l 1 likewise those of smp pn were also at similar levels in both reactors 7 5 6 5 mg l 1 3 3 macro structural properties of aerobic granular sludge micrographs of mixed liquor biomass samples exhibiting the temporal changes in overall view and the macro structure of the aerobic granular sludge present in both reactors between day 210 and 500 are given in fig s5 and s6 the mature granules displayed a layered internal structure growing from a denser core to a less dense surface in addition to the granular biomass dominating both systems between day 210 and 500 some flocculent biomass as well as amorphous biomass patches and biofilm structures were also observed in both reactors fig s5 and s6 those amorphous structures resulting from detachment from granule surface due to mechanical and or microbial factors like sloughing abrasion grazing predation etc and or from granule disintegration due to weakening of a mature granule s interior caused by i e substrate oxygen limitation endogenous respiration death etc were considered acting as biomass pieces supporting formation of new granules in a cyclic fashion with a frequency of 1 1 5 months the sbrs were fed with real wastewater containing medium r2 or high r1 level of suspended solids accordingly some particulate matter originating from raw and settled wastewater was detected on the surface of some granules in both systems i e fig s5 and s6 days 283 357 428 in previously reported cases for granular sludge fed with effluents containing particulate matter schwarzenbeck et al 2004a de kreuk et al 2010 finger like macro structures growing on the granule surface were reported to disturb the structural stability of the granular biomass this was not observed in this study during the long term operation of the reactors even in r1 fed with raw wastewater containing high ss the progress of biomass development between day 210 and 500 and comparative results of the macro structural properties of the ags minimum maximum and average granule diameter roundness smoothness is summarized in fig 3 in general the changes in the macro structural properties of the ags in both systems can be evaluated in two distinct periods i a fluctuation period of 5 months between day 210 and 350 followed by ii a stable period of another 5 months between day 350 and 500 between day 210 and 350 the roundness values were relatively stable with comparable average values of 0 66 and 0 62 in r1 and r2 respectively whereas considerable fluctuations in granule size and surface smoothness were observed in both systems fig 3 the mean granule diameter in r1 varied between 1 31 0 07 mm and 2 87 0 25 mm and that in r2 between 0 90 0 03 mm and 2 16 0 41 mm corresponding average granule size aver dgra was 2 71 0 21 mm and 1 79 0 32 mm respectively the average smoothness was 0 61 for r1 and 0 50 for r2 during that period while the surface smoothness of granules in r1 fluctuated within a wide range between 0 44 0 12 and 0 74 0 04 values for r2 varied less between 0 43 0 09 and 0 57 0 05 but were lower in general fig 3 in contrast to those variations recorded between day 210 and 350 all three parameters exhibited flattened trends during the following 5 months of operation between day 350 and 500 which indicated that the ags in both systems became stable in terms of macro structural properties the roundness values were stable as before within a narrow range between 0 6 and 0 7 and with an average 0 66 for both systems fig 3 this implies that the systems were dominated by elliptical mature granules as was also apparent visually fig s5 and s6 moreover the wide oscillations in surface smoothness observed in r1 during the previous 5 months diminished and also the considerably low values recorded for r2 improved significantly at around day 350 during the following 5 months the smoothness of the granules in both systems exhibited minimal variation and were stable at almost the same average value 0 71 and 0 72 for r1 and r2 respectively while the ags in two systems exhibited the same properties in terms of roundness mostly elliptical granules and capriciousness smooth granule surface between day 350 and 500 there was a clear difference in the size of stable mature granules obtained with different wastewaters mature stable granules fed with raw wastewater were smaller than those fed with settled effluent fig s5 and s6 for the stable period last 5 months the average granule size of the ags fed with raw wastewater r1 was 1 49 0 11 mm and that fed with settled effluent r2 was 2 00 0 24 mm fig 3 comparing the macro structural properties of the biomass during the fluctuation and stable periods there was a 46 decrease in average granule size no change in roundness and 14 improvement in the surface smoothness of the granules obtained in r1 the aerobic granules in r2 got 10 bigger and both the roundness and smoothness of the granules improved significantly 8 2 and 30 respectively 3 4 microscopic investigations and monitoring monitoring of reactors treating raw wastewater and settled wastewater and microscopic examination of weekly samples was performed from the acclimation period throughout 500 d of treatment operation fig 4 in general microscopic examination indicated that the overall microbiological diversity of the reactors did not change dramatically regarding eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells the main difference in the results from comparison of the microbial biodiversity in the reactors was that there were many more eukaryotic species in the bulk solution of the r1 system other minor differences involved populations of filamentous microorganisms in the bulk solution and that some granules floc structure changed when they got 3 5 mm the nematodes and rotifers present also grew larger rotifers usually prefer to grow under stable steady state activated sludge conditions thus they were found in low numbers because they do not survive well in very harsh oxygenated agitated and turbulent systems nematodes appeared in all samples because the fresh domestic wastewater provided high organic content and because they can survive in mixing environments both reactors were mixed and aerated granulated sludge systems but the r1 reactor had larger numbers of attached stalked ciliated protozoa epistylis spp with colonies of 20 100 individuals on flocs and granules fig 4 photomicrographs 1 2 some other organisms ciliated protozoa paramecium spp chilodonella spp colpidium spp lionotus spp flagellated protozoa aspidisca spp monosiga spp and bodo spp stalked protozoa vorticella spp and epistylis spp nematodes ascaridia spp and rotifers philodina spp were observed during operation of the reactors the microbial diversity of both reactors was very rich and included flagellated ciliated and stalked protozoa gram negative and positive bacteria filamentous microorganisms both bacterial and fungal species and nematodes and rotifers in almost every sample examined the floc forming bacterial species zoogloea ramigera produced larger macro structures granules during the treatment period which included some gram negative and positive bacteria inside the floc matrix and filamentous microorganisms in and around the flocs granules these formed macro structures as described by sezgin et al 1978 and as seen in fig 4 photomicrographs 3 4 in both reactors flocs before granulation were enlarged during the acclimation period and had intricate shapes and wavy borders usually covered by filamentous microorganisms fig 4 photomicrographs 3 4 the fungi present grew in very long large filaments these were usually dominated by rhizopus spp which do not have septa and aspergillus spp which have identifier septa and food cells that produce hypha and spores fig s8 photomicrographs 1 2 r2 fed with settled wastewater had better rounded more uniform and smoother flocs and granules fig 4 photomicrographs 5 6 compared to the r1 flocs and granules filamentous bacterial species predominantly nostocoida limicola ii and sphaerotilus natans found with 10 filaments per floc and others type 0041 bacillus spp beggiatoa spp thiothrix spp and type 0092 found irregularly and usually 5 filaments per floc have been observed in high and low numbers depending on changing and fluctuating operational and wastewater characteristics throughout the time of operation fig s8 photomicrographs 3 6 some filamentous species for example sphaerotilus natans and nostocoida limicola ii were usually found in the bulk solution while others for example bacillus spp type 0041 and type 0092 were present within the floc structures with species of individual bacteria these filamentous species did not grow very well or reach high numbers in the systems because of the high dissolved oxygen concentration 5 mg l 1 short hydraulic retention time 10 h and harsh physical and environmental conditions even so they were at least able to survive under these conditions operational factors and wastewater characteristics i e sludge age loading rate f m ratio ph and nutrients likely affected species diversity and the amount of filamentous microorganisms healthy conventional granules were up to 3 4 mm diameter and this structure was protected by a matrix formed by the floc maker zoogloea ramigera if granules reached 5 mm or larger they fragmented into smaller pieces because after anaerobic conditions occurred in the centre of a granule not enough dissolved oxygen could penetrate the interior of the larger granules to prevent the resulting anaerobic micro aerophilic condition fig 4 photomicrographs 6 a well developed mature floc or granule was usually filled with bacterial species of similar morphological shape maybe a single bacterial species as seen in fig 4 photomicrographs 3 and 4 and fig s8 photomicrographs 4 and 5 within the zoogleal matrix which served as an aggregator for microorganisms this may be important in treatment performance for specific types of wastewater if these types create different special environments within the granules 3 5 micro structural properties of aerobic granular sludge micro structure studies using sem edx analysis in both reactors during the entire study were performed to evaluate the surface characteristics of mature granular sludge including such as the chemical precipitates and adsorbed particulate matter on the granule surfaces fig 5 these structures were similar in both reactors fig 5a shows a general view of a crushed granule of mature sludge and fig 5b and c presents the images of the inside of the crushed part and outside of this granule the bacterial community and its organization inside the granule can be clearly seen in fig 5b while the outside of the granule is smooth and covered with filamentous bacteria fig 5d and e exhibit other sections of the sludge granule filamentous fungi rhizopus and aspergillus were observed in both reactors during the entire study fig s8 photomicrographs 1 and 2 therefore it was thought that the structures observed on the surfaces of the granules were the hyphae of fungi fig 5d in fact hyphae penetrated the inner part of granules from the surface fig 5e the sem edx analysis of all sections mentioned above demonstrated that the granules in both reactors and also the inside and outside of the granules had similar chemical compositions the sem edx analysis of the granule in fig 5c gives the weight percentage wt of c n o and p 55 67 6 17 12 6 and 2 92 wt respectively the other elements were less than 0 8 wt except for pt because of the platinum coating used to prepare for sem the sem edx mapping also shows the result of this analysis in fig s9 besides the biodiversity of the granules some chemical precipitants were detected on the surface and gutter of sludge granules fig 5 f g h i and j both sem edx analysis and mapping of the section in fig 5f proved that the chemical precipitates consisted of mg p and o the sem edx mapping fairly illustrated the borders of the chemical precipitates as shown in fig s10 another mg precipitate is presented in fig 5g mg p and o was 14 12 25 56 and 22 92 wt respectively fig 5h shows chemical precipitates containing ca p and o with 16 02 15 33 and 21 93 wt respectively in addition to the mg and ca precipitates si and al precipitates or entrapped adsorbed particles were also observed on the surface of sludge granules fig 5i illustrates the aggregation of entrapped adsorbed particles containing si and al 31 22 and 10 66 wt whereas fig 5j shows al particles 46 74 wt with minimal si 0 1 wt 3 6 performance and microbial community of aerobic granular sludge the cod removal efficiencies were almost identical in both reactors 89 5 the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and po4 3 p varied randomly in both reactors the average removal efficiency of nh4 n in r1 was 60 18 whereas it was 55 22 in r2 the real time pcr results showed that the percentage of aob species to total bacteria in both reactors was lower than 0 10 during the entire study 0 16 in the seed sludge nitrobacter sp was negligible in all samples 1000 yilmaz et al 2017 the percentage of nitrospira sp to total bacteria in both reactors was 0 10 except on a few sampling days the nox n production in both reactors was also negligible therefore it can be said that nitrogen removal occurred mainly due to biological growth the average removal efficiencies of po4 3 p in r1 and r2 were 76 22 and 69 21 respectively unlike for nitrogen removal phosphorus removal was influenced by enhanced biological phosphorus removal mechanisms other than biological growth accumulibacteria were negligible before the stable period 0 9 in the seed sludge they increased during the stable period and reached 4 5 of total bacteria in both reactors actinobacteria were 1 5 2 5 in r2 on day 250 and 310 but were 1 of total bacteria in both reactors the structure of the microbial community was monitored using hrm and ngs analyses the hrm profiles and their cluster analysis for r1 are shown in fig s11 and fig s12 respectively as seen in fig s12 the seed sludge microbial community changed over time and there are three major clusters group 1 on day 457 group 2 on day 336 and group 3 on other days the variance eigenvalue associated with a principal component versus the number of the component was plotted to judge the relative magnitude of the eigenvalues the first principal components pc1s for the microbial hrm profiles had the eigenvalue 43 629 which accounted for 92 8 of the total variance table s1 in other words most of the hrm fingerprinting data was captured in pc1 pc1 was correlated to other variables namely all bacteria aob aoa nitrospira sp accumulibacteria actinobacteria srt mlss influent and effluent ss olr removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p for determination of the factors that affect the microbial community structure table s2 there was a statistically significant correlation between the microbial community profiles and the srt 79 and aoa 76 but only a medium correlation was observed with the mlss concentration 56 genomic dna of each cluster was pooled and subjected to 16s rrna targeted ngs the detected species with abundance is over 1 are given in table s3 where a difference 10 was detected for zoogloea spp uncultured candidatus competibacter sp and brachymonas chironomi in other words the longer the srt was the higher the abundance of aoa and the shorter the srt was the lower the abundance of aoa moreover higher mlss concentrations favoured retention of uncultured candidatus competibacter sp in the sludge and lower mlss concentrations favoured the retention of zoogloea spp and brachymonas chironomi in the sludge the hrm profiles and their cluster analysis in r2 are shown in fig s13 and fig s14 respectively as seen in fig s14 there are two major clusters the microbial community profile of the reactor between day 380 and 478 was distinct from the other operation days the first principal components pc1s for the microbial hrm profiles have the eigenvalue of 55 587 which accounted for 94 8 of the total variance in other words most of the hrm fingerprinting data was captured in pc1 table s4 pc1 was correlated to the other variables for determination of the factors that affect the microbial community structures table s5 there was statistically significant correlation between the microbial community profiles and the srt 85 on the other hand the nh4 n removal efficiency olr mlss and accumulibacteria had medium correlations with microbial community profiles in the range 60 65 genomic dna of each cluster was pooled and subjected to 16s rrna targeted ngs the detected species with abundance 1 are given in table s6 as given in table s6 a difference 5 was detected for uncultured candidatus competibacter sp in other words the higher srt olr mlss concentrations and higher abundance of accumulibacteria favoured retention of uncultured candidatus competibacter sp in the sludge whereas the nh4 n removal efficiency decreased with increase in uncultured candidatus competibacter sp figs 6 and 7 illustrate the members of the microbial community making up 2 of the total bacterial abundance in r1 and r2 respectively during the entire study the microbial community in r1 exhibited high diversity except on day 336 and substantially shifted on day 336 and day 457 in the majority of samples brachymonas chironomi and flavobacterium cheniae species were predominant with 11 and 9 of the total bacteria respectively fig 6a zoogloea spp was dominant 52 on day 336 fig 6b and uncultured candidatus competibacter sp was dominant 35 on day 457 in r1 fig 6c the microbial community could also be divided into two distinctive periods fluctuation and stable as defined previously the microbial community diversities in both reactors were almost identical during the fluctuation period figs 6a and 7a and also had similarities during the stable period in r2 fig 7b the most striking difference between the fluctuation period and the stable period in r2 was that uncultured candidatus competibacter sp increased from 2 to 9 the abundance of the other species in r2 remained similar during both periods fig 7 a and b the structure of the microbial community in both reactors was found to be closely related to the srt and also to the mlss concentration in both reactors the mlss concentration in r1 was stable and reached 13 0 8 g l 1 during one month before the sampling day day 457 when the srt was 11 1 d it should be mentioned that the olr in r1 during this period was also higher 3 3 0 3 kg cod m3 day than that on other operation days 2 5 0 5 kg cod m3 day on the other hand the mlss concentration in r2 steadily increased while the srt and olr were 15 5 d and 2 2 0 6 kg cod m3 day respectively during the stable period the srt in r1 and r2 during the fluctuation period was about 6 5 5 and 5 5 2 5 d respectively therefore it could be said that the high srt probably affected by the high olr encouraged the abundance of uncultured candidatus competibacter sp because the influent ss concentration in r1 was also in the same range on the other operation days the high olr in r1 during this period may also explain the higher abundance of uncultured candidatus competibacter sp 35 when compared with r2 9 4 discussion 4 1 effect of high suspended solid concentration on cultivation and long term operation of aerobic granular sludge the aerobic granular sludge was successfully cultivated within a short period in two pilot scale reactors one fed with raw r1 and one with settled r2 domestic wastewater when the cultivation strategies selected were short settling time high settling velocity and high olr these choices were in line with the results obtained in previous studies liu et al 2011 wagner et al 2015 aerobic granular sludge formed on day 25 in r2 and on day 44 in r1 liu et al 2011 reported granulation in 17 d with similar cultivation strategies using municipal wastewater the concentration of influent ss however was not mentioned in their study in a subsequent study the presence of particulate organic matter in the synthetic wastewater was demonstrated to reduce the kinetics of granule formation wagner et al 2015 the influent ss in the current study comprised particulate organic matter influent vss and inert suspended solids 15 of influent ss moreover the particulate organic matter included some other organics e g cellulose fibres results from study presented above show that ags can be cultivated using real domestic wastewater including suspended solids even at high concentrations up to an average of 800 mg l 1 in our study pilot scale reactors treating real domestic wastewater with high ss concentration were operated for 500 d and the ags in both reactors was fairly stable over the last 5 months of operation as expressed by the svi30 the svi30 svi5 ratio and the average granule size the svi30 was 40 ml g 1 and the svi30 svi5 ratio of 100 obtained in both reactors was quite comparable with that reported by other researchers for granular sludge used treating municipal wastewater ni et al 2009 liu et al 2011 giesen et al 2013 in the ags literature different values have been reported for mature granule size from 0 6 to 1 9 mm during stable and or long term operation chen et al 2011 chou et al 2011 huang et al 2011 verawaty et al 2013 derlon et al 2016 ni et al 2009 successfully cultivated ags on low strength municipal wastewater 200 mg cod l 1 in an aerobic pilot scale sbr by increasing the volumetric exchange rate 75 primarily to elevate the olr which also resulted in a higher settling velocity thus increased hydraulic selection in favour of fast settling bio particles the size range of mature granules was between 0 2 and 0 8 mm and the average granule size stabilized at around 0 45 mm in their long term study to test the effect of influent up flow velocity on ags formation and treatment performance in a 190 l sbr receiving real and low strength municipal wastewater 304 mg cod l 1 derlon et al 2016 showed that when the system was anaerobically fed from the bottom at a high velocity 12 5 16 m h 1 the ags formed in the system was comprised of bigger granules d 0 63 mm but filamentous out growths were detected on the surface of the granules whereas the granules were smaller 0 25 d 0 63 mm when the feeding up flow velocity was as low as 1 m h 1 and granulation was supported also by selective anaerobic carbon utilization due to anaerobic slow feeding and selective sludge withdrawal strategies various factors including but not limited to increase in mass transfer resistance depletion of substrates before reaching the core of a granule formation of anaerobic zones and loss of viability at the granule centre resulting in weakening of the granule interior and increased susceptibility to disintegration have been considered as disturbing the structural stability of ags verawaty et al 2013 proposed the concept of critical granule size towards which aerobic granules tend to equilibrate to through the balance between granule growth and breakage influenced by operational process conditions i e wastewater characteristics settling velocity shear forces feeding and aeration phases etc they tested their hypothesis by operating several sbrs in parallel fed with abattoir wastewater and seeding those with granules at different sizes 0 425 0 900 1 125 mm or a mixture of those they reported that after 50 days of operation and reaching steady state the size of granules in all sbrs except that started up by the small granules equilibrated to approximately the same size of 0 6 0 8 mm and referred that size as the critical granule size characteristic for their experimental set up and operation long term monitoring and data from the final stable operational period in both reactors in the current study showed that the average size of the mature granules treating raw wastewater r1 stabilized at 1 50 mm and that treating settled wastewater r2 at 2 00 mm these values are higher in general than those reported in the ags literature for granular sludge cultivated on low strength domestic wastewater relatively high cod of the raw and settled wastewater and the high olr applied in the current study are considered as the main factors for that difference moreover the mature stable granules of the ags cultivated in and treating raw wastewater with significantly high ss content were 25 smaller than those cultivated in and treating the settled effluent with lower ss this indicates the impact of the influent ss concentration on the ags structure zhou et al 2016 accordingly it can be concluded that the ss content of the influent has an impact on the granule structure and in particular on the granule size of ags systems specifically the higher the influent ss content is the smaller the stable mature granules are in the ags system suspended solids in the effluent can originate from detached biomass and suspended solids in the influent not removed by settling or entrapment absorption and from biodegradation pronk et al 2015 the effluent ss concentration 590 235 mg l 1 in r1 was lower than the influent ss concentration 650 305 mg l 1 while the effluent ss concentration 305 135 mg l 1 in r2 was higher than the influent ss 225 60 mg l 1 during the stable period this can be explained by some part of the influent ss being entrapped on the granules where they were then degraded pronk et al 2015 and settled inside the reactor this was because the mean size of influent ss in r1 was as large as 220 130 μm on the other hand the detached biomass and influent ss increased the effluent ss concentration in r2 because the mean size of the influent ss 60 40 μm in r2 was lower than the self settling size 100 μm apparently in both cases a post treatment option was required to remove the ss in the effluent to meet the relevant discharge standards as an alternative an external membrane reactor was tested for that purpose but those results were not presented because they are outside the scope of the current study 4 2 effect of high suspended solid concentration on macro and micro structural properties of aerobic granular sludge zoogloea spp may play an important role in floc formation providing an eps matrix around which the floc forms seviour et al 2010 zoogloea ramigera was frequently observed during the entire study and the zoogleal matrix incorporated filamentous and non filamentous bacteria fig 4 photomicrographs 3 4 and fig s8 photomicrographs 4 6 previous research demonstrated that particulate organic substrates result in formation of open flocs martins et al 2011 this is in line with the results obtained in the current study when an open floc containing zoogleal matrix was observed at the beginning of the cultivation period due probably to the presence of suspended solids in the influent and application of high olr those open flocs transformed to granular sludge when short settling time was applied from the first to mature granular sludge the granules were round elliptical the granule surface was smooth and filamentous out growths extending from the granules were not observed however previous studies reported filamentous out growth from the surface of the granular sludge fed with both synthetic and real wastewater containing particulate matter de kreuk et al 2010 wagner et al 2015 therefore different from some previous studies our study reveals that suspended solids in the influent do not necessarily cause formation of filamentous out growths over the long run the eps ps produced in both reactors 240 mg g 1 mlvss was more than that reported in some studies with similar extraction and measurement methods but different reference carbohydrates frølund et al 1996 mcswain et al 2005 dulekgurgen et al 2008 our result was closer to the values reported in other studies in which different and more selective for exops extraction methods were employed lin et al 2010 seviour et al 2012 high eps content and in particular high ps which was recorded in both systems in the current study was considered a positive factor for improving granule structural properties i e roundness and smoothness some precipitates of ca 2 and mg 2 were previously observed in the granules of ags systems jiang et al 2003 huang et al 2012 in this study these kinds of precipitates were also found although particles entrapped in the granular structures were mentioned by pronk et al 2015 these particles were not analysed in our study al and si particles on the surface of granular sludge were clearly observed and analysed using sem edx analysis these entrapped adsorbed particles containing si and al may originate from the raw domestic wastewater this could explain why svi30 in the reactor fed with raw wastewater r1 was lower than that in the reactor r2 fed with settled wastewater 4 3 effect of high suspended solid concentration on performance and microbial community previous research reports show that the specific retention time of individual microbial populations plays an important role in determining the aerobic granular structure the srt of populations nitrifiers found on the exterior of granules would be shorter than the srt for populations paos gaos and archaea in the interior in contrast the total srt of the granular sludge would be equal to the srt of individual populations when granular sludge breakage or disintegration occurred winkler et al 2012 these results are in line with our results that the population of uncultured candidatus competibacter sp gaos increased with increase in the total srt of granular sludge in both reactors the aoa population in both reactors increased during the stable period and reached as high as 13 103 in r1 on day 457 when the population of uncultured candidatus competibacter sp was highest on the other hand the removal efficiency of nh4 n in connection with the population of aob decreased because the population of aob located on the exterior of granules detached due to the high concentration of influent ss as previously mentioned the other interesting result was that zoogloea spp became dominant 52 after breakup of the granular sludge and the microbial diversity diminished as seen in fig s5 and s6 on day 331 almost all granular sludge was damaged in both reactors the abundance of zoogloea spp in r1 on day 336 can be explained by zoogleal out growth on the surfaces of the granular sludge as previously mentioned in cultivation period fig s3b and in sections 3 6 and 4 2 higher olr in r1 may have affected the higher amount of zoogloea spp compared with r2 on the other hand the effect of high ss on zoogleal out growth in granular sludge systems after breakup is still unclear additionally the results show that zoogleal out growth was observed during the cultivation period and after breakup of granular sludge whereas microbial community shifted to gao population under the operation conditions applied during the stable period the anaerobic feeding strategy encourages the populations of paos and gaos which store available organic carbon during feeding period therefore paos and gaos gain a competitive advantage over floc forming organisms and filamentous bacteria liu and liu 2006 bassin et al 2011 the main factors affecting the pao gao competition have found as cod p ratio carbon source ph and temperature oehmen et al 2007 the microbial community in both reactors was dominated by gaos during the stable period in our study since the cod p ratios in raw and settled wastewater were 80 mg cod mg p a ratio higher than 50 mg cod mg p reported in the literature as favouring the gaos over paos oehmen et al 2007 in addition to the high cod p ratio the increased olr in r1 between day 425 and 457 may have further increased the amount of gaos particularly in that system up to 35 5 conclusions aerobic granular sludge ags was cultivated successfully in two pilot scale reactors and in two kinds of real domestic wastewater raw wastewater with high ss content and settled effluent including medium ss content high settling velocity and high organic loading rate were the main operational strategies for successful ags cultivation both sbrs were operated successfully and monitored for a long period 500 days the high ss concentration in the raw domestic wastewater did not have a pronounced effect on the cultivation time of ags when compared to the case with medium ss concentration but influenced the size of mature granules during stable reactor operation higher influent ss content resulted in smaller stable mature granules in the reactor treating raw domestic wastewater the ags maintained in both systems were stable in terms of macro structural properties during the last 5 months of reactor operation this implies that the presence of particulate organic matter in the influent does not necessarily deteriorate the structural stability of ags systems in the long run moreover the settling properties of the mature ags fed with raw wastewater were better than that fed with the settled effluent on the other hand it should be taken into account that high influent ss concentration affected the detachment of biomass from the granular sludge surfaces resulting in wash out of certain bacterial populations from the exterior of the granular sludge characterization long term monitoring microscopic observations and microbial community analyses helped monitor and understand the behaviour of the operated ags systems acknowledgement this work was funded by the scientific and technological research council of turkey tubitak project no 111y036 appendix a supplementary data the following is the

19772,the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of high influent concentration suspended solids ss on the cultivation structure and long term stability of aerobic granular sludge ags cultivation and long term stability of ags were monitored in two pilot scale sequencing batch reactors fed with raw r1 and settled r2 domestic wastewater representing high and medium ss content respectively the real domestic wastewater had high chemical oxygen demand cod content 1100 270 mg cod l 1 aerobic granular sludge was cultivated in 44 days r1 and 25 days r2 under the conditions of high settling velocity 18 m h 1 and high organic loading rate olr 2 1 2 4 kg cod m3 day the ags in both reactors had similar structural properties during long term operation and remained structurally and functionally stable during the last five months of operation comparative evaluation of the results indicated that the high influent ss content of the real domestic wastewater had a positive influence on maintaining significantly lower svi30 and relatively lower effluent ss concentration moreover a higher influent ss content resulted in smaller mature granules during the stable period microbial community analyses helped to understand the aerobic granular sludge structure and showed that the sludge retention time and olr affected the granular sludge population the high influent ss increased biomass detachment from the granular sludge surface and caused wash out of some bacteria colonizing the exterior of the granular sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge domestic wastewater granule structure microbial community pilot scale influent suspended solids 1 introduction recently research on aerobic granular sludge ags technology has increased rapidly due to its advantages over conventional suspended activated sludge as technology aerobic granulation has been reported in well controlled lab scale reactors with high or middle strength synthetic wastewaters moy et al 2002 dulekgurgen et al 2003 2008 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 other lab scale studies utilized real wastewaters arrojo vd 2004 schwarzenbeck et al 2004a 2004b hailei et al 2006 yilmaz et al 2008 sam and dulekgurgen 2016 cultivation structure and stability problems encountered with aerobic granular sludge when treating real wastewaters were addressed in lab scale reactors de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 and those efforts became the driving force for moving from lab scale to pilot and full scale applications of the ags technology the first pilot scale ags reactor for treating real wastewater was reported in 2003 in ede the netherlands de kreuk 2006 nereda technology is considered the first ags technology applied at full scale giesen et al 2013 however pilot and full scale applications of ags technology for treatment of domestic municipal wastewaters ni et al 2009 liu et al 2010 2011 li et al 2014 pronk et al 2015 derlon et al 2016 and industrial wastewaters wei et al 2012 morales et al 2013 still have issues the issues involved for scaling up ags reactors to treat real wastewaters i long cultivation start up period ii problems in structural and functional stability of the ags and iii possible negative impacts of high suspended solid concentrations on aerobic granulation have not yet been fully resolved during the process of scaling up the ags technology aerobic granular sludge was cultivated in pilot and full scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs treating domestic municipal wastewater and utilizing a wide range of operating strategies ni et al 2009 reported that aerobic granules of 0 2 0 8 mm were dominant after 300 d of operation the volumetric exchange ratio and the settling time were found to be key factors in aerobic granulation with low strength municipal wastewaters another operational strategy combination of short settling time and high food microorganism f m ratio was suggested for rapid cultivation of ags in a pilot scale sbr fed with municipal wastewater in this case the ags was cultivated in 17 d liu et al 2011 while it took 400 d in a previous study by the same researchers liu et al 2010 cultivation and long term operation of ags in pilot and full scale sbrs were reported with non advantageous hydraulic conditions such as low height to diameter h d ratio of the sbr 2 5 and 0 09 respectively and long settling times 20 and 40 min respectively the main factors highlighted as affecting aerobic granulation were the composition of raw wastewater and periodic feast famine operation li et al 2014 in a full scale sbr treating domestic wastewater ags was formed in a reactor with h d ratio 0 19 and simultaneous feeding and effluent withdrawal aerobic granulation took 3 6 months to meet effluent quality standards during the start up period slow settling biomass was selected 15 min of settling time and 3 3 4 m h 1 up flow feeding velocity biomass was removed from the reactor with surplus sludge sludge retention time srt of 20 38 d pronk et al 2015 derlon et al 2016 reported aerobic granulation in an sbr operated at constant volume it was suggested that lowering the wastewater up flow velocity should ensure retention of enough biomass and efficient removal of substrate optimizing granule size distribution for structural and functional stability of aerobic granules presents a significant challenge zhou et al 2016 several strategies have been suggested to enhance the stability of ags increasing hydrodynamic shear stress to suppress the overgrowth of large granules liu and

organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos using an anaerobic static feeding strategy winkler et al 2011 others proposed using structures inside the reactors such as baffles stirring paddles and tubes van baten et al 2003 soos et al 2008 or a funnel shaped steel wire screen zhou et al 2016 utilizing a high olr wang et al 2009 and selective discharge of aging granular sludge zhu et al 2013 the presence of suspended organics or other slowly biodegradable substrate in the influent was mostly investigated in lab scale reactors fed with synthetic wastewater for conventional activated sludge martins et al 2011 biofilm mosquera corral et al 2003 and aerobic granular sludge systems de kreuk et al 2010 in as systems suspended solids led to formation of open fluffy and porous flocs and also reduced excessive outgrowth of filamentous organisms martins et al 2011 in contrast suspended solids in ags systems caused irregular filamentous outgrowth on the granules de kreuk et al 2010 wagner et al 2015 aerobic granular sludge was also cultivated using industrial wastewater containing influent suspended solids in the range 100 1000 mg l 1 ss from sources such as papermakers hailei et al 2006 dairy products pig farms val del río et al 2012 and swine slurry morales et al 2013 livestock othman et al 2013 rubber manufacturers rosman et al 2014 and breweries corsino et al 2017 none of these studies examined in detail the effect of suspended solids on aerobic granular sludge formation structure or performance microbial populations significantly shift during acclimation and granulation phases towards different conditions in the maturation phase abdullah et al 2013 some bacterial species play more important roles in the formation and growth of granular sludge bin et al 2011 therefore the community structure of bacterial populations should be monitored to understand the relationship between the microbial community and the mechanism of aerobic granulation microbial community analyses of aerobic granular sludge for treating synthetic and real wastewater with high suspended solids are still scarce this paper presents the results of long term monitoring of two pilot scale ags sbrs to determine the effect of high suspended solid ss concentrations on cultivation long term stability and structure of aerobic granular sludge for treating real domestic wastewater two pilot scale sbrs fed with raw r1 and settled r2 wastewater were operated in parallel for 500 d raw domestic wastewater with high ss concentration was used to evaluate the impact of ss on aerobic granulation and to compare the case where settled wastewater with lower ss content was used in addition to the analytic measurements used to determine the performance of the reactors comparative

1 pilot scale sbr and operation two pilot scale sbrs fed with raw r1 and settled r2 wastewater were operated in parallel for 500 d the sbrs had a working volume of 28 7 l with internal diameter of 15 4 cm and height of 154 cm h d 10 fig s1 the volumetric exchange ratio was 60 the sbrs were operated automatically by a programmable logic controller plc the total cycle time was 6 h 60 min of anaerobic feeding an aeration period a settling period 3 min of decanting and 7 min idle the settling time was steadily reduced from 15 to 3 min over 14 d and the remaining cycle time was adjusted as an aeration period the minimum settling velocity vs was 18 m h 1 when the settling time was 3 min diffusers placed at the bottom of the reactors with the same cross sectional area as the reactor diameter were used both for feeding and for aeration hence mixing and were controlled with a solenoid valve during the aerobic phase air was supplied at a flow rate of 18 l min 1 resulting in an up flow air velocity of 1 6 cm s 1 dissolved oxygen do concentration typically 0 8 5 mg o2 l 1 and ph 6 5 8 5 were monitored but not controlled the reactors were operated in a temperature controlled room 22 3 c 2 2 wastewater characterization and seed sludge the wastewater used in this study was taken from a manhole shaft on the istanbul university avcilar campus the wastewater originated from the engineering faculty technical sciences high school and the main refectory dining hall the wastewater was pumped to storage tanks after coarse screening the raw wastewater fed to r1 from the first storage tank was mixed to keep the particulate matter in suspension during the feeding phase while the wastewater fed to r2 from the second storage tank was settled at least 2 h to remove all settle able solids all tanks were cleaned before wastewater collection the wastewater was collected three times a week and stored at 4 c characterizations of raw and settled domestic wastewater are summarized in table 1 the cod concentration for high strength domestic wastewater is 1200 mg l 1 and the concentrations of ss for high and medium strength domestic wastewaters are 350 and 220 mg l 1 respectively metcalf eddy 1991 accordingly the raw domestic wastewater was classified as high strength domestic wastewater in terms of its cod content however the ss content was significantly higher 700 310 mg l 1 than that of a high strength domestic wastewater the settled domestic wastewater presented the characteristics of a medium strength domestic wastewater in terms of its ss content 200 65 mg l 1 micrographs of the raw and settled wastewater are shown in fig s2 the raw wastewater contained much more and larger suspended solids 220 130 μm than the settled wastewater 60 40 μm significant biodiversity was not observed in either of the wastewaters possibly due to the short time of retention in the sewage system the seed sludge was obtained from a full scale wastewater treatment plant in istanbul and acclimated to real domestic wastewater for 3 weeks the mlss concentration mlvss mlss ratio and svi of the seed sludge were 6 4 g l 1 0 39 and 185 ml g 1 respectively the acclimated seed sludge had 5 75 g l 1 of mlss 0 71 mlvss mlss ratio and 40 ml g 1 of svi the srt selected was 10 d during the acclimation period 2 3 eps extraction and analysis the extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted using the method proposed by frølund et al 1996 at the end of the aeration phase a mixed liquor sample was collected from the reactor the supernatant harvested from the first centrifuge of the sample was decanted and considered to represent the soluble microbial product of the sample smp the pellet was re suspended in phosphate buffered saline pbs and eps was extracted using dowex cation exchange resin 0 5 g mlvss extracted using 35 g dowex the extraction was carried out in the dark on ice for 4 h and using a magnetic stirrer set at 750 r m 1 the protein content pn of the extracted eps was determined using the modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin bsa as the standard walker 1996 the polysaccharide content ps of the extracted eps was measured using the dubois method with alginic acid as the standard dubois et al 1956 2 4 particle size measurements and macro structural properties of the biomass mixed liquor samples were collected from both reactors once in two weeks and transferred to the lab freshly for analyses both the original samples and those with flocculants removed were transferred to petri dishes and the samples were examined using a stereomicroscope mikrosistem turkey a minimum of 10 representative images captured by a digital camera kameram 318cu turkey mounted on the microscope were recorded for each sample the digital images were then processed using image analysis ia software imagepro plus v4 0 media cybernetics to determine the mean granule diameter mean of values recorded at 1 steps over 360 the average dgra value for each biomass sample was determined as the arithmetic average of the mean diameters of all granules in all digital images processed for a biomass sample dulekgurgen et al 2008 using the ia software the roundness aspect ratio of each granule was determined as the ratio between the minimum and maximum ferret or the ratio between the minor and major axis of ellipse equivalent to an object similarly the smoothness shape factor or capriciousness of each granule was calculated as 4 π area perimeter2 where perimeter was the length of the granule outline average values of roundness and smoothness for each biomass sample collected on a particular day were then calculated in ways similar to that of average dgra 2 5 microbiological examinations and monitoring of aerobic granular sludge mixed liquor samples were collected from both reactors on a weekly basis for microscopic examination and monitoring which lasted for 500 days after sampling the original samples were examined with bright field and phase contrast microscopy by preparing wet mounts using 0 5 ml of activated sludge on a glass slide air dried smear samples were also prepared for gram staining the gram staining method applied was according to the modifications of jenkins et al 1993 the wet mount slides were examined using 40 100 200 and 400 magnifications of phase contrast and bright field microscope fields the gram stained slides were examined with a bright field microscope at 40 100 200 400 and 1000 magnifications the microscopic analyses were performed using an olympus bx50 model research microscope with attachments for bright field and phase contrast microscopy photomicrographs of the granules and mix culture activated sludge microorganisms were taken using a digital camera cameram 3 mikrosistem turkey mounted on the microscope then recorded and processed using available ia software spot analysis programme mikrosistem turkey calibrations of the measurements were done using an ocular and objective micrometre

v3 reagent kits were used for the runs each run included a minimum of 5 phix that served as an internal control the raw sequence data concatenated forward and reverse sequence reads were cleaned reduced and analysed using mothur version 1 36 1 schloss et al 2009 firstly the barcode and the primer sequences were trimmed and then unique sequences were identified the trimmed unique sequences

samples were analysed for chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nh4 n ortho phosphate po4 3 p total phosphorus tp mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and sludge volume index svi30 in accordance with standard methods apha 1995 in addition to using the microscopic data and the ia software to determine granule size as described above particle size during the start up period was measured directly using a laser particle size analysis system mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments uk when the size of the sludge particles was in the range 0 02 2000 μm during the first 200 d scanning electron microscopy sem philips xl30 esem was employed to visualize the micro scale structure of the aerobic granules energy dispersive x ray edx analysis was used to obtain quantitative analysis of the granule surfaces for that granules were dehydrated in successive 25 50 75 80 90 and 100 ethanol baths and dried in dust free air samples were covered with platinum before the analyses 3 results 3 1 cultivation of aerobic granular sludge the strategies of high olr and short settling time or high settling velocity were found to be the main factors for rapid cultivation of ags liu et al 2011 in our systems the olr was 2 4 0 6 kg cod m3 day for r1 and 2 1 0 3 kg cod m3 day for r2 during the cultivation period therefore the olr in our study was favourable for the rapid cultivation of ags in addition to high olr a short settling time was also selected for rapid cultivation the settling time was shortened from 15 to 3 min during the first 14 d of operation the settling time was reduced to 10 min at the end of the first day of operation the mlss concentration in r2 decreased from 2900 to 2580 mg l 1 whereas it slightly increased from 3000 to 3160 mg l 1 in r1 this was probably due to the high ss concentration and good settling properties of the solids fig 1 further decrease in the settling time of 5 min on day 3 caused a decline in the mlss concentration in both reactors to 2160 mg l 1 in r1 and to 1560 mg l 1 in r2 after the first decrease in the mlss concentrations at the settling time of 5 min the mlss concentrations slightly decreased in both reactors without any further reduction of settling time until day 11 the settling time decreased to 3 min on day 14 then the mlss concentrations in r1 and r2 declined to 1000 and 400 mg l 1 respectively the higher mlss concentration in r1 on day 14 could have resulted from the high ss concentration of the wastewater irregular biofilm structures zoogleal matrices in the flocculants fig s3a were observed when the mlss concentrations reached minimal values then zoogleal out growth was observed on the surfaces of the granular sludge obtained fig s3b the svi30 values in both reactors simultaneously increased from about 60 to 170 ml g 1 the svi30 values decreased and the mlss concentration increased when the first aerobic granular sludge was obtained the concentration of mlss in r2 sharply increased to 4000 mg l 1 while the concentration of mlss in r1 slowly increased to reach 2500 mg l 1 during the cultivation period the difference between the mlss concentrations originated from the mean granule size and the granule size distribution fig 1e f g and h an increase in the mlss concentration in r2 was observed with increase in the mean granule size while a slow increase in the mean granule size in r1 reflected a lower increase in the mlss concentration the mlvss mlss ratio in r2 was more stable than that in r1 and reached 90 when the mlss concentration increased but the ratio in r1 varied between 75 and 85 fig 1a and b a high influent ss concentration fig 1c in the raw wastewater caused a lower and fluctuating mlvss mlss ratio in r1 during the cultivation period the effluent ss concentrations in r1 and r2 increased with decrease in the settling time and also with increase in the influent ss concentration fig 1 c and d morales et al 2013 the influent ss concentration in r1 was 795 250 mg l 1 whereas the average in r2 was 290 98 mg l 1 during the cultivation period the effluent ss concentration averaged 910 280 mg l 1 in r1 and 500 180 mg l 1 in r2 fig 1 c and d the percentage volume of sludge particles of 200 μm svp sb200 liu et al 2010 and the svi30 svi5 ratio schwarzenbeck et al 2005 are good indicators of granulation it is assumed that granular sludge is the dominant form of reactor sludge when svp sb200 is below 50 and the svi30 svi5 ratio is 90 100 liu et al 2010 the granulation was firstly obtained in r2 on day 25 the granule mean size and svi30 svi5 ratio in r2 improved to 900 μm and 90 on day 25 fig 1 f the svi30 svi5 ratio was stable and 90 after day 25 the svp sb200 was 12 fig 1 h and 50 of the granules was in the range 600 1200 μm when granulation was obtained the mean granule size decreased to 615 μm between day 39 and 60 and the sludge volume percentages reflected decrease in the mean granule size fig 1 f and h the granulation in r1 was achieved on day 44 when the svp sb200 was 43 fig 1 g the granule mean size reached 600 μm but the svi30 svi5 ratio fluctuated from 70 to 90 fig 1 e svi30 in r1 firstly decreased to 25 ml g 1 and then reached 44 ml g 1 at the end of the cultivation period the lowest svi30 in r2 was 40 ml g 1 which later reached 52 ml g 1 interestingly svi30 in r1 was better than that in r2 during the cultivation period at the end of the cultivation period the svp sb200 in r2 was 23 whereas it was 37 in r1 3 2 long term operation of aerobic granular sludge reactors after the cultivation period the reactors were operated for 440 d the concentrations of mlss influent and effluent ss mlvss mlss ratio svi30 and the svi30 svi5 ratio in both reactors were monitored to evaluate the stability of aerobic granular sludge during long term operation fig 2 the concentration of mlss in r1 generally fluctuated more than that in r2 during the long term operation the mlss concentration in r1 varied from 550 to 9500 mg l 1 average 5350 2650 mg l 1 between day 210 and 350 decrease in the mlss concentration was observed from 8000 to 550 mg l 1 in 30 d but then increased again to 9500 mg l 1 in the following 30 d fig 2a the high fluctuation in the mlss concentration in r1 was attributed to the high influent ss concentration which varied from 200 to 1600 mg l 1 average 710 345 mg l 1 while the effluent ss concentration was 530 270 mg l 1 fig 2c the mlss concentration in r2 was more stable 3350 1250 mg l 1 fig 2b during this period the influent and effluent concentrations in r2 fluctuated less 200 55 mg l 1 and 310 150 mg l 1 respectively as is well known the mlss concentrations in ags reactors operated in fill and draw batch mode are dynamic because the srt is not adjusted the srt in our reactors was not adjusted but was controlled by the influent and effluent ss and biological growth in the reactor the srt in r1 in days 200 350 and days 350 500 were 6 5 5 d and 6 5 3 d respectively the srt in r2 in these two periods was 5 2 5 d and 15 5 d respectively therefore within the period from day 350 until the end of the study the mlss concentration in r1 fluctuated less whereas it gradually increased in r2 discussed in sections 3 6 and 4 3 the mlss concentrations in both reactors reached the maximum and average values of 14 000 and 8000 3000 mg l 1 respectively in this period the concentrations of the influent and effluent ss in both reactors remained similar to those in the previous period the mlvss mlss ratios in both reactors were 90 after day 200 svi30 and the svi30 svi5 ratio fluctuated in both reactors before day 350 fig 2 e and f svi30 decreased to 32 10 ml g 1 in r1 and 38 10 ml g 1 in r2 during the last period of granulation between day 350 and 500 the svi30 svi5 ratio stabilized at 100 after day 300 in both reactors the composition protein pn and polysaccharide ps of eps and smp in both reactors are given in fig s4 a and b biomass associated eps pn and ps values were similar in both reactors and fluctuated during the entire study it was clearly recorded that the eps pn concentration in both reactors were much lower than those of eps ps these results contradict some others reported in the ags literature mcswain et al 2005 dulekgurgen et al 2008 martins et al 2011 wang et al 2014 the amount of eps pn was 11 2 10 6 mg g 1 mlvss in r1 and 10 8 9 2 mg g 1 mlvss in r2 while the amounts of eps ps were one order of magnitude higher than those of eps pn 224 93 mg g 1 mlvss in r1 and 252 101 mg g 1 mlvss in r2 the concentrations of smp ps from both reactors were comparable 43 18 mg l 1 likewise those of smp pn were also at similar levels in both reactors 7 5 6 5 mg l 1 3 3 macro structural properties of aerobic granular sludge micrographs of mixed liquor biomass samples exhibiting the temporal changes in overall view and the macro structure of the aerobic granular sludge present in both reactors between day 210 and 500 are given in fig s5 and s6 the mature granules displayed a layered internal structure growing from a denser core to a less dense surface in addition to the granular biomass dominating both systems between day 210 and 500 some flocculent biomass as well as amorphous biomass patches and biofilm structures were also observed in both reactors fig s5 and s6 those amorphous structures resulting from detachment from granule surface due to mechanical and or microbial factors like sloughing abrasion grazing predation etc and or from granule disintegration due to weakening of a mature granule s interior caused by i e substrate oxygen limitation endogenous respiration death etc were considered acting as biomass pieces supporting formation of new granules in a cyclic fashion with a frequency of 1 1 5 months the sbrs were fed with real wastewater containing medium r2 or high r1 level of suspended solids accordingly some particulate matter originating from raw and settled wastewater was detected on the surface of some granules in both systems i e fig s5 and s6 days 283 357 428 in previously reported cases for granular sludge fed with effluents containing particulate matter schwarzenbeck et al 2004a de kreuk et al 2010 finger like macro structures growing on the granule surface were reported to disturb the structural stability of the granular biomass this was not observed in this study during the long term operation of the reactors even in r1 fed with raw wastewater containing high ss the progress of biomass development between day 210 and 500 and comparative results of the macro structural properties of the ags minimum maximum and average granule diameter roundness smoothness is summarized in fig 3 in general the changes in the macro structural properties of the ags in both systems can be evaluated in two distinct periods i a fluctuation period of 5 months between day 210 and 350 followed by ii a stable period of another 5 months between day 350 and 500 between day 210 and 350 the roundness values were relatively stable with comparable average values of 0 66 and 0 62 in r1 and r2 respectively whereas considerable fluctuations in granule size and surface smoothness were observed in both systems fig 3 the mean granule diameter in r1 varied between 1 31 0 07 mm and 2 87 0 25 mm and that in r2 between 0 90 0 03 mm and 2 16 0 41 mm corresponding average granule size aver dgra was 2 71 0 21 mm and 1 79 0 32 mm respectively the average smoothness was 0 61 for r1 and 0 50 for r2 during that period while the surface smoothness of granules in r1 fluctuated within a wide range between 0 44 0 12 and 0 74 0 04 values for r2 varied less between 0 43 0 09 and 0 57 0 05 but were lower in general fig 3 in contrast to those variations recorded between day 210 and 350 all three parameters exhibited flattened trends during the following 5 months of operation between day 350 and 500 which indicated that the ags in both systems became stable in terms of macro structural properties the roundness values were stable as before within a narrow range between 0 6 and 0 7 and with an average 0 66 for both systems fig 3 this implies that the systems were dominated by elliptical mature granules as was also apparent visually fig s5 and s6 moreover the wide oscillations in surface smoothness observed in r1 during the previous 5 months diminished and also the considerably low values recorded for r2 improved significantly at around day 350 during the following 5 months the smoothness of the granules in both systems exhibited minimal variation and were stable at almost the same average value 0 71 and 0 72 for r1 and r2 respectively while the ags in two systems exhibited the same properties in terms of roundness mostly elliptical granules and capriciousness smooth granule surface between day 350 and 500 there was a clear difference in the size of stable mature granules obtained with different wastewaters mature stable granules fed with raw wastewater were smaller than those fed with settled effluent fig s5 and s6 for the stable period last 5 months the average granule size of the ags fed with raw wastewater r1 was 1 49 0 11 mm and that fed with settled effluent r2 was 2 00 0 24 mm fig 3 comparing the macro structural properties of the biomass during the fluctuation and stable periods there was a 46 decrease in average granule size no change in roundness and 14 improvement in the surface smoothness of the granules obtained in r1 the aerobic granules in r2 got 10 bigger and both the roundness and smoothness of the granules improved significantly 8 2 and 30 respectively 3 4 microscopic investigations and monitoring monitoring of reactors treating raw wastewater and settled wastewater and microscopic examination of weekly samples was performed from the acclimation period throughout 500 d of treatment operation fig 4 in general microscopic examination indicated that the overall microbiological diversity of the reactors did not change dramatically regarding eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells the main difference in the results from comparison of the microbial biodiversity in the reactors was that there were many more eukaryotic species in the bulk solution of the r1 system other minor differences involved populations of filamentous microorganisms in the bulk solution and that some granules floc structure changed when they got 3 5 mm the nematodes and rotifers present also grew larger rotifers usually prefer to grow under stable steady state activated sludge conditions thus they were found in low numbers because they do not survive well in very harsh oxygenated agitated and turbulent systems nematodes appeared in all samples because the fresh domestic wastewater provided high organic content and because they can survive in mixing environments both reactors were mixed and aerated granulated sludge systems but the r1 reactor had larger numbers of attached stalked ciliated protozoa epistylis spp with colonies of 20 100 individuals on flocs and granules fig 4 photomicrographs 1 2 some other organisms ciliated protozoa paramecium spp chilodonella spp colpidium spp lionotus spp flagellated protozoa aspidisca spp monosiga spp and bodo spp stalked protozoa vorticella spp and epistylis spp nematodes ascaridia spp and rotifers philodina spp were observed during operation of the reactors the microbial diversity of both reactors was very rich and included flagellated ciliated and stalked protozoa gram negative and positive bacteria filamentous microorganisms both bacterial and fungal species and nematodes and rotifers in almost every sample examined the floc forming bacterial species zoogloea ramigera produced larger macro structures granules during the treatment period which included some gram negative and positive bacteria inside the floc matrix and filamentous microorganisms in and around the flocs granules these formed macro structures as described by sezgin et al 1978 and as seen in fig 4 photomicrographs 3 4 in both reactors flocs before granulation were enlarged during the acclimation period and had intricate shapes and wavy borders usually covered by filamentous microorganisms fig 4 photomicrographs 3 4 the fungi present grew in very long large filaments these were usually dominated by rhizopus spp which do not have septa and aspergillus spp which have identifier septa and food cells that produce hypha and spores fig s8 photomicrographs 1 2 r2 fed with settled wastewater had better rounded more uniform and smoother flocs and granules fig 4 photomicrographs 5 6 compared to the r1 flocs and granules filamentous bacterial species predominantly nostocoida limicola ii and sphaerotilus natans found with 10 filaments per floc and others type 0041 bacillus spp beggiatoa spp thiothrix spp and type 0092 found irregularly and usually 5 filaments per floc have been observed in high and low numbers depending on changing and fluctuating operational and wastewater characteristics throughout the time of operation fig s8 photomicrographs 3 6 some filamentous species for example sphaerotilus natans and nostocoida limicola ii were usually found in the bulk solution while others for example bacillus spp type 0041 and type 0092 were present within the floc structures with species of individual bacteria these filamentous species did not grow very well or reach high numbers in the systems because of the high dissolved oxygen concentration 5 mg l 1 short hydraulic retention time 10 h and harsh physical and environmental conditions even so they were at least able to survive under these conditions operational factors and wastewater characteristics i e sludge age loading rate f m ratio ph and nutrients likely affected species diversity and the amount of filamentous microorganisms healthy conventional granules were up to 3 4 mm diameter and this structure was protected by a matrix formed by the floc maker zoogloea ramigera if granules reached 5 mm or larger they fragmented into smaller pieces because after anaerobic conditions occurred in the centre of a granule not enough dissolved oxygen could penetrate the interior of the larger granules to prevent the resulting anaerobic micro aerophilic condition fig 4 photomicrographs 6 a well developed mature floc or granule was usually filled with bacterial species of similar morphological shape maybe a single bacterial species as seen in fig 4 photomicrographs 3 and 4 and fig s8 photomicrographs 4 and 5 within the zoogleal matrix which served as an aggregator for microorganisms this may be important in treatment performance for specific types of wastewater if these types create different special environments within the granules 3 5 micro structural properties of aerobic granular sludge micro structure studies using sem edx analysis in both reactors during the entire study were performed to evaluate the surface characteristics of mature granular sludge including such as the chemical precipitates and adsorbed particulate matter on the granule surfaces fig 5 these structures were similar in both reactors fig 5a shows a general view of a crushed granule of mature sludge and fig 5b and c presents the images of the inside of the crushed part and outside of this granule the bacterial community and its organization inside the granule can be clearly seen in fig 5b while the outside of the granule is smooth and covered with filamentous bacteria fig 5d and e exhibit other sections of the sludge granule filamentous fungi rhizopus and aspergillus were observed in both reactors during the entire study fig s8 photomicrographs 1 and 2 therefore it was thought that the structures observed on the surfaces of the granules were the hyphae of fungi fig 5d in fact hyphae penetrated the inner part of granules from the surface fig 5e the sem edx analysis of all sections mentioned above demonstrated that the granules in both reactors and also the inside and outside of the granules had similar chemical compositions the sem edx analysis of the granule in fig 5c gives the weight percentage wt of c n o and p 55 67 6 17 12 6 and 2 92 wt respectively the other elements were less than 0 8 wt except for pt because of the platinum coating used to prepare for sem the sem edx mapping also shows the result of this analysis in fig s9 besides the biodiversity of the granules some chemical precipitants were detected on the surface and gutter of sludge granules fig 5 f g h i and j both sem edx analysis and mapping of the section in fig 5f proved that the chemical precipitates consisted of mg p and o the sem edx mapping fairly illustrated the borders of the chemical precipitates as shown in fig s10 another mg precipitate is presented in fig 5g mg p and o was 14 12 25 56 and 22 92 wt respectively fig 5h shows chemical precipitates containing ca p and o with 16 02 15 33 and 21 93 wt respectively in addition to the mg and ca precipitates si and al precipitates or entrapped adsorbed particles were also observed on the surface of sludge granules fig 5i illustrates the aggregation of entrapped adsorbed particles containing si and al 31 22 and 10 66 wt whereas fig 5j shows al particles 46 74 wt with minimal si 0 1 wt 3 6 performance and microbial community of aerobic granular sludge the cod removal efficiencies were almost identical in both reactors 89 5 the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and po4 3 p varied randomly in both reactors the average removal efficiency of nh4 n in r1 was 60 18 whereas it was 55 22 in r2 the real time pcr results showed that the percentage of aob species to total bacteria in both reactors was lower than 0 10 during the entire study 0 16 in the seed sludge nitrobacter sp was negligible in all samples 1000 yilmaz et al 2017 the percentage of nitrospira sp to total bacteria in both reactors was 0 10 except on a few sampling days the nox n production in both reactors was also negligible therefore it can be said that nitrogen removal occurred mainly due to biological growth the average removal efficiencies of po4 3 p in r1 and r2 were 76 22 and 69 21 respectively unlike for nitrogen removal phosphorus removal was influenced by enhanced biological phosphorus removal mechanisms other than biological growth accumulibacteria were negligible before the stable period 0 9 in the seed sludge they increased during the stable period and reached 4 5 of total bacteria in both reactors actinobacteria were 1 5 2 5 in r2 on day 250 and 310 but were 1 of total bacteria in both reactors the structure of the microbial community was monitored using hrm and ngs analyses the hrm profiles and their cluster analysis for r1 are shown in fig s11 and fig s12 respectively as seen in fig s12 the seed sludge microbial community changed over time and there are three major clusters group 1 on day 457 group 2 on day 336 and group 3 on other days the variance eigenvalue associated with a principal component versus the number of the component was plotted to judge the relative magnitude of the eigenvalues the first principal components pc1s for the microbial hrm profiles had the eigenvalue 43 629 which accounted for 92 8 of the total variance table s1 in other words most of the hrm fingerprinting data was captured in pc1 pc1 was correlated to other variables namely all bacteria aob aoa nitrospira sp accumulibacteria actinobacteria srt mlss influent and effluent ss olr removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p for determination of the factors that affect the microbial community structure table s2 there was a statistically significant correlation between the microbial community profiles and the srt 79 and aoa 76 but only a medium correlation was observed with the mlss concentration 56 genomic dna of each cluster was pooled and subjected to 16s rrna targeted ngs the detected species with abundance is over 1 are given in table s3 where a difference 10 was detected for zoogloea spp uncultured candidatus competibacter sp and brachymonas chironomi in other words the longer the srt was the higher the abundance of aoa and the shorter the srt was the lower the abundance of aoa moreover higher mlss concentrations favoured retention of uncultured candidatus competibacter sp in the sludge and lower mlss concentrations favoured the retention of zoogloea spp and brachymonas chironomi in the sludge the hrm profiles and their cluster analysis in r2 are shown in fig s13 and fig s14 respectively as seen in fig s14 there are two major clusters the microbial community profile of the reactor between day 380 and 478 was distinct from the other operation days the first principal components pc1s for the microbial hrm profiles have the eigenvalue of 55 587 which accounted for 94 8 of the total variance in other words most of the hrm fingerprinting data was captured in pc1 table s4 pc1 was correlated to the other variables for determination of the factors that affect the microbial community structures table s5 there was statistically significant correlation between the microbial community profiles and the srt 85 on the other hand the nh4 n removal efficiency olr mlss and accumulibacteria had medium correlations with microbial community profiles in the range 60 65 genomic dna of each cluster was pooled and subjected to 16s rrna targeted ngs the detected species with abundance 1 are given in table s6 as given in table s6 a difference 5 was detected for uncultured candidatus competibacter sp in other words the higher srt olr mlss concentrations and higher abundance of accumulibacteria favoured retention of uncultured candidatus competibacter sp in the sludge whereas the nh4 n removal efficiency decreased with increase in uncultured candidatus competibacter sp figs 6 and 7 illustrate the members of the microbial community making up 2 of the total bacterial abundance in r1 and r2 respectively during the entire study the microbial community in r1 exhibited high diversity except on day 336 and substantially shifted on day 336 and day 457 in the majority of samples brachymonas chironomi and flavobacterium cheniae species were predominant with 11 and 9 of the total bacteria respectively fig 6a zoogloea spp was dominant 52 on day 336 fig 6b and uncultured candidatus competibacter sp was dominant 35 on day 457 in r1 fig 6c the microbial community could also be divided into two distinctive periods fluctuation and stable as defined previously the microbial community diversities in both reactors were almost identical during the fluctuation period figs 6a and 7a and also had similarities during the stable period in r2 fig 7b the most striking difference between the fluctuation period and the stable period in r2 was that uncultured candidatus competibacter sp increased from 2 to 9 the abundance of the other species in r2 remained similar during both periods fig 7 a and b the structure of the microbial community in both reactors was found to be closely related to the srt and also to the mlss concentration in both reactors the mlss concentration in r1 was stable and reached 13 0 8 g l 1 during one month before the sampling day day 457 when the srt was 11 1 d it should be mentioned that the olr in r1 during this period was also higher 3 3 0 3 kg cod m3 day than that on other operation days 2 5 0 5 kg cod m3 day on the other hand the mlss concentration in r2 steadily increased while the srt and olr were 15 5 d and 2 2 0 6 kg cod m3 day respectively during the stable period the srt in r1 and r2 during the fluctuation period was about 6 5 5 and 5 5 2 5 d respectively therefore it could be said that the high srt probably affected by the high olr encouraged the abundance of uncultured candidatus competibacter sp because the influent ss concentration in r1 was also in the same range on the other operation days the high olr in r1 during this period may also explain the higher abundance of uncultured candidatus competibacter sp 35 when compared with r2 9 4 discussion 4 1 effect of high suspended solid concentration on cultivation and long term operation of aerobic granular sludge the aerobic granular sludge was successfully cultivated within a short period in two pilot scale reactors one fed with raw r1 and one with settled r2 domestic wastewater when the cultivation strategies selected were short settling time high settling velocity and high olr these choices were in line with the results obtained in previous studies liu et al 2011 wagner et al 2015 aerobic granular sludge formed on day 25 in r2 and on day 44 in r1 liu et al 2011 reported granulation in 17 d with similar cultivation strategies using municipal wastewater the concentration of influent ss however was not mentioned in their study in a subsequent study the presence of particulate organic matter in the synthetic wastewater was demonstrated to reduce the kinetics of granule formation wagner et al 2015 the influent ss in the current study comprised particulate organic matter influent vss and inert suspended solids 15 of influent ss moreover the particulate organic matter included some other organics e g cellulose fibres results from study presented above show that ags can be cultivated using real domestic wastewater including suspended solids even at high concentrations up to an average of 800 mg l 1 in our study pilot scale reactors treating real domestic wastewater with high ss concentration were operated for 500 d and the ags in both reactors was fairly stable over the last 5 months of operation as expressed by the svi30 the svi30 svi5 ratio and the average granule size the svi30 was 40 ml g 1 and the svi30 svi5 ratio of 100 obtained in both reactors was quite comparable with that reported by other researchers for granular sludge used treating municipal wastewater ni et al 2009 liu et al 2011 giesen et al 2013 in the ags literature different values have been reported for mature granule size from 0 6 to 1 9 mm during stable and or long term operation chen et al 2011 chou et al 2011 huang et al 2011 verawaty et al 2013 derlon et al 2016 ni et al 2009 successfully cultivated ags on low strength municipal wastewater 200 mg cod l 1 in an aerobic pilot scale sbr by increasing the volumetric exchange rate 75 primarily to elevate the olr which also resulted in a higher settling velocity thus increased hydraulic selection in favour of fast settling bio particles the size range of mature granules was between 0 2 and 0 8 mm and the average granule size stabilized at around 0 45 mm in their long term study to test the effect of influent up flow velocity on ags formation and treatment performance in a 190 l sbr receiving real and low strength municipal wastewater 304 mg cod l 1 derlon et al 2016 showed that when the system was anaerobically fed from the bottom at a high velocity 12 5 16 m h 1 the ags formed in the system was comprised of bigger granules d 0 63 mm but filamentous out growths were detected on the surface of the granules whereas the granules were smaller 0 25 d 0 63 mm when the feeding up flow velocity was as low as 1 m h 1 and granulation was supported also by selective anaerobic carbon utilization due to anaerobic slow feeding and selective sludge withdrawal strategies various factors including but not limited to increase in mass transfer resistance depletion of substrates before reaching the core of a granule formation of anaerobic zones and loss of viability at the granule centre resulting in weakening of the granule interior and increased susceptibility to disintegration have been considered as disturbing the structural stability of ags verawaty et al 2013 proposed the concept of critical granule size towards which aerobic granules tend to equilibrate to through the balance between granule growth and breakage influenced by operational process conditions i e wastewater characteristics settling velocity shear forces feeding and aeration phases etc they tested their hypothesis by operating several sbrs in parallel fed with abattoir wastewater and seeding those with granules at different sizes 0 425 0 900 1 125 mm or a mixture of those they reported that after 50 days of operation and reaching steady state the size of granules in all sbrs except that started up by the small granules equilibrated to approximately the same size of 0 6 0 8 mm and referred that size as the critical granule size characteristic for their experimental set up and operation long term monitoring and data from the final stable operational period in both reactors in the current study showed that the average size of the mature granules treating raw wastewater r1 stabilized at 1 50 mm and that treating settled wastewater r2 at 2 00 mm these values are higher in general than those reported in the ags literature for granular sludge cultivated on low strength domestic wastewater relatively high cod of the raw and settled wastewater and the high olr applied in the current study are considered as the main factors for that difference moreover the mature stable granules of the ags cultivated in and treating raw wastewater with significantly high ss content were 25 smaller than those cultivated in and treating the settled effluent with lower ss this indicates the impact of the influent ss concentration on the ags structure zhou et al 2016 accordingly it can be concluded that the ss content of the influent has an impact on the granule structure and in particular on the granule size of ags systems specifically the higher the influent ss content is the smaller the stable mature granules are in the ags system suspended solids in the effluent can originate from detached biomass and suspended solids in the influent not removed by settling or entrapment absorption and from biodegradation pronk et al 2015 the effluent ss concentration 590 235 mg l 1 in r1 was lower than the influent ss concentration 650 305 mg l 1 while the effluent ss concentration 305 135 mg l 1 in r2 was higher than the influent ss 225 60 mg l 1 during the stable period this can be explained by some part of the influent ss being entrapped on the granules where they were then degraded pronk et al 2015 and settled inside the reactor this was because the mean size of influent ss in r1 was as large as 220 130 μm on the other hand the detached biomass and influent ss increased the effluent ss concentration in r2 because the mean size of the influent ss 60 40 μm in r2 was lower than the self settling size 100 μm apparently in both cases a post treatment option was required to remove the ss in the effluent to meet the relevant discharge standards as an alternative an external membrane reactor was tested for that purpose but those results were not presented because they are outside the scope of the current study 4 2 effect of high suspended solid concentration on macro and micro structural properties of aerobic granular sludge zoogloea spp may play an important role in floc formation providing an eps matrix around which the floc forms seviour et al 2010 zoogloea ramigera was frequently observed during the entire study and the zoogleal matrix incorporated filamentous and non filamentous bacteria fig 4 photomicrographs 3 4 and fig s8 photomicrographs 4 6 previous research demonstrated that particulate organic substrates result in formation of open flocs martins et al 2011 this is in line with the results obtained in the current study when an open floc containing zoogleal matrix was observed at the beginning of the cultivation period due probably to the presence of suspended solids in the influent and application of high olr those open flocs transformed to granular sludge when short settling time was applied from the first to mature granular sludge the granules were round elliptical the granule surface was smooth and filamentous out growths extending from the granules were not observed however previous studies reported filamentous out growth from the surface of the granular sludge fed with both synthetic and real wastewater containing particulate matter de kreuk et al 2010 wagner et al 2015 therefore different from some previous studies our study reveals that suspended solids in the influent do not necessarily cause formation of filamentous out growths over the long run the eps ps produced in both reactors 240 mg g 1 mlvss was more than that reported in some studies with similar extraction and measurement methods but different reference carbohydrates frølund et al 1996 mcswain et al 2005 dulekgurgen et al 2008 our result was closer to the values reported in other studies in which different and more selective for exops extraction methods were employed lin et al 2010 seviour et al 2012 high eps content and in particular high ps which was recorded in both systems in the current study was considered a positive factor for improving granule structural properties i e roundness and smoothness some precipitates of ca 2 and mg 2 were previously observed in the granules of ags systems jiang et al 2003 huang et al 2012 in this study these kinds of precipitates were also found although particles entrapped in the granular structures were mentioned by pronk et al 2015 these particles were not analysed in our study al and si particles on the surface of granular sludge were clearly observed and analysed using sem edx analysis these entrapped adsorbed particles containing si and al may originate from the raw domestic wastewater this could explain why svi30 in the reactor fed with raw wastewater r1 was lower than that in the reactor r2 fed with settled wastewater 4 3 effect of high suspended solid concentration on performance and microbial community previous research reports show that the specific retention time of individual microbial populations plays an important role in determining the aerobic granular structure the srt of populations nitrifiers found on the exterior of granules would be shorter than the srt for populations paos gaos and archaea in the interior in contrast the total srt of the granular sludge would be equal to the srt of individual populations when granular sludge breakage or disintegration occurred winkler et al 2012 these results are in line with our results that the population of uncultured candidatus competibacter sp gaos increased with increase in the total srt of granular sludge in both reactors the aoa population in both reactors increased during the stable period and reached as high as 13 103 in r1 on day 457 when the population of uncultured candidatus competibacter sp was highest on the other hand the removal efficiency of nh4 n in connection with the population of aob decreased because the population of aob located on the exterior of granules detached due to the high concentration of influent ss as previously mentioned the other interesting result was that zoogloea spp became dominant 52 after breakup of the granular sludge and the microbial diversity diminished as seen in fig s5 and s6 on day 331 almost all granular sludge was damaged in both reactors the abundance of zoogloea spp in r1 on day 336 can be explained by zoogleal out growth on the surfaces of the granular sludge as previously mentioned in cultivation period fig s3b and in sections 3 6 and 4 2 higher olr in r1 may have affected the higher amount of zoogloea spp compared with r2 on the other hand the effect of high ss on zoogleal out growth in granular sludge systems after breakup is still unclear additionally the results show that zoogleal out growth was observed during the cultivation period and after breakup of granular sludge whereas microbial community shifted to gao population under the operation conditions applied during the stable period the anaerobic feeding strategy encourages the populations of paos and gaos which store available organic carbon during feeding period therefore paos and gaos gain a competitive advantage over floc forming organisms and filamentous bacteria liu and liu 2006 bassin et al 2011 the main factors affecting the pao gao competition have found as cod p ratio carbon source ph and temperature oehmen et al 2007 the microbial community in both reactors was dominated by gaos during the stable period in our study since the cod p ratios in raw and settled wastewater were 80 mg cod mg p a ratio higher than 50 mg cod mg p reported in the literature as favouring the gaos over paos oehmen et al 2007 in addition to the high cod p ratio the increased olr in r1 between day 425 and 457 may have further increased the amount of gaos particularly in that system up to 35 5 conclusions aerobic granular sludge ags was cultivated successfully in two pilot scale reactors and in two kinds of real domestic wastewater raw wastewater with high ss content and settled effluent including medium ss content high settling velocity and high organic loading rate were the main operational strategies for successful ags cultivation both sbrs were operated successfully and monitored for a long period 500 days the high ss concentration in the raw domestic wastewater did not have a pronounced effect on the cultivation time of ags when compared to the case with medium ss concentration but influenced the size of mature granules during stable reactor operation higher influent ss content resulted in smaller stable mature granules in the reactor treating raw domestic wastewater the ags maintained in both systems were stable in terms of macro structural properties during the last 5 months of reactor operation this implies that the presence of particulate organic matter in the influent does not necessarily deteriorate the structural stability of ags systems in the long run moreover the settling properties of the mature ags fed with raw wastewater were better than that fed with the settled effluent on the other hand it should be taken into account that high influent ss concentration affected the detachment of biomass from the granular sludge surfaces resulting in wash out of certain bacterial populations from the exterior of the granular sludge characterization long term monitoring microscopic observations and microbial community analyses helped monitor and understand the behaviour of the operated ags systems acknowledgement this work was funded by the scientific and technological research council of turkey tubitak project no 111y036 appendix a supplementary data the following is the

19773,current sanitation systems are inherently limited in their ability to address the new challenges for waste water management that arise from the rising demand to restore resource cycles these challenges include removal of micropollutants water re use and nutrient recovery new opportunities to address these challenges arise from new sanitation a system innovation that combines elements of source separation local treatment and reuse and less use of water new sanitation is applied but not yet widespread in several residential areas in europe implementation is hindered by the lack of insight into the general public s willingness to engage in new sanitation and the resulting uncertainty about this among decision makers and other stakeholders in wastewater management using value belief norm theory as a conceptual lens this paper addresses the individual motivations pro environmental personal norms and personal drivers benefits and barriers risks for acceptance of new sanitation by the dutch general public the results of an online survey n 338 indicated that both pro environmental personal norms and risk and benefit perceptions predict consumers willingness to accept new sanitation more specifically they showed that consumer acceptance is driven by perceived risks relating to the housing market and the need to change behavior but also by environmental benefits overall new sanitation was favorably evaluated by respondents 64 indicated that they would likely use new sanitation if they were owner occupiers the results of this explorative study are discussed in light of the development of novel sanitation systems that are sensitive to perceptions of end users and other key stakeholders keywords new sanitation decentralized sanitation pro environmental personal norms risk perception value belief norm theory wastewater 1 introduction state of the art sanitation systems are very effective in preventing human infection from pathogens present in feces and in processing sewage to wastewater treatment effluents that have acceptable ecological effects only when discharged to surface water however contemporary sanitation systems fuel several issues first sewage contains high loads of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients that are not only critical for agricultural production but also rely on finite or geopolitically sensitive resources ammonia production requires the use of fossil fuels and phosphorous is mined from the earth s crust in a limited number of countries secondly sewage increasingly contains micropollutants like pharmaceutical residues and hormones which represent partially still unknown risks for the environment schwindt et al 2014 removal of these pollutants in the current sanitation system requires large additional investments and additional energy and chemical costs davis 2008 so the currently used systems entail devaluation of human waste loss of nutrients waste of water and emission of residual pollutant loads to the environment and it is therefore increasingly questioned whether they are future proof larsen et al 2016 to address these issues new sanitation was developed in the netherlands and elsewhere hernández leal et al 2017 londong 2013 the new sanitation design aims at maximum recovery of energy and resources from domestic wastewater and at minimizing potable water use and emissions like pharmaceutical residues into the surface water tuantet et al 2014 using a systems approach rather than the end of pipe approach in new sanitation wastewater collection and treatment take place at local level keeping individual source flows like grey and black water separate thereby offering new options for minimizing resource use and restoring resource cycles for one thing water use is minimized for instance by using vacuum toilets also the minimal amount of water yields a more concentrated wastewater flow from which it is more cost effective to remove harmful micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and hormones de wilt et al 2016 and it becomes more feasible to recover valuable components de graaff et al 2011 like nutrients thus implementing new sanitation offers more opportunities for restoring the nutrient cycle finally energy can be saved with source separation and decentralization in two ways rittmann 2013 directly by producing renewable energy in useful forms heat methane and indirectly for example by lowering energy use for treatment and transport despite its potential new sanitation is not yet widely used this can partly be attributed to the currently used sanitation system sewers and centralized treatment plans which results from decades of development and investments switching to a new decentralized system would mean abandoning these investments and applying new decentralized infrastructure requires new investments resulting in a lock in cordell et al 2011 moreover sanitation is a systemic phenomenon embedded in a highly complex network of diverse stakeholders thus a multitude of stakeholders along the sanitation chain need to accept changes and adapt their behavior and practices in order to foster successful adoption of new sanitation this is a complex challenge important stakeholders in the netherlands include the end users general public property developers local governments water boards and users of the recovered resources e g agriculture and industry one of the current bottlenecks for the development of new sanitation is the uncertainty among property developers and other stakeholders about end users acceptance of new sanitation swart and palsma 2013 however whether the general public would accept new sanitation and its consequences for housing and daily practices like using vacuum toilets is currently largely unknown one recent study looked into university residents willingness to pay and general support for urine source separation at a us campus ishii and boyer 2016 but it is important to extend those analyses to other types of sanitation systems among different publics such as people who live in houses on a more permanent basis therefore this study focuses on the general public s perception of new sanitation and especially homeowners and potential homeowners several pilots demonstrations and full scale implementations in the field of new sanitation have been undertaken in the netherlands and elsewhere augustin et al 2014 hernández leal et al 2017 londong 2013 for some of these projects actual users perceptions were studied lienert and larsen 2010 naus and van vliet 2012 in these projects users were mostly positive about the use of new sanitation naus and van vliet 2012 however these studies did not look into the perceptions of the general public and whether they would be willing to commit themselves as homeowners to the pro environmental behavior of becoming a first time new sanitation user in our study stern s 2000 value belief norm vbn theory and people s risk and benefit perceptions are used to explore the dutch general public s intention to accept new sanitation the results of this study are discussed in relation to existing literature to ascertain implications for practice and future research 1 1 value belief norm theory value belief norm theory stern et al 1999 stern 2000 proposes a causal chain of factors that lead from personal values to pro environmental behavior fig 1 as its name suggests these factors are people s values beliefs and norms and each of these is elaborated below to begin with individuals hold different value orientations in life and each of these may have smaller or bigger weights for how they serve as stable guiding principles in their life schwartz 1992 three values are included in vbn theory stern et al 1999 stern 2000 first 1 biospheric values reflect people s belief that it is worth protecting nature because of its intrinsic value second 2 altruistic values deal with the welfare of others for example people that are close to a person finally 3 egoistic values are geared toward one s own welfare and tend to be negatively related to so called green consumer behavior whereas both altruistic and biospheric values have positive associations de groot and steg 2008 nordlund and garvill 2002 according to vbn theory the three values predict the next variable in the causal chain beliefs three kinds of beliefs are included in vbn theory 1 the new ecological paradigm people s ecological worldview representing their belief regarding the extent to which they think they can change or affect nature dunlap and van liere 1978 2 the awareness of adverse consequences for valued things people s awareness of threats to the environment han 2015 and 3 ascription of responsibility people s belief that their own actions could counter those threats finally ascribed responsibility has a direct effect on pro environmental personal norms these personal norms determine one s moral obligation to act in order to prevent negative impacts on the environment therefore pro environmental personal norms are the last part of the vbn causal chain that predicts people s behavior stern et al 1999 1 2 risk and benefit perceptions according to literature reviews vbn theory explains 19 35 of the variance in actual behavior stern et al 1999 kaiser et al 2005 this suggest that other factors are also important in predicting people s ecological behaviors the current study aims to explore people s willingness to accept new sanitation which for most people is a novel technology when it comes to acceptance of new technology perceptions of risk and benefit are generally important if not crucial e g hurlimann 2007 otway and von winterfeldt 1982 van dijk et al 2017 hence it is likely that the general public s evaluation of risks and benefits relating to new sanitation will be important predictors of their acceptance of this technology hurlimann 2007 gives examples of situations in which risk perception stood in the way of public acceptance of new technologies in specific countries like nuclear technologies and genetically modified food low public acceptance of a new technology often has negative consequences for its commercialization gupta et al 2012 suggest that this explains why research on societal acceptance of technology has been increasingly focused on risk and benefit perceptions the general public s risk perceptions are typically based on factual information but also importantly on feelings ethics preferences and attitudes daughton 2004 and can be ambiguous gregory et al 1995 perhaps not always fact based decision making concerning technologies is influenced by risk perceptions and these perceptions are based on a frame of reference and sometimes incomplete knowledge about the risk weisenfeld and ott 2011 perceived risks and benefits of a technology are not fixed concepts rather they are constantly subject to change and mediated by the current cultural understandings of acceptable risks a new technology may be perceived as risky but when it is embedded in routine behavior the perception of it can change to not risky flynn et al 2006 furthermore perceived risks and benefits also influence each other the level of perceived benefits influences the acceptability levels of the perceived risks fischhoff et al 2000 quezada et al 2016 studied the adoption of decentralized water systems in australia which can be considered a form of new sanitation they interviewed different stakeholders government officials property developers planning authorities consultants and technology providers and identified several drivers benefits and barriers risks reducing costs creating a green marketing position and enhancing a sustainable image and thus attracting more buyers water security and environmental impact were identified as drivers furthermore a driver that was fueled by necessity was identified an increasing bulk water price quezada and colleagues also identified barriers or risks to the development of decentralized wastewater systems first a perceived technology risk which consisted of financial and reliability risks secondly concerns about public health and water quality thirdly concerns about the governance regulation and legislation of the decentralized systems inspired by these findings we confronted people with potential benefits and risks relating to new sanitation to find out whether these are important in predicting the acceptance of the technology 2 methods 2 1 sample in order to answer our research questions an online self administered survey was conducted in january 2017 and distributed via various social media such as public social media pages linkedin facebook yammer 96 4 and the second author s personal network 1 7 targeted social media channels were diversified to prevent bias towards the author s personal networks the survey was aimed at the dutch general public aged 18 years and older in order to increase response three vouchers from a well known dutch online store worth 10 were raffled among participants in total 338 completed questionnaires were collected 2 2 procedure the survey consisted of several factors discussed in the theoretical section the questionnaire started off by asking questions about the participants value orientations the new environmental paradigm awareness of adverse consequences ascription of responsibility and pro environmental personal norms see supporting information for the survey items then a brief description of new sanitation was presented this description 244 words in total in dutch included an explanation of the concept vis à vis conventional sanitation systems furthermore possible gains of new sanitation were discussed the example of phosphorus recovery from human urine was given and some practical consequences for end users were mentioned e g use of vacuum toilet kitchen grinder higher initial costs after the description participants answered questions about perceived risks perceived benefits and intention to accept new sanitation finally demographic characteristics were assessed unless otherwise stated the questionnaire items were measured on 7 point likert scales matell and jacoby 1971 a question format in which participants were asked to react to statements by indicating their level of agreement 1 completely disagree 7 completely agree 2 3 measures value orientations were measured using steg and colleagues items steg et al 2005 and respondents were asked to indicate the importance they attached to a list of value objects each value orientation was represented by four items we checked the internal reliability of the set of items representing a variable and these items were collapsed into a single index after verifying that the cronbach alpha values cronbach 1951 were found to be 0 6 or higher a sample item on the biospheric value scale is preventing pollution 1 very unimportant 7 very important cronbach s α 0 72 for the altruistic value subscale social justice cronbach s α 0 78 and for the egoistic value subscale wealth cronbach s α 0 72 new environmental paradigm was measured with a 14 item scale based on the revised nep scale dunlap et al 2000 a sample item is humans are meant to rule over the rest of nature cronbach s α 0 79 awareness of adverse consequences was measured using three statements based on previous vbn research de groot and steg 2008 ryan and spash 2012 and adjusted for the present context so that they were directly relevant for new sanitation an example of an item is without proper precautions we will face the threat of insufficient clean drinking water in the future cronbach s α 0 65 ascription of responsibility was assessed using six items based on steg et al 2005 and de groot and steg 2008 an example of a statement is i can do something to reduce water pollution cronbach s α 0 73 pro environmental personal norms were assessed using six items based on de groot and steg 2007 and steg et al 2005 a sample item is i feel obliged to live as environmentally friendly as possible cronbach s α 0 85 perceived risks regarding new sanitation were assessed with 16 items developed for the purpose of this study reflecting potential risks health risks technical risks risks for daily use in the household risks for the housing market and environmental risks participants were asked to grade each of these items from 1 very low risk to 7 very high risk cronbach s α 0 92 only the responses of house proprietors and participants who expected to be a homeowner within three years were included n 241 we followed that procedure in order to ensure that questions around financial risks on the housing market would be relevant to the participants perceived benefits regarding new sanitation were assessed with 17 items reflecting benefits for daily use in the household the environment the housing market safety benefits and cost benefits the participants rated each item on a 7 point likert scale ranging from 1 no benefit to 7 very high benefit cronbach s α 0 92 the number of responses n 241 collected to measure perceived benefits was the same as the number for risk perception and for the same reason we were careful to ensure that items on perceived benefits regarding sales value and attractiveness to the housing market were relevant to the participants intention to accept new sanitation was measured with four items that reflect stern s typology of four different pro environmental behaviors in vbn theory stern 2000 to gage reaction to these items respondents were instructed to assume that new sanitation would be available in the netherlands a sample item is i would use new sanitation in my own house cronbach s α 0 78 2 4 analyses 2 4 1 vbn model to test whether vbn theory can be used to predict acceptance of new sanitation the vbn causal chain was tested using a series of regression analyses hoeksma et al 2017 steg et al 2005 following the causal chain of factors that lead from personal values to pro environmental behavior see fig 1 each variable was regressed onto its preceding variable in five phases see table 1 within each phase step 1 and step 2 were tested first the variable that directly influenced the dependent variable was entered in the regression analysis and formed step 1 and then the remaining variables from the chain were entered in the regression analysis and formed step 2 for example the first phase tested the relationship between pro environmental personal norms and intention step 1 and then a second regression analysis was conducted that included pro environmental personal norms plus the more distal predicting variables of the vbn model to predict intentions step 2 this procedure was repeated in each separate phase all the way back to the start of the vbn causal chain see table 1 for the five phases of regression analyses previous research suggests a higher chance on a type i error when multiple regressions are used and therefore the bonferroni correction was applied the significance level used for the analyses was p 006 0 05 divided by the nine analyses 2 4 2 mediation following the vbn model it is assumed that 1 a pro environmental personal norm mediates the relationship between ascribed responsibility and intention to use new sanitation 2 ascribed responsibility mediates the relationship between awareness of adverse consequences and pro environmental personal norms 3 awareness of adverse consequences mediates the role between the new ecological paradigm and ascribed responsibility and 4 the new ecological paradigm mediates the role between the three values biospheric altruistic and egoistic and awareness of adverse consequences mediation is indicated when a relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable runs via a mediating variable see fig 1 for the causal chain of factors that lead from personal values to pro environmental behavior this means that the independent variable influences a mediating variable the mediator which in turn influences the dependent variable baron and kenny 1986 therefore the mediator provides insight into the underlying process of the relation between the independent and the dependent variable following hoeksma et al 2017 to formally test for mediation a bootstrap analysis preacher and hayes 2004 was employed to test the reduction in the direct effect this approach involves computing 95 confidence intervals cis 5000 bootstrap resamples around indirect effects mediation is indicated by cis that do not contain zero 2 4 3 risk and benefit perceptions an additional regression analysis was performed in order to test whether an extended vbn model that included risk and benefit perceptions would better predict acceptance of new sanitation then in order to gain more insight into specific types of risk and benefit perceptions factor analyses were performed to generate clusters of risks and benefits finally the clusters thus obtained were used in a regression analysis to explore which specific risks and benefits were most predictive of acceptance of new sanitation 3 results 3 1 sample most respondents were female 63 the participants average age was 41 2 years sd 14 6 years and ranged from 19 to 82 years the most reported level of completed education was higher vocational education 38 and university education 29 bachelor master or phd the sample was representative to the general dutch population in terms of average age and completed level of education at the time of the survey 63 of the participants were living in owner occupied accommodation 35 were renting their accommodation 3 2 vbn model means standard deviations and correlations of the eight variables in the vbn model are reported in table 2 on the question of whether they would use new sanitation in their home if available 64 of the participants gave a positive answer to test the causal chain of vbn theory multiple regression analyses were performed see table 3 all models were at a significance level lower than 0 001 and therefore the bonferroni requirement p 006 is met for all regression analyses below the results per regression analysis are described pro environmental personal norms were positively associated with intention to accept new sanitation β 0 49 p 001 pro environmental personal norms significantly explained 24 of the variance in intention to accept new sanitation p 001 when the other variables further up the causal chain of the vbn model were added 29 of the variance in intention was explained pro environmental personal norms contributed the strongest to this model with β 0 34 p 001 after pro environmental personal norms ascribed responsibility explained most of the variance in intention to accept new sanitation β 0 16 p 001 and egoistic values β 0 15 p 01 and biospheric values β 0 13 p 05 also contributed significantly in phase 2 pro environmental personal norm acted as the dependent and ascribed responsibility as the independent variable in this model 43 of the variance in pro environmental personal norm was explained by ascribed responsibility β 0 66 p 001 when the other variables were added to the model step 2 ascribed responsibility still contributed the most to the variance in pro environmental personal norm β 0 39 p 001 biospheric values β 0 24 p 001 awareness of adverse consequences β 0 14 p 01 and new ecological paradigm β 0 14 p 01 also explained significant amounts of the variance in pro environmental personal norms this model explained 55 of the variance in pro environmental personal norm p 001 in the next phase the dependent variable was ascribed reponsibility awareness of adverse consequences explained 20 of the variance in ascribed reponsibility p 001 the stronger awareness of adverse consequences the stronger ascribed reponsibility β 0 45 p 001 in step 2 of phase 3 38 of the variance in ascribed reponsibility was explained p 001 the three factors biospheric values β 0 33 p 001 new ecological paradigm β 0 25 p 001 and awareness of adverse consequences β 0 18 p 001 positively predicted ascribed responsibility awareness of adverse consequences was the dependent variable in phase 4 in step 1 the independent variable new ecological paradigm β 0 51 p 001 explained 26 of the variance in awareness of adverse consequences p 001 in step 2 of phase 4 the independent variables new ecological paradigm β 0 38 p 001 biospheric values β 0 24 p 001 and egoistic values β 0 11 p 05 accounted for 31 of the variance in awareness of adverse consequences p 001 in phase 5 new ecological paradigm was the dependent variable the three values were the independent variables biospheric β 0 41 p 001 and egoistic β 0 19 p 001 were significant predictors altruistic β 0 08 ns was not together they explained 23 of the variance in the new ecological paradigm variable p 001 3 3 mediation the results of the bootstrap analyses for indirect effects are presented in table 4 fully in line with vbn theory the predicted mediating roles of pro environmental personal norms ascribed reponsibility awareness of adverse consequences and new ecological paradigm are supported by the bootstrapped estimates as the value 0 was not included in the respective 95 confidence intervals 3 4 risk and benefit perceptions means standard deviations and correlations of intention to accept new sanitation pro environmental personal norms and risk and benefit perceptions are reported in table 5 to test this extended model a regression analysis was performed that included two steps in the first step pro environmental personal norm was entered as this is the most proximal predictor of intention to accept new sanitation from the vbn model the second step included risk and benefit perceptions and allowed for testing whether adding these factors could better explain consumers intentions to accept new sanitation the results of this analysis are reported in table 6 step 1 of the regression analysis shows that a pro environmental personal norm was positively related to intention to accept new sanitation risk and benefit perceptions were entered in step 2 and this model shows that pro environmental personal norms and benefit perceptions were positively associated with intention to accept new sanitation whereas risk perceptions were negatively associated importantly the increase in explained variance rose considerably from r 2 0 27 to r 2 0 46 the standardized regression coefficients furthermore indicated that perceived benefits was the most important predictor of intention to accept new sanitation β 0 36 followed by pro environmental personal norms β 0 34 and perceived risks βs 0 17 factor analyses indicated that five specific groups of risk perceptions see appendix a for details and five specific groups of benefit perceptions see appendix b could be distinguished in order to test the relative influence of these risks and benefits a final analysis was performed in which intention to accept new sanitation was regressed on the categories of risks and benefits see table 7 three factors were found to contribute significantly to the model risk for daily use in the household β 0 29 p 001 benefits for the housing market β 0 29 p 001 and environmental benefits β 0 24 p 01 this model explained 44 of the variance in intention to accept new sanitation 4 general discussion this research aimed to explore 1 the general public s risk and benefit perceptions of new sanitation and 2 the general public s willingness to accept new sanitation we did so by using a survey based on vbn theory combined with measures of risk and benefit perceptions for new sanitation consequently this study contributes to the discussions around implementation of new sanitation research on vbn theory applied to other pro environmental behaviors e g steg et al 2005 on acceptability of pro environmental energy policies and jakovcevic and steg 2013 on sustainable transportation predicted a good fit the current study confirmed the hypothesized causal chain within vbn theory each variable was predictive of the variable next in the chain of vbn theory except for altruistic value orientation which did not significantly predict any other variable thus an individual who values the environment high score on biospheric value orientation scores higher on ecological worldview high score on new environmental paradigm is more aware of adverse consequences feels a higher ascription of responsibility and ultimately has a higher intention to accept new sanitation as expected egoistic value orientation was negatively related to new environmental paradigm meaning that individuals with a higher score on egoistic value orientation scored lower on environmental concern this is in line with previous studies de groot and steg 2007 hoeksma et al 2017 jansson et al 2011 altruistic value orientation had no significant relationship with new environmental paradigm this is consistent with several previous studies de groot and steg 2007 lind et al 2015 steg et al 2005 moreover in line with previous studies hoeksma et al 2017 jakovcevic and steg 2013 the results showed a mediation effect of all variables for their preceding and subsequent variables 4 1 risk and benefit perceptions the results of the regression analysis on risk and benefit perceptions showed that both risk and benefit perceptions predict acceptability of new sanitation surprisingly the results showed not only that vbn theory and risk and benefit perceptions successfully predict intention to accept new sanitation but also that in this case risk and benefits perceptions improve the vbn model considerably from 30 explained variance to 50 compared with studies that applied vbn theory to other pro environmental behavior it stands out that new sanitation is a much more technical and systemic innovation than many other topics involving behavior change e g use of transportation mode jakovcevic and steg 2013 lind et al 2015 acceptance of energy policies steg et al 2005 and donating to foundations de groot and steg 2008 consequently risk and benefit perceptions are crucial in the successful development of technical innovations an important result is that benefit perceptions contribute much more almost three times as much to intention to accept new sanitation than risk perceptions this creates a chance to emphasize the opportunities that new sanitation has to offer for example it can stimulate property developers to start thinking about new sanitation as a business opportunity by stressing the benefits of new sanitation in their communication as benefits were found to be the strongest predictor of acceptance following up on this finding factor analyses and additional regression analyses showed that only economic and environmental benefits contributed significantly to benefit perceptions in contrast only potentially needed behavioral change was a characteristic that contributed significantly to risk perceptions 4 2 implications for practice the property and land development sector is tangled up in what environmental activist jonathon porritt calls a circle of blame all stakeholders in the chain are caught up in a path dependency that limits them in stepping away from their traditional role and responsibilities from this position they accuse each other for too little growth in sustainable building van de griendt 2011 porritt also states that the only way to break through this vicious circle is if at least one of the stakeholders takes the initiative the present study offers insights into the general public s perceptions regarding the current discussion and can contribute to lowering the barrier to taking such an initiative in addition this study provides an overview of critical acceptance issues within new sanitation for decision makers e g municipalities water boards and property developers decision makers can use this to make better informed and reasoned choices about new sanitation another rather unexpected perception found in this study concerned the hygiene and public health implications of new sanitation regarding sanitation these are important and delicate issues especially for decision makers who have to ensure a system s hygiene and secure public health despite several studies showing that the treatment of black water is relatively straightforward de graaff et al 2010 dutch water boards for example are hesitant to innovate because the innovation could give rise to perceived concerns on these issues however in our study the general public did not indicate that they were highly concerned as the results showed that hygiene and public health risks do not influence intentions to accept new sanitation this finding could speed up innovative developments and guide decision making as it suggests that insecurity about the public s fear of risk to public health may be important but not particularly problematic apparently the public trust that new sanitation implemented according to good practices meets hygiene requirements as it has in numerous projects already so having ascertained that hygiene and public health do not predict the acceptance of new sanitation we turn to aspects that do play a role we found that the need to change behavior is the only perceived risk that influences the intention to accept new sanitation the higher the perceived risk of behavioral change the lower the intention to accept new sanitation this is in line with previous literature van vliet et al 2010 this information is very relevant for technical developers of new sanitation systems they can address this perceived risk in their design by minimizing behavioral adjustments or make the design flexible for gradual adjustment over time this knowledge adds to our findings on public health and hygiene and is valuable for decision makers who are in the phase of informing the general public about developments or projects it can guide them on the risks on which to focus as perceived by end users and that need to be addressed in information provision however in doing so one must be careful and in constant contact with the target group as perceptions might change and thus also the acceptance of new sanitation we found environmental gain to be a perceived benefit regarding communicating environmental gains bolderdijk et al 2013 state that communication about environmental consequences is motivational only for individuals who have a strong biospheric value orientation therefore on the basis of these results we argue for differentiating between target groups target groups can be identified using other behavior that results from high scores on value orientations for example high scores on biospheric value orientation result in consuming environmentally consciously or being passionate about nature in addition implementing new sanitation should be viewed as a sequential process requiring different types and modes of information tailored to the different target groups in different stages of the process the results of this research can be used to inform stakeholders and decision makers in the wastewater field about the public perception of new sanitation specifically the results can be used to target a specific group of stakeholders end users first value orientations were found to have an influence on intention to use new sanitation as discussed these value orientation can be used to guide communication towards end users in order to increase the use of new sanitation if available and to increase public acceptance and societal agenda setting in general biospheric values lead to a higher acceptance whereas egoistic values lead to a lower acceptance of new sanitation one way to stimulate pro environmental behavior in this case the acceptance of new sanitation is by strengthening biospheric values in specific situations de groot and steg 2009 that can be done by presenting information on why the pro environmental behavior is relevant de groot and steg 2009 thus in this case information on the environmental gains of new sanitation according to de groot and steg 2009 campaigns often fail to promote sustainable behavior because they neglect to include biospheric considerations and only focus on egoistic considerations if new sanitation is already implemented goal setting can be a stimulant to foster environmental behavior abrahamse et al 2005 goal setting is more effective if feedback is provided and at regular intervals abrahamse et al 2005 becker 1978 in the case of new sanitation this feedback e g the amount of energy and water saved or amount of nutrients recovered could be provided with smart meters in the future another relevant outcome for new sanitation s decision makers is the high number of participants who were positive about using new sanitation 64 of them indicated that they were somewhat likely to use new sanitation in their own home this high percentage of positive responses is consistent with previous research on nomix toilets a form of new sanitation in a study on actual nomix toilet users perceptions n 480 72 found the idea of nomix toilets convincing and 86 were willing to move to an apartment with nomix toilets lienert and larsen 2006 4 3 future steps several avenues for further research deserve discussion to start with in the realm of wastewater management including new sanitation there are many more stakeholders involved including property developers inter national and regional governments water boards water companies contractors investors and actors in the agricultural sector all these stakeholders fulfill a role in the development of existing and new sanitation consequently each of them could form a bottleneck for progress that being said the decision was made to focus this research on the perceptions of end users however the relations with and between the other stakeholders also merit further investigation for example it could be explored whether property developers perceive policy and extensive regulations to be barriers to implementing new sanitation systems and consequently it would be interesting to look into the tensions between property developers and governmental bodies furthermore the current study proposed an extended vbn model including risk and benefit perceptions for technical pro environmental innovations this proposed model was developed based on results in the current study but not tested more widely future studies could investigate the applicability of this extended model to other technical pro environmental innovations i e other circular innovations within the household finally although 64 of the participants indicated that they were willing to use new sanitation in their home the cost aspect of new sanitation is indicated as an important factor in recent studies eggimann et al 2016 schoen et al 2017 therefore it would be interesting to quantify what the general public is willing to pay for new sanitation and under what circumstances cf ishii and boyer 2016 in addition it would be interesting to look at the general public s actual adoption of new sanitation in real estate projects and underlying motivations for choosing new sanitation or not in that regard it should be mentioned that a potential caveat lies in the currently used method of convenience sampling therefore another avenue for research would be to replicate this study with a stratified sample of the general public 5 conclusion the dutch general public s perception of new sanitation can be best explained by the proposed extended vbn model including risk and benefit perceptions the majority of participants had a positive perception of new sanitation 64 indicated they would likely use new sanitation in their own home acknowledgement this research did not receive any specific

19773,current sanitation systems are inherently limited in their ability to address the new challenges for waste water management that arise from the rising demand to restore resource cycles these challenges include removal of micropollutants water re use and nutrient recovery new opportunities to address these challenges arise from new sanitation a system innovation that combines elements of source separation local treatment and reuse and less use of water new sanitation is applied but not yet widespread in several residential areas in europe implementation is hindered by the lack of insight into the general public s willingness to engage in new sanitation and the resulting uncertainty about this among decision makers and other stakeholders in wastewater management using value belief norm theory as a conceptual lens this paper addresses the individual motivations pro environmental personal norms and personal drivers benefits and barriers risks for acceptance of new sanitation by the dutch general public the results of an online survey n 338 indicated that both pro environmental personal norms and risk and benefit perceptions predict consumers willingness to accept new sanitation more specifically they showed that consumer acceptance is driven by perceived risks relating to the housing market and the need to change behavior but also by environmental benefits overall new sanitation was favorably evaluated by respondents 64 indicated that they would likely use new sanitation if they were owner occupiers the results of this explorative study are discussed in light of the development of novel sanitation systems that are sensitive to perceptions of end users and other key stakeholders keywords new sanitation decentralized sanitation pro environmental personal norms risk perception value belief norm theory wastewater 1 introduction state of the art sanitation systems are very effective in preventing human infection from pathogens present in feces and in processing sewage to wastewater treatment effluents that have acceptable ecological effects only when discharged to surface water however contemporary sanitation systems fuel several issues first sewage contains high loads of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients that are not only critical for agricultural production but also rely on finite or geopolitically sensitive resources ammonia production requires the use of fossil fuels and phosphorous is mined from the earth s crust in a limited number of countries secondly sewage increasingly contains micropollutants like pharmaceutical residues and hormones which represent partially still unknown risks for the environment schwindt et al 2014 removal of these pollutants in the current sanitation system requires large additional investments and additional energy and chemical costs davis 2008 so the currently used systems entail devaluation of human waste loss of nutrients waste of water and emission of residual pollutant loads to the environment and it is therefore increasingly questioned whether they are future proof larsen et al 2016 to address these issues new sanitation was developed in the netherlands and elsewhere hernández leal et al 2017 londong 2013 the new sanitation design aims at maximum recovery of energy and resources from domestic wastewater and at minimizing potable water use and emissions like pharmaceutical residues into the surface water tuantet et al 2014 using a systems approach rather than the end of pipe approach in new sanitation wastewater collection and treatment take place at local level keeping individual source flows like grey and black water separate thereby offering new options for minimizing resource use and restoring resource cycles for one thing water use is minimized for instance by using vacuum toilets also the minimal amount of water yields a more concentrated wastewater flow from which it is more cost effective to remove harmful micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and hormones de wilt et al 2016 and it becomes more feasible to recover valuable components de graaff et al 2011 like nutrients thus implementing new sanitation offers more opportunities for restoring the nutrient cycle finally energy can be saved with source separation and decentralization in two ways rittmann 2013 directly by producing renewable energy in useful forms heat methane and indirectly for example by lowering energy use for treatment and transport despite its potential new sanitation is not yet widely used this can partly be attributed to the currently used sanitation system sewers and centralized treatment plans which results from decades of development and investments switching to a new decentralized system would mean abandoning these investments and applying new decentralized infrastructure requires new investments resulting in a lock in cordell et al 2011 moreover sanitation is a systemic phenomenon embedded in a highly complex network of diverse stakeholders thus a multitude of stakeholders along the sanitation chain need to accept changes and adapt their behavior and practices in order to foster successful adoption of new sanitation this is a complex challenge important stakeholders in the netherlands include the end users general public property developers local governments water boards and users of the recovered resources e g agriculture and industry one of the current bottlenecks for the development of new sanitation is the uncertainty among property developers and other stakeholders about end users acceptance of new sanitation swart and palsma 2013 however whether the general public would accept new sanitation and its consequences for housing and daily practices like using vacuum toilets is currently largely unknown one recent study looked into university residents willingness to pay and general support for urine source separation at a us campus ishii and boyer 2016 but it is important to extend those analyses to other types of sanitation systems among different publics such as people who live in houses on a more permanent basis therefore this study focuses on the general public s perception of new sanitation and especially homeowners and potential homeowners several pilots demonstrations and full scale implementations in the field of new sanitation have been undertaken in the netherlands and elsewhere augustin et al 2014 hernández leal et al 2017 londong 2013 for some of these projects actual users perceptions were studied lienert and larsen 2010 naus and van vliet 2012 in these projects users were mostly positive about the use of new sanitation naus and van vliet 2012 however these studies did not look into the perceptions of the general public and whether they would be willing to commit themselves as homeowners to the pro environmental behavior of becoming a first time new sanitation user in our study stern s 2000 value belief norm vbn theory and people s risk and benefit perceptions are used to explore the dutch general public s intention to accept new sanitation the results of this study are discussed in relation to existing literature to ascertain implications for practice and future research 1 1 value belief norm theory value belief norm theory stern et al 1999 stern 2000 proposes a causal chain of factors that lead from personal values to pro environmental behavior fig 1 as its name suggests these factors are people s values beliefs and norms and each of these is elaborated below to begin with individuals hold different value orientations in life and each of these may have smaller or bigger weights for how they serve as stable guiding principles in their life schwartz 1992 three values are included in vbn theory stern et al 1999 stern 2000 first 1 biospheric values reflect people s belief that it is worth protecting nature because of its intrinsic value second 2 altruistic values deal with the welfare of others for example people that are close to a person finally 3 egoistic values are geared toward one s own welfare and tend to be negatively related to so called green consumer behavior whereas both altruistic and biospheric values have positive associations de groot and steg 2008 nordlund and garvill 2002 according to vbn theory the three values predict the next variable in the causal chain beliefs three kinds of beliefs are included in vbn theory 1 the new ecological paradigm people s ecological worldview representing their belief regarding the extent to which they think they can change or affect nature dunlap and van liere 1978 2 the awareness of adverse consequences for valued things people s awareness of threats to the environment han 2015 and 3 ascription of responsibility people s belief that their own actions could counter those threats finally ascribed responsibility has a direct effect on pro environmental personal norms these personal norms determine one s moral obligation to act in order to prevent negative impacts on the environment therefore pro environmental personal norms are the last part of the vbn causal chain that predicts people s behavior stern et al 1999 1 2 risk and benefit perceptions according to literature reviews vbn theory explains 19 35 of the variance in actual behavior stern et al 1999 kaiser et al 2005 this suggest that other factors are also important in predicting people s ecological behaviors the current study aims to explore people s willingness to accept new sanitation which for most people is a novel technology when it comes to acceptance of new technology perceptions of risk and benefit are generally important if not crucial e g hurlimann 2007 otway and von winterfeldt 1982 van dijk et al 2017 hence it is likely that the general public s evaluation of risks and benefits relating to new sanitation will be important predictors of their acceptance of this technology hurlimann 2007 gives examples of situations in which risk perception stood in the way of public acceptance of new technologies in specific countries like nuclear technologies and genetically modified food low public acceptance of a new technology often has negative consequences for its commercialization gupta et al 2012 suggest that this explains why research on societal acceptance of technology has been increasingly focused on risk and benefit perceptions the general public s risk perceptions are typically based on factual information but also importantly on feelings ethics preferences and attitudes daughton 2004 and can be ambiguous gregory et al 1995 perhaps not always fact based decision making concerning technologies is influenced by risk perceptions and these perceptions are based on a frame of reference and sometimes incomplete knowledge about the risk weisenfeld and ott 2011 perceived risks and benefits of a technology are not fixed concepts rather they are constantly subject to change and mediated by the current cultural understandings of acceptable risks a new technology may be perceived as risky but when it is embedded in routine behavior the perception of it can change to not risky flynn et al 2006 furthermore perceived risks and benefits also influence each other the level of perceived benefits influences the acceptability levels of the perceived risks fischhoff et al 2000 quezada et al 2016 studied the adoption of decentralized water systems in australia which can be considered a form of new sanitation they interviewed different stakeholders government officials property developers planning authorities consultants and technology providers and identified several drivers benefits and barriers risks reducing costs creating a green marketing position and enhancing a sustainable image and thus attracting more buyers water security and environmental impact were identified as drivers furthermore a driver that was fueled by necessity was identified an increasing bulk water price quezada and colleagues also identified barriers or risks to the development of decentralized wastewater systems first a perceived technology risk which consisted of financial and reliability risks secondly concerns about public health and water quality thirdly concerns about the governance regulation and legislation of the decentralized systems inspired by these findings we confronted people with potential benefits and risks relating to new sanitation to find out whether these are important in predicting the acceptance of the technology 2 methods 2 1 sample in order to answer our research questions an online self administered survey was conducted in january 2017 and distributed via various social media such as public social media pages linkedin facebook yammer 96 4 and the second author s personal network 1 7 targeted social media channels were diversified to prevent bias towards the author s personal networks the survey was aimed at the dutch general public aged 18 years and older in order to increase response three vouchers from a well known dutch online store worth 10 were raffled among participants in total 338 completed questionnaires were collected 2 2 procedure the survey consisted of several factors discussed in the theoretical section the questionnaire started off by asking questions about the participants value orientations the new environmental paradigm awareness of adverse consequences ascription of responsibility and pro environmental personal norms see supporting information for the survey items then a brief description of new sanitation was presented this description 244 words in total in dutch included an explanation of the concept vis à vis conventional sanitation systems furthermore possible gains of new sanitation were discussed the example of phosphorus recovery from human urine was given and some practical consequences for end users were mentioned e g use of vacuum toilet kitchen grinder higher initial costs after the description participants answered questions about perceived risks perceived benefits and intention to accept new sanitation finally demographic characteristics were assessed unless otherwise stated the questionnaire items were measured on 7 point likert scales matell and jacoby 1971 a question format in which participants were asked to react to statements by indicating their level of agreement 1 completely disagree 7 completely agree 2 3 measures value orientations were measured using steg and colleagues items steg et al 2005 and respondents were asked to indicate the importance they attached to a list of value objects each value orientation was represented by four items we checked the internal reliability of the set of items representing a variable and these items were collapsed into a single index after verifying that the cronbach alpha values cronbach 1951 were found to be 0 6 or higher a sample item on the biospheric value scale is preventing pollution 1 very unimportant 7 very important cronbach s α 0 72 for the altruistic value subscale social justice cronbach s α 0 78 and for the egoistic value subscale wealth cronbach s α 0 72 new environmental paradigm was measured with a 14 item scale based on the revised nep scale dunlap et al 2000 a sample item is humans are meant to rule over the rest of nature cronbach s α 0 79 awareness of adverse consequences was measured using three statements based on previous vbn research de groot and steg 2008 ryan and spash 2012 and adjusted for the present context so that they were directly relevant for new sanitation an example of an item is without proper precautions we will face the threat of insufficient clean drinking water in the future cronbach s α 0 65 ascription of responsibility was assessed using six items based on steg et al 2005 and de groot and steg 2008 an example of a statement is i can do something to reduce water pollution cronbach s α 0 73 pro environmental personal norms were assessed using six items based on de groot and steg 2007 and steg et al 2005 a sample item is i feel obliged to live as environmentally friendly as possible cronbach s α 0 85 perceived risks regarding new sanitation were assessed with 16 items developed for the purpose of this study reflecting potential risks health risks technical risks risks for daily use in the household risks for the housing market and environmental risks participants were asked to grade each of these items from 1 very low risk to 7 very high risk cronbach s α 0 92 only the responses of house proprietors and participants who expected to be a homeowner within three years were included n 241 we followed that procedure in order to ensure that questions around financial risks on the housing market would be relevant to the participants perceived benefits regarding new sanitation were assessed with 17 items reflecting benefits for daily use in the household the environment the housing market safety benefits and cost benefits the participants rated each item on a 7 point likert scale ranging from 1 no benefit to 7 very high benefit cronbach s α 0 92 the number of responses n 241 collected to measure perceived benefits was the same as the number for risk perception and for the same reason we were careful to ensure that items on perceived benefits regarding sales value and attractiveness to the housing market were relevant to the participants intention to accept new sanitation was measured with four items that reflect stern s typology of four different pro environmental behaviors in vbn theory stern 2000 to gage reaction to these items respondents were instructed to assume that new sanitation would be available in the netherlands a sample item is i would use new sanitation in my own house cronbach s α 0 78 2 4 analyses 2 4 1 vbn model to test whether vbn theory can be used to predict acceptance of new sanitation the vbn causal chain was tested using a series of regression analyses hoeksma et al 2017 steg et al 2005 following the causal chain of factors that lead from personal values to pro environmental behavior see fig 1 each variable was regressed onto its preceding variable in five phases see table 1 within each phase step 1 and step 2 were tested first the variable that directly influenced the dependent variable was entered in the regression analysis and formed step 1 and then the remaining variables from the chain were entered in the regression analysis and formed step 2 for example the first phase tested the relationship between pro environmental personal norms and intention step 1 and then a second regression analysis was conducted that included pro environmental personal norms plus the more distal predicting variables of the vbn model to predict intentions step 2 this procedure was repeated in each separate phase all the way back to the start of the vbn causal chain see table 1 for the five phases of regression analyses previous research suggests a higher chance on a type i error when multiple regressions are used and therefore the bonferroni correction was applied the significance level used for the analyses was p 006 0 05 divided by the nine analyses 2 4 2 mediation following the vbn model it is assumed that 1 a pro environmental personal norm mediates the relationship between ascribed responsibility and intention to use new sanitation 2 ascribed responsibility mediates the relationship between awareness of adverse consequences and pro environmental personal norms 3 awareness of adverse consequences mediates the role between the new ecological paradigm and ascribed responsibility and 4 the new ecological paradigm mediates the role between the three values biospheric altruistic and egoistic and awareness of adverse consequences mediation is indicated when a relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable runs via a mediating variable see fig 1 for the causal chain of factors that lead from personal values to pro environmental behavior this means that the independent variable influences a mediating variable the mediator which in turn influences the dependent variable baron and kenny 1986 therefore the mediator provides insight into the underlying process of the relation between the independent and the dependent variable following hoeksma et al 2017 to formally test for mediation a bootstrap analysis preacher and hayes 2004 was employed to test the reduction in the direct effect this approach involves computing 95 confidence intervals cis 5000 bootstrap resamples around indirect effects mediation is indicated by cis that do not contain zero 2 4 3 risk and benefit perceptions an additional regression analysis was performed in order to test whether an extended vbn model that included risk and benefit perceptions would better predict acceptance of new sanitation then in order to gain more insight into specific types of risk and benefit perceptions factor analyses were performed to generate clusters of risks and benefits finally the clusters thus obtained were used in a regression analysis to explore which specific risks and benefits were most predictive of acceptance of new sanitation 3 results 3 1 sample most respondents were female 63 the participants average age was 41 2 years sd 14 6 years and ranged from 19 to 82 years the most reported level of completed education was higher vocational education 38 and university education 29 bachelor master or phd the sample was representative to the general dutch population in terms of average age and completed level of education at the time of the survey 63 of the participants were living in owner occupied accommodation 35 were renting their accommodation 3 2 vbn model means standard deviations and correlations of the eight variables in the vbn model are reported in table 2 on the question of whether they would use new sanitation in their home if available 64 of the participants gave a positive answer to test the causal chain of vbn theory multiple regression analyses were performed see table 3 all models were at a significance level lower than 0 001 and therefore the bonferroni requirement p 006 is met for all regression analyses below the results per regression analysis are described pro environmental personal norms were positively associated with intention to accept new sanitation β 0 49 p 001 pro environmental personal norms significantly explained 24 of the variance in intention to accept new sanitation p 001 when the other variables further up the causal chain of the vbn model were added 29 of the variance in intention was explained pro environmental personal norms contributed the strongest to this model with β 0 34 p 001 after pro environmental personal norms ascribed responsibility explained most of the variance in intention to accept new sanitation β 0 16 p 001 and egoistic values β 0 15 p 01 and biospheric values β 0 13 p 05 also contributed significantly in phase 2 pro environmental personal norm acted as the dependent and ascribed responsibility as the independent variable in this model 43 of the variance in pro environmental personal norm was explained by ascribed responsibility β 0 66 p 001 when the other variables were added to the model step 2 ascribed responsibility still contributed the most to the variance in pro environmental personal norm β 0 39 p 001 biospheric values β 0 24 p 001 awareness of adverse consequences β 0 14 p 01 and new ecological paradigm β 0 14 p 01 also explained significant amounts of the variance in pro environmental personal norms this model explained 55 of the variance in pro environmental personal norm p 001 in the next phase the dependent variable was ascribed reponsibility awareness of adverse consequences explained 20 of the variance in ascribed reponsibility p 001 the stronger awareness of adverse consequences the stronger ascribed reponsibility β 0 45 p 001 in step 2 of phase 3 38 of the variance in ascribed reponsibility was explained p 001 the three factors biospheric values β 0 33 p 001 new ecological paradigm β 0 25 p 001 and awareness of adverse consequences β 0 18 p 001 positively predicted ascribed responsibility awareness of adverse consequences was the dependent variable in phase 4 in step 1 the independent variable new ecological paradigm β 0 51 p 001 explained 26 of the variance in awareness of adverse consequences p 001 in step 2 of phase 4 the independent variables new ecological paradigm β 0 38 p 001 biospheric values β 0 24 p 001 and egoistic values β 0 11 p 05 accounted for 31 of the variance in awareness of adverse consequences p 001 in phase 5 new ecological paradigm was the dependent variable the three values were the independent variables biospheric β 0 41 p 001 and egoistic β 0 19 p 001 were significant predictors altruistic β 0 08 ns was not together they explained 23 of the variance in the new ecological paradigm variable p 001 3 3 mediation the results of the bootstrap analyses for indirect effects are presented in table 4 fully in line with vbn theory the predicted mediating roles of pro environmental personal norms ascribed reponsibility awareness of adverse consequences and new ecological paradigm are supported by the bootstrapped estimates as the value 0 was not included in the respective 95 confidence intervals 3 4 risk and benefit perceptions means standard deviations and correlations of intention to accept new sanitation pro environmental personal norms and risk and benefit perceptions are reported in table 5 to test this extended model a regression analysis was performed that included two steps in the first step pro environmental personal norm was entered as this is the most proximal predictor of intention to accept new sanitation from the vbn model the second step included risk and benefit perceptions and allowed for testing whether adding these factors could better explain consumers intentions to accept new sanitation the results of this analysis are reported in table 6 step 1 of the regression analysis shows that a pro environmental personal norm was positively related to intention to accept new sanitation risk and benefit perceptions were entered in step 2 and this model shows that pro environmental personal norms and benefit perceptions were positively associated with intention to accept new sanitation whereas risk perceptions were negatively associated importantly the increase in explained variance rose considerably from r 2 0 27 to r 2 0 46 the standardized regression coefficients furthermore indicated that perceived benefits was the most important predictor of intention to accept new sanitation β 0 36 followed by pro environmental personal norms β 0 34 and perceived risks βs 0 17 factor analyses indicated that five specific groups of risk perceptions see appendix a for details and five specific groups of benefit perceptions see appendix b could be distinguished in order to test the relative influence of these risks and benefits a final analysis was performed in which intention to accept new sanitation was regressed on the categories of risks and benefits see table 7 three factors were found to contribute significantly to the model risk for daily use in the household β 0 29 p 001 benefits for the housing market β 0 29 p 001 and environmental benefits β 0 24 p 01 this model explained 44 of the variance in intention to accept new sanitation 4 general discussion this research aimed to explore 1 the general public s risk and benefit perceptions of new sanitation and 2 the general public s willingness to accept new sanitation we did so by using a survey based on vbn theory combined with measures of risk and benefit perceptions for new sanitation consequently this study contributes to the discussions around implementation of new sanitation research on vbn theory applied to other pro environmental behaviors e g steg et al 2005 on acceptability of pro environmental energy policies and jakovcevic and steg 2013 on sustainable transportation predicted a good fit the current study confirmed the hypothesized causal chain within vbn theory each variable was predictive of the variable next in the chain of vbn theory except for altruistic value orientation which did not significantly predict any other variable thus an individual who values the environment high score on biospheric value orientation scores higher on ecological worldview high score on new environmental paradigm is more aware of adverse consequences feels a higher ascription of responsibility and ultimately has a higher intention to accept new sanitation as expected egoistic value orientation was negatively related to new environmental paradigm meaning that individuals with a higher score on egoistic value orientation scored lower on environmental concern this is in line with previous studies de groot and steg 2007 hoeksma et al 2017 jansson et al 2011 altruistic value orientation had no significant relationship with new environmental paradigm this is consistent with several previous studies de groot and steg 2007 lind et al 2015 steg et al 2005 moreover in line with previous studies hoeksma et al 2017 jakovcevic and steg 2013 the results showed a mediation effect of all variables for their preceding and subsequent variables 4 1 risk and benefit perceptions the results of the regression analysis on risk and benefit perceptions showed that both risk and benefit perceptions predict acceptability of new sanitation surprisingly the results showed not only that vbn theory and risk and benefit perceptions successfully predict intention to accept new sanitation but also that in this case risk and benefits perceptions improve the vbn model considerably from 30 explained variance to 50 compared with studies that applied vbn theory to other pro environmental behavior it stands out that new sanitation is a much more technical and systemic innovation than many other topics involving behavior change e g use of transportation mode jakovcevic and steg 2013 lind et al 2015 acceptance of energy policies steg et al 2005 and donating to foundations de groot and steg 2008 consequently risk and benefit perceptions are crucial in the successful development of technical innovations an important result is that benefit perceptions contribute much more almost three times as much to intention to accept new sanitation than risk perceptions this creates a chance to emphasize the opportunities that new sanitation has to offer for example it can stimulate property developers to start thinking about new sanitation as a business opportunity by stressing the benefits of new sanitation in their communication as benefits were found to be the strongest predictor of acceptance following up on this finding factor analyses and additional regression analyses showed that only economic and environmental benefits contributed significantly to benefit perceptions in contrast only potentially needed behavioral change was a characteristic that contributed significantly to risk perceptions 4 2 implications for practice the property and land development sector is tangled up in what environmental activist jonathon porritt calls a circle of blame all stakeholders in the chain are caught up in a path dependency that limits them in stepping away from their traditional role and responsibilities from this position they accuse each other for too little growth in sustainable building van de griendt 2011 porritt also states that the only way to break through this vicious circle is if at least one of the stakeholders takes the initiative the present study offers insights into the general public s perceptions regarding the current discussion and can contribute to lowering the barrier to taking such an initiative in addition this study provides an overview of critical acceptance issues within new sanitation for decision makers e g municipalities water boards and property developers decision makers can use this to make better informed and reasoned choices about new sanitation another rather unexpected perception found in this study concerned the hygiene and public health implications of new sanitation regarding sanitation these are important and delicate issues especially for decision makers who have to ensure a system s hygiene and secure public health despite several studies showing that the treatment of black water is relatively straightforward de graaff et al 2010 dutch water boards for example are hesitant to innovate because the innovation could give rise to perceived concerns on these issues however in our study the general public did not indicate that they were highly concerned as the results showed that hygiene and public health risks do not influence intentions to accept new sanitation this finding could speed up innovative developments and guide decision making as it suggests that insecurity about the public s fear of risk to public health may be important but not particularly problematic apparently the public trust that new sanitation implemented according to good practices meets hygiene requirements as it has in numerous projects already so having ascertained that hygiene and public health do not predict the acceptance of new sanitation we turn to aspects that do play a role we found that the need to change behavior is the only perceived risk that influences the intention to accept new sanitation the higher the perceived risk of behavioral change the lower the intention to accept new sanitation this is in line with previous literature van vliet et al 2010 this information is very relevant for technical developers of new sanitation systems they can address this perceived risk in their design by minimizing behavioral adjustments or make the design flexible for gradual adjustment over time this knowledge adds to our findings on public health and hygiene and is valuable for decision makers who are in the phase of informing the general public about developments or projects it can guide them on the risks on which to focus as perceived by end users and that need to be addressed in information provision however in doing so one must be careful and in constant contact with the target group as perceptions might change and thus also the acceptance of new sanitation we found environmental gain to be a perceived benefit regarding communicating environmental gains bolderdijk et al 2013 state that communication about environmental consequences is motivational only for individuals who have a strong biospheric value orientation therefore on the basis of these results we argue for differentiating between target groups target groups can be identified using other behavior that results from high scores on value orientations for example high scores on biospheric value orientation result in consuming environmentally consciously or being passionate about nature in addition implementing new sanitation should be viewed as a sequential process requiring different types and modes of information tailored to the different target groups in different stages of the process the results of this research can be used to inform stakeholders and decision makers in the wastewater field about the public perception of new sanitation specifically the results can be used to target a specific group of stakeholders end users first value orientations were found to have an influence on intention to use new sanitation as discussed these value orientation can be used to guide communication towards end users in order to increase the use of new sanitation if available and to increase public acceptance and societal agenda setting in general biospheric values lead to a higher acceptance whereas egoistic values lead to a lower acceptance of new sanitation one way to stimulate pro environmental behavior in this case the acceptance of new sanitation is by strengthening biospheric values in specific situations de groot and steg 2009 that can be done by presenting information on why the pro environmental behavior is relevant de groot and steg 2009 thus in this case information on the environmental gains of new sanitation according to de groot and steg 2009 campaigns often fail to promote sustainable behavior because they neglect to include biospheric considerations and only focus on egoistic considerations if new sanitation is already implemented goal setting can be a stimulant to foster environmental behavior abrahamse et al 2005 goal setting is more effective if feedback is provided and at regular intervals abrahamse et al 2005 becker 1978 in the case of new sanitation this feedback e g the amount of energy and water saved or amount of nutrients recovered could be provided with smart meters in the future another relevant outcome for new sanitation s decision makers is the high number of participants who were positive about using new sanitation 64 of them indicated that they were somewhat likely to use new sanitation in their own home this high percentage of positive responses is consistent with previous research on nomix toilets a form of new sanitation in a study on actual nomix toilet users perceptions n 480 72 found the idea of nomix toilets convincing and 86 were willing to move to an apartment with nomix toilets lienert and larsen 2006 4 3 future steps several avenues for further research deserve discussion to start with in the realm of wastewater management including new sanitation there are many more stakeholders involved including property developers inter national and regional governments water boards water companies contractors investors and actors in the agricultural sector all these stakeholders fulfill a role in the development of existing and new sanitation consequently each of them could form a bottleneck for progress that being said the decision was made to focus this research on the perceptions of end users however the relations with and between the other stakeholders also merit further investigation for example it could be explored whether property developers perceive policy and extensive regulations to be barriers to implementing new sanitation systems and consequently it would be interesting to look into the tensions between property developers and governmental bodies furthermore the current study proposed an extended vbn model including risk and benefit perceptions for technical pro environmental innovations this proposed model was developed based on results in the current study but not tested more widely future studies could investigate the applicability of this extended model to other technical pro environmental innovations i e other circular innovations within the household finally although 64 of the participants indicated that they were willing to use new sanitation in their home the cost aspect of new sanitation is indicated as an important factor in recent studies eggimann et al 2016 schoen et al 2017 therefore it would be interesting to quantify what the general public is willing to pay for new sanitation and under what circumstances cf ishii and boyer 2016 in addition it would be interesting to look at the general public s actual adoption of new sanitation in real estate projects and underlying motivations for choosing new sanitation or not in that regard it should be mentioned that a potential caveat lies in the currently used method of convenience sampling therefore another avenue for research would be to replicate this study with a stratified sample of the general public 5 conclusion the dutch general public s perception of new sanitation can be best explained by the proposed extended vbn model including risk and benefit perceptions the majority of participants had a positive perception of new sanitation 64 indicated they would likely use new sanitation in their own home acknowledgement this research did not receive any specific

19774,differential uv spectroscopy defined as the difference in uv absorbance spectra before and after chlorination has shown great potential to predict disinfection by product dbp concentrations at laboratory scale however so far no results have been reported on the full scale application of differential uv spectroscopy in drinking water treatment facilities the objectives of this study are to determine if relationships can be developed between differential uv absorbance and dbp concentrations for both regulated and unregulated dbps in a full scale facility and to determine if these relationships vary throughout the year with variations in raw water quality and treatment conditions the results show that linear and power relationships between differential uv absorbance and dbp concentrations can be developed 0 62 r2 0 99 although differences between relationships obtained in lab and full scale conditions need further investigation finally the relationships obtained are different from one sampling campaign to another which raises the question of whether it is possible to determine relationships that are stable enough to be used as adequate feedback on dbp

and rodriguez 2004 2011 and kinetic gallard and von gunten 2002 korshin et al 2004 sohn et al 2004 models based on operational and water quality parameters e g chlorine dose natural organic matter indicators temperature ph contact time and others to provide more frequent estimates of dbp concentrations these estimates are not valid for regulatory compliance but could be used to evaluate the impact of raw water variations or operational changes on dbp formation to plan sampling campaigns in distribution networks or simply to provide more frequent feedback on plant performances in terms of dbp precursor removal and occurrence an alternative approach for estimating dbp concentrations differential uv absorbance δa has been proposed by korshin et al 1996 the approach consists in measuring uv absorbance before chlorination and after a given contact time in laboratory conditions the difference in uv absorbance at a wavelength of 272 nm between the two measurements has been shown to be linearly proportional to the concentration of many regulated dbps including trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas korshin et al 2002a li et al 1998 uyak and demirbas 2014 as well as some unregulated dbps korshin et al 2004 2002a 2002b roccaro and vagliasindi 2010 reported correlations between δa and dbp concentrations obtained through laboratory batch chlorination experiments are at least as strong as results obtained by empirical and kinetic models korshin et al 2002b 2002a li et al 1998 roccaro et al 2008a roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 2010 also while uv absorbance of low specific uv absorbance suva waters may not be proportional to the formation potential of dbps δa has shown to be a good surrogate to dbp measurements in waters with various suvas korshin et al 2002a korshin and chang 2008 roccaro et al 2008b it has been shown that dbp concentrations are better correlated to δa at 272 nm than at 254 nm a wavelength at which uv absorbance is more widely monitored roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 however to the best of our knowledge full scale applications of δa have not been reported in peer reviewed literature previous work marcoux et al 2017 has shown that about 80 of the dbps measured in the distribution network in some cases are already formed when the water leaves the plant and enters the distribution network therefore δa could lend itself as a useful tool for the estimation of dbps to characterize their formation at the treatment plant the objectives of this study are first to determine the applicability of dbp δa relationships as a surrogate for grab sampling and analyses of individual dbps and secondly to provide a better understanding of regulated and non regulated dbp formation throughout the plant this paper presents a first attempt at applying δa in a full scale facility for dbp monitoring purposes 2 methodology 2 1 case study the facility in this study has been worked on previously marcoux et al 2017 and is located in the city of st jérôme quebec canada and takes its water from the du nord river that flows south from the laurentian mountains the treatment plant fig 1 consists of a slightly modified conventional treatment train potassium permanganate kmno4 is used on the raw water as a pre oxidant coagulation and settling is conducted on five parallel trains two ballasted actiflo veolia water technologies canada floc settlers and three conventional settling basins inter chlorination with sodium hypochlorite takes place after settling but before filtration in all settling trains at around 1 h before primary disinfection with chlorine the flow on conventional settlers is held almost constant while the flow treated by the ballasted floc settlers is adjusted to account for daily variations in water demand 12 dual media i e sand and activated carbon filters treat water from the ballasted floc and conventional settlers six for each stream backwash and filter ripening waters are sent to waste and do not contribute to dbp levels in the plant once the filter effluents are mixed primary disinfection is conducted with sodium hypochlorite before entering the contact tank chlorination is followed by uv disinfection also for primary disinfection and chlorine dioxide for oxidation purposes the total reservoir volume between the effluent of the filters and the entrance of the distribution system is about 36 000 m3 providing a hydraulic retention time of about 20 h for an average flow of 45 000 m3 day there is no other reservoir in the distribution network 2 2 sampling strategy this study is based on intensive seasonal multi point daily sampling campaigns that were designed according to the different location of the various chlorination points and the water residence time within this treatment plant four intensive 24 h sampling campaigns were carried out on october 2015 fall december 2015 early winter march 2016 early spring and july 2016 summer for seasonal characterization of dbp formation regulated dbps thms and haas were measured in each campaign while non regulated dbps haloacetonitriles hans chloropicrin cpk and haloketones hks were measured only in the last two campaigns other water quality and operational parameters including differential uv absorbance δa were also measured in each campaign samples were taken at 15 points throughout the plant fig 1 10 of which were located after the first chlorination point sampling locations were chosen to adequately characterize the impact of coagulation on natural organic matter nom rw s1 s2 s4 s5 and to provide dbp concentrations after short and long reaction times in the reservoirs before s3 s6 s7 s8 and after s9 s10 s11 s12 s13 dw the addition of chlorine dioxide unregulated dbps were measured at sampling points s3 s6 s8 s10 s12 and dw average travel time after the first chlorination points is also indicated for each point in fig 1 to establish dbp δa relationships in a laboratory setting batch chlorination tests are deployed to ensure that the same water is used to measure the uv absorbance spectra at varying reaction times accordingly in a full scale treatment plant the same water must be followed throughout the treatment plant this was achieved by first sampling from the most upstream sampling point the inlet and then by sampling at the other sampling points according to the travel time of the water from the inlet to that point the description of travel time estimation is presented in supplementary text st1 uv absorbance spectra were measured on samples from sampling points rw s1 s2 s3 s5 s6 s7 s9 s10 s11 s13 and dw sample s2 was chosen as the t 0 sample for calculating δas samples s5 and s6 were not used because they are in parallel to samples s2 and s3 fig 1 and their absorbance were almost identical to those from samples s2 and s3 as a result 7 dbp δa data pairs are available for the regulated dbps s3 s7 s9 s10 s11 s13 and dw and 3 for the unregulated dbps s3 s10 and dw only 2 3 analytical procedures for dbps and physicochemical parameters free and total chlorine residuals ammonia temperature turbidity and ph were measured in situ at the time of sampling chlorine residuals were measured using the dpd colorimetric method hach 8021 and hach 8167 with a hach dr 4000 spectrophotometer ammonia was analysed using the salicylate method hach 10023 with the same spectrophotometer temperature and ph were determined using a denver instrument ap15 ph mv fet meter turbidity was measured using a hach 2100n laboratory turbidimeter one liter samples collected in polyethylene bottles were quenched using a solution of 10 g l of sodium sulphite and used to measure dissolved organic carbon doc and uv absorbance spectra sodium sulphite was preferred to ammonium chloride because it does not interfere with uv measurement when dosed adequately while ammonium chloride forms monochloramines that exhibit high uv absorbance thus causing interference the volume of sodium sulphite solution was adjusted to neutralize the free chlorine residual measured previously with a safety factor of 2 this safety factor ensured that all free chlorine was quenched while the excess sodium sulphite concentration was low enough that it did not interfere with uv absorbance in the range of wavelengths of interest 260 280 nm in all cases the excess sodium sulphite was never higher than 2 5 mg l in the sample the samples were kept in the dark at 4 c before the analyses less than 48 h after sample collection the samples were filtered using a vacuum pump set up on 0 7 μm glass microfiber filters pre carbonized at 550 c for 2 h the doc was measured in triplicate with a sievers 5310c laboratory toc analyser sievers 900 autosampler means are reported herein the uv absorbance spectra of the filtered samples between wavelengths of 200 and 350 nm were obtained using 5 or 10 cm quartz cells and a double beam agilent cary 100 uv vis spectrophotometer blanks and baseline samples consisted of nanofiltered demineralized water samples for bromide analysis were first collected in 1 l amber polypropylene bottles to which 0 5 ml of a 100 ppm ethylene diamine solution was added as a preservative agent approximately 50 ml of each sample was filtered on 0 45 μm digifilters within 14 days of the sampling and filtration filtrates were analysed by ion chromatography on a thermofisher ics 4000 capillary hpic coupled with a dionex as ap autosampler the method quantification limit was 6 5 μg l the analyses of regulated and unregulated dbps has been described previously mercier shanks et al 2013 briefly samples for thm and haa analyses were collected in 40 ml glass vials pre dosed with 4 98 g of ammonium chloride because it has shown to be an adequate quenching agent for the conservation of dbps in our own previous trials and in previous studies kristiana et al 2014 thms were extracted using solid phase microextraction spme fibres and analysed with gas chromatography with ion trap mass spectrometry gc ms haas were extracted using liquid liquid extraction in mtbe and the extracts were analysed using gas chromatography with electron capture detection gc ecd the thms analysed are the chlorinated and brominated thms namely chloroform tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform tbm commonly known as thm4 the haas analysed are the 5 regulated haas haa5 in the province of québec i e mono di and tri chloroacetic acids mcaa dcaa tcaa mono and di bromoacetic acids mbaa dbaa and an unregulated haa bromochloroacetic acids bcaa the total of which we name haa6 the method quantification limits were 1 1 μg l 0 6 μg l 1 0 μg l 0 8 μg l and 1 0 μg l for tcm bdcm dbcm tbm and all haas respectively samples for hans cpk and hks were collected in 60 ml glass vials pre dosed with 6 45 g of ammonium chloride and 1 00 g of phosphate buffer to adjust the ph of the sample to approximately 5 for the preservation of han these non regulated dbps were extracted using liquid liquid extraction and were analysed with gc ecd the method quantification limit was 0 01 μg l for all non regulated dbps 3 results and discussion 3 1 raw water characteristics the raw water characteristics of the four campaigns are given in table 1 the results show a stable ph and a relatively stable turbidity ammonia in raw water was low during all campaigns except the spring campaign when it was 0 12 mg n l and thus exerted a theoretical chlorine demand of 0 91 mg l 7 6 mg cl2 mg n nh3 doc was relatively high during the summer campaign and low in the spring campaign with average values in fall and early winter campaigns which is in accordance with typical patterns observed in this region although fall values are sometimes reported to be as high as or higher than summer values rodriguez et al 2004 scheili et al 2015 suva i e uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 on a doc basis only varied from 3 44 summer to 3 78 l mg m early winter from one campaign to another suggesting that the coagulability of the nom did not vary greatly finally bromide ion was consistently found in concentrations lower than 15 μg l and was below the detection limit in the spring campaign 3 2 operational parameters and physicochemical characteristics of the water the relevant operational parameters of the facility for the four campaigns are given in table 2 coagulant polymer and chlorine doses are given for the trains with conventional settlers neglecting the chlorine demand exerted by ammonia and considering the chlorine demand of other inorganics e g metals to be eliminated by pre oxidation the inter chlorination dose of the summer campaign is the highest the post chlorination and total chlorine doses of the summer campaign are also the highest as expected based on higher temperatures higher doc concentrations and higher uv254 of both raw and coagulated water as shown in table 3 the post chlorination dose is higher in the summer campaign despite a higher clo2 dose which has been shown to lower chlorine demand and dbp formation arora et al 2001 korshin et al 2002a globally these higher chlorine doses indicate that more dbps are probably formed following both the inter chlorination and post chlorination points alum dosages are established by the operators based on experience in order to attain and exceed the regulatory requirements of filtered water turbidity however alum dosage is controlled by both turbidity and nom content of the raw water to be coagulated babcock and singer 1979 edzwald 1993 oliver and lawrence 1979 pernitsky and edzwald 2006 and greatly influences dbp precursor removal in the present study the low raw water turbidity levels mean that the alum dosage should be based almost exclusively on nom content as an indicator of adequate coagulant dosage mass ratios of aluminum to doc concentration edzwald 1993 and of aluminum to uv254 edzwald and kaminski 2009 pernitsky and edzwald 2006 have been computed and are shown in table 2 the al doc ratio is close to the recommended value in all campaigns except the summer campaign the al uv254 ratio is significantly lower in the summer campaign and lower than the recommendations by edzwald and kaminski 2009 18 6 24 4 mg al l cm 1 for similar waters table 3 shows that the removal rates of doc and uv254 by coagulation flocculation settling in the summer campaign are 65 and 83 respectively which is slightly higher than the values obtained for the other campaigns however because the doc and uv254 of the raw water were higher in the summer campaign they remain high in the coagulated water in the summer campaign as discussed in the next section dbp concentrations are as a result higher in the summer campaign ph of the water changes in the plant according to the various treatment processes first upstream dosing of sodium hydroxide is used to reach a coagulation ph between 6 0 and 7 0 depending on water temperature thus chlorine is first applied in water with a ph in that range then sodium hydroxide is added along with chlorine at the post chlorination point to increase ph to around 8 0 at sampling point s7 lastly alkalinity and carbonate saturation are controlled by the addition of carbon dioxide and lime which result in a finished water ph of 9 0 given that the formation reactions and kinetics are ph dependent for some dbps notably thms and haas these ph changes might also affect the dbp δa relationships this is discussed further in section 4 3 3 dbp occurrence fig 2 shows the time profiles of thm4 and haa6 for the four campaigns according to estimated travel time with t0 defined as the moment of the first sodium hypochlorite dosing inter chlorination the time profile of individual dbps can be found in the supplementary information figures s 1 to s 6 one data point is missing on figs 2 4 and 5 for the early winter and summer campaign because the sampling lines from points s10 and s11 respectively were insufficiently flushed before sampling leading to unrealistic results for dbps and physicochemical parameters mbaa and dbaa were never detected during the campaigns the general trends for all dbps shown here is in accordance with previous studies gallard and von gunten 2002 gang et al 2002 korshin et al 2004 sohn et al 2004 i e rapid formation initially occurs during the first few hours followed by a continuous slow formation of dbps on a time scale of hours to days unregulated dbp time profiles are shown in fig 3 time profile of individual unregulated dbps are shown in figures s 7 to s 12 the concentrations obtained in the summer campaign are consistent with the results of another study on the same facility marcoux et al 2017 in such study weekly sampling during the warm season end of may to early october helped to determine the range of dbp concentrations at various points within the treatment plant and distribution system all regulated and non regulated dbp concentrations in our study fall within these ranges thm4 tcm and bdcm time profiles are very similar for the fall early winter and early spring campaigns for thm4 a rapid reaction occurred forming just over 20 μg l in the first 2 h in the following hours the formation rate decreased to a minimum approximately 6 h after inter chlorination at a thm4 concentration of approximately 30 μg l this time corresponds to the point of injection of chlorine dioxide before leaving the plant the concentrations reached about 35 μg l in the summer campaign however the rapid reaction formed about 30 μg l in less than 30 min and the concentration increased to over 50 μg l at the entrance of the distribution system after a residence time shorter than the previous campaigns because of the higher water demand in the summer about 17 h vs 20 22 h tcm concentrations represent about 90 of the thm4 while bdcm accounts for the remainder since no other thms were detected in all campaigns dcaa and tcaa concentrations represent more than 90 of the haa6 concentrations with dcaa concentrations slightly higher than tcaa concentrations in all campaigns haa6 concentrations follow the trend of thm4 concentrations the only difference between them and thm4 concentrations is that haa6 concentrations are slightly higher in the fall campaign than in the early winter and early spring campaigns haa6 concentration in the summer campaign reached over 50 μg l at the dw sampling point higher thm and haa concentrations in the summer are consistent with prior research rodriguez et al 2007 summerhayes et al 2011 williams et al 1997 mcaa concentrations are close to the detection limit of 1 μg l in all campaigns in the summer campaign mcaa are not detected at any location in the treatment plant while in the early winter campaign it is only detected at the dw sampling point at a concentration equal to the detection limit of 1 μg l interpretation of these results is risky because of the low concentrations involved clearly however the characteristics of the nom and the chlorination conditions favor the formation of the other haas mostly dcaa and tcaa bcaa concentrations are low as expected based on bromide concentrations in the raw water bcaa is not detected in the early spring campaign while bdcm is detected at levels similar to those of the fall and early winter campaigns total haloacetonitriles thans is the sum of dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloroacetonitrile tcan bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dibromoacetonitrile dban dcan accounts for about 80 of all han measured in the two campaigns and bcan accounts for the remaining 20 which is consistent with previous results found on waters with low bromide concentrations roccaro et al 2013 tcan and dban were found in concentrations varying from 0 01 to 0 05 μg l as can be seen in fig 3 hans seem to degrade after a certain amount of time in the summer campaign for this facility marcoux et al 2017 attributed this degradation to high ph around 8 high temperatures in the summer and the presence of a free residual chlorine as suggested by reckhow et al 2001 this result is consistent with those obtained by korshin et al 2002b for dcan interestingly these conditions except for high temperatures were present in the spring campaign although the degradation was not observed in the treatment plant and reservoir it is not possible to conclude if the degradation simply slows down and occurs nonetheless in the distribution system or if low temperatures prevent the degradation completely cpk concentrations are low with a maximum of 0 52 μg l reached in the summer campaign cpk concentration has behaviour similar to the thm concentrations i e it increases rapidly in the first few hours then slowly but steadily in the presence of a free chlorine residual and dbp precursors the time profile shown in fig 3 is consistent with this behaviour and with previous observations chiang et al 2010 marcoux et al 2017 mercier shanks et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 however observed the degradation of cpk at high temperatures such as those reached in a water heater and cole et al 2007 studied the degradation mechanisms of cpk in water the small decrease in concentration at the dw sampling point in the summer campaign could be explained by degradation although it is not possible to conclude first because the difference 0 04 μg l between the two measurements 0 52 and 0 48 μg l is very low and could be due to measurement uncertainties and also because the causes of this possible decrease were not investigated the data obtained by marcoux et al 2017 in the same facility does not suggest a degradation total haloketones thks is the sum of 1 1 dichloropropanone 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 trichloropropanone 1 1 1 tcp concentrations thk time profile shown in fig 3 is consistent with previous observations marcoux et al 2017 i e it degrades because of base catalyzed hydrolysis of both 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 tcp this result is also consistent with those of korshin et al 2002b for 1 1 1 tcp 3 4 differential uv absorbance the time profile of δa at 272 nm is shown in fig 4 for the four campaigns it follows a trend similar to the time profile of dbp concentrations with a rapid increase of δa decrease of uv absorbance in the first hour followed by a slower but steady increase of δa in the next hours to days the highest δa values were 0 0097 0 0110 0 0069 and 0 0138 cm 1 for the fall early winter early spring and summer campaigns and were always attained at the dw sampling point these δa values are significantly smaller than what has been previously reported in laboratory studies korshin and chang 2008 roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 possible explanations for this behaviour are discussed in section 4 also fig 4 shows that δa does not always increase monotonically although it is expected to increase steadily during chlorination we hypothesize that the ph of measurement of the uv spectra could cause this as protonation deprotonation of natural organic matter produces subtle changes in the absorbance spectra in the order of magnitude of 0 001 cm 1 yan et al 2014 adjusting the ph of the sample before measuring uv absorbance could possibly resolve this issue and is suggested for future experiments dbp δa relationships are shown in fig 5 for thm4 and haa6 along with their linear regression determination coefficients relationships between individual dbps and δa are shown in figures s 13 to s 17 in the supplementary information mcaa results are not shown because many samples had a concentration below the detection limit which led to an insufficient number of data points from which to compute significant regression parameters tables s 1 and s 2 present the linear and power function regression parameters and coefficients of determination of all dbp δa relationships because hans and hks degraded in the plant it is not possible to establish relationships between them and δa hence for non regulated dbps only the cpk δa relationship is shown in fig 6 for the early spring and summer campaigns 3 4 1 thm δa relationships while the linear regression parameters for the fall and early winter campaigns are quite similar a higher slope in the early spring campaign and a higher intercept in the summer campaign indicate that the formation of the same amount of thm requires a lower δa in the summer campaign the very high intercept value and the exponent smaller than 1 for the power function suggest that the initial formation of thm occurred more rapidly than the change in absorbance which was unexpected considering that negative intercepts and positive exponents have usually been reported korshin et al 2000 2002b 2004 2007 roccaro et al 2008a 2008b as expected bdcm δa relationships have lower slopes than tcm δa relationships because of the overall lower bdcm concentrations determination coefficients 0 79 0 93 are nonetheless at least as good as those for tcm δa relationships 0 65 0 90 determination coefficients of power functions are very similar to those of linear functions 3 4 2 haa δa relationships again positive intercepts and exponents smaller than 1 have been obtained for the three individual haa δa relationships and for the haa6 δa relationship in the early spring and summer campaigns and also in the early winter campaign for tcaa determination coefficients for these relationships 0 69 0 98 are slightly higher than yet in the same order of magnitude as those for thms 0 62 0 94 slopes intercepts and power function parameters also vary noticeably between the four campaigns with the lowest slopes and highest intercepts always occurring in the summer campaign determination coefficients for the thm and haa relationships obtained are equal to or lower than what has been previously reported for laboratory chlorination studies although seasonal variability of thm and haa δa relationships may be expected korshin et al 2002a the lower slopes higher intercepts and exponents smaller than 1 in the summer campaign suggest that organic precursors of the extra dbps measured in the summer campaign compared to other campaigns are not necessarily dissolved uv absorbing compounds but can be the result of a reaction between chlorine and particulate matter or between chlorine and compounds that do not contribute significantly to uv absorbance 3 4 3 cpk δa relationships because hans and hks degraded in the plant it is not possible to establish a relationship between them and δa for cpk the early spring linear and power relationships have a very good fit r2 0 99 and 0 98 respectively while the summer relationships are not as good since the cpk concentration seems to reach a plateau while δa keeps on changing this explains the very low slope obtained for the linear function roccaro et al 2011 also obtained a good fit for the cpk δa relationship developed in laboratory conditions despite the fact that dissolved organic nitrogen has shown to be a better indicator of cpk formation potential than uv absorbance hu et al 2010 yang et al 2008 our study supports the conclusion of roccaro et al 2011 that δa seems to be an adequate predictor of cpk concentration however because of the relatively small number of data points involved in our study future research should seek to confirm the nature of the relationships of unregulated dbps with δa we hypothesize that uv depletion and cpk formation could result from two processes taking place in parallel during chlorination therefore implying a good correlation good fit of cpk δa relationships but not necessarily a causal relationship uv absorbance vs cpk formation potential regarding the shape of the relationship obtained in our work the positive intercept and exponent smaller than 1 obtained for the summer campaign are consistent with those obtained for other dbps however exponents higher than 1 were obtained by roccaro et al 2011 this difference is discussed further in section 4 4 general discussion and research needs it is noteworthy that for every individual dbp the regression parameters are quite different from one campaign to another and the determination coefficients are much higher than when the data of all the campaigns are combined 0 40 and 0 50 for thm4 and haa6 respectively as shown in table 4 and illustrated in the supplementary information in figures s 18 and s 19 thus these results suggest that the use of δa to estimate dbps is seasonally specific in fact it has been suggested by korshin et al 2002a that seasonal variations in the nature of nom might affect dbp δa relationships site specificity and nom fraction specificity have already been demonstrated korshin and chang 2008 özdemir et al 2013 roccaro et al 2008a roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 but these are to our knowledge the first reported results that confirm seasonal specificity of dbp δa relationships changes in the nature of nom in raw water might indeed explain the differences in the fitting parameters between campaigns however other factors could also explain these differences the treatment conditions notably temperature coagulant dose and coagulation ph surely influence the amount edwards 1997 edzwald 1993 and the nature of the nom left after the coagulation flocculation settling steps as suggested by changes in suva before and after nom removal by coagulation see table 3 so given these varying raw water characteristics and treatment conditions an interesting question to ask is whether the same relationships will hold true or not for each season during the following years or even if they hold true for different days of the same season when raw water quality or treatment conditions are different if establishing a relationship that is stable from one year to another for a given season is difficult that might hinder the immediate usefulness of this technique in full scale conditions another interesting feature of the dbp δa relationships is the positive intercepts of the linear functions and the corresponding exponent smaller than 1 for the power functions of many of the relationships noticeable for all the relationships obtained in the summer campaign and all but one bdcm obtained in the early spring campaign this result is different from what has been reported in laboratory scale conditions in the literature so far where negative intercepts and exponents higher than 1 have been interpreted as an indication of the transformation of an initial precursor into an intermediate product with a smaller a272 that later reacts to produce known dbps korshin et al 2000 2002b 2004 2007 here it could be hypothesised that the opposite occurs i e that a precursor with little to no uv absorbance at 272 nm could be reacting with chlorine at the onset of chlorination to rapidly form known dbps without much change in absorbance this considerably challenges the dominant view that uv absorbing nom moieties are the major precursors of dbps the very low initial a272 0 024 0 031 cm 1 see table 3 and the very low δa 0 014 cm 1 in all campaigns despite dbp concentrations reaching close to the maximum allowed by regulations reinforce this hypothesis the results of this study do not allow us to formulate an explanation for the positive intercepts exponents lower than 1 and very low δa however they warrant future research to seek to characterize the dbp precursors present in low uv low suva coagulated nom the determination coefficients of the dbp δa relationships obtained during the campaigns are not always as high as those reported in laboratory studies but are very good in the early winter campaign 0 82 0 94 and summer campaign 0 86 0 98 except for tcm at 0 62 and fair in the fall 0 76 0 81 and early spring 0 71 0 87 campaigns these differences are globally due to better control over the reaction conditions in laboratory studies compared to full scale facilities table 4 summarizes the specific conditions that might influence the fitting parameters of the dbp δa relationships these conditions are categorized into two categories depending if they are inherent to the scaling up of differential uv to full scale facilities or if they are specific to the treatment processes of the facility considered in this study first the ph of the water during the reaction of free chlorine with nom is not buffered as is usually done in laboratory batch chlorination studies this is inherent to the scaling up of the technique although some naturally alkaline waters might limit the variations of ph along the treatment processes however the water ph in the present case study is actually adjusted at the entrance and towards the end of the reservoir for corrosion control and aesthetic purposes resulting in major ph changes between the first chlorination point and the last sampling point see table 3 this may add scatter to the dbp δa relationships for the dbps for which the formation rates are sensitive to ph second the multiple chlorine dosing points in the plant might also influence the relationships mostly when combined with the fact that the first chlorination dose is applied on coagulated but unfiltered water containing fine particulate organic matter this particulate matter might react with free chlorine and form dbps although it does not exhibit any absorbance because the samples are filtered before making uv absorbance measurements this is also a valid hypothesis to explain the positive intercepts discussed in the second paragraph of the present section although this difference is specific to the plant studied here multiple chlorine dosing points are not uncommon and multiple chlorine doses should be studied in a laboratory setting to determine their effect on dbp δa relationships another full scale condition specific to our case study that might explain the lower coefficients of determination is the use of another disinfectant chlorine dioxide in the same water chlorine dioxide reduces the formation of dbps when used as a pre treatment followed by chlorine gas or sodium hypochlorite chlorination arora et al 2001 song et al 2016 and it has been shown that it influences the fitting parameters of the dbp δa relationship korshin et al 2002a because chlorine dioxide is used here after inter and post chlorination it oxidizes the remaining nom after some of it has already reacted with free chlorine and probably modifies its reactivity towards free chlorine also nom oxidation by chlorine dioxide can produce changes in uv absorbance without generating many organic dbps hence also influencing the dbp δa relationships moreover the hydraulic mixing taking place in a full scale facility means that the samples taken and analysed during the campaigns do not necessarily contain the same water that was sampled at sampling points located upstream despite all our efforts to model travel times between sampling points and sample accordingly this might influence both uv absorbance and dbp concentrations hence dbp δa relationships finally even though nothing shows it happened in this case study volatile dbps such as thms may volatilize from the water in full scale facilities which would affect their relationship to δa globally future research should focus on applying differential uv absorbance to full scale facilities that have fewer uncontrolled conditions compared to the facility studied here until the impact of these varying conditions is addressed for example a facility that uses only free chlorine as a disinfectant only in filtered water with only small ph adjustment required would be an interesting case study dbp concentrations prior to the first chlorination point should also be investigated if raw water contamination is suspected or if backwash waters are recirculated while the previous discussion focused on improving our understanding of dbp δa relationships and on improving the relationships themselves one can raise the question from a broader point of view of how precise the feedback in terms of dbp concentrations needs to be to take actions given that in a decision making process incomplete information is better than no information at all the dbp δa relationships obtained here could already be without further improvement a very valuable tool to support operational decisions such as adjusting coagulation conditions to improve precursor removal adjusting disinfectant doses or choosing new disinfectant dosing points we believe that this should be attempted in future research we also think that it would be interesting to compare the feedbacks given by dbp δa relationships and other existing techniques or apparatus e g kinetic models online dbp analysers

19774,differential uv spectroscopy defined as the difference in uv absorbance spectra before and after chlorination has shown great potential to predict disinfection by product dbp concentrations at laboratory scale however so far no results have been reported on the full scale application of differential uv spectroscopy in drinking water treatment facilities the objectives of this study are to determine if relationships can be developed between differential uv absorbance and dbp concentrations for both regulated and unregulated dbps in a full scale facility and to determine if these relationships vary throughout the year with variations in raw water quality and treatment conditions the results show that linear and power relationships between differential uv absorbance and dbp concentrations can be developed 0 62 r2 0 99 although differences between relationships obtained in lab and full scale conditions need further investigation finally the relationships obtained are different from one sampling campaign to another which raises the question of whether it is possible to determine relationships that are stable enough to be used as adequate feedback on dbp concentrations keywords chlorination differential uv absorbance disinfection by products emerging dbps drinking water 1 introduction the monitoring of disinfection by products dbps for regulatory compliance usually requires grab sampling and analyses of the samples for individual species while these methods involve costs and delays for water utilities researchers have developed empirical sadiq and rodriguez 2004 2011 and kinetic gallard and von gunten 2002 korshin et al 2004 sohn et al 2004 models based on operational and water quality parameters e g chlorine dose natural organic matter indicators temperature ph contact time and others to provide more frequent estimates of dbp concentrations these estimates are not valid for regulatory compliance but could be used to evaluate the impact of raw water variations or operational changes on dbp formation to plan sampling campaigns in distribution networks or simply to provide more frequent feedback on plant performances in terms of dbp precursor removal and occurrence an alternative approach for estimating dbp concentrations differential uv absorbance δa has been proposed by korshin et al 1996 the approach consists in measuring uv absorbance before chlorination and after a given contact time in laboratory conditions the difference in uv absorbance at a wavelength of 272 nm between the two measurements has been shown to be linearly proportional to the concentration of many regulated dbps including trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas korshin et al 2002a li et al 1998 uyak and demirbas 2014 as well as some unregulated dbps korshin et al 2004 2002a 2002b roccaro and vagliasindi 2010 reported correlations between δa and dbp concentrations obtained through laboratory batch chlorination experiments are at least as strong as results obtained by empirical and kinetic models korshin et al 2002b 2002a li et al 1998 roccaro et al 2008a roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 2010 also while uv absorbance of low specific uv absorbance suva waters may not be proportional to the formation potential of dbps δa has shown to be a good surrogate to dbp measurements in waters with various suvas korshin et al 2002a korshin and chang 2008 roccaro et al 2008b it has been shown that dbp concentrations are better correlated to δa at 272 nm than at 254 nm a wavelength at which uv absorbance is more widely monitored roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 however to the best of our knowledge full scale applications of δa have not been reported in peer reviewed literature previous work marcoux et al 2017 has shown that about 80 of the dbps measured in the distribution network in some cases are already formed when the water leaves the plant and enters the distribution network therefore δa could lend itself as a useful tool for the estimation of dbps to characterize their formation at the treatment plant the objectives of this study are first to determine the applicability of dbp δa relationships as a surrogate for grab sampling and analyses of individual dbps and secondly to provide a better understanding of regulated and non regulated dbp formation throughout the plant this paper presents a first attempt at applying δa in a full scale facility for dbp monitoring purposes 2 methodology 2 1 case study the facility in this study has been worked on previously marcoux et al 2017 and is located in the city of st jérôme quebec canada and takes its water from the du nord river that flows south from the laurentian mountains the treatment plant fig 1 consists of a slightly modified conventional treatment train potassium permanganate kmno4 is used on the raw water as a pre oxidant coagulation and settling is conducted on five parallel trains two ballasted actiflo veolia water technologies canada floc settlers and three conventional settling basins inter chlorination with sodium hypochlorite takes place after settling but before filtration in all settling trains at around 1 h before primary disinfection with chlorine the flow on conventional settlers is held almost constant while the flow treated by the ballasted floc settlers is adjusted to account for daily variations in water demand 12 dual media i e sand and activated carbon filters treat water from the ballasted floc and conventional settlers six for each stream backwash and filter ripening waters are sent to waste and do not contribute to dbp levels in the plant once the filter effluents are mixed primary disinfection is conducted with sodium hypochlorite before entering the contact tank chlorination is followed by uv disinfection also for primary disinfection and chlorine dioxide for oxidation purposes the total reservoir volume between the effluent of the filters and the entrance of the distribution system is about 36 000 m3 providing a hydraulic retention time of about 20 h for an average flow of 45 000 m3 day there is no other reservoir in the distribution network 2 2 sampling strategy this study is based on intensive seasonal multi point daily sampling campaigns that were designed according to the different location of the various chlorination points and the water residence time within this treatment plant four intensive 24 h sampling campaigns were carried out on october 2015 fall december 2015 early winter march 2016 early spring and july 2016 summer for seasonal characterization of dbp formation regulated dbps thms and haas were measured in each campaign while non regulated dbps haloacetonitriles hans chloropicrin cpk and haloketones hks were measured only in the last two campaigns other water quality and operational parameters including differential uv absorbance δa were also measured in each campaign samples were taken at 15 points throughout the plant fig 1 10 of which were located after the first chlorination point sampling locations were chosen to adequately characterize the impact of coagulation on natural organic matter nom rw s1 s2 s4 s5 and to provide dbp concentrations after short and long reaction times in the reservoirs before s3 s6 s7 s8 and after s9 s10 s11 s12 s13 dw the addition of chlorine dioxide unregulated dbps were measured at sampling points s3 s6 s8 s10 s12 and dw average travel time after the first chlorination points is also indicated for each point in fig 1 to establish dbp δa relationships in a laboratory setting batch chlorination tests are deployed to ensure that the same water is used to measure the uv absorbance spectra at varying reaction times accordingly in a full scale treatment plant the same water must be followed throughout the treatment plant this was achieved by first sampling from the most upstream sampling point the inlet and then by sampling at the other sampling points according to the travel time of the water from the inlet to that point the description of travel time estimation is presented in supplementary text st1 uv absorbance spectra were measured on samples from sampling points rw s1 s2 s3 s5 s6 s7 s9 s10 s11 s13 and dw sample s2 was chosen as the t 0 sample for calculating δas samples s5 and s6 were not used because they are in parallel to samples s2 and s3 fig 1 and their absorbance were almost identical to those from samples s2 and s3 as a result 7 dbp δa data pairs are available for the regulated dbps s3 s7 s9 s10 s11 s13 and dw and 3 for the unregulated dbps s3 s10 and dw only 2 3 analytical procedures for dbps and physicochemical parameters free and total chlorine residuals ammonia temperature turbidity and ph were measured in situ at the time of sampling chlorine residuals were measured using the dpd colorimetric method hach 8021 and hach 8167 with a hach dr 4000 spectrophotometer ammonia was analysed using the salicylate method hach 10023 with the same spectrophotometer temperature and ph were determined using a denver instrument ap15 ph mv fet meter turbidity was measured using a hach 2100n laboratory turbidimeter one liter samples collected in polyethylene bottles were quenched using a solution of 10 g l of sodium sulphite and used to measure dissolved organic carbon doc and uv absorbance spectra sodium sulphite was preferred to ammonium chloride because it does not interfere with uv measurement when dosed adequately while ammonium chloride forms monochloramines that exhibit high uv absorbance thus causing interference the volume of sodium sulphite solution was adjusted to neutralize the free chlorine residual measured previously with a safety factor of 2 this safety factor ensured that all free chlorine was quenched while the excess sodium sulphite concentration was low enough that it did not interfere with uv absorbance in the range of wavelengths of interest 260 280 nm in all cases the excess sodium sulphite was never higher than 2 5 mg l in the sample the samples were kept in the dark at 4 c before the analyses less than 48 h after sample collection the samples were filtered using a vacuum pump set up on 0 7 μm glass microfiber filters pre carbonized at 550 c for 2 h the doc was measured in triplicate with a sievers 5310c laboratory toc analyser sievers 900 autosampler means are reported herein the uv absorbance spectra of the filtered samples between wavelengths of 200 and 350 nm were obtained using 5 or 10 cm quartz cells and a double beam agilent cary 100 uv vis spectrophotometer blanks and baseline samples consisted of nanofiltered demineralized water samples for bromide analysis were first collected in 1 l amber polypropylene bottles to which 0 5 ml of a 100 ppm ethylene diamine solution was added as a preservative agent approximately 50 ml of each sample was filtered on 0 45 μm digifilters within 14 days of the sampling and filtration filtrates were analysed by ion chromatography on a thermofisher ics 4000 capillary hpic coupled with a dionex as ap autosampler the method quantification limit was 6 5 μg l the analyses of regulated and unregulated dbps has been described previously mercier shanks et al 2013 briefly samples for thm and haa analyses were collected in 40 ml glass vials pre dosed with 4 98 g of ammonium chloride because it has shown to be an adequate quenching agent for the conservation of dbps in our own previous trials and in previous studies kristiana et al 2014 thms were extracted using solid phase microextraction spme fibres and analysed with gas chromatography with ion trap mass spectrometry gc ms haas were extracted using liquid liquid extraction in mtbe and the extracts were analysed using gas chromatography with electron capture detection gc ecd the thms analysed are the chlorinated and brominated thms namely chloroform tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform tbm commonly known as thm4 the haas analysed are the 5 regulated haas haa5 in the province of québec i e mono di and tri chloroacetic acids mcaa dcaa tcaa mono and di bromoacetic acids mbaa dbaa and an unregulated haa bromochloroacetic acids bcaa the total of which we name haa6 the method quantification limits were 1 1 μg l 0 6 μg l 1 0 μg l 0 8 μg l and 1 0 μg l for tcm bdcm dbcm tbm and all haas respectively samples for hans cpk and hks were collected in 60 ml glass vials pre dosed with 6 45 g of ammonium chloride and 1 00 g of phosphate buffer to adjust the ph of the sample to approximately 5 for the preservation of han these non regulated dbps were extracted using liquid liquid extraction and were analysed with gc ecd the method quantification limit was 0 01 μg l for all non regulated dbps 3 results and discussion 3 1 raw water characteristics the raw water characteristics of the four campaigns are given in table 1 the results show a stable ph and a relatively stable turbidity ammonia in raw water was low during all campaigns except the spring campaign when it was 0 12 mg n l and thus exerted a theoretical chlorine demand of 0 91 mg l 7 6 mg cl2 mg n nh3 doc was relatively high during the summer campaign and low in the spring campaign with average values in fall and early winter campaigns which is in accordance with typical patterns observed in this region although fall values are sometimes reported to be as high as or higher than summer values rodriguez et al 2004 scheili et al 2015 suva i e uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 on a doc basis only varied from 3 44 summer to 3 78 l mg m early winter from one campaign to another suggesting that the coagulability of the nom did not vary greatly finally bromide ion was consistently found in concentrations lower than 15 μg l and was below the detection limit in the spring campaign 3 2 operational parameters and physicochemical characteristics of the water the relevant operational parameters of the facility for the four campaigns are given in table 2 coagulant polymer and chlorine doses are given for the trains with conventional settlers neglecting the chlorine demand exerted by ammonia and considering the chlorine demand of other inorganics e g metals to be eliminated by pre oxidation the inter chlorination dose of the summer campaign is the highest the post chlorination and total chlorine doses of the summer campaign are also the highest as expected based on higher temperatures higher doc concentrations and higher uv254 of both raw and coagulated water as shown in table 3 the post chlorination dose is higher in the summer campaign despite a higher clo2 dose which has been shown to lower chlorine demand and dbp formation arora et al 2001 korshin et al 2002a globally these higher chlorine doses indicate that more dbps are probably formed following both the inter chlorination and post chlorination points alum dosages are established by the operators based on experience in order to attain and exceed the regulatory requirements of filtered water turbidity however alum dosage is controlled by both turbidity and nom content of the raw water to be coagulated babcock and singer 1979 edzwald 1993 oliver and lawrence 1979 pernitsky and edzwald 2006 and greatly influences dbp precursor removal in the present study the low raw water turbidity levels mean that the alum dosage should be based almost exclusively on nom content as an indicator of adequate coagulant dosage mass ratios of aluminum to doc concentration edzwald 1993 and of aluminum to uv254 edzwald and kaminski 2009 pernitsky and edzwald 2006 have been computed and are shown in table 2 the al doc ratio is close to the recommended value in all campaigns except the summer campaign the al uv254 ratio is significantly lower in the summer campaign and lower than the recommendations by edzwald and kaminski 2009 18 6 24 4 mg al l cm 1 for similar waters table 3 shows that the removal rates of doc and uv254 by coagulation flocculation settling in the summer campaign are 65 and 83 respectively which is slightly higher than the values obtained for the other campaigns however because the doc and uv254 of the raw water were higher in the summer campaign they remain high in the coagulated water in the summer campaign as discussed in the next section dbp concentrations are as a result higher in the summer campaign ph of the water changes in the plant according to the various treatment processes first upstream dosing of sodium hydroxide is used to reach a coagulation ph between 6 0 and 7 0 depending on water temperature thus chlorine is first applied in water with a ph in that range then sodium hydroxide is added along with chlorine at the post chlorination point to increase ph to around 8 0 at sampling point s7 lastly alkalinity and carbonate saturation are controlled by the addition of carbon dioxide and lime which result in a finished water ph of 9 0 given that the formation reactions and kinetics are ph dependent for some dbps notably thms and haas these ph changes might also affect the dbp δa relationships this is discussed further in section 4 3 3 dbp occurrence fig 2 shows the time profiles of thm4 and haa6 for the four campaigns according to estimated travel time with t0 defined as the moment of the first sodium hypochlorite dosing inter chlorination the time profile of individual dbps can be found in the supplementary information figures s 1 to s 6 one data point is missing on figs 2 4 and 5 for the early winter and summer campaign because the sampling lines from points s10 and s11 respectively were insufficiently flushed before sampling leading to unrealistic results for dbps and physicochemical parameters mbaa and dbaa were never detected during the campaigns the general trends for all dbps shown here is in accordance with previous studies gallard and von gunten 2002 gang et al 2002 korshin et al 2004 sohn et al 2004 i e rapid formation initially occurs during the first few hours followed by a continuous slow formation of dbps on a time scale of hours to days unregulated dbp time profiles are shown in fig 3 time profile of individual unregulated dbps are shown in figures s 7 to s 12 the concentrations obtained in the summer campaign are consistent with the results of another study on the same facility marcoux et al 2017 in such study weekly sampling during the warm season end of may to early october helped to determine the range of dbp concentrations at various points within the treatment plant and distribution system all regulated and non regulated dbp concentrations in our study fall within these ranges thm4 tcm and bdcm time profiles are very similar for the fall early winter and early spring campaigns for thm4 a rapid reaction occurred forming just over 20 μg l in the first 2 h in the following hours the formation rate decreased to a minimum approximately 6 h after inter chlorination at a thm4 concentration of approximately 30 μg l this time corresponds to the point of injection of chlorine dioxide before leaving the plant the concentrations reached about 35 μg l in the summer campaign however the rapid reaction formed about 30 μg l in less than 30 min and the concentration increased to over 50 μg l at the entrance of the distribution system after a residence time shorter than the previous campaigns because of the higher water demand in the summer about 17 h vs 20 22 h tcm concentrations represent about 90 of the thm4 while bdcm accounts for the remainder since no other thms were detected in all campaigns dcaa and tcaa concentrations represent more than 90 of the haa6 concentrations with dcaa concentrations slightly higher than tcaa concentrations in all campaigns haa6 concentrations follow the trend of thm4 concentrations the only difference between them and thm4 concentrations is that haa6 concentrations are slightly higher in the fall campaign than in the early winter and early spring campaigns haa6 concentration in the summer campaign reached over 50 μg l at the dw sampling point higher thm and haa concentrations in the summer are consistent with prior research rodriguez et al 2007 summerhayes et al 2011 williams et al 1997 mcaa concentrations are close to the detection limit of 1 μg l in all campaigns in the summer campaign mcaa are not detected at any location in the treatment plant while in the early winter campaign it is only detected at the dw sampling point at a concentration equal to the detection limit of 1 μg l interpretation of these results is risky because of the low concentrations involved clearly however the characteristics of the nom and the chlorination conditions favor the formation of the other haas mostly dcaa and tcaa bcaa concentrations are low as expected based on bromide concentrations in the raw water bcaa is not detected in the early spring campaign while bdcm is detected at levels similar to those of the fall and early winter campaigns total haloacetonitriles thans is the sum of dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloroacetonitrile tcan bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dibromoacetonitrile dban dcan accounts for about 80 of all han measured in the two campaigns and bcan accounts for the remaining 20 which is consistent with previous results found on waters with low bromide concentrations roccaro et al 2013 tcan and dban were found in concentrations varying from 0 01 to 0 05 μg l as can be seen in fig 3 hans seem to degrade after a certain amount of time in the summer campaign for this facility marcoux et al 2017 attributed this degradation to high ph around 8 high temperatures in the summer and the presence of a free residual chlorine as suggested by reckhow et al 2001 this result is consistent with those obtained by korshin et al 2002b for dcan interestingly these conditions except for high temperatures were present in the spring campaign although the degradation was not observed in the treatment plant and reservoir it is not possible to conclude if the degradation simply slows down and occurs nonetheless in the distribution system or if low temperatures prevent the degradation completely cpk concentrations are low with a maximum of 0 52 μg l reached in the summer campaign cpk concentration has behaviour similar to the thm concentrations i e it increases rapidly in the first few hours then slowly but steadily in the presence of a free chlorine residual and dbp precursors the time profile shown in fig 3 is consistent with this behaviour and with previous observations chiang et al 2010 marcoux et al 2017 mercier shanks et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 however observed the degradation of cpk at high temperatures such as those reached in a water heater and cole et al 2007 studied the degradation mechanisms of cpk in water the small decrease in concentration at the dw sampling point in the summer campaign could be explained by degradation although it is not possible to conclude first because the difference 0 04 μg l between the two measurements 0 52 and 0 48 μg l is very low and could be due to measurement uncertainties and also because the causes of this possible decrease were not investigated the data obtained by marcoux et al 2017 in the same facility does not suggest a degradation total haloketones thks is the sum of 1 1 dichloropropanone 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 trichloropropanone 1 1 1 tcp concentrations thk time profile shown in fig 3 is consistent with previous observations marcoux et al 2017 i e it degrades because of base catalyzed hydrolysis of both 1 1 dcp and 1 1 1 tcp this result is also consistent with those of korshin et al 2002b for 1 1 1 tcp 3 4 differential uv absorbance the time profile of δa at 272 nm is shown in fig 4 for the four campaigns it follows a trend similar to the time profile of dbp concentrations with a rapid increase of δa decrease of uv absorbance in the first hour followed by a slower but steady increase of δa in the next hours to days the highest δa values were 0 0097 0 0110 0 0069 and 0 0138 cm 1 for the fall early winter early spring and summer campaigns and were always attained at the dw sampling point these δa values are significantly smaller than what has been previously reported in laboratory studies korshin and chang 2008 roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 possible explanations for this behaviour are discussed in section 4 also fig 4 shows that δa does not always increase monotonically although it is expected to increase steadily during chlorination we hypothesize that the ph of measurement of the uv spectra could cause this as protonation deprotonation of natural organic matter produces subtle changes in the absorbance spectra in the order of magnitude of 0 001 cm 1 yan et al 2014 adjusting the ph of the sample before measuring uv absorbance could possibly resolve this issue and is suggested for future experiments dbp δa relationships are shown in fig 5 for thm4 and haa6 along with their linear regression determination coefficients relationships between individual dbps and δa are shown in figures s 13 to s 17 in the supplementary information mcaa results are not shown because many samples had a concentration below the detection limit which led to an insufficient number of data points from which to compute significant regression parameters tables s 1 and s 2 present the linear and power function regression parameters and coefficients of determination of all dbp δa relationships because hans and hks degraded in the plant it is not possible to establish relationships between them and δa hence for non regulated dbps only the cpk δa relationship is shown in fig 6 for the early spring and summer campaigns 3 4 1 thm δa relationships while the linear regression parameters for the fall and early winter campaigns are quite similar a higher slope in the early spring campaign and a higher intercept in the summer campaign indicate that the formation of the same amount of thm requires a lower δa in the summer campaign the very high intercept value and the exponent smaller than 1 for the power function suggest that the initial formation of thm occurred more rapidly than the change in absorbance which was unexpected considering that negative intercepts and positive exponents have usually been reported korshin et al 2000 2002b 2004 2007 roccaro et al 2008a 2008b as expected bdcm δa relationships have lower slopes than tcm δa relationships because of the overall lower bdcm concentrations determination coefficients 0 79 0 93 are nonetheless at least as good as those for tcm δa relationships 0 65 0 90 determination coefficients of power functions are very similar to those of linear functions 3 4 2 haa δa relationships again positive intercepts and exponents smaller than 1 have been obtained for the three individual haa δa relationships and for the haa6 δa relationship in the early spring and summer campaigns and also in the early winter campaign for tcaa determination coefficients for these relationships 0 69 0 98 are slightly higher than yet in the same order of magnitude as those for thms 0 62 0 94 slopes intercepts and power function parameters also vary noticeably between the four campaigns with the lowest slopes and highest intercepts always occurring in the summer campaign determination coefficients for the thm and haa relationships obtained are equal to or lower than what has been previously reported for laboratory chlorination studies although seasonal variability of thm and haa δa relationships may be expected korshin et al 2002a the lower slopes higher intercepts and exponents smaller than 1 in the summer campaign suggest that organic precursors of the extra dbps measured in the summer campaign compared to other campaigns are not necessarily dissolved uv absorbing compounds but can be the result of a reaction between chlorine and particulate matter or between chlorine and compounds that do not contribute significantly to uv absorbance 3 4 3 cpk δa relationships because hans and hks degraded in the plant it is not possible to establish a relationship between them and δa for cpk the early spring linear and power relationships have a very good fit r2 0 99 and 0 98 respectively while the summer relationships are not as good since the cpk concentration seems to reach a plateau while δa keeps on changing this explains the very low slope obtained for the linear function roccaro et al 2011 also obtained a good fit for the cpk δa relationship developed in laboratory conditions despite the fact that dissolved organic nitrogen has shown to be a better indicator of cpk formation potential than uv absorbance hu et al 2010 yang et al 2008 our study supports the conclusion of roccaro et al 2011 that δa seems to be an adequate predictor of cpk concentration however because of the relatively small number of data points involved in our study future research should seek to confirm the nature of the relationships of unregulated dbps with δa we hypothesize that uv depletion and cpk formation could result from two processes taking place in parallel during chlorination therefore implying a good correlation good fit of cpk δa relationships but not necessarily a causal relationship uv absorbance vs cpk formation potential regarding the shape of the relationship obtained in our work the positive intercept and exponent smaller than 1 obtained for the summer campaign are consistent with those obtained for other dbps however exponents higher than 1 were obtained by roccaro et al 2011 this difference is discussed further in section 4 4 general discussion and research needs it is noteworthy that for every individual dbp the regression parameters are quite different from one campaign to another and the determination coefficients are much higher than when the data of all the campaigns are combined 0 40 and 0 50 for thm4 and haa6 respectively as shown in table 4 and illustrated in the supplementary information in figures s 18 and s 19 thus these results suggest that the use of δa to estimate dbps is seasonally specific in fact it has been suggested by korshin et al 2002a that seasonal variations in the nature of nom might affect dbp δa relationships site specificity and nom fraction specificity have already been demonstrated korshin and chang 2008 özdemir et al 2013 roccaro et al 2008a roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 but these are to our knowledge the first reported results that confirm seasonal specificity of dbp δa relationships changes in the nature of nom in raw water might indeed explain the differences in the fitting parameters between campaigns however other factors could also explain these differences the treatment conditions notably temperature coagulant dose and coagulation ph surely influence the amount edwards 1997 edzwald 1993 and the nature of the nom left after the coagulation flocculation settling steps as suggested by changes in suva before and after nom removal by coagulation see table 3 so given these varying raw water characteristics and treatment conditions an interesting question to ask is whether the same relationships will hold true or not for each season during the following years or even if they hold true for different days of the same season when raw water quality or treatment conditions are different if establishing a relationship that is stable from one year to another for a given season is difficult that might hinder the immediate usefulness of this technique in full scale conditions another interesting feature of the dbp δa relationships is the positive intercepts of the linear functions and the corresponding exponent smaller than 1 for the power functions of many of the relationships noticeable for all the relationships obtained in the summer campaign and all but one bdcm obtained in the early spring campaign this result is different from what has been reported in laboratory scale conditions in the literature so far where negative intercepts and exponents higher than 1 have been interpreted as an indication of the transformation of an initial precursor into an intermediate product with a smaller a272 that later reacts to produce known dbps korshin et al 2000 2002b 2004 2007 here it could be hypothesised that the opposite occurs i e that a precursor with little to no uv absorbance at 272 nm could be reacting with chlorine at the onset of chlorination to rapidly form known dbps without much change in absorbance this considerably challenges the dominant view that uv absorbing nom moieties are the major precursors of dbps the very low initial a272 0 024 0 031 cm 1 see table 3 and the very low δa 0 014 cm 1 in all campaigns despite dbp concentrations reaching close to the maximum allowed by regulations reinforce this hypothesis the results of this study do not allow us to formulate an explanation for the positive intercepts exponents lower than 1 and very low δa however they warrant future research to seek to characterize the dbp precursors present in low uv low suva coagulated nom the determination coefficients of the dbp δa relationships obtained during the campaigns are not always as high as those reported in laboratory studies but are very good in the early winter campaign 0 82 0 94 and summer campaign 0 86 0 98 except for tcm at 0 62 and fair in the fall 0 76 0 81 and early spring 0 71 0 87 campaigns these differences are globally due to better control over the reaction conditions in laboratory studies compared to full scale facilities table 4 summarizes the specific conditions that might influence the fitting parameters of the dbp δa relationships these conditions are categorized into two categories depending if they are inherent to the scaling up of differential uv to full scale facilities or if they are specific to the treatment processes of the facility considered in this study first the ph of the water during the reaction of free chlorine with nom is not buffered as is usually done in laboratory batch chlorination studies this is inherent to the scaling up of the technique although some naturally alkaline waters might limit the variations of ph along the treatment processes however the water ph in the present case study is actually adjusted at the entrance and towards the end of the reservoir for corrosion control and aesthetic purposes resulting in major ph changes between the first chlorination point and the last sampling point see table 3 this may add scatter to the dbp δa relationships for the dbps for which the formation rates are sensitive to ph second the multiple chlorine dosing points in the plant might also influence the relationships mostly when combined with the fact that the first chlorination dose is applied on coagulated but unfiltered water containing fine particulate organic matter this particulate matter might react with free chlorine and form dbps although it does not exhibit any absorbance because the samples are filtered before making uv absorbance measurements this is also a valid hypothesis to explain the positive intercepts discussed in the second paragraph of the present section although this difference is specific to the plant studied here multiple chlorine dosing points are not uncommon and multiple chlorine doses should be studied in a laboratory setting to determine their effect on dbp δa relationships another full scale condition specific to our case study that might explain the lower coefficients of determination is the use of another disinfectant chlorine dioxide in the same water chlorine dioxide reduces the formation of dbps when used as a pre treatment followed by chlorine gas or sodium hypochlorite chlorination arora et al 2001 song et al 2016 and it has been shown that it influences the fitting parameters of the dbp δa relationship korshin et al 2002a because chlorine dioxide is used here after inter and post chlorination it oxidizes the remaining nom after some of it has already reacted with free chlorine and probably modifies its reactivity towards free chlorine also nom oxidation by chlorine dioxide can produce changes in uv absorbance without generating many organic dbps hence also influencing the dbp δa relationships moreover the hydraulic mixing taking place in a full scale facility means that the samples taken and analysed during the campaigns do not necessarily contain the same water that was sampled at sampling points located upstream despite all our efforts to model travel times between sampling points and sample accordingly this might influence both uv absorbance and dbp concentrations hence dbp δa relationships finally even though nothing shows it happened in this case study volatile dbps such as thms may volatilize from the water in full scale facilities which would affect their relationship to δa globally future research should focus on applying differential uv absorbance to full scale facilities that have fewer uncontrolled conditions compared to the facility studied here until the impact of these varying conditions is addressed for example a facility that uses only free chlorine as a disinfectant only in filtered water with only small ph adjustment required would be an interesting case study dbp concentrations prior to the first chlorination point should also be investigated if raw water contamination is suspected or if backwash waters are recirculated while the previous discussion focused on improving our understanding of dbp δa relationships and on improving the relationships themselves one can raise the question from a broader point of view of how precise the feedback in terms of dbp concentrations needs to be to take actions given that in a decision making process incomplete information is better than no information at all the dbp δa relationships obtained here could already be without further improvement a very valuable tool to support operational decisions such as adjusting coagulation conditions to improve precursor removal adjusting disinfectant doses or choosing new disinfectant dosing points we believe that this should be attempted in future research we also think that it would be interesting to compare the feedbacks given by dbp δa relationships and other existing techniques or apparatus e g kinetic models online dbp analysers bailey et al 2014 colorimetric methods reckhow and pierce 1992 would the various capabilities precision frequency of measurements of these methods result in the same operational decisions are the costs of new equipment model calibration sampling and analyses and equipment maintenance lower for one or more technique these questions should be addressed in future research 5 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study linear and power relationships between differential uv absorbance and dbp concentrations were good 0 62 r2 0 99 considering such relationships were established in full scale conditions positive intercepts linear functions and exponents smaller than 1 power function in dbp δa relationships are not consistent with previously reported results future research should seek to test the hypotheses suggested in this study to explain the differences in the shape of the relationships obtained the fitting parameters of the dbp δa relationships vary from one season to another establishing stable dbp δa relationships that are valid for long periods of time and for similar periods from one year to another might be the greatest challenge to utilities who wish to implement differential uv absorbance to estimate dbp concentrations ways to improve the applicability of this technique have been suggested and should be applied in
