19950,organic coatings can guarantee long term protection of steel structures due to causing a physical barrier against water and oxygen because of their mechanical properties and resistances to heat and chemicals epoxy resin based coatings are widely used for corrosion protection despite of the aromatic backbone and the resulting susceptibility to uv degradation epoxy resins are frequently used as binding agent in top layers of anti corrosion coating systems consequently these organic polymers are directly exposed to sunlight and thus uv radiation the present study was designed to investigate if toxic effects of epoxy resin based coatings are changed by uv a irradiation for this purpose two epoxide based top coatings were examined with and without uv aging for their bacterial toxicity and estrogenicity in addition chemical analyses were performed to identify released compounds as well as photolytic degradation products and to assign toxic effects to individual substances uv a irradiation of epoxy resin based top coatings resulted in an overall decrease of acute and specific ecotoxicological effects but as well to the formation of toxic transformation products both in leachates of untreated and uv a irradiated coatings 4tbp was identified as the main driver of estrogenicity and toxicity to luminescent bacteria bpa and structural analogs contributing to estrogenic effects in leachates were formed by uv a irradiation the combination of hptlc coupled bioassays and lc ms analyses supported the identification of bioactive compounds in terms of an effect directed analysis the present findings indicate that epoxide based coatings are less suitable for the application as top coatings and more uv stable coatings like aliphatic polyurethanes should be preferred graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords epoxide leaching toxicity uv a effect directed analysis introduction alterations of metallic construction materials by the reaction with their environment are summarized under the term corrosion to maintain relevant infrastructures this natural process can be prevented by active and passive protection methods active corrosion protection is done by the negative polarization of the steel e g by galvanic anodes or impressed current systems in contrast passive protection methods achieve their anti corrosive properties by acting as barrier between the metal and the corrosive environment an effective and frequently used passive method is the application of organic coatings systems since they can provide long term protection of steel structures even under aggressive environmental conditions e g in industrial or marine applications besides major steel structures such as bridges offshore wind turbines and buildings the bodyworks of vehicles are protected by organic coatings lyon et al 2017 protective paint systems are designed for protection periods up to over 25 years and are internationally standardized according to iso 12944 1 iso 2018a in perspective systems even providing at least 50 years of corrosion protection are intended to be approved kuhlmann 2020 for the fabrication of organic coatings a wide range of binding agents can be applied such as alkyd resins acrylic resins ethyl silicates fluoropolymers polyester resins polysiloxanes polyacrylates and polyaspartates iso 2018a the most commonly used coatings are based on polyurethane or epoxy resins a complete anti corrosion coating system can consist of up to three different coating layers priming intermediate and top coating which themselves consisting of one or two components and are applied usually in up to 360 µm film thickness after application the coating is continually exposed to weathering especially to uv radiation because of their aromatic backbone epoxide based coatings have a decreased uv stability compared to coatings based on polyurethane nevertheless the former is frequently used as top layers in anti corrosion coating systems consequently these organic polymers are irradiated by sunlight and thus uv radiation this might trigger the degradation of the chemical structure of the coating caused by the cleavage of chemical bonds due to photolysis and the attack of free radicals autoxidation hare 1992 besides the negative effects on the durability of the coating by e g cracking or delamination from the coated surface the light induced degradation could possibly lead to the formation of transformation products with unwanted biological activities depending on the corrosive category and protection period the resistance of paints to weathering is examined as part of their performance testing under artificial cycle test according to iso 12944 and natural conditions long term exposure in nature according to baw 2011 the iso standard asks for reduced emissions of volatile organic compounds voc and prohibits the use of toxic and carcinogenic ingredients but the assessment of possible environmental impacts is not part of the authorization of corrosion protection systems however coatings based on epoxy resins can contain a wide range of organic solvents metallic pigments uv stabilizers biocides and other potential hazardous substances as bisphenol a f alkylphenols and other phenolic substances and polyamines which are added as curing agents jin et al 2015 verma et al 2020 all these ingredients and reaction products formed during the hardening by polyaddition reactions potentially pose a risk to the aquatic environment if released from respective steel structures either by a direct contact with a water body or indirectly via the runoff from the structure after rainfall in previous studies the leaching of bisphenol a nonylphenol and 4 tert butylphenol from various unweathered epoxy resin based coatings was already reported in this context estrogenic activity and toxic effects to water fleas luminescent bacteria and cypris larvae of barnacles were detected bell et al 2020 vermeirssen et al 2017 watermann et al 2005 in contrast investigations on uv aged coatings were mainly focused on topics of material and polymer sciences such as the mechanisms of photodegradation or structural and performance changes for instance liu et al 2014 studied the microstructural alteration of a polyamide cured epoxy coating and discovered the formation of micropores along with an increased water barrier function upon uv a irradiation brand et al 2020 recently investigated irradiated coating surfaces and elucidated degradation pathways leading to the delamination of polyurethane top layers however the toxicity of uv aged coatings to the aquatic environment has not been addressed so far therefore this study was designed to investigate if toxic effects of epoxy resin based coatings are changed by uv a irradiation for this purpose two epoxide based top coatings were examined with and without uv aging for their bacterial toxicity and estrogenicity in addition chemical analyses were performed to identify released compounds as well as photolytic products and to assign toxic effects to individual substances material and methods selection of coating systems and fabrication of test plates the current study was performed with two different two component epoxide based top coatings for corrosion protection known for their elevated bacterial toxicity and estrogenic effects from previous investigations bell et al 2020 the selected products are primarily used for the corrosion protection of hydraulic steel structures and are among the most relevant coatings for the federal transport infrastructure of germany the coating was performed by the institute for corrosion protection iks dresden the respective layers were applied on the front back and edges of steel plates with a size of 150 160 3 mm following the respective instructions provided by the manufacturer of the coatings the particular layer thickness was defined by the list of approved coating systems of the baw and amounted to 200 µm and 500 µm for coating a and b respectively the treatment with uv a radiation was conducted in an indoor uv chamber uva cube 400 dr hönle ag germany for 65 h only on the front of the coated plates with an average power of 230 w m² and a total energy amount of 53 82 mj m² the uv doses were recorded using the corresponding uv meter equipped with an optical fiber sensor 340

bioactive fractions the identification of compounds contributing to bacterial toxicity and estrogen like effects of the extracts was performed by thin layer chromatography the extracts were developed according to the proceeding in hptlc coupled assays based on the previously detected bio active zones toxic fractions were marked on the surface of the hptlc plate with a pencil the silica layer was scraped off the glass at relevant positions with a scalpel and placed in a reaction tube the obtained fractions were extracted with 500 µl ethanol optigrade promochem by thoroughly mixing for 30 s after the centrifugation of the suspensions for 1 min at 14 000 g the supernatants were filtered ptfe 0 45 µm and subjected to lc ms analysis as described in section 2 4 1 results alteration of toxicity by uv irradiation in order to investigate if ecotoxicological effects of epoxide based coatings are changed by uv a irradiation two different top coatings were examined with and without uv aging for their bacterial toxicity and estrogenicity all tested leachates caused high toxicity to bacteria and induced estrogenic effects interestingly the uv a irradiation of the coatings resulted in a significant decrease of toxicological effects see figure 1 in total 185 19 ng l eeq were determined in leachates of coating a without uv aging whereas the mean eeq concentration was 152 13 ng l in the corresponding leachates of uv aged coatings the leachates of coating b contained 50 6 7 2 ng l eeq without uv aging and 31 4 4 5 ng l eeq after uv irradiation in the bioluminescence inhibition assay the ec50 values in terms of percentage of the sample in the assay of coating a and b without uv aging were 0 190 0 002 and 0 820 0 011 respectively the uv a irradiated plates resulted in ec50 values of 0 260 0 002 in case of coating a and 1 860 0 031 in case of coating b formation of toxic transformation products despite the observed reduced toxicity caused by the uv aging of coatings it cannot be excluded that bioactive transformation products tps are formed during the treatment and released into the environment hptlc coupled bioassays can assist in the identification of toxic compounds by the determination of toxic fractions in continuously separated samples therefore leachates of untreated and uv a irradiated coatings were investigated for differences in effect patterns by means of the hptlc coupled luminescent bacteria assay as well as the planar yeast estrogen screen p yes the bioactive hptlc fractions of respective standards and selected samples were subsequently analyzed by lc ms the phenols 4tbp and bpa were suspected targets to be present as bioactive compounds due to their identification in previous studies investigating leachates of coatings for corrosion protection in all leachates of coatings without uv aging bacterial toxicity was observed as only one very intense signal at a rf value of 0 74 see figure 2 a and figure si 2a at the same height a signal with less intensity was detected in all leachates of coatings with uv aging in case of the irradiated coating an additional inhibition zone occurred at a rf value of 0 32 all signals showed a dose dependent variation of intensity see figure si 3 the same effect patterns were observed by the p yes see figure 2b and figure si 2b with the difference that minimal estrogenic activity already becomes visible at a rf value of 0 32 in leachates of coatings without uv aging however the increased signal intensity after uv irradiation at rf 0 32 is clearly evident the rf values of observed effect signals matched well with the pattern of the suspected compounds 4tbp and bpa not shown the subsequent comparison of chromatograms revealed the presence 4tbp at a rf value of 0 74 and bpa at a rf value of 0 32 figure 3 released substances following the initial identification the samples were further analyzed for possible transformation products of bpa and other phenolic compounds by a targeted lc tandem ms approach in addition to 4tbp and bpa further four phenols namely 4 cumylphenol 4cp 4 1 4 methoxyphenyl 1 methylethyl phenol bpa i11 5 hydroxybisphenol a bpa i10 bisphenol a bis 2 3 dihydroxypropyl ether bis hppp and 2 phenylphenol 2pp were identified these compounds were subsequently quantified by an external calibration see table 2 three of these substances 4tbp bpa and bis hppp were detected in all samples further three 4cp bpa i11 bpa i10 only in leachates of uv irradiated coatings and one 2pp just in leachates of untreated coating b the contents of 4tbp and bis hppp were significantly lower in leachates of uv irradiated coatings compared to leachates of coating without uv treatment the release of 4tbp was reduced by around 40 and 45 in leachates of coating a and b respectively leachates of uv irradiated coating a showed a release of bis hppp reduced on average by 72 compared to the untreated coating a in contrast in leachates of uv irradiated coatings a and b the concentration of bpa increased about 6 and 19 times compared to leachates of coatings without uv treatment characterization of effects caused by identified compounds in addition to the quantification of the released substances the individual compounds were characterized regarding to their toxic potency using the hptlc coupled and the microplate bioassays on basis of the latter test approach the relative contribution of individual substances to the bacterial toxicity and estrogen like effects were estimated all the substances quantified in the leachates of the coatings were toxic to luminescent bacteria figure si 5a by far the highest toxicity was observed in the presence of 4tbp ec50 14 0 0 4 µg l which was also detected in the highest concentrations in the leachates therefore the toxicity to luminescent bacteria was virtually completely driven by 4tbp and the contribution of the other quantified substances is negligible six of the seven quantified substances showed estrogenic effects figure si 5b in this context the most potent substance was 4cp ec50 44 9 5 9 µg l followed by bpa i11 ec50 161 3 1 8 µg l and bpa ec50 302 24 µg l although 4tbp induced the estrogenic effects less strong ec50 6300 220 µg l it could explain more than 99 of the estrogenicity of discovered compounds in leachates of untreated coatings see figure 4 likewise in leachates of uv irradiated coatings the estrogenic effects were driven by 4tbp the mean contribution to estrogenicity of the quantified substances in leachates of coating a and b was 97 and 81 respectively on average bpa explained 3 and 16 of the overall estrogenic potential caused by the identified compounds in samples of uv irradiated coatings a and b in leachates of uv irradiated coating b 2 and 1 of the estrogenicity can be assigned to bpa i11 and 4cp respectively although bpa i10 and 2pp showed estrogenic potential in single testing they did not contribute to the observed effects due to their low concentrations in the leachates bis hppp was not estrogenic far above the measured concentrations the investigation of single standards with the hptlc coupled assays has shown that 4cp and 2pp are potentially contributing to the intense effect signals at rf value of 0 74 figure si 4 moreover in appropriate concentrations the substances bpa i11 and bpa i10 become visible as additional signals at rf value of 0 62 and 0 05 respectively discussion the investigation of two epoxy resin based top coatings revealed the potential release of hazardous substances into the environment along with elevated toxicity to luminescent bacteria and estrogen like effects see table si 1 similar results were obtained in a study by vermeirssen et al 2017 who investigated leachates of anonymized epoxy resin based anti corrosion coatings and detected up to 280 ng l eeq under worst case conditions in contrast to the present observations bpa and not 4tbp was identified as the main driver for the estrogenic effect in concentrations up to 10 4 mg l bpa in the luminescence inhibition assay the lowest ec50 was determined by vermeirssen et al at a sample concentration of 0 4 this finding is in the range of the results reported in the current study the observed decrease of ecotoxicological effects in leachates of uv a irradiated coatings can be associated with the significant decrease of 4tbp concentrations a volatilization of 4tbp during the fabrication of test plates could be responsible for this reduction the treatment with uv a radiation leads to increased temperatures of the investigated coating materials and thus an elevated evaporation of 4tbp is likely secondly a possible degradation of 4tbp to less or non toxic substances might explain reduced concentrations of 4tbp and lower toxic effects previous studies identified 4 2 methyl 2 propanyl 2 4 2 methyl 2 propanyl phenoxy phenol 4 4 di tert butyl o o biphenol 4 tert butylcatechol and 2 tert butylphenol as tps of 4tbp that can be generated by uv photolysis cirkva et al 2005 wu et al 2016 to the best of our knowledge for the two first mentioned tps no analytical standards are available and ecotoxicological effects are not documented so far in contrast the 4tbp degradation product 4 tert butylcatechol is categorized as very toxic to aquatic life and the european chemicals agency echa proposes a predicted no effect concentration pnec of 1 2 µg l for freshwater for 2 tert butylphenol various endocrine effects were documented for example tollefsen and nilsen 2008 determined the binding affinity of 2 tert butylphenol to the hepatic estrogen receptor from rainbow trout li et al 2010 demonstrated antagonistic effects to the androgen receptor and gamma inverse agonistic effects to an estrogen related receptor using a set of recombined yeast strains in contrast to the reduced release of 4tbp the release of bpa from both coatings was increased by the uv a irradiation bpa is the basis of the most common epoxy resins as it is a major compound for the production of the resin monomer bisphenol a diglycidyl ether badge during the curing of coating components the monomers are crosslinked by polyaddition reactions with polyfunctional amines added as hardener earlier studies demonstrated that the photooxidative change of epoxy polymers can be caused by various mechanisms the uv radiation of epoxy resins e g can lead to a chain scission of c n bonds and ring opening reactions of oxirane groups brand et al 2020 kim and urban 2000 liu et al 2014 this indicates that respective parts of the polymeric matrix were degraded and or released into the environment bpa is one of the world s most important and commonly produced industrial chemicals it primarily serves as intermediate in the production of polycarbonate and epoxy resins furthermore it is used as additive e g in the manufacture of thermal paper tires and flame retardants due to its widespread use bpa has been found in waters since the late 1990s and is now detectable in almost all environmental compartments corrales et al 2015 michalowicz 2014 in particular the input of bpa into the environment can be related to traffic and the release from construction materials lamprea et al 2018 investigated a representative selection of building materials and automotive supplies and identified lacquered car bodyworks as important source of bpa contamination in urban runoff with a tested water emission of up to 360 ng cm² on this basis it can be assumed that the emission of bpa from weathered coatings plays a significant role in the overall exposure however investigations on a larger scale or ideally a substance flow analysis for bpa would be necessary for a robust estimation of the contribution to the overall pollution in a european union risk assessment report dating from 2010 monitoring data for bpa in european water bodies were published a mean concentration of 0 13 µg l for freshwaters and 60 ng g dry weight for freshwater sediments was reported ec 2010 bpa is recognized as endocrine disruptor can have adverse effects on the immune system and liver promotes mutagenesis and carcinogenesis and is supposed to mediate neurotoxic and teratogenic effects michalowicz 2014 the echa proposes a pnec of 18 µg l in freshwaters and 1 2 µg g dry weight in freshwater sediments besides bpa four related compounds could be identified via lc ms analyses three of them bpa i10 4cp and bpa i11 were only detected in leachates of uv irradiated coatings and were therefore assumed to be photolytic degradation products of bpa or the bpa based polymer in aqueous solution the degradation reaction of uv irradiated bpa followed a pseudo first order kinetic with a half life time about 6 h kovacic et al 2019 the light sensitivity of bpa and the formation of a variety of derivates by photochemical processes were already reported in former studies cardoso da silva et al 2014 im and loffler 2016 kondrakov et al 2014 molkenthin et al 2013 in this context bpa i10 was formerly identified as photo transformation product of bpa so far to the best of our knowledge the occurrence of bpa i10 in environmental samples was not reported the competitive binding of bpa i10 to erα was reported with a half maximal inhibition concentration ic50 of 50 µm and at the same time this transformation product was identified as slightly less potent than bpa ic50 10 µm nakagawa and suzuki 2001 in toxicity testing with mcf 7 and nih3t3 cells bpa i10 exhibited estrogen like and anti androgenic effects with an ec50 of 1 8 µm and 14 µm respectively kitamura et al 2005 the present results of the yeast estrogen screen ec50 7 5 mg l or 31 µm lie in the range of the previous reports moreover mutou et al 2006 demonstrated a cytotoxicity of bpa i10 on jurkat cells in concentrations from 5 to 50 µm 1 2 to 12 mg l this amounts to the same order of magnitude as the present results of acute bacterial toxicity 4cp is known as impurity in industrial grade bpa terasaki et al 2004 and is used as an intermediate for the production of phenolic resins insecticides and lubricants in polish surface waters concentrations up to 6 2 ng l were detected czarczynska goslinska et al 2017 further monitoring data for 4cp is mainly available for asia ranging from about 2 ng l in river estuaries around dianchi lake in china wang et al 2013 up to 160 ng l in river water of nagoya city in japan hasegawa et al 2016 moreover investigations at the panlong river in china revealed sediment concentrations up to 4 8 ng g and a bioconcentration factor bcf of up to 10 by analyzing muscle liver and gill tissue of wild fish wang et al 2016 in one of six muscle samples of freshwater prawn from local supermarkets in usa 4cp could also be detected with 1 96 ng g wet weight zuo and zhu 2014 perez albaladejo et al 2019 reported that 4cp induced cytotoxic effects ec50 65 µm led to the generation of reactive oxygen species 2 3 fold at 50 µm and increased the p450 aromatase activity 1 3 fold at 20 µm in human placental jeg 3 cells in a yeast two hybrid assay 4cp showed 12 times higher estrogenic effects than bpa terasaki et al 2005 this observation is consistent with the present data revealing a nearly 7 times lower ec50 of 4cp compared to bpa furthermore a recent study reported that low concentrations of 4cp and bpa induce the proliferation of mcf 7 cells synergistically wang et al 2020 investigations of rosenmai et al 2014 indicate that 4cp act by several modes of action within the endocrine system for example the activation of estrogen receptor ec50 0 10 µm and the inhibition of the androgen receptor ec50 5 1 µm was determined by reporter gene assays furthermore agonistic effects on the retinoic acid ra receptor 1 68 µm 4cp showed 20 of the activity of 0 1 µm all trans ra were shown kamata et al 2008 a pnec of 14 2 µg l and 3 58 µg g dry weight is proposed by the echa for freshwater and freshwater sediments bpa i11 was previously mentioned as product of microbial transformation mccormick et al 2011 and of photodegradation catalyzed by nano tio2 jia et al 2012 information on the occurrence of bpa i11 in environmental samples is very limited ashfaq et al 2018 determined an average concentration of 2 75 ng l in jiulong river china investigations on the competitive binding to erα as well as the gene induction and cell proliferation with mcf 7 cells exhibited bpa i11 as less estrogenic than bpa coleman et al 2003 for instance the relative effect on proliferation in response to bpa i11 and bpa differed by one order of magnitude 2 63 10 4 vs 2 00 10 3 ec50 relative to estradiol the opposite trend was observed during the present study as compared by ec50 the effected estrogenicity of bpa i11 was approximately twice as high as the effect induced by bpa furthermore bpa i11 was found to be responsible for the disruption of mitosis and cytokinesis in hela cells by inducing the formation of ectopic spindle poles george et al 2008 even if the correlation of aneuploidy and tumorigenesis is not fully understood this result indicates that bpa i11 can exhibit carcinogenic effects mccormick et al 2011 reported a half maximal lethal concentration of up to 0 66 mg l bpa i11 to zebrafish embryos and thus an almost eight times higher toxicity as bpa the present study indicates that the uv aging of epoxy coatings could contribute to the emission of bpa and its transformation products into the environment due to the potentially incomplete enrichment of hazardous substances by spe the actual toxicity might even be underestimated if a release may lead to locally elevated concentrations and pose an environmental risk needs to be further investigated in field and laboratory studies so far known environmental concentrations are all below the proposed pnecs however the information on the environmental fate and effects of the tps is very limited and pnecs were defined only for individual substances as two of the identified photolytic products i e 4cp and bpa i11 are found to be more potent in the yes and the luminescent bacteria assay than bpa itself they could be of more serious concern especially if continuously released and or accumulated the present study investigated changes in toxicity caused by approximately three months of real time exposure to sunlight to explore the underlying degradation and release kinetics and to predict the total environmental impact of photodegradation products the individual protection period of coatings up to 25 years has to be considered for a more complete picture also further weathering parameters e g temperature humidity and precipitation and coating materials should be investigated compared to other materials such as polyurethanes acrylics polyesters or alkyds epoxy resins are well known for their susceptibility to uv degradation knudsen and forsgren 2017 the absorption of uv radiation by aromatic moieties can lead to the breakdown of the polymeric structure along with the discoloration and chalking of the coating layer ghasemi kahrizsangi et al 2015 to compensate this disadvantage epoxy resin based coatings are frequently covered by top coatings based on polyurethane furthermore the uv resistance of polymers can be improved by different additives as light screens uv absorbers radical scavengers or quenchers hawkins 1984 recent studies demonstrated that the uv resistance of epoxy coatings can for example be enhanced by polyaniline nanowires gao et al 2021 or tio2 nanoparticles blended with poly dimethylamino siloxane fadl et al 2020 to extend the service life of steel coatings and to reduce their emissions in outdoor exposure to solar radiation it is advisable to adjust the recipe of uv sensitive coatings accordingly or to use top layers with more photostable binding agents conclusion the susceptibility of epoxy resin based coatings to uv degradation was demonstrated by the alteration of acute and specific ecotoxicological effects and the release of toxic transformation products both in leachates of untreated and uv a irradiated coatings 4tbp was identified as the main driver of estrogenicity and toxicity to luminescent bacteria additionally bpa and close structural analogs contribute to estrogenic effects in leachates of uv a irradiated materials the combination of hptlc coupled bioassays and lc ms analyses supported the identification of bioactive compounds in terms of an effect directed analysis due to their lower uv stability

19950,organic coatings can guarantee long term protection of steel structures due to causing a physical barrier against water and oxygen because of their mechanical properties and resistances to heat and chemicals epoxy resin based coatings are widely used for corrosion protection despite of the aromatic backbone and the resulting susceptibility to uv degradation epoxy resins are frequently used as binding agent in top layers of anti corrosion coating systems consequently these organic polymers are directly exposed to sunlight and thus uv radiation the present study was designed to investigate if toxic effects of epoxy resin based coatings are changed by uv a irradiation for this purpose two epoxide based top coatings were examined with and without uv aging for their bacterial toxicity and estrogenicity in addition chemical analyses were performed to identify released compounds as well as photolytic degradation products and to assign toxic effects to individual substances uv a irradiation of epoxy resin based top coatings resulted in an overall decrease of acute and specific ecotoxicological effects but as well to the formation of toxic transformation products both in leachates of untreated and uv a irradiated coatings 4tbp was identified as the main driver of estrogenicity and toxicity to luminescent bacteria bpa and structural analogs contributing to estrogenic effects in leachates were formed by uv a irradiation the combination of hptlc coupled bioassays and lc ms analyses supported the identification of bioactive compounds in terms of an effect directed analysis the present findings indicate that epoxide based coatings are less suitable for the application as top coatings and more uv stable coatings like aliphatic polyurethanes should be preferred graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords epoxide leaching toxicity uv a effect directed analysis introduction alterations of metallic construction materials by the reaction with their environment are summarized under the term corrosion to maintain relevant infrastructures this natural process can be prevented by active and passive protection methods active corrosion protection is done by the negative polarization of the steel e g by galvanic anodes or impressed current systems in contrast passive protection methods achieve their anti corrosive properties by acting as barrier between the metal and the corrosive environment an effective and frequently used passive method is the application of organic coatings systems since they can provide long term protection of steel structures even under aggressive environmental conditions e g in industrial or marine applications besides major steel structures such as bridges offshore wind turbines and buildings the bodyworks of vehicles are protected by organic coatings lyon et al 2017 protective paint systems are designed for protection periods up to over 25 years and are internationally standardized according to iso 12944 1 iso 2018a in perspective systems even providing at least 50 years of corrosion protection are intended to be approved kuhlmann 2020 for the fabrication of organic coatings a wide range of binding agents can be applied such as alkyd resins acrylic resins ethyl silicates fluoropolymers polyester resins polysiloxanes polyacrylates and polyaspartates iso 2018a the most commonly used coatings are based on polyurethane or epoxy resins a complete anti corrosion coating system can consist of up to three different coating layers priming intermediate and top coating which themselves consisting of one or two components and are applied usually in up to 360 µm film thickness after application the coating is continually exposed to weathering especially to uv radiation because of their aromatic backbone epoxide based coatings have a decreased uv stability compared to coatings based on polyurethane nevertheless the former is frequently used as top layers in anti corrosion coating systems consequently these organic polymers are irradiated by sunlight and thus uv radiation this might trigger the degradation of the chemical structure of the coating caused by the cleavage of chemical bonds due to photolysis and the attack of free radicals autoxidation hare 1992 besides the negative effects on the durability of the coating by e g cracking or delamination from the coated surface the light induced degradation could possibly lead to the formation of transformation products with unwanted biological activities depending on the corrosive category and protection period the resistance of paints to weathering is examined as part of their performance testing under artificial cycle test according to iso 12944 and natural conditions long term exposure in nature according to baw 2011 the iso standard asks for reduced emissions of volatile organic compounds voc and prohibits the use of toxic and carcinogenic ingredients but the assessment of possible environmental impacts is not part of the authorization of corrosion protection systems however coatings based on epoxy resins can contain a wide range of organic solvents metallic pigments uv stabilizers biocides and other potential hazardous substances as bisphenol a f alkylphenols and other phenolic substances and polyamines which are added as curing agents jin et al 2015 verma et al 2020 all these ingredients and reaction products formed during the hardening by polyaddition reactions potentially pose a risk to the aquatic environment if released from respective steel structures either by a direct contact with a water body or indirectly via the runoff from the structure after rainfall in previous studies the leaching of bisphenol a nonylphenol and 4 tert butylphenol from various unweathered epoxy resin based coatings was already reported in this context estrogenic activity and toxic effects to water fleas luminescent bacteria and cypris larvae of barnacles were detected bell et al 2020 vermeirssen et al 2017 watermann et al 2005 in contrast investigations on uv aged coatings were mainly focused on topics of material and polymer sciences such as the mechanisms of photodegradation or structural and performance changes for instance liu et al 2014 studied the microstructural alteration of a polyamide cured epoxy coating and discovered the formation of micropores along with an increased water barrier function upon uv a irradiation brand et al 2020 recently investigated irradiated coating surfaces and elucidated degradation pathways leading to the delamination of polyurethane top layers however the toxicity of uv aged coatings to the aquatic environment has not been addressed so far therefore this study was designed to investigate if toxic effects of epoxy resin based coatings are changed by uv a irradiation for this purpose two epoxide based top coatings were examined with and without uv aging for their bacterial toxicity and estrogenicity in addition chemical analyses were performed to identify released compounds as well as photolytic products and to assign toxic effects to individual substances material and methods selection of coating systems and fabrication of test plates the current study was performed with two different two component epoxide based top coatings for corrosion protection known for their elevated bacterial toxicity and estrogenic effects from previous investigations bell et al 2020 the selected products are primarily used for the corrosion protection of hydraulic steel structures and are among the most relevant coatings for the federal transport infrastructure of germany the coating was performed by the institute for corrosion protection iks dresden the respective layers were applied on the front back and edges of steel plates with a size of 150 160 3 mm following the respective instructions provided by the manufacturer of the coatings the particular layer thickness was defined by the list of approved coating systems of the baw and amounted to 200 µm and 500 µm for coating a and b respectively the treatment with uv a radiation was conducted in an indoor uv chamber uva cube 400 dr hönle ag germany for 65 h only on the front

bioactive fractions the identification of compounds contributing to bacterial toxicity and estrogen like effects of the extracts was performed by thin layer chromatography the extracts were developed according to the proceeding in hptlc coupled assays based on the previously detected bio active zones toxic fractions were marked on the surface of the hptlc plate with a pencil the silica layer was scraped off the glass at relevant positions with a scalpel and placed in a reaction tube the obtained fractions were extracted with 500 µl ethanol optigrade promochem by thoroughly mixing for 30 s after the centrifugation of the suspensions for 1 min at 14 000 g the supernatants were filtered ptfe 0 45 µm and subjected to lc ms analysis as described in section 2 4 1 results alteration of toxicity by uv irradiation in order to investigate if ecotoxicological effects of epoxide based coatings are changed by uv a irradiation two different top coatings were examined with and without uv aging for their bacterial toxicity and estrogenicity all tested leachates caused high toxicity to bacteria and induced estrogenic effects interestingly the uv a irradiation of the coatings resulted in a significant decrease of toxicological effects see figure 1 in total 185 19 ng l eeq were determined in leachates of coating a without uv aging whereas the mean eeq concentration was 152 13 ng l in the corresponding leachates of uv aged coatings the leachates of coating b contained 50 6 7 2 ng l eeq without uv aging and 31 4 4 5 ng l eeq after uv irradiation in the bioluminescence inhibition assay the ec50 values in terms of percentage of the sample in the assay of coating a and b without uv aging were 0 190 0 002 and 0 820 0 011 respectively the uv a irradiated plates resulted in ec50 values of 0 260 0 002 in case of coating a and 1 860 0 031 in case of coating b formation of toxic transformation products despite the observed reduced toxicity caused by the uv aging of coatings it cannot be excluded that bioactive transformation products tps are formed during the treatment and released into the environment hptlc coupled bioassays can assist in the identification of toxic compounds by the determination of toxic fractions in continuously separated samples therefore leachates of untreated and uv a irradiated coatings were investigated for differences in effect patterns by means of the hptlc coupled luminescent bacteria assay as well as the planar yeast estrogen screen p yes the bioactive hptlc fractions of respective standards and selected samples were subsequently analyzed by lc ms the phenols 4tbp and bpa were suspected targets to be present as bioactive compounds due to their identification in previous studies investigating leachates of coatings for corrosion protection in all leachates of coatings without uv aging bacterial toxicity was observed as only one very intense signal at a rf value of 0 74 see figure 2 a and figure si 2a at the same height a signal with less intensity was detected in all leachates of coatings with uv aging in case of the irradiated coating an additional inhibition zone occurred at a rf value of 0 32 all signals showed a dose dependent variation of intensity see figure si 3 the same effect patterns were observed by the p yes see figure 2b and figure si 2b with the difference that minimal estrogenic activity already becomes visible at a rf value of 0 32 in leachates of coatings without uv aging however the increased signal intensity after uv irradiation at rf 0 32 is clearly evident the rf values of observed effect signals matched well with the pattern of the suspected compounds 4tbp and bpa not shown the subsequent comparison of chromatograms revealed the presence 4tbp at a rf value of 0 74 and bpa at a rf value of 0 32 figure 3 released substances following the initial identification the samples were further analyzed for possible transformation products of bpa and other phenolic compounds by a targeted lc tandem ms approach in addition to 4tbp and bpa further four phenols namely 4 cumylphenol 4cp 4 1 4 methoxyphenyl 1 methylethyl phenol bpa i11 5 hydroxybisphenol a bpa i10 bisphenol a bis 2 3 dihydroxypropyl ether bis hppp and 2 phenylphenol 2pp were identified these compounds were subsequently quantified by an external calibration see table 2 three of these substances 4tbp bpa and bis hppp were detected in all samples further three 4cp bpa i11 bpa i10 only in leachates of uv irradiated coatings and one 2pp just in leachates of untreated coating b the contents of 4tbp and bis hppp were significantly lower in leachates of uv irradiated coatings compared to leachates of coating without uv treatment the release of 4tbp was reduced by around 40 and 45 in leachates of coating a and b respectively leachates of uv irradiated coating a showed a release of bis hppp reduced on average by 72 compared to the untreated coating a in contrast in leachates of uv irradiated coatings a and b the concentration of bpa increased about 6 and 19 times compared to leachates of coatings without uv treatment characterization of effects caused by identified compounds in addition to the quantification of the released substances the individual compounds were characterized regarding to their toxic potency using the hptlc coupled and the microplate bioassays on basis of the latter test approach the relative contribution of individual substances to the bacterial toxicity and estrogen like effects were estimated all the substances quantified in the leachates of the coatings were toxic to luminescent bacteria figure si 5a by far the highest toxicity was observed in the presence of 4tbp ec50 14 0 0 4 µg l which was also detected in the highest concentrations in the leachates therefore the toxicity to luminescent bacteria was virtually completely driven by 4tbp and the contribution of the other quantified substances is negligible six of the seven quantified substances showed estrogenic effects figure si 5b in this context the most potent substance was 4cp ec50 44 9 5 9 µg l followed by bpa i11 ec50 161 3 1 8 µg l and bpa ec50 302 24 µg l although 4tbp induced the estrogenic effects less strong ec50 6300 220 µg l it could explain more than 99 of the estrogenicity of discovered compounds in leachates of untreated coatings see figure 4 likewise in leachates of uv irradiated coatings the estrogenic effects were driven by 4tbp the mean contribution to estrogenicity of the quantified substances in leachates of coating a and b was 97 and 81 respectively on average bpa explained 3 and 16 of the overall estrogenic potential caused by the identified compounds in samples of uv irradiated coatings a and b in leachates of uv irradiated coating b 2 and 1 of the estrogenicity can be assigned to bpa i11 and 4cp respectively although bpa i10 and 2pp showed estrogenic potential in single testing they did not contribute to the observed effects due to their low concentrations in the leachates bis hppp was not estrogenic far above the measured concentrations the investigation of single standards with the hptlc coupled assays has shown that 4cp and 2pp are potentially contributing to the intense effect signals at rf value of 0 74 figure si 4 moreover in appropriate concentrations the substances bpa i11 and bpa i10 become visible as additional signals at rf value of 0 62 and 0 05 respectively discussion the investigation of two epoxy resin based top coatings revealed the potential release of hazardous substances into the environment along with elevated toxicity to luminescent bacteria and estrogen like effects see table si 1 similar results were obtained in a study by vermeirssen et al 2017 who investigated leachates of anonymized epoxy resin based anti corrosion coatings and detected up to 280 ng l eeq under worst case conditions in contrast to the present observations bpa and not 4tbp was identified as the main driver for the estrogenic effect in concentrations up to 10 4 mg l bpa in the luminescence inhibition assay the lowest ec50 was determined by vermeirssen et al at a sample concentration of 0 4 this finding is in the range of the results reported in the current study the observed decrease of ecotoxicological effects in leachates of uv a irradiated coatings can be associated with the significant decrease of 4tbp concentrations a volatilization of 4tbp during the fabrication of test plates could be responsible for this reduction the treatment with uv a radiation leads to increased temperatures of the investigated coating materials and thus an elevated evaporation of 4tbp is likely secondly a possible degradation of 4tbp to less or non toxic substances might explain reduced concentrations of 4tbp and lower toxic effects previous studies identified 4 2 methyl 2 propanyl 2 4 2 methyl 2 propanyl phenoxy phenol 4 4 di tert butyl o o biphenol 4 tert butylcatechol and 2 tert butylphenol as tps of 4tbp that can be generated by uv photolysis cirkva et al 2005 wu et al 2016 to the best of our knowledge for the two first mentioned tps no analytical standards are available and ecotoxicological effects are not documented so far in contrast the 4tbp degradation product 4 tert butylcatechol is categorized as very toxic to aquatic life and the european chemicals agency echa proposes a predicted no effect concentration pnec of 1 2 µg l for freshwater for 2 tert butylphenol various endocrine effects were documented for example tollefsen and nilsen 2008 determined the binding affinity of 2 tert butylphenol to the hepatic estrogen receptor from rainbow trout li et al 2010 demonstrated antagonistic effects to the androgen receptor and gamma inverse agonistic effects to an estrogen related receptor using a set of recombined yeast strains in contrast to the reduced release of 4tbp the release of bpa from both coatings was increased by the uv a irradiation bpa is the basis of the most common epoxy resins as it is a major compound for the production of the resin monomer bisphenol a diglycidyl ether badge during the curing of coating components the monomers are crosslinked by polyaddition reactions with polyfunctional amines added as hardener earlier studies demonstrated that the photooxidative change of epoxy polymers can be caused by various mechanisms the uv radiation of epoxy resins e g can lead to a chain scission of c n bonds and ring opening reactions of oxirane groups brand et al 2020 kim and urban 2000 liu et al 2014 this indicates that respective parts of the polymeric matrix were degraded and or released into the environment bpa is one of the world s most important and commonly produced industrial chemicals it primarily serves as intermediate in the production of polycarbonate and epoxy resins furthermore it is used as additive e g in the manufacture of thermal paper tires and flame retardants due to its widespread use bpa has been found in waters since the late 1990s and is now detectable in almost all environmental compartments corrales et al 2015 michalowicz 2014 in particular the input of bpa into the environment can be related to traffic and the release from construction materials lamprea et al 2018 investigated a representative selection of building materials and automotive supplies and identified lacquered car bodyworks as important source of bpa contamination in urban runoff with a tested water emission of up to 360 ng cm² on this basis it can be assumed that the emission of bpa from weathered coatings plays a significant role in the overall exposure however investigations on a larger scale or ideally a substance flow analysis for bpa would be necessary for a robust estimation of the contribution to the overall pollution in a european union risk assessment report dating from 2010 monitoring data for bpa in european water bodies were published a mean concentration of 0 13 µg l for freshwaters and 60 ng g dry weight for freshwater sediments was reported ec 2010 bpa is recognized as endocrine disruptor can have adverse effects on the immune system and liver promotes mutagenesis and carcinogenesis and is supposed to mediate neurotoxic and teratogenic effects michalowicz 2014 the echa proposes a pnec of 18 µg l in freshwaters and 1 2 µg g dry weight in freshwater sediments besides bpa four related compounds could be identified via lc ms analyses three of them bpa i10 4cp and bpa i11 were only detected in leachates of uv irradiated coatings and were therefore assumed to be photolytic degradation products of bpa or the bpa based polymer in aqueous solution the degradation reaction of uv irradiated bpa followed a pseudo first order kinetic with a half life time about 6 h kovacic et al 2019 the light sensitivity of bpa and the formation of a variety of derivates by photochemical processes were already reported in former studies cardoso da silva et al 2014 im and loffler 2016 kondrakov et al 2014 molkenthin et al 2013 in this context bpa i10 was formerly identified as photo transformation product of bpa so far to the best of our knowledge the occurrence of bpa i10 in environmental samples was not reported the competitive binding of bpa i10 to erα was reported with a half maximal inhibition concentration ic50 of 50 µm and at the same time this transformation product was identified as slightly less potent than bpa ic50 10 µm nakagawa and suzuki 2001 in toxicity testing with mcf 7 and nih3t3 cells bpa i10 exhibited estrogen like and anti androgenic effects with an ec50 of 1 8 µm and 14 µm respectively kitamura et al 2005 the present results of the yeast estrogen screen ec50 7 5 mg l or 31 µm lie in the range of the previous reports moreover mutou et al 2006 demonstrated a cytotoxicity of bpa i10 on jurkat cells in concentrations from 5 to 50 µm 1 2 to 12 mg l this amounts to the same order of magnitude as the present results of acute bacterial toxicity 4cp is known as impurity in industrial grade bpa terasaki et al 2004 and is used as an intermediate for the production of phenolic resins insecticides and lubricants in polish surface waters concentrations up to 6 2 ng l were detected czarczynska goslinska et al 2017 further monitoring data for 4cp is mainly available for asia ranging from about 2 ng l in river estuaries around dianchi lake in china wang et al 2013 up to 160 ng l in river water of nagoya city in japan hasegawa et al 2016 moreover investigations at the panlong river in china revealed sediment concentrations up to 4 8 ng g and a bioconcentration factor bcf of up to 10 by analyzing muscle liver and gill tissue of wild fish wang et al 2016 in one of six muscle samples of freshwater prawn from local supermarkets in usa 4cp could also be detected with 1 96 ng g wet weight zuo and zhu 2014 perez albaladejo et al 2019 reported that 4cp induced cytotoxic effects ec50 65 µm led to the generation of reactive oxygen species 2 3 fold at 50 µm and increased the p450 aromatase activity 1 3 fold at 20 µm in human placental jeg 3 cells in a yeast two hybrid assay 4cp showed 12 times higher estrogenic effects than bpa terasaki et al 2005 this observation is consistent with the present data revealing a nearly 7 times lower ec50 of 4cp compared to bpa furthermore a recent study reported that low concentrations of 4cp and bpa induce the proliferation of mcf 7 cells synergistically wang et al 2020 investigations of rosenmai et al 2014 indicate that 4cp act by several modes of action within the endocrine system for example the activation of estrogen receptor ec50 0 10 µm and the inhibition of the androgen receptor ec50 5 1 µm was determined by reporter gene assays furthermore agonistic effects on the retinoic acid ra receptor 1 68 µm 4cp showed 20 of the activity of 0 1 µm all trans ra were shown kamata et al 2008 a pnec of 14 2 µg l and 3 58 µg g dry weight is proposed by the echa for freshwater and freshwater sediments bpa i11 was previously mentioned as product of microbial transformation mccormick et al 2011 and of photodegradation catalyzed by nano tio2 jia et al 2012 information on the occurrence of bpa i11 in environmental samples is very limited ashfaq et al 2018 determined an average concentration of 2 75 ng l in jiulong river china investigations on the competitive binding to erα as well as the gene induction and cell proliferation with mcf 7 cells exhibited bpa i11 as less estrogenic than bpa coleman et al 2003 for instance the relative effect on proliferation in response to bpa i11 and bpa differed by one order of magnitude 2 63 10 4 vs 2 00 10 3 ec50 relative to estradiol the opposite trend was observed during the present study as compared by ec50 the effected estrogenicity of bpa i11 was approximately twice as high as the effect induced by bpa furthermore bpa i11 was found to be responsible for the disruption of mitosis and cytokinesis in hela cells by inducing the formation of ectopic spindle poles george et al 2008 even if the correlation of aneuploidy and tumorigenesis is not fully understood this result indicates that bpa i11 can exhibit carcinogenic effects mccormick et al 2011 reported a half maximal lethal concentration of up to 0 66 mg l bpa i11 to zebrafish embryos and thus an almost eight times higher toxicity as bpa the present study indicates that the uv aging of epoxy coatings could contribute to the emission of bpa and its transformation products into the environment due to the potentially incomplete enrichment of hazardous substances by spe the actual toxicity might even be underestimated if a release may lead to locally elevated concentrations and pose an environmental risk needs to be further investigated in field and laboratory studies so far known environmental concentrations are all below the proposed pnecs however the information on the environmental fate and effects of the tps is very limited and pnecs were defined only for individual substances as two of the identified photolytic products i e 4cp and bpa i11 are found to be more potent in the yes and the luminescent bacteria assay than bpa itself they could be of more serious concern especially if continuously released and or accumulated the present study investigated changes in toxicity caused by approximately three months of real time exposure to sunlight to explore the underlying degradation and release kinetics and to predict the total environmental impact of photodegradation products the individual protection period of coatings up to 25 years has to be considered for a more complete picture also further weathering parameters e g temperature humidity and precipitation and coating materials should be investigated compared to other materials such as polyurethanes acrylics polyesters or alkyds epoxy resins are well known for their susceptibility to uv degradation knudsen and forsgren 2017 the absorption of uv radiation by aromatic moieties can lead to the breakdown of the polymeric structure along with the discoloration and chalking of the coating layer ghasemi kahrizsangi et al 2015 to compensate this disadvantage epoxy resin based coatings are frequently covered by top coatings based on polyurethane furthermore the uv resistance of polymers can be improved by different additives as light screens uv absorbers radical scavengers or quenchers hawkins 1984 recent studies demonstrated that the uv resistance of epoxy coatings can for example be enhanced by polyaniline nanowires gao et al 2021 or tio2 nanoparticles blended with poly dimethylamino siloxane fadl et al 2020 to extend the service life of steel coatings and to reduce their emissions in outdoor exposure to solar radiation it is advisable to adjust the recipe of uv sensitive coatings accordingly or to use top layers with more photostable binding agents conclusion the susceptibility of epoxy resin based coatings to uv degradation was demonstrated by the alteration of acute and specific ecotoxicological effects and the release of toxic transformation products both in leachates of untreated and uv a irradiated coatings 4tbp was identified as the main driver of estrogenicity and toxicity to luminescent bacteria additionally bpa and close structural analogs contribute to estrogenic effects in leachates of uv a irradiated materials the combination of hptlc coupled bioassays and lc ms analyses supported the identification of bioactive compounds in terms of an effect directed analysis due to their lower uv stability

19951,the anaerobic treatment of wastewater leads to the loss of dissolved methane in the effluent of the treatment plant especially when operated at low temperatures the emission of this greenhouse gas may reduce or even offset the environmental gain from energy recovery through anaerobic treatment we demonstrate here the removal and elimination of these comparably small methane concentrations using an ecologically engineered methanotrophic community harbored in oxygenic photogranules we constructed a syntrophy between methanotrophs enriched from activated sludge and cyanobacteria residing in photogranules and maintained it over a two month period in a continuously operated reactor the novel community removed dissolved methane during stable reactor operation by on average 84 8 7 4 standard deviation with an average effluent concentration of dissolved methane of 4 9 3 7 mg ch4 l 1 the average methane removal rate was 26 mg ch4 l 1 d 1 with an observed combined biomass yield of 2 4 g vss g ch4 1 the overall cod balance closed at around 91 small photogranules removed methane more efficiently than larger photogranule likely because of a more favorable surface to volume ratio of the biomass miseq amplicon sequencing of 16s and 23s rrna revealed a potential syntrophic chain between methanotrophs non methanotrophic methylotrophs and filamentous cyanobacteria the community composition between individual photogranules varied considerably suggesting cross feeding between photogranules of different community composition methanotrophic photogranules may be a viable option for dissolved methane removal as anaerobic effluent post treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved methane interactions bioaugmentation ecological engineering effluent polishing anaerobic digestion introduction the use of anaerobic granulated biomass for biological wastewater treatment was introduced about 40 years ago lettinga et al 1980 and is now regarded an adequate methodology for municipal wastewater treatment seghezzo et al 1998 and energy recovery gao et al 2014 the development of anaerobic wastewater treatment since the end of the 1990s has been considered a more sustainable alternative to traditional aerobic processes especially for high strength wastewater its primary purpose is the conversion of organic matter to methane as a renewable form of energy vandevivere 1999 verstraete et al 1996 an often overlooked drawback of anaerobic wastewater treatment is the loss of dissolved methane as not all of it partitions to the gas phase inside the digesters estimations of the loss of dissolved methane from anaerobic wastewater treatment are typically calculated from methane concentrations in the gaseous headspace using henry s law i e under equilibrium conditions lobato et al 2012 this idealized case does not always reflect the actual measured values of anaerobic treatment liquid effluent as mass transfer limitations can lead to supersaturation of methane in this case an assumed equilibrium with headspace concentrations will thus underestimate the dissolved methane content souza et al 2011 and wu et al 2017 found that dissolved methane was supersaturated in the liquid phase of an anaerobic bioreactor effluent saturation factor of 1 03 1 67 increasing with the increased methane solubility at decreasing temperatures even at equilibrium considerable amounts of methane are lost with the liquid effluent especially when treating wastewater at low temperatures and or in high flow through situations low hydraulic retention time brandt et al 2019 once the effluent is discharged and exposed to ambient methane partial pressures methane degasses into the atmosphere theoretically 0 38 liters of methane are produced per gram of chemical oxygen demand cod removed from the anaerobic wastewater treatment at standard ambient condition 25 c 1 atm tchobanoglous et al 2003 by assuming 80 cod removal efficiency for a typical high strength municipal wastewaters with an average soluble cod concentration of 450 g m 3 henze et al 2008 137 l ch4 m 3 is produced equivalent to 89 7 g ch4 m 3 at a methane solubility of approximately 20 g m 3 at 25 c liu et al 2014 approximately 22 of all produced methane would be in its dissolved form and likely leave the digester at most about 107 l ch4 m 3 could be used for combustion saving fossil co2 emissions of 107 l co2 m 3 degassing of the dissolved methane to the atmosphere however would contribute approximately 500 g co2 equiv m 3 equivalent to 278 l co2 m 3 therefore the greenhouse gas contribution in this example is about 2 5 times greater than the positive effects from generating a renewable energy see supplemental materials this methane loss is significantly reducing and as in the given example even offsetting the positive effect of energy recovery from anaerobic wastewater treatment therefore a post treatment process is required to remove dissolved methane reducing the environmental impact of anaerobic wastewater treatment several methods have been proposed for removing or recovering dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents these include air stripping oxidation hatamoto et al 2010 matsuura et al 2015 and degassing membrane based recovery bandara et al 2011 cookney et al 2016 dissolved methane can be biologically oxidized by methanotrophs methanotrophs are part of a larger group of bacteria called methylotrophs that typically utilize single carbon compounds like methane methanol formic acid or even formaldehyde as carbon and energy source chistoserdova et al 2009 methanotrophs may fully oxidize methane to co2 or partially to molecules like methanol molecular oxygen is required for the conversion through the coupled activities of eukaryotic algae or photosynthetic bacteria and methanotrophs in syntrophic bioaggregates oxygen may be provided by direct or at least local transfer the produced oxygen is then immediately utilized by the methanotrophs to convert organic matter to co2 which is in turn used by phototrophs for autotrophic co2 fixation these interactions are found in natural systems for example at the chemocline between anaerobic and aerobic water layers in freshwater lakes milucka et al 2015 and are also utilized in engineered systems e g by van der ha et al 2012 for the production of lipids or polyhydroxy butyrate using co cultured eukaryotic algae and methanotrophs rasoulie et al 2018 also investigated a co culture of green microalgae and methanotrophs for removing methane and recovering nutrients they used industrial wastewater as media and synthetic biogas as methane source in both studies the authors used pure cultures of methanotrophs and microalgae rasouli et al 2018 van der ha et al 2012 in nature methanotrophs often co occur with non methanotrophic methylotrophs that feed on partially oxidized methane intermediates like methanol takeuchi et al 2019 yu et al 2017 these more complex interactions are also relevant in our study using an environmental enrichment as basis for the construction of a new syntrophy in contrast to studies using suspended phototrophic methanotrophic consortia we present here an aggregated biomass in the form of photogranules for the aeration free removal of dissolved methane the conversion relies on syntrophic interactions between phototrophic cyanobacteria and methanotrophic bacteria aggregated in oxygenic photogranules aggregation is particularly important in the bioprocesses as it allows efficient and fast removal of the biomass from the treated water and efficient intra aggregate oxygen transfer we established the presence of methanotrophic bacteria in the photogranule aggregates and propagated the newly developed syntrophy in an open community challenged by invading microbes the syntrophy was ecologically engineered from an enrichment culture of methanotrophs from activated sludge and oxygenic photogranules converting synthetic wastewater as described in milferstedt et al 2017 we discuss community assembly in the light of performance characteristics of a continuously operated reactor system for the removal of dissolved methane materials and methods media composition the media composition for the batch experiments i e enrichment and size specific analysis and for the continuously operated reactor were identical a modified nitrate mineral salt nms solution whittenbury et al 1970 the nutrient content of the nms media was modified by increasing the phosphate concentration and replacing nitrate with ammonium as nitrogen sources to mimic effluents from anaerobic processes the media was prepared and diluted with tap water which naturally containing approximately 4 mm as bicarbonate hco3 the final concentrations in the feed were as following 150 mg l 1 of nh4cl 20 mg l 1 of mgso4 7h2o 4 mg l 1 of cacl2 6h2o 5 44 mg l 1 of kh2po4 12 2 mg l 1 of k2hpo4 5 mg l 1 of fecl3 20 mg l 1 of disodium edta 0 03 ml l 1 of hcl from a stock solution we added 1 ml l 1 of trace elements resulting in concentrations of 10 mg l 1 of disodium edta 0 2 mg l 1 of znso4 7h2o 0 06 mg l 1 of mncl2 4h2o 0 6 mg l 1 of h3bo3 0 06 mg l 1 of na2moo4 2h2o 4 mg l 1 of feso4 7h2o 0 04 mg l 1 of nicl2 6h2o 0 4 mg l 1 of cocl2 6h2o and 0 02 mg l 1 of cuso4 5h2o methanotrophic enrichment methanotrophs were enriched under batch conditions from municipal activated sludge from the wastewater treatment plant in narbonne france we used 160 ml serum bottles with 50 ml as liquid volume of the media to the media 10 ml of inoculum were added so that a 100 ml gaseous headspace remained replicated enrichments 4 10 replicates were incubated either with or without mixing using magnetic stirring we also enriched the activated sludge mixed with fresh oxygenic photogranules and oxygenic photogranules only without mixing for all enrichments the serum bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and capped using aluminum crimp caps the headspace gas was mixed prior to the gas injection by combining 30 vol ch4 and 70 vol o2 during the injection a pressure of 1 49 0 05 bar standard deviation was achieved in the serum bottle headspace the pressure was manually confirmed using a handheld manometer keller leo 2 switzerland we used purified methane for feeding from biogas produced in two laboratory scale anaerobic digesters this was done using a co2 absorbing bubble column containing naoh at 3 m the final methane concentration was on average 98 1 2 3 standard deviation pure oxygen was used the serum bottles were incubated at room temperature using a serological pipette a volume of 20 ml of the methanotroph enrichment culture was transferred every five to seven days into a new serum bottle containing 40 ml of fresh media after each transfer the headspace was renewed with a fresh ch4 and o2 mixture 30 70 at approximately 1 5 bar after a third transfer i e after about 21 days we observed decreasing oxygen and methane concentrations in the headspace of several bottles from that point on in all bottles a mix of methane and oxygen 30 70 was added on a daily basis after the fourth transfer we harvested the enriched suspended methanotrophic cultures and transferred them to five new serum bottles with fresh media and approximately ten oxygenic photogranules each with an approximate average diameter of 1 2 mm the untreated fresh oxygenic photogranules were obtained from a continuously operated reactor to the methanotroph enrichment and oxygenic photogranules we added 100 methane in the headspace assuming that oxygen would be provided by photosynthesis bottles were incubated on a shaker that was equipped with fluorescent light bulbs providing photoactive radiation par at approximately 58 μmol m 2 s 1 par was measured at the outside of the flasks using a light meter li 250a li cor usa after one week the active methanotrophic photogranules were separated from the suspended biomass and rinsed photogranules were rinsed using deionized water before the final transfer into the continuous reactor to avoid suspended and loosely attached biomass only the solid photogranule biomass was used to inoculate the continuous reactor set up and operation of continuous reactor approximately 60 active methanotrophic photogranules were transferred to an airtight glass vessel with 1 8 l of liquid volume operated as a continuously stirred tank reactor fig 1 shows a schematic view of the reactor set up we used overhead mixing as this type of agitation does not impact photogranules stability the use of magnetic stir bar resulted in gradually crushing photogranules milferstedt et al 2017 we used an airtight overhead magnetic stirrer head of the g mrk ptfe type with a ground joint bola bohlender gmbh germany connected to an overhead motor using a polyoxymethylene globe stirrer coupling bola bohlender gmbh germany the coupling compensates potential misalignment between the overhead motor and the magnetic stirrer head the reactor vessel was a borosilicate glass beaker with a glass flat flange lid containing one central and three angled ground necks mixing was provided by a stainless steel impeller operated at 100 rpm during the first 30 days of reactor operation increased to 125 128 rpm on day 31 for the remainder of the experiment light was provided using standard 60 60 cm2 led panels emitting warm white at 4000k a light intensity of approximately 45 μmol m 2 s 1 par was measured at the outside of the vertical reactor surface the reactor was operated at an average room temperature of 23 2 1 0 c standard deviation without active temperature control the dissolved oxygen concentration in the reactor fluctuated with an average 1 8 3 2 mg l 1 high oxygen concentrations were observed to be a consequence of membrane fouling of the electrode membrane the average ph in the reactor was 7 0 0 2 initially all headspace compartments and the experimental set up e g tubings fittings were flushed with nitrogen and methane 92 8 vol vol before the start of operation as the supply of biogenic purified methane was limited pure nitrogen 100 was used for flushing the headspace during routine reactor operation e g after manual interventions for cleaning and biomass removal after start up methane saturated feed was continuously pumped into the reactor the reactor was operated at a hydraulic retention time of 12 h the media contained on average 17 6 2 2 mg ch4 l 1 standard deviation and the volumetric organic loading rate was approximately 35 1 4 5 mg ch4 l 1 d 1 media preparation as mentioned in section 2 1 the initial media composition for the continuously operated reactor was identical with the batch experiments media was prepared in an o2 and co2 free closed atmosphere obtained by initially sparging the preparation system with nitrogen gas for approximately 15 min until the dissolved oxygen concentration measured with a handheld oxygen meter multi 3620 ids wtw germany was below the detection limit this precaution was taken to limit the supply with externally provided co2 and oxygen so that growth of methanotrophs and phototrophs in the reactor could be linked to their respective metabolic activities then the media was saturated with purified methane by recirculating methane through the solution using a diaphragm pump and porous diffusors this step took around six hours the media was then transferred using gas tight tubing and a peristaltic pump into the 20 l media storage tank a capacity of 20 l ensured autonomy for a 72 h period media preparation and media storage were physically separated in two bottles to assure continuous feeding during media preparation one batch of methane saturated media had a maximum volume of 10 l limited by laboratory safety consideration the long preparation was mostly due to slow gas transfer from the methane atmosphere to the aqueous phase photogranule size analysis we quantified the total number of all photogranules in the reactor and their size distribution based on equivalent diameters for this we temporarily placed the entire content of the reactor on a custom built square tray with a transparent glass bottom 17 7 17 6 cm2 that was then placed on the glass surface of a desktop scanner canon lide 220 japan an image of the photogranules through the bottom of the tray was acquired with the dimensions of 5583 5556 pixels and saved as a non compressed 8 bit gray level tagged image format tif file care was taken to avoid overlap or contact between individual photogranules as this would have made the subsequent image analysis more complicated with increasing numbers of photogranules in the reactor photogranules were partitioned into several batches and multiple images were acquired using a custom made script in imagej schneider et al 2012 we then used the maximum entropy thresholding algorithm to differentiate photogranules from the background using the morpholibj plugin legland et al 2016 noise was removed on the images by applying the morphological operation opening with a radius of 1 white pixels within apparent particles on the images were filled using the fill holes command particles in contact with the image boundaries were removed using the kill borders command to avoid counting particles that were not entirely visible on the images the area of each detected object was then quantified and translated into the equivalent diameter of an assumed perfect circle with the same area analytical methods gaseous samples were withdrawn from the headspace of enrichment cultures and the reactor using gas tight syringes sge europe subsequently samples were analyzed using gas chromatography perkin elmer gc580 usa for determination the concentration of ch4 n2 co2 and o2 the gc was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector rt msieve 5a column 0 32 mm diameter 30 m length and 30 μm film helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 35 4 ml min 1 the oven temperature was 60 c dissolved methane was determined by converting the dissolved cod measurement by multiplying with the specific cod equivalent of methane 4 g cod g ch4 1 total and dissolved cod were determined daily using standard cod test kits with a detection range of 0 150 mg l 1 aqualytic germany the influent and effluent samples were withdrawn using a 5 ml syringe containing no gas phases the samples were immediately and directly filtered through a 0 45 µm ptfe hydrophilic membrane syringe filter into a cod test kit and sealed immediately speedy sample handling and processing ensured reliable measurements of dissolved methane total cod measurement was conducted without filtering the sample we compensated for any background cod by measuring blank cod concentrations in the ready made media before methane equilibration and then subtract that from all consecutive cod measurements made at the reactor inlet and outlet cod compensation was done to account for any compounds in the media with a potential contribution to cod notably edta total suspended solid tss was measured following standard methods 2540d after the filtered samples pre weighted glass fiber filter pore size 0 45 μm diameter 47 mm 934 ah rtu whatman uk dried at 105 c for 1 h rice et al 2013 samples were taken in duplicates for each gas cod and tss measurement observed biomass yield the overall observed biomass yield was determined based on the ratio of cumulative generated biomass g tss per cumulative consumed substrate g ch4 assuming 15 inorganic biomass fraction the cumulative generated biomass in the unit of g tss is converted to the unit of g vss the consumed substrate g ch4 was measured daily as cod removed by the system the cumulative generated biomass consists of the accumulated biomass in the system cumulative biomass wastage and biomass effluent the accumulated biomass and biomass wastage were measured weekly while doing cleaning and maintenance in addition the suspended biomass in the effluent was measured daily we calculated the specific cod of tss using linear regression analysis chon et al 2011 dependence of methanotrophic activity on photogranules size when assuming phototropic methane conversion to be a surface depending process photogranule size may influence the specific phototrophic and methanotrophic activities by affecting surface to volume ratios and diffusional lengths we analyzed the specific metabolic activity in batch experiments in serum bottles under the same conditions as during the enrichment experiments we prepared a serum bottle per size class containing on average six similar sized photogranules photogranules were sampled during stable reactor performance on day 29 57 72 79 86 and 97 for each test three size classes 1 0 2 2 mm 2 3 3 7 mm and 3 8 5 5 mm were defined microbial analysis photogranules were sampled for community analysis 1 before contact with methanotrophic enrichments samples named background 2 after incubation with methanotrophic enrichments samples named inoculum and 3 during continuous operation of the reactor samples named continuous reactor operation sampled photogranules were stored at 20 c for subsequent dna extraction dna was extracted using the dneasy powerwater kit qiagen germany according to the manufacturer s instructions the genomic dna was used in two independent miseq sequencing reactions for 16s rrna amplicons and 23s rrna amplicons the 16s rrna amplicons were generated using the primer pair 515f 5

bioanalyzer 2100 agilent usa in a second pcr of 12 cycles an index sequence was added and the resulting pcr products were purified and loaded onto the illumina miseq cartridge according to the manufacturer s instructions for sequencing of paired 300 bp reads v3 chemistry library preparation and sequencing was done at the get plage sequencing center of the genotoul lifescience network in toulouse france https get genotoul fr the datasets for this study can be found in the ncbi sequence read archive sra database as bioproject prjna686893 sequences were dereplicated quality checked chimera checked and affiliated with a taxonomic description using mothur version 1 42 3 schloss et al 2009 sequence treatment included preclustering at four differences in nucleotides over the length of the amplicon and chimera checking using uchime edgar et al 2011 we removed all sequences that appeared less than three times in the entire dataset the databases silva quast et al 2013 132 ssu 16s rrna and 132 lsuref 23s rrna were used for alignment and as taxonomic outline cleaned up and taxonomically affiliated sequence data was written into a biom file and was subsequently merged with the environmental data and analyzed in r version 4 0 3 r core team 2020 using the r packages phyloseq mcmurdie holmes 2013 and tidyverse wickham et al 2019 for the 16s rrna amplicons we removed the sequences affiliated with cyanobacteria using subset sample command in phyloseq with the argument phylum cyanobacteria for the 23s data we separated the chloroplast sequences from cyanobacteria using the same command with the argument phylum cyanobacteria order chloroplast on average the 16s rrna amplicons contained 50600 7300 standard deviation bacterial sequences per sample of which on average 17100 7500 were not cyanobacteria even though the 16s rrna reverse primer supposedly excludes cyanobacterial sequences hodkinson lutzoni 2009 we nevertheless find them in high abundance likely because of the overwhelming presence of cyanobacteria in the systems with the exception of the activated sludge sample that only contained four sequences affiliated with phototrophs in the 16s amplicon on average the 23s rrna amplicons contained 51700 6700 sequences per sample of which on average 1800 1600 or 3 5 3 0 were eukaryotic microalgae the counts disregard the activated sludge sample that only contained 370 sequences affiliated with cyanobacteria in the 23s amplicon however in which we detected the highest absolute and relative counts of microalgae in this study based on taxonomic outlines offered by the silva 132 ssu and lsu databases we considered the following taxa detected in our amplicons as putative methanotrophic the families methylococcaceae containing the genus methyloparacoccus methylomonaceae containing the genera methylomonas methylobacter methylomicrobium and methylosarcina and beijerinckiaceae containing methylocystis and methylobacterium we considered as non methanotrophic methylotrophs the genus methyloversatilis of the family rhodocyclaceae and the family methylophilaceae containing the genera methylophilus and methylobacillus results and discussions successful establishment of a syntrophic methane degrading community methanotrophs were enriched from activated sludge in gas tight stoppered serum bottles with a mixture of oxygen and methane in the headspace we tested enrichments with and without mixing by magnetic stirring after four transfers every five days into fresh media all enrichments that were mixed during incubation removed methane and produced carbon dioxide according to the methane oxidation stoichiometry closing the mass balance by more than 80 we detected methane removal in approximately half of statically incubated cultures i e without mixing mixing increases methane transfer across the gas liquid interface leading to more successful incubations the enrichments from unstirred oxygenic photogranules mixed with activated sludge removed methane however unstirred and stirred activated sludge enrichments removed methane twice and four times faster respectively fresh photogranules did not exhibit a measurable methanotrophic activity we detected methane removal after adding 100 methane without externally provided oxygen to a mixture of fresh non methanotrophic photogranules and methanotrophic enrichments from activated sludge also the production of oxygen and co2 was measured this observation demonstrated the onset of engineered syntrophic interactions between methanotrophs and oxygenic photogranules we were thus able to introduce a novel function into an existing granulated microbial ecosystem laying the basis for a potential future application in biotechnology in which biomass harvesting is feasible continuous reactor performance for removing dissolved methane the ecologically engineered methane converting photogranules were then used as inoculum for the continuously operated reactor fig 2 shows the dissolved cod removal efficiency as proxy for methane removal as well as effluent total suspended solids tss over time dissolved methane removal efficiencies fluctuated over the first week of operation effluent concentrations stabilized over the following two weeks and the methane removal efficiency steadily increased on day 16 biofilm on reactor surfaces and equipment was removed resulting in a 5 decrease in methane removal the rather moderate decrement indicates that the vast majority of methane oxidation was situated in photogranular biomass and not in the biofilm formed on the reactor surfaces approximately 10 mg tss l 1 of suspended solids were washed out from the reactor photogranules became increasingly more filamentous at this time fig 3 a middle the change of photogranule morphology could have been influenced by the increase in biomass concentration and a local decrease in light availability in the reactor the cyanobacteria might try to increase their surface area by forming filamentous outgrowth and therefore exposure to light biddanda et al 2015 after about three weeks of operation effluent tss increased due to the detachment of filaments from the photogranules application of higher mixing intensity on day 31 from 100 rpm to 125 128 rpm resulted in an increase in methane removal efficiency now exceeding 90 mixing serves the purposes of minimizing the laminar boundary layer around the photogranules and keeping the photogranules in suspension beun et al 2000 liu et al 2003 we also changed mixing to increase detachment of filaments from the photogranule surfaces this approach worked resulting in temporarily increased effluent suspended solid concentrations from the reactor fig 2 days 31 to 40 and less filamentous photogranules however the sudden detachment became problematic for reactor operation at day 40 when the effluent clogged turning operation into safety mode for two days i e without water in and outflow the reactor was operational again after cleaning and wasting some photogranules at day 43 on day 43 biomass was purposely wasted to obtain approximately 1 5 g tss l 1 introduction of a weekly cleaning and biomass wasting protocol by removing approximately 0 5 0 7 g tss l 1 prevented further clogging and maintained a balanced biomass concentration in the reactor of approximately 1 2 g tss l 1 this weekly biomass removal represented about one third to half of the biomass in the reactor the removal of granular biomass on day 43 caused a drop in methane removal efficiency from about 90 to 60 the removal efficiency reached on average 84 8 7 4 standard deviation between day 54 93 on day 94 a decreased methane removal efficiency was observed due to accidental wasting of a large numbers of photogranules however performance recovered over the next week to above 80 the average effluent concentration of dissolved methane and the averaged methane removal rate during reactor operation was 4 9 3 7 mg ch4 l 1 and 26 3 2 6 mg ch4 l 1 d 1 respectively in van der ha et al 2011 an overall methane oxidation rate was reported to be 171 mg ch4 l 1 liquid phase d 1 which appears to be 6 6 times higher than in our experiments a major factor leading to a higher removal rate is the organic loading in van der ha et al 2011 235 ml of ch4 were added over 72 hours which corresponds to approximately 258 mg ch4 l 1 d 1 at 22 c our olr of 35 1 4 5 mg ch4 l 1 d 1 was thus 7 3 times lower it is important to note that the rates are not immediately comparable as van der ha et al 2011 worked in a batch system over 90 h while our results are obtained in a cstr with an hrt of 12 h the observed overall biomass yield was 0 7 g tss g cod 1 equivalent to 0 6 g vss g cod 1 assuming 15 inorganic biomass fraction per mass substrate ch4 this is equivalent to 2 4 g vss g ch4 1 the observed yield represents the combination of cellular yield from methanotrophic and cyanobacterial growth literature values of methanotrophic yields relevant for our study have been reported by leak dalton 1986 and arcangeli arvin 1999 by theoretical analysis and experimental observations on suspended methylococcus capsulatus leak dalton 1986 reported cellular yield of 0 6 0 7 g vss g ch4 1 on cultivation conditions similar to this study arcangeli arvin 1999 studied a methanotrophic biofilm enriched from landfill soil and estimated the dry weight yield to be 0 56 g vss g ch4 1 as conditions and growth technique granular aggregation is similar to biofilms and our media 0 02 mg l 1 of cuso4 5h2o was comparable to the cu limited experiment of leak and dalton 1986 we estimate methanotrophic yields to be in the order of 0 5 0 6 g vss g ch4 1 which leaves the remaining observed 1 8 g vss g ch4 1 to be the autotrophic contribution assuming all co2 from the mineralization of methane to be assimilated by the phototrophic bacteria a combined methanotrophic and phototrophic yield of 1 54 g vss g ch4 1 would be theoretically possible the observed combined yield 2 4 g vss g ch4 1 therefore indicates an additional autotrophic growth contribution of 0 9 g vss g ch4 1 probably originating from the inlet bicarbonate high biomass yields in this system highlight the potential for the recovery of chemical energy or the methane based biorefinery using photogranules the overall cod balance closed at 91 of the inlet cod the unaccounted 9 cod could be explained the reactor system still not completely at steady state positive bioaccumulation and by the negative cod contribution by phototrophically produced oxygen consumed by the methanotrophs during methane mineralization we can rule out leakages in the system and therefore potential methane loss or oxygen and co2 entering the system the tightness of the reactor system was verified by frequently checking the gas composition in the headspace of the reactor using gas chromatography the results showed that in the headspace the dominant gas were nitrogen oxygen and methane by 89 3 3 3 4 4 2 6 and 4 9 2 3 v v standard deviation respectively the high presence of nitrogen gas resulted from the regular flushing of the headspace with nitrogen during reactor cleaning and maintenance only at most traces of co2 were detected in the gas phase at 0 01 0 02 v v cyanobacteria can use co2 hco3 and possibly also co3 2 as carbon source schneider campion alsumard 1999 in our study methane was not the sole carbon sources but hco3 was contained as hardness in the tap water we used for media preparation based on the growth stoichiometry for methane oxidation coupled to photosynthesis the theoretically produced oxygen from co2 assimilation during photosynthesis only provides roughly 20 of the oxygen needed for complete methane oxidation the presence of hco3 to the media would enhance the methane removal efficiency due to higher oxygen availability from bicarbonate photosynthesis the 4 mm hco3 contained in the tap water could theoretically supply an additional 2 58 mm o2 or an equivalent cod of 82 mg l 1 upon autotrophic growth hence methane oxidation is not stoichiometric oxygen limited by cyanobacterial growth similar findings were reported in the literature where in the absence of external oxygen supply microalgal photosynthesis was not sufficient for methane oxidation bahr et al 2011 only when bicarbonate was introduced the methane removal efficiency increased we suggest that the elevated methane removal in the absence of any external oxygen supply can only be explained by in situ oxygen production and immediate uptake by methanotrophs our results therefore demonstrate the establishment of syntrophic interactions between phototrophs and methanotrophs this syntrophy was stably maintained over seven weeks during continuous reactor operation photogranule development in continuously operated reactor during continuous reactor operation new photogranules rapidly formed fig 3 after 16 days of continuous operation the photogranules became dark green roughly spherical and filamentous fig 3 the presence of filamentous cyanobacteria was confirmed by white light and fluorescence microscopy development of the filamentous morphology likely caused the increase in suspended solids in the reactor effluent fig 2 we successfully generated a less filamentous photogranule phenotype by increasing mixing from 100 rpm to 125 128 rpm starting on day 31 immediately after the increase the photogranules lost substantial amounts of filaments whitish areas on the photogranules surface became visible fig 3b middle using image analysis we determined the number and the size of photogranules in the reactor over the first four weeks the number of photogranules increased from initially 60 with an approximated total surface area of 0 08 cm2 day 0 to 888 and a total surface area of 240 cm2 on day 16 and to about 2000 with a total surface area of 551 cm2 on day 29 fig 4 after the major wasting and cleaning event on day 43 the number and surface area of photogranules decreased to 613 and 77 3 cm2 respectively however the biomass concentration increased in the following days and reached more than 3500 photogranules and 1105 cm2 of surface area on day 79 fig 4 the range of biomass diameters on day 16 was between 1 and 7 mm with an average of 2 6 1 3 mm standard deviation on day 43 because of increasing shear the predominant diameter of photogranules was less than 2 mm the largest size of photogranules in the reactor was approximately 7 5 mm this size is larger than the typical size of aerobic granular sludge with sizes in the range of 4 to 6 mm beun et al 2000 morgenroth et al 1997 however towards the end of reactor operation more than 90 of the photogranules were between 1 and 3 mm with an average diameter of 2 6 1 0 mm this value is greater than the size of photogranules 2 mm in diameter reported from previous photogranule reactor studies abouhend et al 2018 liu et al 2017 size specific analysis of methanotrophic activity photogranule size may influence the specific phototrophic and methanotrophic activities as we assume phototrophic methane conversion to be a surface depending process photogranule size affects the surface to volume ratios and diffusional lengths we analyzed the specific metabolic activity in batch experiments for sets of on average six similar sized photogranules in size classes between 1 3 and 5 5 mm in average diameter fig 5 photogranules were sampled during stable reactor performance photogranules with diameters of approximately 1 2 mm gave the highest surface specific methane removal rate of 0 53 0 02 mg ch4 d 1 mm 2 standard deviation the methane removal rate per photogranule surface area decreased with increasing diameter fig 5a the relation with the surface to volume ratio is presented in fig 5b an elevated surface to volume ratio is beneficial for methane removal from a conversion perspective it is favorable to engineer a size distribution within the reactor of minimal photogranule diameter the surface dependent character of photogranule metabolism was also shown in a recent study by abouhend et al 2020 in which oxygenic photogranules of 0 5 1 7 mm in diameter showed the highest oxygen production rate compared to bigger photogranules abouhend et al 2020 higher oxygen production rates influence the treatment potential of the biomass in this case dissolved methane removal due to higher oxygen availability from photosynthesis as electron acceptor bigger photogranules may also become less active because they lose their cyanobacteria from the core as the photo layer appear to be limited to depth of about 700 µm milferstedt et al 2017 community analysis related to methane removal performances using miseq amplicon sequencing we analyzed the microbial communities in various photogranules sampled from the sequencing batch reactor as well as the enriched inoculum and background material before the enrichment we detected the presence of sequences belonging to methylotrophic bacteria in our samples fig 6 a the detected methylotrophs predominantly belong to methanotrophic bacteria a subgroup of the methylotrophs able to directly use methane as carbon and energy source a frequent intermediate or even final product of methanotrophs is methanol kalyuzhnaya xing 2018 also non methanotrophic methylotrophs were detected in elevated abundances fig 6a notably of the family methylophilaceae often involved in methanol conversion yu et al 2017 these groups of bacteria may participate in a communal metabolism of methane beck et al 2013 oshkin et al 2015 in the background material before the enrichment process only in raw activated sludge we detected sequences of one methanotrophic type in the 16s rrna amplicons at a relative abundance of 0 02 of all bacterial sequences excluding cyanobacteria this sequence type was unique to the activated sludge sample and undetected in the inoculum and during reactor operation in oxygenic photogranules no sequences affiliated with known methanotrophic bacteria were detected fig 6a background the activated sludge and oxygenic photogranules used as starting material in this study contained fewer sequences of methanotrophic bacteria than previous observations milferstedt et al 2017 non methanotrophic methylotrophs were undetectable in background activated sludge and oxygenic photogranules the enrichment process had a profound impact on the microbial community as at the end of it 18 5 6 0 standard deviation of all non cyanobacterial bacterial 16s rrna sequences were affiliated with known methylotrophic bacterial genera fig 6a inoculum of this methylotrophic fraction 74 1 4 8 were known methanotrophs notably of the family of beijerinckiaceae these bacteria are alphaproteobacteria frequently described as type ii methanotrophs across all samples containing sequences of methanotrophic beijerinckiaceae 98 5 4 5 were of the genus methylocystis methylocystis are often considered versatile in their oxygen and methane requirements knief 2015 allowing them to thrive in ecosystems with a varying methane supply knief 2015 this survival strategy is believed to be linked to the presence of two variants of particulate methane monooxygenase a pmoa knief 2015 the key enzyme in methane oxidation converting methane to the intermediate methanol one of them is especially adapted to low methane to oxygen ratios in the feed as likely encountered during batch feeding cycles in the enrichment process the batch supply of methane and oxygen may thus be a key environmental factor favoring growth of these methanotrophs whereas the continuous exposure to methane at low concentrations as in the continuously fed reactor may promote others also present at the end of the enrichment however at notably lower abundances of 21 6 5 5 standard deviation of all methanotrophic bacteria were members of the families of methylococcaceae and methylomonaceae these subdominant families belong to the gammaproteobacteria also known as type i methanotrophs traditionally the distinction in type i and type ii methanotrophs allowed the differentiation of mutually exclusive physiological traits over the last years however it was realized that the distribution of these traits was less exclusive and the distinction has become less meaningful dedysh knief 2018 during photoreactor operation the overall relative abundance of methylotrophs dropped from 18 5 in the inoculum to on average 3 5 2 0 standard deviation of which roughly half of all sequences were known methanotrophs 1 8 1 4 most analyzed photogranules had an approximate diameter of 2 mm and thus a comparable biovolume with the exception of the third and fourth samples on day 28 that had a diameter of 5 mm assuming an approximately constant microbial community size for equally sized photogranules the observed relative changes in the microbial community are likely translated into an absolute decrease in abundance per photogranule most of this loss is attributed to a significant decrease in the methanotroph methylocystis of the beijerinckiaceae t test p value 0 006 also the abundance of the other two methanotrophic families methylococcaceae and methylomonaceae decreased significantly t test p value 0 02 dropping from on average 2 9 1 0 to 1 3 0 9 after the disappearance of the methylocystis these two families presented the majority of methanotroph affiliated sequences during reactor operation 87 2 24 2 fig 6 continuous reactor operation two photogranules sampled at day 28 only contained about 0 1 of methanotrophic sequences more than ten times fewer than the other samples taken during reactor operation the overall loss of methanotrophs may be explained by a reduced substrate availability per photogranule during reactor operation with the increasing number of photogranules in the system the comparably low number of methanotrophs may thus be a steady state concentration adapted to the prevailing environmental conditions even though the drop in methanotrophs is significant the abundance of methylotrophic bacteria including methanotrophs remains about 100 times above the background levels before the enrichment we note that the overall methanotrophic performance of the reactor system was maintained even at comparably low sequence abundances of 1 8 1 4 of methanotrophs we systematically detected sequences of non methanotrophic methylotrophs in our amplicons notably of the family methylophilaceae their sequences represented on average 4 7 1 6 standard deviation in the inoculum and 1 7 1 5 during reactor operation in natural systems like sediments these organisms are frequently found to respire methanol produced by methanotrophic bacteria yu et al 2017 yu et al 2017 even suggested that among non methanotrophic methylotrophs and methanotrophs specific non random pairings exist that seem to possess an environmental advantage over others we did not detect specific pairings in our data but the abundances of methylophiliaceae sequences appears to be roughly one third of the counts of known methanotrophic sequences in photogranules linear regression through origin with slope of 0 345 and adj r2 of 0 74 fig 7 the constant ratio in abundance between two distinct phylogenetic groups hints towards a stoichiometric relationship between the implied organisms possibly through metabolite dependencies in fig 7 notable exceptions to an otherwise strong linear relationship are two for the three samples marked with an asterisk in fig 6 in these samples methanotrophs are only present at a comparably low number the exceptions indicate that metabolic heterogeneity between photogranules existed in our reactor with the coexistence of putatively methanotrophic and non methanotrophic photogranules the non methanotrophic photogranules may consume substrates provided by other methanotrophic photogranules these substrates could be for example methanol a complete ch4 to co2 conversion chain may therefore not be required to be present within each photogranule but the entire population of photogranules participates in the methane conversion cross feeding beyond the boundaries of individual photogranules the enrichment process and the consequent transfer into the continuously operated reactor also shaped the non methylotrophic and non phototrophic bacteria in the community during the enrichment sphingomonadaceae were enrich and reach abundances in the non phototrophic 16s rrna amplicons of more than 45 in one photogranule this organism was affiliated with porphyrobacter an organism believed to be involved in the recycling of organic matter during reactor operation this organism became less abundant in most cases while other recyclers increased in abundance notably chitinophagaceae some of the detected organisms are facultative anaerobes suggesting that there are anaerobic microhabitats within the photogranules no apparent correlation with the dynamics that we observed for the methylotrophs were detected a graphical representation of the dominating families of non methylotrophic and non phototrophic bacteria is given in figure s1 we were unable to detect sequences of nitrifiers in photogranules ammonium is therefore likely directly assimilated by the growing biomass archaea were only detected in traces in the activated sludge sample before enrichment and otherwise absent in the amplicons the postulated trophic chain between the different methylotrophs in photogranules is coupled to the oxygen production by phototrophs notably cyanobacteria we analyzed in 23s rrna amplicons the presence and abundance of cyanobacteria and microalgae as expected the total abundance of phototroph sequences in the background activated sludge sample was low compared to photogranule amplicons only 370 cyanobacterial sequences were found in activated sludge whereas the mean cyanobacteria count in photogranules was 49900 6700 standard deviation microalgal sequences represented the biggest part of the phototrophic population in activated sludge 93 in photogranules microalgal sequences were significantly less abundant accounting for on average 3 5 3 0 the microalgal population in photogranules was dominated by one single taxonomically unclassified sequence type with a sequence identity over the entire amplicon of approximately 95 to various microalgae genera this sequence type made up on average 83 26 median 96 of the microalgae we found in photogranules in the activated sludge sample this particular sequence type was virtually absent 1 2 in a more diverse microalgal population it appears that this microalga may be a member specific to the photogranule community albeit low in abundance compared to cyanobacteria in the background photogranule and the inocula at the end of the enrichment three sequence types dominated the cyanobacterial counts were detected two of which are affiliated with leptolyngbya boryana and one with phormidium tenue these organisms are filamentous motile cyanobacteria as often found to constitute the phototrophic biomass of photogranules milferstedt et al 2017 after the enrichment 90 0 4 3 of all phototrophic sequences were related to leptolyngbya and 2 9 1 7 to phormidium during reactor operation the distribution of the two cyanobacterial types was close to binary in the different photogranules where either one of the two dominated the photogranule community as indicated by the high standard deviations around their mean abundances 52 43 leptolyngbya and 46 44 phormidium a heterogeneous cyanobacterial composition between individual photogranules within the same reactor was observed not unlike our observations for methanotrophic bacteria when assuming that the two cyanobacteria perform the same ecosystem function dominance of one over the other may be the result of a random event at the birth of the photogranule e g a photogranule developing from a detached leptolyngbya dominated aggregate that develops into a leptolyngbya dominated photogranule likewise it may be possible that the dominance of either leptolyngbya or phormidium results from preferential interactions with other microbes for example methanotrophs curiously the samples that contain the lowest numbers of methanotrophs marked with asterisk in fig 6a coincide with the photogranules in which the phototrophic community is dominated by leptolyngbya like sequences potential preferential pairing between microorganisms as considered in this study within the methylotrophs may need to be considered at larger phylogenetic scales than uniquely between methylotrophs the differences between microbial communities of individual photogranules from the same environment emphasize the need to study these systems at the scale of individual photogranules for example when formulating the conversion process in a mathematical model conclusions a methanotrophic cyanobacterial syntrophy was established in the chassis of existing oxygenic photogranules this syntrophy was maintained and propagated in a continuously operated reactor proven by biomass growth and the removal of dissolved methane we thus demonstrated the feasibility to ecologically engineer a novel photogranule community as potential biocatalyst for dissolved methane removal from anaerobic effluents photogranule morphology could be controlled in part by adapting hydrodynamic shear in the system demonstrating that morphology not only depended on the developmental state of the photogranules the established open community not only contained methanotrophic bacteria and phototrophs but also non methanotrophic methylotrophs likely responsible for methanol conversion possibly methanotrophs only incompletely oxidized methane to methanol enabling the development of a methanol degrading community equally fueled by phototrophically generated oxygen community composition may differ considerably between photogranules hinting towards cross feeding between individuals of the photogranule population this variability needs to be considered in experimental and modeling studies the presence of non methanotrophic methylotrophs is not problematic if the biotechnological aim was the removal of dissolved methane as post treatment of anaerobic effluent if simultaneous molecule recovery was the intention e g methanol production more specific ways for controlling the activity of the open microbial community would be needed further research will focus on the treatment of real anaerobic wastewaters effluent in a long term continuous mode nutrient recovery and an increased loading rate need to be studied as a function of temperature photogranules may be suitable to remove methane after psychrophilic anaerobic wastewater treatment

19951,the anaerobic treatment of wastewater leads to the loss of dissolved methane in the effluent of the treatment plant especially when operated at low temperatures the emission of this greenhouse gas may reduce or even offset the environmental gain from energy recovery through anaerobic treatment we demonstrate here the removal and elimination of these comparably small methane concentrations using an ecologically engineered methanotrophic community harbored in oxygenic photogranules we constructed a syntrophy between methanotrophs enriched from activated sludge and cyanobacteria residing in photogranules and maintained it over a two month period in a continuously operated reactor the novel community removed dissolved methane during stable reactor operation by on average 84 8 7 4 standard deviation with an average effluent concentration of dissolved methane of 4 9 3 7 mg ch4 l 1 the average methane removal rate was 26 mg ch4 l 1 d 1 with an observed combined biomass yield of 2 4 g vss g ch4 1 the overall cod balance closed at around 91 small photogranules removed methane more efficiently than larger photogranule likely because of a more favorable surface to volume ratio of the biomass miseq amplicon sequencing of 16s and 23s rrna revealed a potential syntrophic chain between methanotrophs non methanotrophic methylotrophs and filamentous cyanobacteria the community composition between individual photogranules varied considerably suggesting cross feeding between photogranules of different community composition methanotrophic photogranules may be a viable option for dissolved methane removal as anaerobic effluent post treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved methane interactions bioaugmentation ecological engineering effluent polishing anaerobic digestion introduction the use of anaerobic granulated biomass for biological wastewater treatment was introduced about 40 years ago lettinga et al 1980 and is now regarded an adequate methodology for municipal wastewater treatment seghezzo et al 1998 and energy recovery gao et al 2014 the development of anaerobic wastewater treatment since the end of the 1990s has been considered a more sustainable alternative to traditional aerobic processes especially for high strength wastewater its primary purpose is the conversion of organic matter to methane as a renewable form of energy vandevivere 1999 verstraete et al 1996 an often overlooked drawback of anaerobic wastewater treatment is the loss of dissolved methane as not all of it partitions to the gas phase inside the digesters estimations of the loss of dissolved methane from anaerobic wastewater treatment are typically calculated from methane concentrations in the gaseous headspace using henry s law i e under equilibrium conditions lobato et al 2012 this idealized case does not always reflect the actual measured values of anaerobic treatment liquid effluent as mass transfer limitations can lead to supersaturation of methane in this case an assumed equilibrium with headspace concentrations will thus underestimate the dissolved methane content souza et al 2011 and wu et al 2017 found that dissolved methane was supersaturated in the liquid phase of an anaerobic bioreactor effluent saturation factor of 1 03 1 67 increasing with the increased methane solubility at decreasing temperatures even at equilibrium considerable amounts of methane are lost with the liquid effluent especially when treating wastewater at low temperatures and or in high flow through situations low hydraulic retention time brandt et al 2019 once the effluent is discharged and exposed to ambient methane partial pressures methane degasses into the atmosphere theoretically 0 38 liters of methane are produced per gram of chemical oxygen demand cod removed from the anaerobic wastewater treatment at standard ambient condition 25 c 1 atm tchobanoglous et al 2003 by assuming 80 cod removal efficiency for a typical high strength municipal wastewaters with an average soluble cod concentration of 450 g m 3 henze et al 2008 137 l ch4 m 3 is produced equivalent to 89 7 g ch4 m 3 at a methane solubility of approximately 20 g m 3 at 25 c liu et al 2014 approximately 22 of all produced methane would be in its dissolved form and likely leave the digester at most about 107 l ch4 m 3 could be used for combustion saving fossil co2 emissions of 107 l co2 m 3 degassing of the dissolved methane to the atmosphere however would contribute approximately 500 g co2 equiv m 3 equivalent to 278 l co2 m 3 therefore the greenhouse gas contribution in this example is about 2 5 times greater than the positive effects from generating a renewable energy see supplemental materials this methane loss is significantly reducing and as in the given example even offsetting the positive effect of energy recovery from anaerobic wastewater treatment therefore a post treatment process is required to remove dissolved methane reducing the environmental impact of anaerobic wastewater treatment several methods have been proposed for removing or recovering dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents these include air stripping oxidation hatamoto et al 2010 matsuura et al 2015 and degassing membrane based recovery bandara et al 2011 cookney et al 2016 dissolved methane can be biologically oxidized by methanotrophs methanotrophs are part of a larger group of bacteria called methylotrophs that typically utilize single carbon compounds like methane methanol formic acid or even formaldehyde as carbon and energy source chistoserdova et al 2009 methanotrophs may fully oxidize methane to co2 or partially to molecules like methanol molecular oxygen is required for the conversion through the coupled activities of eukaryotic algae or photosynthetic bacteria and methanotrophs in syntrophic bioaggregates oxygen may be provided by direct or at least local transfer the produced oxygen is then immediately utilized by the methanotrophs to convert organic matter to co2 which is in turn used by phototrophs for autotrophic co2 fixation these interactions are found in natural systems for example at the chemocline between anaerobic and aerobic water layers in freshwater lakes milucka et al 2015 and are also utilized in engineered systems e g by van der ha et al 2012 for the production of lipids or polyhydroxy butyrate using co cultured eukaryotic algae and methanotrophs rasoulie et al 2018 also investigated a co culture of green microalgae and methanotrophs for removing methane and recovering nutrients they used industrial wastewater as media and synthetic biogas as methane source in both studies the authors used pure cultures of methanotrophs and microalgae rasouli et al 2018 van der ha et al 2012 in nature methanotrophs often co occur with non methanotrophic methylotrophs that feed on partially oxidized methane intermediates like methanol takeuchi et al 2019 yu et al 2017 these more complex interactions are also relevant in our study using an environmental enrichment as basis for the construction of a new syntrophy in contrast to studies using suspended phototrophic methanotrophic consortia we present here an aggregated biomass in the form of photogranules for the aeration free removal of dissolved methane the conversion relies on syntrophic interactions between phototrophic cyanobacteria and methanotrophic bacteria aggregated in oxygenic photogranules aggregation is particularly important in the bioprocesses as it allows efficient and fast removal of the biomass from the treated water and efficient intra aggregate oxygen transfer we established the presence of methanotrophic bacteria in the photogranule aggregates and propagated the newly developed syntrophy in an open community challenged by invading microbes the syntrophy was ecologically engineered from an enrichment culture of methanotrophs from activated sludge and oxygenic photogranules converting synthetic wastewater as described in milferstedt et al 2017 we discuss community assembly in the light of performance characteristics of a continuously operated reactor system for the removal of dissolved methane materials and methods media composition the media composition for the batch experiments i e enrichment and size specific analysis and for the continuously operated reactor

enriched under batch conditions from municipal activated sludge from the wastewater treatment plant in narbonne france we used 160 ml serum bottles with 50 ml as liquid volume of the media to the media 10 ml of inoculum were added so that a 100 ml gaseous headspace remained replicated enrichments 4 10 replicates were incubated either with or without mixing using magnetic stirring we also enriched the activated sludge mixed with fresh oxygenic photogranules and oxygenic photogranules only without mixing for all enrichments the serum bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and capped using aluminum crimp caps the headspace gas was mixed prior to the gas injection by combining 30 vol ch4 and 70 vol o2 during the injection a pressure of 1 49 0 05 bar standard deviation was achieved in the serum bottle headspace the pressure was manually confirmed using a handheld manometer keller leo 2 switzerland we used purified methane for feeding from biogas produced in two laboratory scale anaerobic digesters this was done using a co2 absorbing bubble column containing naoh at 3 m the final methane concentration was on average 98 1 2 3 standard deviation pure oxygen was used the serum bottles were incubated at room temperature using a serological pipette a volume of 20 ml of the methanotroph enrichment culture was transferred every five to seven days into a new serum bottle containing 40 ml of fresh media after each transfer the headspace was renewed with a fresh ch4 and o2 mixture 30 70 at approximately 1 5 bar after a third transfer i e after about 21 days we observed decreasing oxygen and methane concentrations in the headspace of several bottles from that point on in all bottles a mix of methane and oxygen 30 70 was added on a daily basis after the fourth transfer we harvested the enriched suspended methanotrophic cultures and transferred them to five new serum bottles with fresh media and approximately ten oxygenic photogranules each with an approximate average diameter of 1 2 mm the untreated fresh oxygenic photogranules were obtained from a continuously operated reactor to the methanotroph enrichment and oxygenic photogranules we added 100 methane in the headspace assuming that oxygen would be provided by photosynthesis bottles were incubated on a shaker that was equipped with fluorescent light bulbs providing photoactive radiation par at approximately 58 μmol m 2 s 1 par was measured at the outside of the flasks using a light meter li 250a li cor usa after one week the active methanotrophic photogranules were separated from the suspended biomass and rinsed photogranules were rinsed using deionized water before the final transfer into the continuous reactor to avoid suspended and loosely attached biomass only the solid photogranule biomass was used to inoculate the continuous reactor set up and operation of continuous reactor approximately 60 active methanotrophic photogranules were transferred to an airtight glass vessel with 1 8 l of liquid volume operated as a continuously stirred tank reactor fig 1 shows a schematic view of the reactor set up we used overhead mixing as this type of agitation does not impact photogranules stability the use of magnetic stir bar resulted in gradually crushing photogranules milferstedt et al 2017 we used an airtight overhead magnetic stirrer head of the g mrk ptfe type with a ground joint bola bohlender gmbh germany connected to an overhead motor using a polyoxymethylene globe stirrer coupling bola bohlender gmbh germany the coupling compensates potential misalignment between the overhead motor and the magnetic stirrer head the reactor vessel was a borosilicate glass beaker with a glass flat flange lid containing one central and three angled ground necks mixing was provided by a stainless steel impeller operated at 100 rpm during the first 30 days of reactor operation increased to 125 128 rpm on day 31 for the remainder of the experiment light was provided using standard 60 60 cm2 led panels emitting warm white at 4000k a light intensity of approximately 45 μmol m 2 s 1 par was measured at the outside of the vertical reactor surface the reactor was operated at an average room temperature of 23 2 1 0 c standard deviation without active temperature control the dissolved oxygen concentration in the reactor fluctuated with an average 1 8 3 2 mg l 1 high oxygen concentrations were observed to be a consequence of membrane fouling of the electrode membrane the average ph in the reactor was 7 0 0 2 initially all headspace compartments and the experimental set up e g tubings fittings were flushed with nitrogen and methane 92 8 vol vol before the start of operation as the supply of biogenic purified methane was limited pure nitrogen 100 was used for flushing the headspace during routine reactor operation e g after manual interventions for cleaning and biomass removal after start up methane saturated feed was continuously pumped into the reactor the reactor was operated at a hydraulic retention time of 12 h the media contained on average 17 6 2 2 mg ch4 l 1 standard deviation and the volumetric organic loading rate was approximately 35 1 4 5 mg ch4 l 1 d 1 media preparation as mentioned in section 2 1 the initial media composition for the continuously operated reactor was identical with the batch experiments media was prepared in an o2 and co2 free closed atmosphere obtained by initially sparging the preparation system with nitrogen gas for approximately 15 min until the dissolved oxygen concentration measured with a handheld oxygen meter multi 3620 ids wtw germany was below the detection limit this precaution was taken to limit the supply with externally provided co2 and oxygen so that growth of methanotrophs and phototrophs in the reactor could be linked to their respective metabolic activities then the media was saturated with purified methane by recirculating methane through the solution using a diaphragm pump and porous diffusors this step took around six hours the media was then transferred using gas tight tubing and a peristaltic pump into the 20 l media storage tank a capacity of 20 l ensured autonomy for a 72 h period media preparation and media storage were physically separated in two bottles to assure continuous feeding during media preparation one batch of methane saturated media had a maximum volume of 10 l limited by laboratory safety consideration the long preparation was mostly due to slow gas transfer from the methane atmosphere to the aqueous phase photogranule size analysis we quantified the total number of all photogranules in the reactor and their size distribution based on equivalent diameters for this we temporarily placed the entire content of the reactor on a custom built square tray with a transparent glass bottom 17 7 17 6 cm2 that was then placed on the glass surface of a desktop scanner canon lide 220 japan an image of the photogranules through the bottom of the tray was acquired with the dimensions of 5583 5556 pixels and saved as a non compressed 8 bit gray level tagged image format tif file care was taken to avoid overlap or contact between individual photogranules as this would have made the subsequent image analysis more complicated with increasing numbers of photogranules in the reactor photogranules were partitioned into several batches and multiple images were acquired using a custom made script in imagej schneider et al 2012 we then used the maximum entropy thresholding algorithm to differentiate photogranules from the background using the morpholibj plugin legland et al 2016 noise was removed on the images by applying the morphological operation opening with a radius of 1 white pixels within apparent particles on the images were filled using the fill holes command particles in contact with the image boundaries were removed using the kill borders command to avoid counting particles that were not entirely visible on the images the area of each detected object was then quantified and translated into the equivalent diameter of an assumed perfect circle with the same area analytical methods gaseous samples were withdrawn from the headspace of enrichment cultures and the reactor using gas tight syringes sge europe subsequently samples were analyzed using gas chromatography perkin elmer gc580 usa for determination the concentration of ch4 n2 co2 and o2 the gc was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector rt msieve 5a column 0 32 mm diameter 30 m length and 30 μm film helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 35 4 ml min 1 the oven temperature was 60 c dissolved methane was determined by converting the dissolved cod measurement by multiplying with the specific cod equivalent of methane 4 g cod g ch4 1 total and dissolved cod were determined daily using standard cod test kits with a detection range of 0 150 mg l 1 aqualytic germany the influent and effluent samples were withdrawn using a 5 ml syringe containing no gas phases the samples were immediately and directly filtered through a 0 45 µm ptfe hydrophilic membrane syringe filter into a cod test kit and sealed immediately speedy sample handling and processing ensured reliable measurements of dissolved methane total cod measurement was conducted without filtering the sample we compensated for any background cod by measuring blank cod concentrations in the ready made media before methane equilibration and then subtract that from all consecutive cod measurements made at the reactor inlet and outlet cod compensation was done to account for any compounds in the media with a potential contribution to cod notably edta total suspended solid tss was measured following standard methods 2540d after the filtered samples pre weighted glass fiber filter pore size 0 45 μm diameter 47 mm 934 ah rtu whatman uk dried at 105 c for 1 h rice et al 2013 samples were taken in duplicates for each gas cod and tss measurement observed biomass yield the overall observed biomass yield was determined based on the ratio of cumulative generated biomass g tss per cumulative consumed substrate g ch4 assuming 15 inorganic biomass fraction the cumulative generated biomass in the unit of g tss is converted to the unit of g vss the consumed substrate g ch4 was measured daily as cod removed by the system the cumulative generated biomass consists of the accumulated biomass in the system cumulative biomass wastage and biomass effluent the accumulated biomass and biomass wastage were measured weekly while doing cleaning and maintenance in addition the suspended biomass in the effluent was measured daily we calculated the specific cod of tss using linear regression analysis chon et al 2011 dependence of methanotrophic activity on photogranules size when assuming phototropic methane conversion to be a surface depending process photogranule size may influence the specific phototrophic and methanotrophic activities by affecting surface to volume ratios and diffusional lengths we analyzed the specific metabolic activity in batch experiments in serum bottles under the same conditions as during the enrichment experiments we prepared a serum bottle per size class containing on average six similar sized photogranules photogranules were sampled during stable reactor performance on day 29 57 72 79 86 and 97 for each test three size classes 1 0 2 2 mm 2 3 3 7 mm and 3 8 5 5 mm were defined microbial analysis photogranules were sampled for community analysis 1 before contact with methanotrophic enrichments samples named background 2 after incubation with methanotrophic enrichments samples named inoculum and 3 during continuous operation of the reactor samples named continuous reactor operation sampled photogranules were stored at 20 c for subsequent dna extraction dna was extracted using the dneasy powerwater kit qiagen germany according to the manufacturer s instructions the genomic dna was used in two independent miseq sequencing reactions for 16s rrna amplicons and 23s rrna amplicons the 16s rrna amplicons were generated using the primer pair 515f 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggta 3 and 928r 5 ccccgycaattcmtttragt 3 wang qian 2009 plus their respective linkers the primers target the v4 v5 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene they amplify most of the

with a final extension at 72 c for 10 min the 23s rrna amplicons were generated using the primers pair p23srv f1 5 ggacagaaagaccctatgaa 3 and p23srv r1 5 tcagcctgttatccctagag 3 sherwood presting 2007 plus their respective linkers this primer pair targets a region in the 23s rrna of cyanobacteria and plastids in algae the 50 μl pcr mixtures contained 0 5 u of mtp taq dna polymerase sigma aldrich

bioanalyzer 2100 agilent usa in a second pcr of 12 cycles an index sequence was added and the resulting pcr products were purified and loaded onto the illumina miseq cartridge according to the manufacturer s instructions for sequencing of paired 300 bp reads v3 chemistry library preparation and sequencing was done at the get plage sequencing center of the genotoul lifescience network in toulouse france https get genotoul fr the datasets for this study can be found in the ncbi sequence read archive sra database as bioproject prjna686893 sequences were dereplicated quality checked chimera checked and affiliated with a taxonomic description using mothur version 1 42 3 schloss et al 2009 sequence treatment included preclustering at four differences in nucleotides over the length of the amplicon and chimera checking using uchime edgar et al 2011 we removed all sequences that appeared less than three times in the entire dataset the databases silva quast et al 2013 132 ssu 16s rrna and 132 lsuref 23s rrna were used for alignment and as taxonomic outline cleaned up and taxonomically affiliated sequence data was written into a biom file and was subsequently merged with the environmental data and analyzed in r version 4 0 3 r core team 2020 using the r packages phyloseq mcmurdie holmes 2013 and tidyverse wickham et al 2019 for the 16s rrna amplicons we removed the sequences affiliated with cyanobacteria using subset sample command in phyloseq with the argument phylum cyanobacteria for the 23s data we separated the chloroplast sequences from cyanobacteria using the same command with the argument phylum cyanobacteria order chloroplast on average the 16s rrna amplicons contained 50600 7300 standard deviation bacterial sequences per sample of which on average 17100 7500 were not cyanobacteria even though the 16s rrna reverse primer supposedly excludes cyanobacterial sequences hodkinson lutzoni 2009 we nevertheless find them in high abundance likely because of the overwhelming presence of cyanobacteria in the systems with the exception of the activated sludge sample that only contained four sequences affiliated with phototrophs in the 16s amplicon on average the 23s rrna amplicons contained 51700 6700 sequences per sample of which on average 1800 1600 or 3 5 3 0 were eukaryotic microalgae the counts disregard the activated sludge sample that only contained 370 sequences affiliated with cyanobacteria in the 23s amplicon however in which we detected the highest absolute and relative counts of microalgae in this study based on taxonomic outlines offered by the silva 132 ssu and lsu databases we considered the following taxa detected in our amplicons as putative methanotrophic the families methylococcaceae containing the genus methyloparacoccus methylomonaceae containing the genera methylomonas methylobacter methylomicrobium and methylosarcina and beijerinckiaceae containing methylocystis and methylobacterium we considered as non methanotrophic methylotrophs the genus methyloversatilis of the family rhodocyclaceae and the family methylophilaceae containing the genera methylophilus and methylobacillus results and discussions successful establishment of a syntrophic methane degrading community methanotrophs were enriched from activated sludge in gas tight stoppered serum bottles with a mixture of oxygen and methane in the headspace we tested enrichments with and without mixing by magnetic stirring after four transfers every five days into fresh media all enrichments that were mixed during incubation removed methane and produced carbon dioxide according to the methane oxidation stoichiometry closing the mass balance by more than 80 we detected methane removal in approximately half of statically incubated cultures i e without mixing mixing increases methane transfer across the gas liquid interface leading to more successful incubations the enrichments from unstirred oxygenic photogranules mixed with activated sludge removed methane however unstirred and stirred activated sludge enrichments removed methane twice and four times faster respectively fresh photogranules did not exhibit a measurable methanotrophic activity we detected methane removal after adding 100 methane without externally provided oxygen to a mixture of fresh non methanotrophic photogranules and methanotrophic enrichments from activated sludge also the production of oxygen and co2 was measured this observation demonstrated the onset of engineered syntrophic interactions between methanotrophs and oxygenic photogranules we were thus able to introduce a novel function into an existing granulated microbial ecosystem laying the basis for a potential future application in biotechnology in which biomass harvesting is feasible continuous reactor performance for removing dissolved methane the ecologically engineered methane converting photogranules were then used as inoculum for the continuously operated reactor fig 2 shows the dissolved cod removal efficiency as proxy for methane removal as well as effluent total suspended solids tss over time dissolved methane removal efficiencies fluctuated over the first week of operation effluent concentrations stabilized over the following two weeks and the methane removal efficiency steadily increased on day 16 biofilm on reactor surfaces and equipment was removed resulting in a 5 decrease in methane removal the rather moderate decrement indicates that the vast majority of methane oxidation was situated in photogranular biomass and not in the biofilm formed on the reactor surfaces approximately 10 mg tss l 1 of suspended solids were washed out from the reactor photogranules became increasingly more filamentous at this time fig 3 a middle the change of photogranule morphology could have been influenced by the increase in biomass concentration and a local decrease in light availability in the reactor the cyanobacteria might try to increase their surface area by forming filamentous outgrowth and therefore exposure to light biddanda et al 2015 after about three weeks of operation effluent tss increased due to the detachment of filaments from the photogranules application of higher mixing intensity on day 31 from 100 rpm to 125 128 rpm resulted in an increase in methane removal efficiency now exceeding 90 mixing serves the purposes of minimizing the laminar boundary layer around the photogranules and keeping the photogranules in suspension beun et al 2000 liu et al 2003 we also changed mixing to increase detachment of filaments from the photogranule surfaces this approach worked resulting in temporarily increased effluent suspended solid concentrations from the reactor fig 2 days 31 to 40 and less filamentous photogranules however the sudden detachment became problematic for reactor operation at day 40 when the effluent clogged turning operation into safety mode for two days i e without water in and outflow the reactor was operational again after cleaning and wasting some photogranules at day 43 on day 43 biomass was purposely wasted to obtain approximately 1 5 g tss l 1 introduction of a weekly cleaning and biomass wasting protocol by removing approximately 0 5 0 7 g tss l 1 prevented further clogging and maintained a balanced biomass concentration in the reactor of approximately 1 2 g tss l 1 this weekly biomass removal represented about one third to half of the biomass in the reactor the removal of granular biomass on day 43 caused a drop in methane removal efficiency from about 90 to 60 the removal efficiency reached on average 84 8 7 4 standard deviation between day 54 93 on day 94 a decreased methane removal efficiency was observed due to accidental wasting of a large numbers of photogranules however performance recovered over the next week to above 80 the average effluent concentration of dissolved methane and the averaged methane removal rate during reactor operation was 4 9 3 7 mg ch4 l 1 and 26 3 2 6 mg ch4 l 1 d 1 respectively in van der ha et al 2011 an overall methane oxidation rate was reported to be 171 mg ch4 l 1 liquid phase d 1 which appears to be 6 6 times higher than in our experiments a major factor leading to a higher removal rate is the organic loading in van der ha et al 2011 235 ml of ch4 were added over 72 hours which corresponds to approximately 258 mg ch4 l 1 d 1 at 22 c our olr of 35 1 4 5 mg ch4 l 1 d 1 was thus 7 3 times lower it is important to note that the rates are not immediately comparable as van der ha et al 2011 worked in a batch system over 90 h while our results are obtained in a cstr with an hrt of 12 h the observed overall biomass yield was 0 7 g tss g cod 1 equivalent to 0 6 g vss g cod 1 assuming 15 inorganic biomass fraction per mass substrate ch4 this is equivalent to 2 4 g vss g ch4 1 the observed yield represents the combination of cellular yield from methanotrophic and cyanobacterial growth literature values of methanotrophic yields relevant for our study have been reported by leak dalton 1986 and arcangeli arvin 1999 by theoretical analysis and experimental observations on suspended methylococcus capsulatus leak dalton 1986 reported cellular yield of 0 6 0 7 g vss g ch4 1 on cultivation conditions similar to this study arcangeli arvin 1999 studied a methanotrophic biofilm enriched from landfill soil and estimated the dry weight yield to be 0 56 g vss g ch4 1 as conditions and growth technique granular aggregation is similar to biofilms and our media 0 02 mg l 1 of cuso4 5h2o was comparable to the cu limited experiment of leak and dalton 1986 we estimate methanotrophic yields to be in the order of 0 5 0 6 g vss g ch4 1 which leaves the remaining observed 1 8 g vss g ch4 1 to be the autotrophic contribution assuming all co2 from the mineralization of methane to be assimilated by the phototrophic bacteria a combined methanotrophic and phototrophic yield of 1 54 g vss g ch4 1 would be theoretically possible the observed combined yield 2 4 g vss g ch4 1 therefore indicates an additional autotrophic growth contribution of 0 9 g vss g ch4 1 probably originating from the inlet bicarbonate high biomass yields in this system highlight the potential for the recovery of chemical energy or the methane based biorefinery using photogranules the overall cod balance closed at 91 of the inlet cod the unaccounted 9 cod could be explained the reactor system still not completely at steady state positive bioaccumulation and by the negative cod contribution by phototrophically produced oxygen consumed by the methanotrophs during methane mineralization we can rule out leakages in the system and therefore potential methane loss or oxygen and co2 entering the system the tightness of the reactor system was verified by frequently checking the gas composition in the headspace of the reactor using gas chromatography the results showed that in the headspace the dominant gas were nitrogen oxygen and methane by 89 3 3 3 4 4 2 6 and 4 9 2 3 v v standard deviation respectively the high presence of nitrogen gas resulted from the regular flushing of the headspace with nitrogen during reactor cleaning and maintenance only at most traces of co2 were detected in the gas phase at 0 01 0 02 v v cyanobacteria can use co2 hco3 and possibly also co3 2 as carbon source schneider campion alsumard 1999 in our study methane was not the sole carbon sources but hco3 was contained as hardness in the tap water we used for media preparation based on the growth stoichiometry for methane oxidation coupled to photosynthesis the theoretically produced oxygen from co2 assimilation during photosynthesis only provides roughly 20 of the oxygen needed for complete methane oxidation the presence of hco3 to the media would enhance the methane removal efficiency due to higher oxygen availability from bicarbonate photosynthesis the 4 mm hco3 contained in the tap water could theoretically supply an additional 2 58 mm o2 or an equivalent cod of 82 mg l 1 upon autotrophic growth hence methane oxidation is not stoichiometric oxygen limited by cyanobacterial growth similar findings were reported in the literature where in the absence of external oxygen supply microalgal photosynthesis was not sufficient for methane oxidation bahr et al 2011 only when bicarbonate was introduced the methane removal efficiency increased we suggest that the elevated methane removal in the absence of any external oxygen supply can only be explained by in situ oxygen production and immediate uptake by methanotrophs our results therefore demonstrate the establishment of syntrophic interactions between phototrophs and methanotrophs this syntrophy was stably maintained over seven weeks during continuous reactor operation photogranule development in continuously operated reactor during continuous reactor operation new photogranules rapidly formed fig 3 after 16 days of continuous operation the photogranules became dark green roughly spherical and filamentous fig 3 the presence of filamentous cyanobacteria was confirmed by white light and fluorescence microscopy development of the filamentous morphology likely caused the increase in suspended solids in the reactor effluent fig 2 we successfully generated a less filamentous photogranule phenotype by increasing mixing from 100 rpm to 125 128 rpm starting on day 31 immediately after the increase the photogranules lost substantial amounts of filaments whitish areas on the photogranules surface became visible fig 3b middle using image analysis we determined the number and the size of photogranules in the reactor over the first four weeks the number of photogranules increased from initially 60 with an approximated total surface area of 0 08 cm2 day 0 to 888 and a total surface area of 240 cm2 on day 16 and to about 2000 with a total surface area of 551 cm2 on day 29 fig 4 after the major wasting and cleaning event on day 43 the number and surface area of photogranules decreased to 613 and 77 3 cm2 respectively however the biomass concentration increased in the following days and reached more than 3500 photogranules and 1105 cm2 of surface area on day 79 fig 4 the range of biomass diameters on day 16 was between 1 and 7 mm with an average of 2 6 1 3 mm standard deviation on day 43 because of increasing shear the predominant diameter of photogranules was less than 2 mm the largest size of photogranules in the reactor was approximately 7 5 mm this size is larger than the typical size of aerobic granular sludge with sizes in the range of 4 to 6 mm beun et al 2000 morgenroth et al 1997 however towards the end of reactor operation more than 90 of the photogranules were between 1 and 3 mm with an average diameter of 2 6 1 0 mm this value is greater than the size of photogranules 2 mm in diameter reported from previous photogranule reactor studies abouhend et al 2018 liu et al 2017 size specific analysis of methanotrophic activity photogranule size may influence the specific phototrophic and methanotrophic activities as we assume phototrophic methane conversion to be a surface depending process photogranule size affects the surface to volume ratios and diffusional lengths we analyzed the specific metabolic activity in batch experiments for sets of on average six similar sized photogranules in size classes between 1 3 and 5 5 mm in average diameter fig 5 photogranules were sampled during stable reactor performance photogranules with diameters of approximately 1 2 mm gave the highest surface specific methane removal rate of 0 53 0 02 mg ch4 d 1 mm 2 standard deviation the methane removal rate per photogranule surface area decreased with increasing diameter fig 5a the relation with the surface to volume ratio is presented in fig 5b an elevated surface to volume ratio is beneficial for methane removal from a conversion perspective it is favorable to engineer a size distribution within the reactor of minimal photogranule diameter the surface dependent character of photogranule metabolism was also shown in a recent study by abouhend et al 2020 in which oxygenic photogranules of 0 5 1 7 mm in diameter showed the highest oxygen production rate compared to bigger photogranules abouhend et al 2020 higher oxygen production rates influence the treatment potential of the biomass in this case dissolved methane removal due to higher oxygen availability from photosynthesis as electron acceptor bigger photogranules may also become less active because they lose their cyanobacteria from the core as the photo layer appear to be limited to depth of about 700 µm milferstedt et al 2017 community analysis related to methane removal performances using miseq amplicon sequencing we analyzed the microbial communities in various photogranules sampled from the sequencing batch reactor as well as the enriched inoculum and background material before the enrichment we detected the presence of sequences belonging to methylotrophic bacteria in our samples fig 6 a the detected methylotrophs predominantly belong to methanotrophic bacteria a subgroup of the methylotrophs able to directly use methane as carbon and energy source a frequent intermediate or even final product of methanotrophs is methanol kalyuzhnaya xing 2018 also non methanotrophic methylotrophs were detected in elevated abundances fig 6a notably of the family methylophilaceae often involved in methanol conversion yu et al 2017 these groups of bacteria may participate in a communal metabolism of methane beck et al 2013 oshkin et al 2015 in the background material before the enrichment process only in raw activated sludge we detected sequences of one methanotrophic type in the 16s rrna amplicons at a relative abundance of 0 02 of all bacterial sequences excluding cyanobacteria this sequence type was unique to the activated sludge sample and undetected in the inoculum and during reactor operation in oxygenic photogranules no sequences affiliated with known methanotrophic bacteria were detected fig 6a background the activated sludge and oxygenic photogranules used as starting material in this study contained fewer sequences of methanotrophic bacteria than previous observations milferstedt et al 2017 non methanotrophic methylotrophs were undetectable in background activated sludge and oxygenic photogranules the enrichment process had a profound impact on the microbial community as at the end of it 18 5 6 0 standard deviation of all non cyanobacterial bacterial 16s rrna sequences were affiliated with known methylotrophic bacterial genera fig 6a inoculum of this methylotrophic fraction 74 1 4 8 were known methanotrophs notably of the family of beijerinckiaceae these bacteria are alphaproteobacteria frequently described as type ii methanotrophs across all samples containing sequences of methanotrophic beijerinckiaceae 98 5 4 5 were of the genus methylocystis methylocystis are often considered versatile in their oxygen and methane requirements knief 2015 allowing them to thrive in ecosystems with a varying methane supply knief 2015 this survival strategy is believed to be linked to the presence of two variants of particulate methane monooxygenase a pmoa knief 2015 the key enzyme in methane oxidation converting methane to the intermediate methanol one of them is especially adapted to low methane to oxygen ratios in the feed as likely encountered during batch feeding cycles in the enrichment process the batch supply of methane and oxygen may thus be a key environmental factor favoring growth of these methanotrophs whereas the continuous exposure to methane at low concentrations as in the continuously fed reactor may promote others also present at the end of the enrichment however at notably lower abundances of 21 6 5 5 standard deviation of all methanotrophic bacteria were members of the families of methylococcaceae and methylomonaceae these subdominant families belong to the gammaproteobacteria also known as type i methanotrophs traditionally the distinction in type i and type ii methanotrophs allowed the differentiation of mutually exclusive physiological traits over the last years however it was realized that the distribution of these traits was less exclusive and the distinction has become less meaningful dedysh knief 2018 during photoreactor operation the overall relative abundance of methylotrophs dropped from 18 5 in the inoculum to on average 3 5 2 0 standard deviation of which roughly half of all sequences were known methanotrophs 1 8 1 4 most analyzed photogranules had an approximate diameter of 2 mm and thus a comparable biovolume with the exception of the third and fourth samples on day 28 that had a diameter of 5 mm assuming an approximately constant microbial community size for equally sized photogranules the observed relative changes in the microbial community are likely translated into an absolute decrease in abundance per photogranule most of this loss is attributed to a significant decrease in the methanotroph methylocystis of the beijerinckiaceae t test p value 0 006 also the abundance of the other two methanotrophic families methylococcaceae and methylomonaceae decreased significantly t test p value 0 02 dropping from on average 2 9 1 0 to 1 3 0 9 after the disappearance of the methylocystis these two families presented the majority of methanotroph affiliated sequences during reactor operation 87 2 24 2 fig 6 continuous reactor operation two photogranules sampled at day 28 only contained about 0 1 of methanotrophic sequences more than ten times fewer than the other samples taken during reactor operation the overall loss of methanotrophs may be explained by a reduced substrate availability per photogranule during reactor operation with the increasing number of photogranules in the system the comparably low number of methanotrophs may thus be a steady state concentration adapted to the prevailing environmental conditions even though the drop in methanotrophs is significant the abundance of methylotrophic bacteria including methanotrophs remains about 100 times above the background levels before the enrichment we note that the overall methanotrophic performance of the reactor system was maintained even at comparably low sequence abundances of 1 8 1 4 of methanotrophs we systematically detected sequences of non methanotrophic methylotrophs in our amplicons notably of the family methylophilaceae their sequences represented on average 4 7 1 6 standard deviation in the inoculum and 1 7 1 5 during reactor operation in natural systems like sediments these organisms are frequently found to respire methanol produced by methanotrophic bacteria yu et al 2017 yu et al 2017 even suggested that among non methanotrophic methylotrophs and methanotrophs specific non random pairings exist that seem to possess an environmental advantage over others we did not detect specific pairings in our data but the abundances of methylophiliaceae sequences appears to be roughly one third of the counts of known methanotrophic sequences in photogranules linear regression through origin with slope of 0 345 and adj r2 of 0 74 fig 7 the constant ratio in abundance between two distinct phylogenetic groups hints towards a stoichiometric relationship between the implied organisms possibly through metabolite dependencies in fig 7 notable exceptions to an otherwise strong linear relationship are two for the three samples marked with an asterisk in fig 6 in these samples methanotrophs are only present at a comparably low number the exceptions indicate that metabolic heterogeneity between photogranules existed in our reactor with the coexistence of putatively methanotrophic and non methanotrophic photogranules the non methanotrophic photogranules may consume substrates provided by other methanotrophic photogranules these substrates could be for example methanol a complete ch4 to co2 conversion chain may therefore not be required to be present within each photogranule but the entire population of photogranules participates in the methane conversion cross feeding beyond the boundaries of individual photogranules the enrichment process and the consequent transfer into the continuously operated reactor also shaped the non methylotrophic and non phototrophic bacteria in the community during the enrichment sphingomonadaceae were enrich and reach abundances in the non phototrophic 16s rrna amplicons of more than 45 in one photogranule this organism was affiliated with porphyrobacter an organism believed to be involved in the recycling of organic matter during reactor operation this organism became less abundant in most cases while other recyclers increased in abundance notably chitinophagaceae some of the detected organisms are facultative anaerobes suggesting that there are anaerobic microhabitats within the photogranules no apparent correlation with the dynamics that we observed for the methylotrophs were detected a graphical representation of the dominating families of non methylotrophic and non phototrophic bacteria is given in figure s1 we were unable to detect sequences of nitrifiers in photogranules ammonium is therefore likely directly assimilated by the growing biomass archaea were only detected in traces in the activated sludge sample before enrichment and otherwise absent in the amplicons the postulated trophic chain between the different methylotrophs in photogranules is coupled to the oxygen production by phototrophs notably cyanobacteria we analyzed in 23s rrna amplicons the presence and abundance of cyanobacteria and microalgae as expected the total abundance of phototroph sequences in the background activated sludge sample was low compared to photogranule amplicons only 370 cyanobacterial sequences were found in activated sludge whereas the mean cyanobacteria count in photogranules was 49900 6700 standard deviation microalgal sequences represented the biggest part of the phototrophic population in activated sludge 93 in photogranules microalgal sequences were significantly less abundant accounting for on average 3 5 3 0 the microalgal population in photogranules was dominated by one single taxonomically unclassified sequence type with a sequence identity over the entire amplicon of approximately 95 to various microalgae genera this sequence type made up on average 83 26 median 96 of the microalgae we found in photogranules in the activated sludge sample this particular sequence type was virtually absent 1 2 in a more diverse microalgal population it appears that this microalga may be a member specific to the photogranule community albeit low in abundance compared to cyanobacteria in the background photogranule and the inocula at the end of the enrichment three sequence types dominated the cyanobacterial counts were detected two of which are affiliated with leptolyngbya boryana and one with phormidium tenue these organisms are filamentous motile cyanobacteria as often found to constitute the phototrophic biomass of photogranules milferstedt et al 2017 after the enrichment 90 0 4 3 of all phototrophic sequences were related to leptolyngbya and 2 9 1 7 to phormidium during reactor operation the distribution of the two cyanobacterial types was close to binary in the different photogranules where either one of the two dominated the photogranule community as indicated by the high standard deviations around their mean abundances 52 43 leptolyngbya and 46 44 phormidium a heterogeneous cyanobacterial composition between individual photogranules within the same reactor was observed not unlike our observations for methanotrophic bacteria when assuming that the two cyanobacteria perform the same ecosystem function dominance of one over the other may be the result of a random event at the birth of the photogranule e g a photogranule developing from a detached leptolyngbya dominated aggregate that develops into a leptolyngbya dominated photogranule likewise it may be possible that the dominance of either leptolyngbya or phormidium results from preferential interactions with other microbes for example methanotrophs curiously the samples that contain the lowest numbers of methanotrophs marked with asterisk in fig 6a coincide with the photogranules in which the phototrophic community is dominated by leptolyngbya like sequences potential preferential pairing between microorganisms as considered in this study within the methylotrophs may need to be considered at larger phylogenetic scales than uniquely between methylotrophs the differences between microbial communities of individual photogranules from the same environment emphasize the need to study these systems at the scale of individual photogranules for example when formulating the conversion process in a mathematical model conclusions a methanotrophic cyanobacterial syntrophy was established in the chassis of existing oxygenic photogranules this syntrophy was maintained and propagated in a continuously operated reactor proven by biomass growth and the removal of dissolved methane we thus demonstrated the feasibility to ecologically engineer a novel photogranule community as potential biocatalyst for dissolved methane removal from anaerobic effluents photogranule morphology could be controlled in part by adapting hydrodynamic shear in the system demonstrating that morphology not only depended on the developmental state of the photogranules the established open community not only contained methanotrophic bacteria and phototrophs but also non methanotrophic methylotrophs likely responsible for methanol conversion possibly methanotrophs only incompletely oxidized methane to methanol enabling the development of a methanol degrading community equally fueled by phototrophically generated oxygen community composition may differ considerably between photogranules hinting towards cross feeding between individuals of the photogranule population this variability needs to be considered in experimental and modeling studies the presence of non methanotrophic methylotrophs is not problematic if the biotechnological aim was the removal of dissolved methane as post treatment of anaerobic effluent if simultaneous molecule recovery was the intention e g methanol production more specific ways for controlling the activity of the open microbial community would be needed further research will focus on the treatment of real anaerobic wastewaters effluent in a long term continuous mode nutrient recovery and an increased loading rate need to be studied as a function of temperature photogranules may be suitable to remove methane after psychrophilic anaerobic wastewater treatment

19952,we estimate 250 million people receive water using private pumps connected directly to intermittently pressurized distribution networks yet no previous studies have quantified the presumed effects of these pumps in this paper we investigate the effects of installing pressure sustaining valves at consumer connections these valves mimic pump disconnection by restricting flow installing these valves during the dry season at 94 of connections in an affluent neighborhood in delhi india cut the prevalence of samples with turbidity 4 ntu by two thirds but considering the poor reputation of pumps installed valves had surprisingly small average effects on turbidity 8 p 0 01 and free chlorine 0 05 mg l p 0 001 n 1 031 these effects were much smaller than the high variability in water quality supplied to both control and valve installed neighborhoods site specific responses to this variability could have confounded our results at the study site installed valves increased network pressure during 88 of the typical supply window valves had a maximum pressure effect of 0 62 m 95 ci 0 54 0 71 a 40 increase vs control further research is needed to generalize beyond our study site nevertheless this paper provides unique evidence showing how the deployed valves mitigated pump effects increased network pressure and improved water safety graphical abstract image graphical abstract

erickson et al 2017 kumpel and nelson 2016 taylor et al 2018b low distribution pressure is common in iws in part because these systems deliver water over short supply windows increasing flow rates and pressure losses klingel 2012 low distribution pressure and the associated risk of contaminant intrusion may also result from consumer adaptations to iws consumers adapt to intermittent water availability by storing water locally galaitsi et al 2016 kumpel et al 2017 overhead storage further increases convenience but typically requires consumers to use a pump guragai et al 2018 guragai et al 2017 kumpel et al 2017 while some consumers pump from passively filled lower storage tanks many get additional volumes of water by pumping directly from the distribution system these directly connected suction pumps are owned and operated by consumers and are widely presumed to lower distribution pressure promote contaminant intrusion and reduce water volumes delivered to consumers without pumps ahmed 2008 klingel 2012 zérah 2000 suction pumps may also reduce equity in iws as pump use varies by affluence zérah 2000 where suction pumps are common some utilities blame consumers and their pumps for deficiencies in the water supply e g bagga 2012 we identified five case studies in the literature where the prevalence of suction pumps was quantified ahmed 2008 klingel 2010 kumpel et al 2017 mastaller and klingel 2018 onda 2014 four of which were based in south asia table s1 these studies combine to suggest that 25 of consumers in iws extrapolates to 250 million people access their water supply through a suction pump table s1 if the presumed effects of pumps are true pumps pose a pervasive threat to water quality and equity while water utilities and regulators ought to prioritize mitigating their effects yet no prior research has measured the collective effects of suction pumps on water quality or pressure in any distribution system this absence of data likely reflects the physical and political difficulty of prohibiting or preventing consumers from using their own pumps ahmed 2008 anand 2011 2012 to overcome such difficulties taylor and slocum 2015 invented and validated the anti pump valve apv the apv regulates pressure and flow to mimic the existence of a storage tank upstream of the consumer s pump thereby eliminating the suction pump s effects on the network taylor 2014 taylor 2014 used the apv to verify that individual suction pumps can cause inward pressure gradients locally measured just upstream of the suction pump text s1 and fig s1 however the local effects of individual suction pumps likely differ from the collective effects of many suction pumps within a network this paper s first aim is to estimate the collective effects of suction pumps in a neighborhood in delhi india by observing the effects of widespread apv installation to do so we measured operational parameters indicative of intrusion since intrusion requires an inward pressure gradient a pathway for transport and nearby contaminants besner et al 2011 lindley and buchberger 2002 we also considered water pressure as surrogate indicator of water safety i e lower pressure increases the likelihood of an inward pressure gradient with the concomitant risk of intrusion in the event that suction pumps collectively produce substantial and undesirable effects the paper s second aim is to determine the feasibility of mitigating suction pump effects through apv installation 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydraulic disconnection of suction pumps the apv is a pressure sustaining valve with an upstream setpoint of atmospheric pressure fig 1 a it was invented to throttle through flow in order to maintain positive upstream water pressure fig 1b taylor and slocum 2015 unlike other pressure sustaining valves however the apv poses no obstruction to the flow cross section when in its open position thereby minimizing its reduction of pressure when open fig 1a the flow rate that consumers receive with an apv installed even while using a suction pump is intended to be equivalent to the flow rate they would receive with a ground level tank filling passively i e without a suction pump the installation of an apv is therefore equivalent to hydraulically disconnecting a suction pump several different versions of prototype apvs handmade in the u s were tested at individual household connections in delhi as part of previous work taylor 2014 but apvs have not been widely deployed outside this study for the present study 500 plastic apvs were injection molded in the u s and assembled in india prior testing taylor 2014 suggested prototype apvs did not prevent all negative pressure measured immediately upstream of the device but these prototype apvs did reduce the time during which pressure head hp 0 5 m by 80 p 0 01 fig s1 and the time during which hp 1 m by 96 p 0 001 fig s1 this increase in pressure along individual service connection pipes fig 1b likely reduced the local risk of contaminant intrusion based on these results the cumulative effects of apvs if installed at most connections in a neighborhood were expected to include increasing the supply pressure in nearby water mains due to the overall reduction in flow rates and their concomitant pressure losses e g main in fig 1b the effects of pumps and apvs depend on the supply pressure in the water main to which a consumer connects fig 1b apvs severely limit flow rates to consumers in locations where the pressure head in the water main hp 2 m averaged while water is being supplied apvs are not recommended in such areas in areas where hp 10 m consumer pumps are unlikely to induce negative pressures and apvs would have little or no effect therefore we selected a study site with 2 m hp 10 m while water was being supplied while pressure varies spatially and temporally in iws 79 of indian water utilities who reported an average pressure at consumer connections n 19 reported 2 m hp 10 m adb and moud 2007 similarly pressure at consumer taps in nagpur india was measured in this range for 83 and 71 of intermittently and continuously supplied households respectively bivins et al 2021 2 2 study design and site we conducted the study in delhi india where the public water utility had claimed that consumer pumps were their biggest problem and responsible for 90 of water contamination issues bagga 2012 budget constraints limited our study to installing apvs in a single neighborhood and so we used a before after control impact experimental design baci stewart oaten and bence 2001 during the before period october 1st to november 19th 2018 consumers in a control zone and an impact zone used their suction pumps without obstruction next apvs were installed at 94 of service connections in the impact zone total of 301 apvs apvs were installed upstream of consumer pumps often just outside consumer premises fig 1c but were not installed at 6 of connections in the impact zone due to lack of consumer availability interest and or accessibility finally both zones were observed during the after period december 2nd 2018 to january 19th 2019 the study was conducted during the first half of delhi s dry season i to minimize the variability in intrusion associated with rain events and ii to avoid severe water shortages sometimes associated with the latter half of the dry season daily rainfall during before and after periods was minimal totaling 5 9 mm and 6 3 mm respectively rainfall monitoring unit 2020 at the study site the water supply was usually predictably intermittent galaitsi et al 2016 lasting 2 5 4 h daily pumped water supply typically began from the underground supply reservoir at 5 am reaching the control and impact zones approximately 15 min later the duration of the water supply window depended on reservoir levels and ended near 8 am most days during the before period during the after period the system depressurized briefly at 8 am as supply valves and pumps were reconfigured and then water was often supplied for an additional 15 60 min between 8 and 9 am when extra water was available occasionally the utility would extend the morning supply and or pump water for a brief period in the afternoon or night the impact zone was selected because of its size hydraulic isolation high trust relationship between consumers and the utility history of occasionally severe contamination and average pressure head between 2 and 10 m during supply times it had 124 structures and 320 connections to the distribution system fig s2b to account for temporal variations in water quality and pressure a nearby similarly isolated neighborhood with 60 structures and 181 connections was selected as the control zone fig s2a a schematic of each zone and their relative locations in the network is included as fig s2 2 3 measuring water quality at our study site pre study testing of water quality methods and results in text s2 detected fecal indicator bacteria only once in 123 samples of 100 ml fig s3 plausibly due to high levels of residual free chlorine 90 0 5 mg l and 31 1 mg l fig s3 given the low baseline prevalence of fecal indicator bacteria at our study site detecting a significant decrease in their prevalence would have been prohibitively expensive taylor et al 2018a more generally detecting an intrusion event by sampling e coli is unlikely in a chlorinated water supply unless samples are taken close to the source while intrusion is occurring hatam et al 2020 aerobic endospores have been suggested as an alternative indicator of intrusion in other contexts cartier et al 2009 near our study site aerobic endospores were consistently detected in soils fig s4 but their variable presence in the treated source water fig s5 discouraged their use as an indicator of intrusion in lieu of microbial indicators turbidity total chlorine and free chlorine were used as operational indicators to quantify potential changes in intrusion and water quality helbling and vanbriesen 2008 who 2014 2017 while total chlorine was measured and modelled text s3 it is omitted here because it closely resembled free chlorine grab samples were collected repeatedly from a convenience sample of 20 connections per zone 10 samples per zone per day 6 days per week approximate sampling locations in fig s2 samples were collected downstream of consumers suction pumps but upstream of any storage tanks samples were immediately tested for turbidity using hach 2100q portable meters 0 40

range reagents measurement range 0 05 4 00 mg l due to limited water and consumer availability not all connections were sampled when scheduled data analysis only includes samples from connections with 30 observations and from days with 8 observations in each zone the analyzed data includes 504 samples from 19 connections in the control zone and 527 samples from 20 connections in the impact zone included samples were taken on 27 days during the before period 524 samples and 26 days during the after period 507 samples 2 4 measuring pressure during a typical intermittent water supply cycle at the study site consumers gradually become satisfied i e receive as much water as they demand taylor et al 2019 causing flow rates to decrease and pressures to increase we hypothesized that suction pumps increased flow rates at the beginning of the supply cycle and thereby magnified the pressure differential between the start and end of supply if true apvs would increase the pressure in the distribution network at the start of supply pressure in the water distribution mains was sampled at 5 minute intervals at two interior locations in each zone using mirocom nemos n200 pressure loggers layout in fig s2 battery capacity cell connectivity and operational constraints limited the pressure coverage to 43 days with at least one pressure logger in each zone before and 43 days after installation of the apvs 2 5 data analysis the effects of apvs were estimated using data from the before and after periods in the control and impact zones the intervention effects in a baci experiment are not directly measured instead they are found by measuring how the difference between control and impact zones changes from the before to the after period a difference of difference baci experimental designs can control for location effects and time effects but not time effects which differ between locations mean apv effects were computed using two different methods 1 first by computing the mean difference of difference between control and impact zones during before and after periods uncertainty in the resultant apv effect estimate is summarized by a 95 confidence interval generated from the t distribution and by comparing zonal differences impact control during the before and after periods 2 second by using multiple linear regression with fixed effects to control for location and time effects as is appropriate for baci designs stewart oaten and bence 2001 non normality in the data and residuals were accounted for using bootstrapping methods appropriate for regression stratified case bootstrapping chernick 2008 with 9999 replications the uncertainty in regression results was summarized by bias corrected accelerated 95th percentile intervals fox and weisberg 2019 hereafter referred to as confidence intervals ci for convenience 2 5 1 water quality effects in the first method the average difference in free chlorine between impact and control zones was computed each day with a t distribution derived 95 confidence interval the average difference between these daily differences after before was attributed to the apv s installation also with a t distribution derived 95 confidence interval turbidity measurements were right skewed which we mitigated by log transforming turbidity values before analysis figure s6 log transformed turbidity values were analyzed with the same method as free chlorine values difference of difference with t distribution derived confidence intervals estimates of the apv s effect on ln turbidity are reported in the text as equivalent percent changes for example if the apv s effect δ δ ln turbidity 0 15 we would report apvs were associated with a 16 increase in turbidity e 0 15 1 16 16 in the second method multiple linear regression estimated free chlorine model 2 and log turbidity model 1 each day d at each sampled connection c accounting for the presence or absence of the apv connection and date were treated as fixed effects whose estimates are not generalizable and therefore are not reported in the main text the model of free chlorine additionally included turbidity t d c not log transformed as a predictor model 1 ln t d c b 0 b d d b c c b 1 x a p v model 2 c l d c b 0 b d d b c c b 1 x a p v b 2 t d c where t d c and c l d c represent the estimated turbidity and free chlorine on day d at connection c d 1 53 days c 1 39 connections and x a p v 0 1 where x a p v 1 indicates that the apvs were installed in that connection s zone on that day the effect estimates b 0 b d d b c c b 1 b 2 were estimated separately for models 1 and 2 the intercepts b 0 were calculated by assuming that b c 1 b d 1 0 if apvs improved i e reduced overall turbidity b 1 would be negative in model 1 conversely if apvs improved i e increased overall concentrations of free chlorine b 1 would be positive in model 2 additionally apv induced changes in the distribution rather than the mean of water quality parameters were investigated graphically using the observed empirical cumulative distributions functions ecdfs from both zones during both periods to bound the true cumulative distribution function within a confidence band around the ecdf with 95 probability we used the dvoretzky kiefer wolfowitz inequality massart 1990 2 5 2 pressure effect estimates to control for variations in supply during the study we studied the difference between the spatially averaged pressure head in the control and impact zones this pressure difference δ h p was strongly dependent on the time of day t note t is not date and time but time of day for clarity we focus on the window during which water was typically supplied 5 00 to 9 10 am in the first method we computed δ h p t each day as the difference between h p t in each zone impact control the effect of the apv was then computed as the change in δ h p t between periods after before a difference of difference δ δ h p t with a t distribution derived 95 confidence interval in the second method we estimated δ h p t using multiple linear regression accounting for baseline differences in time of day with fixed effects within this regression model the effect of the apv was estimated separately for each time of day t the final model of the pressure difference between zones was model 3 δ h p t b 0 b t 1 t b t 2 t x a p v where x a p v 0 1 where x a p v 1 indicates that apvs were installed while we focus on 5 00 to 9 10 am valve effects were estimated throughout the day fig s7 time of day was in five minute increments t 00 00 00 00 23 55 together b 0 b t 1 t estimate how δ h p t varied during an average day in the before period each b t 2 t e g b t 2 05 20 estimates how δ h p changed at that time of day t during the after period e g at 05 20 am this change was then attributed to apvs the constant b 0 was calculated by assuming that b t 1 00 00 0 3 results and discussion the transition between periods unfortunately coincided with a change in the supply pattern on most days in the after period the utility supplied water for longer and with lower pressure than before the baci experimental design accounts for these changes provided they would have affected both zones equally had there been no intervention if these changes would have affected zones differently that difference would erroneously be attributed to apvs 3 1 apv effects on water quality throughout the before and after periods substantial variations in mean water quality were observed even in the control zone fig 2 amidst these large temporal variations in quality parameters the installation of apvs modestly improved tracked indicators the difference of differences method suggested apvs reduced mean turbidity by 7 95 confidence interval ci 2 12 fig 3 b and increased free chlorine by 0 05 mg l 95 ci 0 02 0 09 fig 3d similarly regression models 1 and 2 suggest that apvs changed the turbidity and free chlorine by a mean of 8 p 0 01 and 0 05 mg l p 0 001 respectively table 1 and figs 3b and 3d in both methods variations in water quality associated with recent rainfall were controlled for by analyzing the differences between zones on a daily basis improvements in log mean turbidity and mean free chlorine due to apvs while statistically significant were close to the precision of the measurement methods and were more than an order of magnitude smaller than the observed temporal variations in these parameters figs 2 and 3 due presumably to fluctuations in treated water quality the limited improvements in overall water quality were particularly unexpected given how frequently pumps are purported to degrade water quality including in delhi the limited water quality effects may have resulted in part from selecting zones with h p 2 m while apvs were associated with a small overall reduction in turbidity 8 their presence during the after period was also associated with a 68 reduction p 0 001 in the prevalence of samples with turbidity 4 ntu from 13 to 4 2 fig 4 a samples with turbidity 4 ntu increased during the after period in both zones but the increase was much more pronounced in the control zone 6x larger fig 4a nevertheless with apvs installed 4 2 of samples in the impact zone had turbidity 4 ntu fig 4a and the highest measured value of turbidity 18 ntu occurred at a connection with an apv installed the increase in high turbidity 4 ntu in the control zone could be explained by i a localized turbidity increasing phenomenon in the control zone during the after period ii a phenomenon that would have increased the prevalence of high turbidity in both zones but the phenomenon was mitigated in the impact zone by apvs or iii a combination of i and ii the experimental design does not allow us to distinguish between these possibilities in any case apvs did not eliminate all instances of high turbidity increases in turbidity can indicate upstream contaminant intrusion backflow and or detachment of the biofilm or rust husband and boxall 2011 who 2017 2014 the observed overall reductions in turbidity and especially in high turbidity events associated with apvs suggest that suction pumps do promote or exacerbate turbidity increasing phenomena posing a threat to water quality the relationship between health and turbidity in distribution networks continues to be debated who 2017 nevertheless measured turbidity was sometimes high enough figs 2a and 4a to increase chlorine demand and possibly to limit the disinfection potential of residual chlorine lechevallier et al 1981 who 2017 during the before period free chlorine was 0 5 mg l in 7 8 and 19 of samples in the control and impact zones fig 4b during the after period however free chlorine was always 0 5 mg l fig 4b substantial increases free chlorine in both zones suggest a change in upstream treatment processes rather than a change associated with apv installation limited apv induced improvements in water quality do not necessarily imply limited improvements in intrusion risk or water safety since contaminant intrusion requires the presence of a contaminant in the vicinity of a transport pathway and an inward pressure gradient besner et al 2011 lindley and buchberger 2002 our study was conducted during the dry season fig 2e when contamination events are less frequent kumpel and nelson 2013 and in an affluent and residential area with fewer contaminants near water pipes than may be expected in informal settlements in a different season or at a different site pump induced contaminant intrusion may have been more prevalent further research is needed to generalize the current findings 3 2 apv effects on pressure to make a more generalizable assessment of the risk of intrusion the prevalence and magnitude of low pressure is reported lower pressure increases the likelihood of an inward hydraulic gradient and the associated risk of contaminant intrusion besner et al 2011 lindley and buchberger 2002 and hence provides a surrogate indicator of reduced water safety the pressure difference between zones impact control δ h p t varied with the time of day and changed when apvs were installed fig 5 a the effect of apvs was first computed as the mean difference in δ h p t δ δ h p t fig 5b and second with regression model 3 estimates from both methods and their 95 confidence ranges match very closely fig 5c both methods suggest apv effects varied with time of day fig 5c as the regression model more robustly accounted for non normality we focus on describing its numerical estimates in the text to contextualize the magnitude and timing of apv effects the regression estimated apv effects fig 5c and table s3 were superimposed on the mean pressure profile observed in the control zone during the after period fig 5a resulting in fig 5d as expected apvs increased pressure in the distribution network especially at the start of supply at 5 20 am apvs had their maximum effect on pressure increasing it by a mean of 0 62 m 95 ci 0 54 0 71 fig 5c equivalent to increasing pressure in the control zone by 40 fig 5d during the period from 5 15 to 7 00 am which begins when water typically reached the control and impact zones apvs increased the pressure by a mean of 0 48 m equivalent to a 21 pressure increase in the control zone pressure fig 5d from 7 05 to 7 55 am apvs increased pressure by a mean 0 29 m equivalent to an 8 increase in the control zone fig 5d finally from 8 to 9 05 am the mean pressure increase was negligible 0 05 m or 2 in the control zone fig 5d at 8 00 am the computed apv effect was negative 0 32 m 95 ci 0 60 0 04 fig 5c apvs in the impact zone slowed flow rates we hypothesize this left more consumers withdrawing water and deflating pressure compared to the control zone during the temporary depressurization at 8 00 am during the after period fig 5a overall apvs increased pressure 88 of the time from 5 00 to 9 10 am but their efficacy decreased during second half of the supply window when many consumers had received enough water reducing the number of active pumps fig 5d since many common contaminant sources have low pressure e g adjacent saturated soils even modest pressure increases in pipes with low pressure can meaningfully reduce the prevalence and or severity of inward pressure gradients thereby reducing the risk and or severity of contaminant intrusion while water is being supplied besner et al 2011 collins and boxall 2013 ebacher et al 2012 taylor et al 2018b more research is needed to understand how low pressures affect water safety in intermittent water supplies as part of its water safety plans the world health organization recommends the removal of contaminants in the vicinity of pipes in iws who 2014 this recommendation should certainly be emphasized wherever consumers use suction pumps consumers who could afford pumps and household water treatment often expressed that they wanted more water not water of better quality yet allowing suction pumps to deliver more water to pump users while potentially compromising water quality harms consumers who cannot afford to both pump and treat their water apvs reduced this suction pump induced inequity by increasing pressure and disrupting the hydraulic connection between pump size and the volume of water supplied 3 3 acceptability vs efficacy of apvs attempts to physically disconnect consumer pumps often encounter strong community and political resistance e g see anand 2012 or björkman 2014 to avoid this in the impact zone we worked closely with community representatives and secured strong initial support for apvs from residents and their association despite selecting impact and control zones with 2 m h p 10 m after apv installation many impact zone consumers were concerned about flow rates and some complained in response to each consumer complaint the effects of the complainant s apv were reduced by moving the apv further upstream from the complainant s suction pump and or by lowering the installed elevation of the apv the flow rate received by consumers is physically linked to the pressure differential between their connection and the water supply main while suction pumps serve to increase both the pressure differential and the flow rate apvs reduce both apv induced flow rate reductions were modest via site selection and complaint response hence our study was limited in the magnitude of observable pressure changes associated with apv installation our reported results do not represent the maximum technical effects that apvs could achieve nor the maximum harm that suction pumps may cause instead the results indicate the potential benefits of disconnecting consumer pumps hydraulically or physically in locations where disconnections are at least marginally acceptable to consumers pumps are likely a larger problem in areas where disconnection would be unacceptable to consumers and a lesser problem where disconnection would go uncontested consumer acceptance of apvs declined when consumers noticed flow rate reductions immediately after apv installation acceptability would likely improve if apvs were integrated into water meters or backflow preventers and installed when making new service connections or replacing existing service connections given the acceptability efficacy tradeoff of pump disconnection utilities should continue to prioritize other system improvements such as removing contaminants near pipes and repairing leaks at our study site the utility should also prioritize improving the consistency of water treatment 4 limitations this study had several notable limitations first the acceptability of apvs was assessed anecdotally future studies should seek to formalize the response of consumers to varying changes in their flow rates and delivered volumes second iws are remarkably heterogeneous and generalizing across such heterogeneity is not possible with this study which compared two neighborhoods over 13 weeks third the likelihood of contaminant intrusion during the dry season in an affluent neighborhood was low limiting the potential of directly observing pump induced intrusion fourth our results depend on the assumption that the control and impact zones would respond equally to temporal changes yet differences between the zones were present most notably their sizes and the system varied substantially over time if the zones responded differently to these temporal variations these differences would be mistakenly attributed to apvs a longer multi site study would mitigate these concerns and better quantify the potential role of apvs in improving iws globally we used apvs to estimate pump effects but could only do so where apv installation was acceptable to consumers limiting our ability to study systems severely affected by pumps this limitation is an important qualifier of our results insofar as apv effects are used to infer the effects of suction sumps nevertheless our findings are of practical importance as they suggest the potential benefits of pump mitigation where such mitigation would be marginally acceptable to consumers 5 conclusions we conclude that at the study site hydraulically disconnecting suction pumps by installing anti pump valves had only modest effects on mean water quality especially when compared to variations in treated water quality casting doubt on the applicability of the public utility s claim that 90 of contamination could be traced to suction pumps the absence of a substantial association between overall water quality and pump mitigating valves at our study site suggests utilities researchers and policy makers should be more cautious when making generalized claims about the effects of consumer pumps some evidence was found to suggest that at least at the study site mitigating suction pumps reduces the prevalence of high turbidity generating phenomena such as contaminant

19952,we estimate 250 million people receive water using private pumps connected directly to intermittently pressurized distribution networks yet no previous studies have quantified the presumed effects of these pumps in this paper we investigate the effects of installing pressure sustaining valves at consumer connections these valves mimic pump disconnection by restricting flow installing these valves during the dry season at 94 of connections in an affluent neighborhood in delhi india cut the prevalence of samples with turbidity 4 ntu by two thirds but considering the poor reputation of pumps installed valves had surprisingly small average effects on turbidity 8 p 0 01 and free chlorine 0 05 mg l p 0 001 n 1 031 these effects were much smaller than the high variability in water quality supplied to both control and valve installed neighborhoods site specific responses to this variability could have confounded our results at the study site installed valves increased network pressure during 88 of the typical supply window valves had a maximum pressure effect of 0 62 m 95 ci 0 54 0 71 a 40 increase vs control further research is needed to generalize beyond our study site nevertheless this paper provides unique evidence showing how the deployed valves mitigated pump effects increased network pressure and improved water safety graphical abstract image graphical abstract

erickson et al 2017 kumpel and nelson 2016 taylor et al 2018b low distribution pressure is common in iws in part because these systems deliver water over short supply windows increasing flow rates and pressure losses klingel 2012 low distribution pressure and the associated risk of contaminant intrusion may also result from consumer adaptations to iws consumers adapt to intermittent water

al 2017 kumpel et al 2017 while some consumers pump from passively filled lower storage tanks many get additional volumes of water by pumping directly from the distribution system these directly connected suction pumps are owned and operated by consumers and are widely presumed to lower distribution pressure promote contaminant intrusion and reduce water volumes delivered to consumers without pumps ahmed 2008 klingel 2012 zérah 2000 suction pumps may also reduce equity in iws as pump use varies by affluence zérah 2000 where suction pumps are common some utilities blame consumers and their

2017 mastaller and klingel 2018 onda 2014 four of which were based in south asia table s1 these studies combine to suggest that 25 of consumers in iws extrapolates to 250 million people access their water supply through a suction pump table s1 if the presumed effects of pumps are true pumps pose a pervasive threat to water quality and equity while water utilities and regulators ought to prioritize mitigating their effects yet no prior research has measured the collective effects of suction pumps on water quality or pressure in any distribution system this absence of data likely reflects the physical and political difficulty of prohibiting or preventing consumers from using their own pumps ahmed 2008 anand 2011 2012 to overcome such difficulties taylor and slocum 2015 invented and validated the anti pump valve apv the apv regulates pressure and flow to mimic the existence of a storage tank upstream of the consumer s pump thereby eliminating the suction pump s effects on the network taylor 2014 taylor 2014 used the apv to verify that individual suction pumps can cause inward pressure gradients locally measured just upstream of the suction pump text s1 and fig s1 however the local effects of individual suction pumps likely differ from the collective effects of many suction pumps within a network this paper s first aim is to estimate the collective effects of suction pumps in a neighborhood in delhi india by observing the effects of widespread apv installation to do so we measured operational parameters indicative of intrusion since intrusion requires an inward pressure gradient a pathway for transport and nearby contaminants besner et al 2011 lindley and buchberger 2002 we also considered water pressure as surrogate indicator of water safety i e lower pressure increases the likelihood of an inward pressure gradient with the concomitant risk of intrusion in the event that suction pumps collectively produce substantial and undesirable effects the paper s second aim is to determine the feasibility of mitigating suction pump effects through apv installation 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydraulic disconnection of suction pumps the apv is a pressure sustaining valve with an upstream setpoint of atmospheric pressure fig 1 a it was invented to throttle through flow in order to maintain positive upstream water pressure fig 1b taylor and slocum 2015 unlike other pressure sustaining valves however the apv poses no obstruction to the flow cross section when in its open position thereby minimizing its reduction of pressure when open fig 1a the flow rate that consumers receive with an apv installed even while using a suction pump is intended to be equivalent to the flow rate they would receive with a ground level tank filling passively i e without a suction pump the installation of an apv is therefore equivalent to hydraulically disconnecting a suction pump several different versions of prototype apvs handmade in the u s were tested at individual household connections in delhi as part of previous work taylor 2014 but apvs have not been widely deployed outside this study for the present study 500 plastic apvs were injection molded in the u s and assembled in india prior testing taylor 2014 suggested prototype apvs did not prevent all negative pressure measured immediately upstream of the device but these prototype apvs did reduce the time during which pressure head hp 0 5 m by 80 p 0 01 fig s1 and the time during which hp 1 m by 96 p 0 001 fig s1 this increase in pressure along individual service connection pipes fig 1b likely reduced the local risk of contaminant intrusion based on these results the cumulative effects of apvs if installed at most connections in a neighborhood were expected to include increasing the supply pressure in nearby water mains due to the overall reduction in flow rates and their concomitant pressure losses e g main in fig 1b the effects of pumps and apvs depend on the supply pressure in the water main to which a consumer connects fig 1b apvs severely limit flow rates to consumers in locations where the pressure head in the water main hp 2 m averaged while water is being supplied apvs are not recommended in such areas in areas where hp 10 m consumer pumps are unlikely to induce negative pressures and apvs would have little or no effect therefore we selected a study site with 2 m hp 10 m while water was being supplied while pressure varies spatially and temporally in iws 79 of indian water utilities who reported an average pressure at consumer connections n 19 reported 2 m hp 10 m adb and moud 2007 similarly pressure at consumer taps in nagpur india was measured in this range for 83 and 71 of intermittently and continuously supplied households respectively bivins et al 2021 2 2 study design and site we conducted the study in delhi india where the public water utility had claimed that consumer pumps were their biggest problem and responsible for 90 of water contamination issues bagga 2012 budget constraints limited our study to installing apvs in a single neighborhood and so we used a before after control impact experimental design baci stewart oaten and bence 2001 during the before period october 1st to november 19th 2018 consumers in a control zone and an impact zone used their suction pumps without obstruction next apvs were installed at 94 of service connections in the impact zone total of 301 apvs apvs were installed upstream of consumer pumps often just outside consumer premises fig 1c but were not installed at 6 of connections in the impact zone due to lack of consumer availability interest and or accessibility finally both zones were observed during the after period december 2nd 2018 to january 19th 2019 the study was conducted during the first half of delhi s dry season i to minimize the variability in intrusion associated with rain events and ii to avoid severe water shortages sometimes associated with the latter half of the dry season daily rainfall during before and after periods was minimal totaling 5 9 mm and 6 3 mm respectively rainfall monitoring unit 2020 at the study site the water supply was usually predictably intermittent galaitsi et al 2016 lasting 2 5 4 h daily pumped water supply typically began from the underground supply reservoir at 5 am reaching the control and impact zones approximately 15 min later the duration of the water supply window depended on reservoir levels and ended near 8 am most days during the before period during the after period the system depressurized briefly at 8 am as supply valves and pumps were reconfigured and then water was often supplied for an additional 15 60 min between 8 and 9 am when extra water was available occasionally the utility would extend the morning supply and or pump water for a brief period in the afternoon or night the impact zone was selected because of its size hydraulic isolation high trust relationship between consumers and the utility history of occasionally severe contamination and average pressure head between 2 and 10 m during supply times it had 124 structures and 320 connections to the distribution system fig s2b to account for temporal variations in water quality and pressure a nearby similarly isolated neighborhood with 60 structures and 181 connections was selected as the control zone fig s2a a schematic of each zone and their relative locations in the network is included as fig s2 2 3 measuring water quality at our study site pre study testing of water quality methods and results in text s2 detected fecal indicator bacteria only once in 123 samples of 100 ml fig s3 plausibly due to high levels of residual free chlorine 90 0 5 mg l and 31 1 mg l fig s3 given the low baseline prevalence of fecal indicator bacteria at our study site detecting a significant decrease in their prevalence would have been prohibitively expensive taylor et al 2018a more generally detecting an intrusion event by sampling e coli is unlikely in a chlorinated water supply unless samples are taken close to the source while intrusion is occurring hatam et al 2020 aerobic endospores have been suggested as an alternative indicator of intrusion in other contexts cartier et al 2009 near our study site aerobic endospores were consistently detected in soils fig s4 but their variable presence in the treated source water fig s5 discouraged their use as an indicator of intrusion in lieu of microbial indicators turbidity total chlorine and free chlorine were used as operational indicators to quantify potential changes in intrusion and water quality helbling and vanbriesen 2008 who 2014 2017 while total chlorine was measured and modelled text s3 it is omitted here because it closely resembled free chlorine grab samples were collected repeatedly from a convenience sample of 20 connections per zone 10 samples per zone per day 6 days per week approximate sampling locations in fig s2 samples were collected downstream of consumers suction pumps but upstream of any storage tanks samples were immediately tested for turbidity using hach 2100q portable meters 0 40 ntu range accuracy 2 of reading and stray light effects 0 02 ntu samples were also promptly tested for chlorine residual total and free using hach pocket colorimeter ii mr hr portable meters with mid range reagents measurement range 0 05 4 00 mg l due to limited water and consumer availability not all connections were sampled when scheduled data analysis only includes samples from connections with 30 observations and from days with 8 observations in each zone the analyzed data includes 504 samples from 19 connections in the control zone and 527 samples from 20 connections in the impact zone included samples were taken on 27 days during the before period 524 samples and 26 days during the after period 507 samples 2 4 measuring pressure during a typical intermittent water supply cycle at the study site consumers gradually become satisfied i e receive as much water as they demand taylor et al 2019 causing flow rates to decrease and pressures to increase we hypothesized that suction pumps increased flow rates at the beginning of the supply cycle and thereby magnified the pressure differential between the start and end of supply if true apvs would increase the pressure in the distribution network at the start of supply pressure in the water distribution mains was sampled at 5 minute intervals at two interior locations in each zone using mirocom nemos n200 pressure loggers layout in fig s2 battery capacity cell connectivity and operational constraints limited the pressure coverage to 43 days with at least one pressure logger in each zone before and 43 days after installation of the apvs 2 5 data analysis the effects of apvs were estimated using data from the before and after periods in the control and impact zones the intervention effects in a baci experiment are not directly measured instead they are found by measuring how the difference between control and impact zones changes from the before to the after period a difference of difference baci experimental designs can control for location effects and time effects but not time effects which differ between locations mean apv effects were computed using two different methods 1 first by computing the mean difference of difference between control and impact zones during before and after periods uncertainty in the resultant apv effect estimate is summarized by a 95 confidence interval generated from the t distribution and by comparing zonal differences impact control during the before and after periods 2 second by using multiple linear regression with fixed effects to control for location and time effects as is appropriate for baci designs stewart oaten and bence 2001 non normality in the data and residuals were accounted for using bootstrapping methods appropriate for regression stratified case bootstrapping chernick 2008 with 9999 replications the uncertainty in regression results was summarized by bias corrected accelerated 95th percentile intervals fox and weisberg 2019 hereafter referred to as confidence intervals ci for convenience 2 5 1 water quality effects in the first method the average difference in free chlorine between impact and control zones was computed each day with a t distribution derived 95 confidence interval the average difference between these daily differences after before was attributed to the apv s installation also with a t distribution derived 95 confidence interval turbidity measurements were right skewed which we mitigated by log transforming turbidity values before analysis figure s6 log transformed turbidity values were analyzed with the same method as free chlorine values difference of difference with t distribution derived confidence intervals estimates of the apv s effect on ln turbidity are reported in the text as equivalent percent changes for example if the apv s effect δ δ ln turbidity 0 15 we would report apvs were associated with a 16 increase in turbidity e 0 15 1 16 16 in the second method multiple linear regression estimated free chlorine model 2 and log turbidity model 1 each day d at each sampled connection c accounting for the presence or absence of the apv connection and date were treated as fixed effects whose estimates are not generalizable and therefore are not reported in the main text the model of free chlorine additionally included turbidity t d c not log transformed as a predictor model 1 ln t d c b 0 b d d b c c b 1 x a p v model 2 c l d c b 0 b d d b c c b 1 x a p v b 2 t d c where t d c and c l d c represent the estimated turbidity and free chlorine on day d at connection c d 1 53 days c 1 39 connections and x a p v 0 1 where x a p v 1 indicates that the apvs were installed in that connection s zone on that day the effect estimates b 0 b d d b c c b 1 b 2 were estimated separately for models 1 and 2 the intercepts b 0 were calculated by assuming that b c 1 b d 1 0 if apvs improved i e reduced overall turbidity b 1 would be negative in model 1 conversely if apvs improved i e increased overall concentrations of free chlorine b 1 would be positive in model 2 additionally apv induced changes in the distribution rather than the mean of water quality parameters were investigated graphically using the observed empirical cumulative distributions functions ecdfs from both zones during both periods to bound the true cumulative distribution function within a confidence band around the ecdf with 95 probability we used the dvoretzky kiefer wolfowitz inequality massart 1990 2 5 2 pressure effect estimates to control for variations in supply during the study we studied the difference between the spatially averaged pressure head in the control and impact zones this pressure difference δ h p was strongly dependent on the time of day t note t is not date and time but time of day for clarity we focus on the window during which water was typically supplied 5 00 to 9 10 am in the first method we computed δ h p t each day as the difference between h p t in each zone impact control the effect of the apv was then computed as the change in δ h p t between periods after before a difference of difference δ δ h p t with a t distribution derived 95 confidence interval in the second method we estimated δ h p t using multiple linear regression accounting for baseline differences in time of day with fixed effects within this regression model the effect of the apv was estimated separately for each time of day t the final model of the pressure difference between zones was model 3 δ h p t b 0 b t 1 t b t 2 t x a p v where x a p v 0 1 where x a p v 1 indicates that apvs were installed while we focus on 5 00 to 9 10 am valve effects were estimated throughout the day fig s7 time of day was in five minute increments t 00 00 00 00 23 55 together b 0 b t 1 t estimate how δ h p t varied during an average day in the before period each b t 2 t e g b t 2 05 20 estimates how δ h p changed at that time of day t during the after period e g at 05 20 am this change was then attributed to apvs the constant b 0 was calculated by assuming that b t 1 00 00 0 3 results and discussion the transition between periods unfortunately coincided with a change in the supply pattern on most days in the after period the utility supplied water for longer and with lower pressure than before the baci experimental design accounts for these changes provided they would have affected both zones equally had there been no intervention if these changes would have affected zones differently that difference would erroneously be attributed to apvs 3 1 apv effects on water quality throughout the before and after periods substantial variations in mean water quality were observed even in the control zone fig 2 amidst these large temporal variations in quality parameters the installation of apvs modestly improved tracked indicators the difference of differences method suggested apvs reduced mean turbidity by 7 95 confidence interval ci 2 12 fig 3 b and increased free chlorine by 0 05 mg l 95 ci 0 02 0 09 fig 3d similarly regression models 1 and 2 suggest that apvs changed the turbidity and free chlorine by a mean of 8 p 0 01 and 0 05 mg l p 0 001 respectively table 1 and figs 3b and 3d in both methods variations in water quality associated with recent rainfall were controlled for by analyzing the differences between zones on a daily basis improvements in log mean turbidity and mean free chlorine due to apvs while statistically significant were close to the precision of the measurement methods and were more than an order of magnitude smaller than the observed temporal variations in these parameters figs 2 and 3 due presumably to fluctuations in treated water quality the limited improvements in overall water quality were particularly unexpected given how frequently pumps are purported to degrade water quality including in delhi the limited water quality effects may have resulted in part from selecting zones with h p 2 m while apvs were associated with a small overall reduction in turbidity 8 their presence during the after period was also associated with a 68 reduction p 0 001 in the prevalence of samples with turbidity 4 ntu from 13 to 4 2 fig 4 a samples with turbidity 4 ntu increased during the after period in both zones but the increase was much more pronounced in the control zone 6x larger fig 4a nevertheless with apvs installed 4 2 of samples in the impact zone had turbidity 4 ntu fig 4a and the highest measured value of turbidity 18 ntu occurred at a connection with an apv installed the increase in high turbidity 4 ntu in the control zone could be explained by i a localized turbidity increasing phenomenon in the control zone during the after period ii a phenomenon that would have increased the prevalence of high turbidity in both zones but the phenomenon was mitigated in the impact zone by apvs or iii a combination of i and ii the experimental design does not allow us to distinguish between these possibilities in any case apvs did not eliminate all instances of high turbidity increases in turbidity can indicate upstream contaminant intrusion backflow and or detachment of the biofilm or rust husband and boxall 2011 who 2017 2014 the observed overall reductions in turbidity and especially in high turbidity events associated with apvs suggest that suction pumps do promote or exacerbate turbidity increasing phenomena posing a threat to water quality the relationship between health and turbidity in distribution networks continues to be debated who 2017 nevertheless measured turbidity was sometimes high enough figs 2a and 4a to increase chlorine demand and possibly to limit the disinfection potential of residual chlorine lechevallier et al 1981 who 2017 during the before period free chlorine was 0 5 mg l in 7 8 and 19 of samples in the control and impact zones fig 4b during the after period however free chlorine was always 0 5 mg l fig 4b substantial increases free chlorine in both zones suggest a change in upstream treatment processes rather than a change associated with apv installation limited apv induced improvements in water quality do not necessarily imply limited improvements in intrusion risk or water safety since contaminant intrusion requires the presence of a contaminant in the vicinity of a transport pathway and an inward pressure gradient besner et al 2011 lindley and buchberger 2002 our study was conducted during the dry season fig 2e when contamination events are less frequent kumpel and nelson 2013 and in an affluent and residential area with fewer contaminants near water pipes than may be expected in informal settlements in a different season or at a different site pump induced contaminant intrusion may have been more prevalent further research is needed to generalize the current findings 3 2 apv effects on pressure to make a more generalizable assessment of the risk of intrusion the prevalence and magnitude of low pressure is reported lower pressure increases the likelihood of an inward hydraulic gradient and the associated risk of contaminant intrusion besner et al 2011 lindley and buchberger 2002 and hence provides a surrogate indicator of reduced water safety the pressure difference between zones impact control δ h p t varied with the time of day and changed when apvs were installed fig 5 a the effect of apvs was first computed as the mean difference in δ h p t δ δ h p t fig 5b and second with regression model 3 estimates from both methods and their 95 confidence ranges match very closely fig 5c both methods suggest apv effects varied with time of day fig 5c as the regression model more robustly accounted for non normality we focus on describing its numerical estimates in the text to contextualize the magnitude and timing of apv effects the regression estimated apv effects fig 5c and table s3 were superimposed on the mean pressure profile observed in the control zone during the after period fig 5a resulting in fig 5d as expected apvs increased pressure in the distribution network especially at the start of supply at 5 20 am apvs had their maximum effect on pressure increasing it by a mean of 0 62 m 95 ci 0 54 0 71 fig 5c equivalent to increasing pressure in the control zone by 40 fig 5d during the period from 5 15 to 7 00 am which begins when water typically reached the control and impact zones apvs increased the pressure by a mean of 0 48 m equivalent to a 21 pressure increase in the control zone pressure fig 5d from 7 05 to 7 55 am apvs increased pressure by a mean 0 29 m equivalent to an 8 increase in the control zone fig 5d finally from 8 to 9 05 am the mean pressure increase was negligible 0 05 m or 2 in the control zone fig 5d at 8 00 am the computed apv effect was negative 0 32 m 95 ci 0 60 0 04 fig 5c apvs in the impact zone slowed flow rates we hypothesize this left more consumers withdrawing water and deflating pressure compared to the control zone during the temporary depressurization at 8 00 am during the after period fig 5a overall apvs increased pressure 88 of the time from 5 00 to 9 10 am but their efficacy decreased during second half of the supply window when many consumers had received enough water reducing the number of active pumps fig 5d since many common contaminant sources have low pressure e g adjacent saturated soils even modest pressure increases in pipes with low pressure can meaningfully reduce the prevalence and or severity of inward pressure gradients thereby reducing the risk and or severity of contaminant intrusion while water is being supplied besner et al 2011 collins and boxall 2013 ebacher et al 2012 taylor et al 2018b more research is needed to understand how low pressures affect water safety in intermittent water supplies as part of its water safety plans the world health organization recommends the removal of contaminants in the vicinity of pipes in iws who 2014 this recommendation should certainly be emphasized wherever consumers use suction pumps consumers who could afford pumps and household water treatment often expressed that they wanted more water not water of better quality yet allowing suction pumps to deliver more water to pump users while potentially compromising water quality harms consumers who cannot afford to both pump and treat their water apvs reduced this suction pump induced inequity by increasing pressure and disrupting the hydraulic connection between pump size and the volume of water supplied 3 3 acceptability vs efficacy of apvs attempts to physically disconnect consumer pumps often encounter strong community and political resistance e g see anand 2012 or björkman 2014 to avoid this in the impact zone we worked closely with community representatives and secured strong initial support for apvs from residents and their association despite selecting impact and control zones with 2 m h p 10 m after apv installation many impact zone consumers were concerned about flow rates and some complained in response to each consumer complaint the effects of the complainant s apv were reduced by moving the apv further upstream from the complainant s suction pump and or by lowering the installed elevation of the apv the flow rate received by consumers is physically linked to the pressure differential between their connection and the water supply main while suction pumps serve to increase both the pressure differential and the flow rate apvs reduce both apv induced flow rate reductions were modest via site selection and complaint response hence our study was limited in the magnitude of observable pressure changes associated with apv installation our reported results do not represent the maximum technical effects that apvs could achieve nor the maximum harm that suction pumps may cause instead the results indicate the potential benefits of disconnecting consumer pumps hydraulically or physically in locations where disconnections are at least marginally acceptable to consumers pumps are likely a larger problem in areas where disconnection would be unacceptable to consumers and a lesser problem where disconnection would go uncontested consumer acceptance of apvs declined when consumers noticed flow rate reductions immediately after apv installation acceptability would likely improve if apvs were integrated into water meters or backflow preventers and installed when making new service connections or replacing existing service connections given the acceptability efficacy tradeoff of pump disconnection utilities should continue to prioritize other system improvements such as removing contaminants near pipes and repairing leaks at our study site the utility should also prioritize improving the consistency of water treatment 4 limitations this study had several notable limitations first the acceptability of apvs was assessed anecdotally future studies should seek to formalize the response of consumers to varying changes in their flow rates and delivered volumes second iws are remarkably heterogeneous and generalizing across such heterogeneity is not possible with this study which compared two neighborhoods over 13 weeks third the likelihood of contaminant intrusion during the dry season in an affluent neighborhood was low limiting the potential of directly observing pump induced intrusion fourth our results depend on the assumption that the control and impact zones would respond equally to temporal changes yet differences between the zones were present most notably their sizes and the system varied substantially over time if the zones responded differently to these temporal variations these differences would be mistakenly attributed to apvs a longer multi site study would mitigate these concerns and better quantify the potential role of apvs in improving iws globally we used apvs to estimate pump effects but could only do so where apv installation was acceptable to consumers limiting our ability to study systems severely affected by pumps this limitation is an important qualifier of our results insofar as apv effects are used to infer the effects of suction sumps nevertheless our findings are of practical importance as they suggest the potential benefits of pump mitigation where such mitigation would be marginally acceptable to consumers 5 conclusions we conclude that at the study site hydraulically disconnecting suction pumps by installing anti pump valves had only modest effects on mean water quality especially when compared to variations in treated water quality casting doubt on the applicability of the public utility s claim that 90 of contamination could be traced to suction pumps the absence of a substantial association between overall water quality and pump mitigating valves at our study site suggests utilities researchers and policy makers should be more cautious when making generalized claims about the effects of consumer pumps some evidence was found to suggest that at least at the study site mitigating suction pumps reduces the prevalence of high turbidity generating phenomena such as contaminant intrusion or biofilm detachment observed turbidity levels were sometimes high enough to impede residual disinfection warranting further study further evidence was found suggesting that suction pump mitigating valves can increase water pressure especially during the beginning of the water supply window thereby reducing the risk of contaminant intrusion when most consumers are withdrawing water given the prevalence of suction pumps in intermittent water supplies and the regularity with which consumer pumps are assumed to cause water quality issues additional research is needed to further specify how and where pumps are most problematic as a utility improves the pressure and duration of its intermittent supply the influence of suction pumps is expected to decrease utilities should consider the tradeoffs between the efficacy and acceptability of disconnecting suction pumps hydraulically or physically other interventions such as improving treated water quality removing nearby contaminants and repairing leaks should remain urgent priorities upwards of 250 million people access water using suction pumps connected to intermittent water supplies suction pumps can worsen equity reduce pressure and increase the risk of contaminant intrusion at the study site anti pump valves mitigated these effects data availability all data supporting this study are available in an online

19953,fluoride f in groundwater gw in excess of 1 5 mg l is a globally distributed problem impacting the health of hundreds of millions of people many of whom cannot access centralized treatment infrastructure animal e g cow bone char has received emerging interest as a low cost f sorbent for use in decentralized household and community water treatment pilot column tests using full sized granular bone char particles can be used to assess treatment performance of fixed bed contactors but are costly time consuming and require large amounts of test water rapid small scale column tests rsscts can be used to simulate f uptake in bone char contactors if the relationship between f intraparticle diffusion kinetics and bone char particle size is known two common approaches to the rssct assume either constant cd or linear proportional pd sorbate diffusivity as a function of sorbent particle size this study used experimentally determined pseudo equilibrium and kinetic f sorption data in model groundwater as inputs to the homogeneous surface diffusion model hsdm to determine f intraparticle diffusion coefficients for different sized bone char particles and to fit rssct and pilot column breakthrough data to evaluate cd and pd approaches results of this study corroborated by incorporation of additional literature data indicate approximately linearly proportional diffusivity of f as a function of bone char particle size congruently the pd rssct approach provided a superior simulation of pilot column f breakthrough compared to the cd rssct pd rssct breakthrough data closely matched pilot breakthrough on a scaled service time basis up to around 500 bed volumes corresponding to a relative f breakthrough of about 40 and provided a slightly conservative indicator of f removal thereafter the pd rssct was compared with a hybrid modeling and empirical workflow using the hsdm with experimentally determined pseudo equilibrium and kinetic parameter inputs as time and cost saving approaches to evaluating full sized groundwater treatment system performance this comparison and a sensitivity analysis of hsdm input parameters used in the hybrid workflow indicated that greater precision can be obtained using the pd rssct graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bone char fluoride rapid small scale column test sorption groundwater introduction naturally

bones bone char as a low cost sorbent for removing excessive f from water has drawn considerable interest in recent years abe et al 2004 alkurdi et al 2019 brunson and sabatini 2014 j kearns et al

mayorga et al 2013 most studies have been conducted in batch format using crushed bone char for example bottle point isotherm tests only a few studies brunson and sabatini 2014 j kearns et al 2018 kennedy anthony and arias paic 2020 nigri et al 2017 have evaluated bone char sorbents in fixed bed column configuration although fixed bed contactors are a common configuration of groundwater treatment systems the dynamics of sorption differ between batch and column systems for example crushed sorbent is exposed to a declining aqueous concentration gradient of sorbate in batch contactors as equilibrium is approached whereas sorbent located in the mass transfer zone of a column contactor is exposed to an increasing aqueous sorbate concentration gradient noting these differences underscores the importance of column testing for deriving design and operational specifications of fixed bed contactors pilot column tests using granular sorbent with the same particle diameter dp bed depth l and empty bed contact time ebct as the full scale contactor provide the most accurate simulation of water treatment systems however pilot testing is costly in terms of money time and experimental resources e g the experimental duration and the volume of test water required to obtain a complete sorbate breakthrough profile the rapid small scale column test rssct method was developed to simulate full scale water contaminant removal in a fraction of the time and using a fraction of the experimental resources necessary for pilot testing it does so by employing the concept of similitude to scale the sorption process using dimensionless parameters developed from the dispersed flow pore and surface diffusion model psdm john c crittenden et al 1986 john c crittenden et al 1987 the rssct was originally developed to simulate organic compound removal by granular activated carbon gac but has been extended to other sorbates and sorbents such as arsenic and granular ferric hydroxide gfh badruzzaman et al 2004a westerhoff et al 2005 there are two common rssct design approximations proportional diffusivity pd and constant diffusivity cd the cd approach assumes that sorbate intraparticle diffusion kinetics does not depend on sorbent particle size whereas the pd approach assumes a linearly proportional dependence of sorbate intraparticle diffusion kinetics on sorbent particle size at this time there is no clearly superior approach for all situations summers et al 2014 to our knowledge only two studies have applied rssct methods for simulating f sorption by unmodified bone char brunson and sabatini 2014 brunson and sabatini 2014 used the cd rssct approach and found good agreement between f breakthrough curves from columns containing bone char granules of slightly different average particle sizes 0 64 mm log mean 0 54 mm and 0 30 mm log mean 0 29 mm kennedy and arias paic 2020 kennedy anthony and arias paic 2020 conducted cd and pd rssct experiments for comparison with pilot column results they found that the cd approach better approximated the shape of the pilot column breakthrough curve but substantially underestimated f sorption capacity while the pd approach provided an accurate simulation of early f breakthrough i e up to c c0 of around 20 but underpredicted f removal thereafter one objective of this study was to resolve the discrepancy of whether the cd or pd rssct approach can provide an accurate simulation of f sorption by bone char through column testing as well as kinetic tests to quantify the relationship between f intraparticle diffusivity and bone char particle size the second objective of this study was to evaluate a mass transfer modeling approach for predicting f removal in bone char columns if reliably accurate the use of model based methods to simulate different treatment system design and performance scenarios could provide additional savings of time and experimental resources sorption models are based on equilibrium parameters e g freundlich isotherm coefficients kf and 1 n as well as external and internal mass transfer coefficients describing film diffusion kf and pore dp and or surface ds intraparticle diffusion one model that has been used to describe sorption in fixed bed contactors is the homogeneous surface diffusion model hsdm for example arsenate sorption by gfh badruzzaman et al 2004a sperlich et al 2008 and organic micropollutant adsorption by gac or biochar joshua kearns et al 2020 piazzoli and antonelli 2018 surface diffusion might be an apt conceptualization of intraparticle transfer of arsenate which forms weak inner sphere complexes with sorption sites on the gfh surface and is hypothesized to hop from site to site as it diffuses through the pore network badruzzaman et al 2004a dale et al 2016 analogies between the arsenate gfh and f bone char systems include a hydrated anion sorbate forming weak inner sphere interactions with sorbent surface sites f sorption by bone char is believed to occur by electrostatic interaction and ion exchange and has been demonstrated to be reversible abe et al 2004 n a medellin castillo et al 2007 n a medellin castillo et al 2014 therefore a similar site hopping mechanism of surface diffusion could govern intraparticle mass transfer of f in bone char which suggests that the hsdm might accurately represent this system this study compared an empirical approach to simulating f removal from groundwater by full scale bone char contactors using rsscts and pilot column testing with a hybrid approach that used the hsdm with experimentally determined equilibrium and kinetic parameters as model inputs a sensitivity analysis was performed on the individual hsdm input parameters to inform the practicality and precision of the hybrid approach the fixed bed adsorption simulation tool fast 2 1 schimmelpfennig and sperlich 2011 was used as a convenient freeware user interface for solving hsdm calculations the motivation for this research is to provide water treatment practitioners with a simplified economical workflow for conducting fixed bed bone char contactor design and operational scenarios materials

was quantified after 14 days preliminary batch tests conducted for 18 days and 21 days showed no significant additional f uptake therefore 14 days was considered sufficient contact time for attaining pseudo equilibrium conditions suspensions were filtered using 0 45 μm whatman nylon syringe filters and f was quantified in the filtrate using a portable hach colorimeter dr850 following the spadns 2 reagent method kinetic testing to determine f sorption kinetics of the different sized bone char particles the same f test solution used in bottle point isotherm tests was circulated through a

degassed under vacuum to remove air bubbles 1 3 days in deionized water prior to loading into columns bone char was packed in columns using glass beads and glass wool to contain the sorbent in the column and ensure a fully developed flow field bone char was packed by volume based on bed density 660 kg m3 reported previously j kearns et al 2018 results and discussion comparison of cd and pd rssct for pilot column simulation fig 1 shows f breakthrough data for the pilot column cd and pd rssct experiments strong correspondence was observed between f removal in the pd rssct and pilot columns from the onset of breakthrough until around 500 bed volumes bv corresponding to f relative breakthrough i e c c0 of around 40 thereafter f breakthrough from the pd rssct traced a steeper pattern than the pilot column in contrast f removal by the cd rssct traced a flatter pattern with an earlier onset of breakthrough compared with the pd rssct and pilot column the cd rssct simulated the effective f uptake capacity of the pilot column i e the number of bv to a relative f breakthrough of 50 well but overestimated f removal at longer service times the cd rssct reached the who drinking water guideline value of 1 5 mg l f in the column effluent with a bed lifecycle of around 370 bv whereas the pd rssct and pilot columns reached this level with a bed lifecycle of around 450 bv these results are comparable to the experiments of kennedy and coworkers kennedy anthony and arias paic 2020 for a 30 minute ebct 450 bv corresponds to a service time of around 9 5 days the results of this study corroborated by the work of kennedy et al 2020 kennedy anthony and arias paic 2020 indicate that the pd rssct can provide an accurate simulation of fixed bed bone char contactors when high to moderate levels of f removal i e for relative removals of greater than 60 to 70 of f in the influent are required if the treatment objective is to keep f levels below the who guideline value of 1 5 mg l based on observations in this study the pd rssct is expected to provide an accurate simulation for treating waters with f concentrations of around 4 mg l or greater for treating waters with f concentrations below 4 mg l the pd rssct can provide a conservative estimate of bone char contactor performance in order to further examine the robustness of the rssct approach and interrogate the hypothesis of non constant diffusivity equilibrium and kinetic parameters were measured experimentally and inputted into the hsdm to obtain model fits to rssct and pilot column f breakthrough data as discussed in the following sections bottle point isotherm tests fig 2 displays f uptake in bottle point isotherm tests using bone char samples with dp values of 1 29 0 196 and 0 108 mm corresponding to particle sizes used in pilot column and rssct experiments respectively the freundlich isotherm model eq 2 was used to fit pseudo equilibrium adsorption data and obtain freundlich parameters kf 1 n the freundlich model was selected for two reasons one the freundlich model provided slightly better fits to isotherm data than the langmuir model freundlich r2 values ranged from 0 94 to 0 99 whereas langmuir r2 values ranged from 0 92 to 0 98 second this study made extensive use of sorption data from other studies to validate our approach discussed in later sections and freundlich isotherm values are the most commonly reported the smallest bone char particle size showed slightly higher f sorption capacity as indicated by comparing the respective freundlich capacity terms i e kf values the values associated with freundlich parameters shown in fig 2 represent 95 confidence intervals based on fits of the freundlich model to batch test data 2 q e k f c e 1 n in eq 2

using unmodified cow bone char generated at around 600 c reported freundlich parameters typically range from kf 1 8 to 3 2 mg g l mg 1 n and 1 n values range from 0 28 to 0 43 brunson and sabatini 2014 leyva ramos et al 2010 n a medellin castillo et al 2007 n a medellin castillo et al 2014 nigri et al 2017 rojas mayorga et al 2013 this study similar to work by leyva ramos et al 2010 leyva ramos et al 2010 found f sorption capacity to increase modestly with decreasing bone char particle size kinetic tests pseudo equilibrium f sorption parameters determined from bottle point isotherm tests were used as guides for fitting f sorption kinetics data obtained from dcbr experiments with different sized bone char particles fig 3 the fast 2 1 software interface schimmelpfennig and sperlich 2011 was used to iteratively solve the hsdm while adjusting inputs kf 1 n ds in order to obtain good visual model fits to dcbr data due to the high hydraulic loading rate used in dcbr tests 83 m hr it was assumed that f concentration at the outer particle surface was approximately equal to its concentration in the bulk liquid thereby minimizing film mass transfer resistance hand et al 1983 accordingly the kf term was omitted from hsdm fits to dcbr data in the case of dp 0 108 mm it was necessary to reduce kf to 3 00 mg g l mg 1 n which is below the 95 confidence interval range obtained from bottle point isotherm tests 3 55 0 12 mg g l mg 1 n to obtain a good visual fit of f kinetic data in the cases of dp 1 29 and 0 196 mm the kf values used to fit kinetic data fell within the 95 confidence interval ranges obtained from bottle point isotherm tests for all particle sizes 1 n values used to fit kinetic data fell within the 95 confidence interval range obtained from bottle point isotherm test ds values obtained from hsdm fitting of dcbr data were 1 5 10 13 m2 sec for dp 1 29 mm 2 5 10 14 m2 sec for dp 0 196 mm and 1 0 10 14 m2 sec for dp 0 108 mm indicative of non constant diffusivity the bone char particle scaling factor i e dp pilot dp rssct was 11 9 while the ratio of the largest and smallest ds values obtained from model fits was 15 suggesting approximately linear proportional diffusivity hsdm fitting to column data pseudo equilibrium kf 1 n and kinetic ds parameters obtained from bottle point and dcbr experiments were used as guides for hsdm inputs to obtain model fits to pd rssct and pilot column f breakthrough data fig 4 displays f breakthrough data hsdm model fits and the pseudo equilibrium and kinetic parameter inputs used to obtain the fits in order to obtain a good visual model fit to rssct breakthrough data it was necessary to tune kf and 1 n inputs slightly compared with values obtained from bottle point and dcbr tests a good visual fit to pilot column breakthrough data was obtained using kf and 1 n inputs consistent with those obtained from bottle point and dcbr tests ds values obtained from fitting dcbr data for the three particle sizes were used unchanged as inputs to the hsdm in fitting column breakthrough data this lends further support to the hypothesis of non constant diffusivity in fixed bed bone char contactors however to obtain better visual fits to breakthrough data particularly for the early portion of f breakthrough it was necessary to invoke increased film mass transfer resistance this was accomplished by decreasing the film mass transfer coefficients kf model inputs relative to the calculated values listed in table 1 to further evaluate the robustness of these observations literature data were obtained from column studies that used different sized bone char particles brunson and sabatini 2014 brunson and sabatini 2014 conducted bottle point isotherm and column tests using bone char with particle sizes approximately 0 54 mm and 0 29 mm good visual fits of the hsdm to their column data were obtained using freundlich parameters near or within range of their batch test data and ds values falling between those used to fit column data in the present study fig 5 panels a and b similar to this study it was necessary to invoke additional film mass transfer resistance by lowering kf model inputs below calculated values to obtain good visual fits to the early portion of f breakthrough curves f breakthrough data were also obtained from pilot dp 0 92 mm and pd rssct dp 0 108 mm column experiments performed by kennedy and arias paic 2020 kennedy anthony and arias paic 2020 bottle point isotherm data are not available for their bone char and groundwater however visual fits of the hsdm to their column data were obtained by inputting interpolated ds values as guides and adjusting them along with freundlich parameters fig 5 panels c and d once again for obtaining good visual fits to early breakthrough it was necessary to invoke additional film mass transfer resistance via reduced kf inputs it is not surprising that film mass transfer resistance played a small but noticeable role in the shape of f breakthrough data observed in this study and those of kennedy and arias paic 2020 and brunson and sabatini 2014 the biot number expresses the relative contributions of external i e film and internal mass transfer resistance by convention film mass transfer resistance can be considered negligible for biot numbers greater than 30 hand david et al 1984 although other researchers consider film mass transport to be important at biot numbers up to 100 traegner and suidan 1989 the biot numbers for pilot and pd rssct columns in this study were 25 and were 31 and 29 for pilot and pd rssct column experiments respectively conducted by kennedy and aria paic 2020 biot numbers for the column tests carried out by brunson and sabatini 2014 were 16 dp 0 54 mm and 21 dp 0 29 mm in their study of arsenate sorption by gfh particles of different sizes and biot numbers ranging from 19 to 190 badruzzaman et al 2004 badruzzaman et al 2004a also found it necessary to invoke additional film mass transfer resistance by reducing kf values used in hsdm model fits by around one order of magnitude and noted that this phenomenon had also been observed for organic compound adsorption by gac additional ds values for f sorption by bone char were obtained by fitting the hsdm to kinetic data extracted from the literature nigri et al 2017 nigri et al 2017 obtained f sorption kinetic data by analyzing water samples from agitated batch reactors containing bone char particles with average diameter of 1 32 mm at prescribed time intervals ranging from approximately one to 96 h leyva ramos et al 2010 leyva ramos et al 2010 used a rotating basket apparatus reactor to obtain f sorption kinetics data for bone char at two particle sizes 1 29 mm and 0 79 mm freundlich parameters obtained from bottle point isotherm data as reported by nigri et al 2017 and leyva ramos et al 2010 were used as inputs to the hsdm obtaining good visual fits of the model to sorption kinetics data by modulating ds inputs fig 6 panels a c ds values obtained using these literature datasets ranged from 2 0 10 13 m2 s to 3 3 10 13 m2 s these values are similar but slightly larger than ds values obtained in the present study 1 5 10 13 m2 s and by kennedy and arias paic 2020 0 9 10 13 m2 s for bone char particles that are around 1 mm in diameter fig 7 displays ds values obtained by fitting the hsdm to kinetic and column experiment data collected in the present study and from the literature brunson and sabatini 2014 kennedy anthony and arias paic 2020 leyva ramos et al 2010 nigri et al 2017 as a function of bone char particle size dp the relationship between intraparticle diffusivity and particle size is suggested to be somewhat greater than linear proportionality as indicated by the slope factor of 1 2 shown in the power law regression fit to the data the 95 confidence intervals of the power law fit to the data are shown in parenthesis note that this interval encompasses a slope factor of 1 0 additional kinetic experiments with a wider range of bone char particles are recommended to increase the precision of this relationship for example to determine possible linear proportional diffusivity however the data in fig 7 do provide robust support for non constant approximately linear proportional diffusivity of intraparticle mass transport of f in bone char sorbents for the arsenate gfh system badruzzaman et al 2004 badruzzaman et al 2004a observed an analogous nonlinear slope factor 1 4 proportional diffusivity hsdm input parameter sensitivity analysis for practitioners who design and operate water treatment systems using bone char to remove excess fluoride it is helpful to have an understanding of the merits and limitations of conducting modeling scenarios using the hsdm the sensitivity of the hsdm output i e predicted f breakthrough curves to equilibrium and kinetic input parameters can underscore important limitations on the reliance on modeling over empirical approaches to predicting and assessing fixed bed bone char contactor performance as an illustrative exercise consider a hypothetical contactor using granular bone char with an average particle diameter of 1 mm used to treat water containing 8 mg l f at a 15 minute ebct with the objective to produce water below the who guideline value of 1 5 mg l f a base case and ranges of equilibrium kf 1 n and kinetic kf ds parameter inputs to the hsdm were selected from consideration of the experimental values obtained in this study and from the literature to reflect typical expected values the base case inputs with outer ranges shown in parenthesis were as follows ds 1 2 10 13 m2 s 0 7 10 13 to 3 0 10 13 m2 s kf 5 0 10 6 m2 s 2 0 10 6 to 20 10 6 m2 s kf 3 0 mg g l mg 1 n 2 0 to 4 0 mg g l mg 1 n 1 n 0 4 0 3 to 0 5 fig 8 displays base case and outer range hsdm predicted f breakthrough curves for the hypothetical bone char contactor equilibrium and kinetic model inputs were varied individually to obtain predicted f breakthrough scenarios bed lifecycle defined as the predicted number of bed volumes treated until the effluent f concentration reached 1 5 mg l bv1 5 is used for comparing the different modeling scenarios in the base case scenario the bv1 5 is 337 bv bv1 5 values for outer range model inputs varied from 251 to 441 bv for ds 304 to 349 bv for kf 182 to 585 bv for kf and 268 to 415 bv for 1 n thus under these modeling scenarios hsdm output sensitivity defined as the breadth of predicted bv1 5 values between outer range inputs increased in the order kf 1 n ds kf a treatment objective of 1 5 mg l for a source water containing 8 mg l f represents a relative c c0 breakthrough of just under 20 it is important to note that the hsdm output sensitivity to the different inputs can vary for lower or higher levels of relative f breakthrough the change in model sensitivity to kf input is low across a wide range of f c c0 values which is expected since kf represents effective sorption capacity and its modulation mainly shifts predicted breakthrough curves left or right model sensitivity to kf is the highest of the four parameters under nearly all scenarios however underscoring the importance of experimental accuracy and precision necessary for using this parameter as a model input model sensitivity to ds follows a decreasing trend but remains significant up to f c c0 60 whereas sensitivity to kf is significant only at f c c0 values below 20 model sensitivity to 1 n is significant and varies modestly across much of the range of likely c c0 values these observations are expected as ds kf and 1 n affect f sorption kinetics and therefore breakthrough curve shape workflow recommendations for fixed bed bone char contactor design studies have demonstrated that bone char preparation conditions including animal species of bone bone pretreatment prior to pyrolysis pyrolysis conditions and post pyrolysis bone char treatment e g exposure to acid s can exert profound effects on f uptake capacity alkurdi et al 2019 brunson and sabatini 2009 chatterjee et al 2018 kawasaki et al 2009 nahum andres medellin castillo et al 2016 rojas mayorga et al 2013 likewise background water characteristics such as ph and the presence of dom and or competing sorbates also influences f sorption capacity brunson and sabatini 2014 n a medellin castillo et al 2007 n a medellin castillo et al 2014 therefore experiments to quantify f sorption using the specific bone char and source water combination of interest should be used to obtain treatment system design inputs representative experimental water sample s should be obtained to match source water background characteristics as well as expected f levels one approach to obtaining treatment system design specifications would be to conduct pseudo equilibrium and kinetic tests of f uptake using the bone char and water combination of interest these experiments would provide input parameters kf 1 n kf ds to the hsdm for generating predicted breakthrough curves used to design and operate treatment units a second approach would be to conduct a pd rssct experiment using the bone char and water combination of interest and use the results directly as a guide to treatment system design and operation specifications comparison of fig 1 and fig 8 suggests that the latter approach is more reliable for predicting treatment system performance with precision conclusions this study compared cd and pd rssct methods for simulating f removal from model groundwater in granular bone char pilot columns f removal by the pd rssct closely matched pilot breakthrough on a scaled service time basis up to around 500 bv corresponding to a relative breakthrough c c0 of around 40 and provided a slightly

experiments kf and 1 n values measured in this study ranged from approximately 3 0 to 3 6 mg g l mg 1 n and 0 36 to 0 46 respectively and compared well with other studies of f uptake by unmodified cow bone char generated at around 600 c bone char intraparticle surface diffusion coefficients ds values were obtained from hsdm fits to dcbr data for bone char particle sizes ranging from 0 108 to 1 29

additional pseudo equilibrium and kinetic data provided corroborating evidence of near linearly proportional diffusivity as a function of bone char particle size obtaining the best visual fits of the hsdm to pd rssct and pilot column breakthrough data using measured kf 1 n and ds values required the invocation of film mass transfer resistance exceeding values calculated by the common gnielinski method for borderline biot numbers of around 30 this effect is most consequential for treatment objectives that fall within early breakthrough c c0 20 a sensitivity analysis of hsdm inputs revealed increasing sensitivity in the order kf 1 n ds kf for a given water bone char combination the number of bv that could be treated to an effluent f concentration of 1 5 mg l varied substantially over the ranges of values that are typical for 1 n ds and kf and even over the ranges of precision with which these parameters can be determined experimentally accordingly it is preferable to use pd rssct

19953,fluoride f in groundwater gw in excess of 1 5 mg l is a globally distributed problem impacting the health of hundreds of millions of people many of whom cannot access centralized treatment infrastructure animal e g cow bone char has received emerging interest as a low cost f sorbent for use in decentralized household and community water treatment pilot column tests using full sized granular bone char particles can be used to assess treatment performance of fixed bed contactors but are costly time consuming and require large amounts of test water rapid small scale column tests rsscts can be used to simulate f uptake in bone char contactors if the relationship between f intraparticle diffusion kinetics and bone char particle size is known two common approaches to the rssct assume either constant cd or linear proportional pd sorbate diffusivity as a function of sorbent particle size this study used experimentally determined pseudo equilibrium and kinetic f sorption data in model groundwater as inputs to the homogeneous surface diffusion model hsdm to determine f intraparticle diffusion coefficients for different sized bone char particles and to fit rssct and pilot column breakthrough data to evaluate cd and pd approaches results of this study corroborated by incorporation of additional literature data indicate approximately linearly proportional diffusivity of f as a function of bone char particle size congruently the pd rssct approach provided a superior simulation of pilot column f breakthrough compared to the cd rssct pd rssct breakthrough data closely matched pilot breakthrough on a scaled service time basis up to around 500 bed volumes corresponding to a relative f breakthrough of about 40 and provided a slightly conservative indicator of f removal thereafter the pd rssct was compared with a hybrid modeling and empirical workflow using the hsdm with experimentally determined pseudo equilibrium and kinetic parameter inputs as time and cost saving approaches to evaluating full sized groundwater treatment system performance this comparison and a sensitivity analysis of hsdm input parameters used in the hybrid workflow indicated that greater precision can be obtained using the pd rssct graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bone char fluoride rapid small scale column test sorption groundwater introduction naturally

mayorga et al 2013 most studies have been conducted in batch format using crushed bone char for example bottle point isotherm tests only a few studies brunson and sabatini 2014 j kearns et al 2018 kennedy anthony and arias paic 2020 nigri et al 2017 have evaluated bone char sorbents in fixed bed column configuration although fixed bed contactors are a common configuration of groundwater treatment systems the dynamics of sorption differ between batch and column systems for example crushed sorbent is exposed to a declining aqueous concentration gradient of sorbate in batch contactors as equilibrium is approached whereas sorbent located in the mass transfer zone of a column contactor is exposed to an increasing aqueous sorbate concentration gradient noting these differences underscores the importance of column testing for deriving design and operational specifications of fixed bed contactors pilot column tests using granular sorbent with the same particle diameter dp bed depth l and empty bed contact time ebct as the full scale contactor provide the most accurate simulation of water treatment systems however pilot testing is costly in terms of money time and experimental resources e g the experimental duration and the volume of test water required to obtain a complete sorbate breakthrough profile the rapid small scale column test rssct method was developed to simulate full scale water contaminant removal in a fraction of the time and using a fraction of the experimental resources necessary for pilot testing it does so by employing the concept of similitude to scale the sorption process using dimensionless parameters developed from the dispersed flow pore and surface diffusion model psdm john c crittenden et al 1986 john c crittenden et al 1987 the rssct was originally developed to simulate organic compound removal by granular activated carbon gac but has been extended to other sorbates and sorbents such as arsenic and granular ferric hydroxide gfh badruzzaman et al 2004a westerhoff et al 2005 there are two common rssct design approximations proportional diffusivity pd and constant diffusivity cd the cd approach assumes that sorbate intraparticle diffusion kinetics does not depend on sorbent particle size whereas the pd approach assumes a linearly proportional dependence of sorbate intraparticle diffusion kinetics on sorbent particle size at this time there is no clearly superior approach for all situations summers et al 2014 to our knowledge only two studies have applied rssct methods for simulating f sorption by unmodified bone char brunson and sabatini 2014 brunson and sabatini 2014 used the cd rssct approach and found good agreement between f breakthrough curves from columns containing bone char granules of slightly different average particle sizes 0 64 mm log mean 0 54 mm and 0 30 mm log mean 0 29 mm kennedy and arias paic 2020 kennedy anthony and arias paic 2020 conducted cd and pd rssct experiments for comparison with pilot column results they found that the cd approach better approximated the shape of the pilot column breakthrough curve but substantially underestimated f sorption capacity while the pd approach provided an accurate simulation of early f breakthrough i e up to c c0 of around 20 but underpredicted f removal thereafter one objective of this study was to resolve the discrepancy of whether the cd or pd rssct approach can provide an accurate simulation of f sorption by bone char through column testing as well as kinetic tests to quantify the relationship between f intraparticle diffusivity and bone char particle size the second objective of this study was to evaluate a mass transfer modeling approach for predicting f removal in bone char columns if reliably accurate the use of model based methods to simulate different treatment system design and performance scenarios could provide additional savings of time and experimental resources sorption models are based on equilibrium parameters e g freundlich isotherm coefficients kf and 1 n as well as external and internal mass transfer coefficients describing film diffusion kf and pore dp and or surface ds intraparticle diffusion one model that has been used to describe sorption in fixed bed contactors is the homogeneous surface diffusion model hsdm for example arsenate sorption by gfh badruzzaman et al 2004a sperlich et al 2008 and organic micropollutant adsorption by gac or biochar joshua kearns et al 2020 piazzoli and antonelli 2018 surface diffusion might be an apt conceptualization of intraparticle transfer of arsenate which forms weak inner sphere complexes with sorption sites on the gfh surface and is hypothesized to hop from site to site as it diffuses through the pore network badruzzaman et al 2004a dale et al 2016 analogies between the arsenate gfh and f bone char systems include a hydrated anion sorbate forming weak inner sphere interactions with sorbent surface sites f sorption by bone char is believed to occur by electrostatic interaction and ion exchange and has been demonstrated to be reversible abe et al 2004 n a medellin castillo et al 2007 n a medellin castillo et al 2014 therefore a similar site hopping mechanism of surface diffusion could govern intraparticle mass transfer of f in bone char which suggests that the hsdm might accurately represent this system this study compared an empirical approach to simulating f removal from groundwater by full scale bone char contactors using rsscts and pilot column testing with a hybrid approach that used the hsdm with experimentally determined equilibrium and kinetic parameters as model inputs a sensitivity analysis was performed on the individual hsdm input parameters to inform the practicality and precision of the hybrid approach the fixed bed adsorption simulation tool fast 2 1 schimmelpfennig and sperlich 2011 was used as a convenient freeware user interface for solving hsdm calculations the

was quantified after 14 days preliminary batch tests conducted for 18 days and 21 days showed no significant additional f uptake therefore 14 days was considered sufficient contact time for attaining pseudo equilibrium conditions suspensions were filtered using 0 45 μm whatman nylon syringe filters and f was quantified in the filtrate using a portable hach colorimeter dr850 following the spadns 2

rssct for pilot column simulation fig 1 shows f breakthrough data for the pilot column cd and pd rssct experiments strong correspondence was observed between f removal in the pd rssct and pilot columns from the onset of breakthrough until around 500 bed volumes bv corresponding to f relative breakthrough i e c c0 of around 40 thereafter f breakthrough from the pd rssct traced a steeper pattern than the pilot column in contrast f removal by the cd rssct traced a flatter pattern with an earlier onset of breakthrough compared with the pd rssct and pilot column the cd rssct simulated the effective f uptake capacity of the pilot column i e the number of bv to a relative f breakthrough of 50 well but overestimated f removal at longer service times the cd rssct reached the who drinking water guideline value of 1 5 mg l f in the column effluent with a bed lifecycle of around 370 bv whereas the pd rssct and pilot columns reached this level with a bed lifecycle of around 450 bv these results are comparable to the experiments of kennedy and coworkers kennedy anthony and arias paic 2020 for a 30 minute ebct 450 bv corresponds to a service time of around 9 5 days the results of this study corroborated by the work of kennedy et al 2020 kennedy anthony and arias paic 2020 indicate that the pd rssct can provide an accurate simulation of fixed bed bone char contactors when high to moderate levels of f removal i e for relative removals of greater than 60 to 70 of f in the influent are required if the treatment objective is to keep f levels below the who guideline value of 1 5 mg l based on observations in this study the pd rssct is expected to provide an accurate simulation for treating waters with f concentrations of around 4 mg l or greater for treating waters with f concentrations below 4 mg l the pd rssct can provide a conservative estimate of bone char contactor performance in order to further examine the robustness of the rssct approach and interrogate the hypothesis of non constant diffusivity equilibrium and kinetic parameters were measured experimentally and inputted into the hsdm to obtain model fits to rssct and pilot column f breakthrough data as discussed in the following sections bottle point isotherm tests fig 2 displays f uptake in bottle point isotherm tests using bone char samples with dp values of 1 29 0 196 and 0 108 mm corresponding to particle sizes used in pilot column and rssct experiments respectively the freundlich isotherm model eq 2 was used to fit pseudo equilibrium adsorption data and obtain freundlich parameters kf 1 n the freundlich model was selected for two reasons one the freundlich model provided slightly better fits to isotherm data than the langmuir model freundlich r2 values ranged from 0 94 to 0 99 whereas langmuir r2 values ranged from 0 92 to 0 98 second this study made extensive use of sorption data from other studies to validate our approach discussed in later sections and freundlich isotherm values are the most commonly reported the smallest bone char particle size showed slightly higher f sorption capacity as indicated by comparing the respective freundlich capacity

et al 2010 found f sorption capacity to increase modestly with decreasing bone char particle size kinetic tests pseudo equilibrium f sorption parameters determined from bottle point isotherm tests were used as guides for fitting f sorption kinetics data obtained from dcbr experiments with different sized bone char particles fig 3 the fast 2 1 software interface schimmelpfennig and sperlich 2011 was used to iteratively solve the hsdm while adjusting inputs kf 1 n ds in order to obtain good visual model fits to dcbr data due to the high hydraulic loading rate used in dcbr tests 83 m hr it was assumed that f concentration at the outer particle surface was approximately equal to its concentration in the bulk liquid thereby minimizing film mass transfer resistance hand et al 1983 accordingly the kf term was omitted from hsdm fits to dcbr data in the case of dp 0 108 mm it was necessary to reduce kf to 3 00 mg g l mg 1 n which is below the 95 confidence interval range obtained from bottle point isotherm tests 3 55 0 12 mg g l mg 1 n to obtain a good visual fit of f kinetic data in the cases of dp 1 29 and 0 196 mm the kf values used to fit kinetic data fell within the 95 confidence interval ranges obtained from bottle point isotherm tests for all particle sizes 1 n values used to fit kinetic data fell within the 95 confidence interval range obtained from bottle point isotherm test ds values obtained from hsdm fitting of dcbr data were 1 5 10 13 m2 sec for dp 1 29 mm 2 5 10 14 m2 sec for dp 0 196 mm and 1 0 10 14 m2 sec for dp 0 108 mm indicative of non constant diffusivity the bone char particle scaling factor i e dp pilot dp rssct was 11 9 while the ratio of the largest and smallest ds values obtained from model fits was 15 suggesting approximately linear proportional diffusivity hsdm fitting to column data pseudo equilibrium kf 1 n and kinetic ds parameters obtained from bottle point and dcbr experiments were used as guides for hsdm inputs to obtain model fits to pd rssct and pilot column f breakthrough data fig 4 displays f breakthrough data hsdm model fits and the pseudo equilibrium and kinetic parameter inputs used to obtain the fits in order to obtain a good visual model fit to rssct breakthrough data it was necessary to tune kf and 1 n inputs slightly compared with values obtained from bottle point and dcbr tests a good visual fit to pilot column breakthrough data was obtained using kf and 1 n inputs consistent with those obtained from bottle point and dcbr tests ds values obtained from fitting dcbr data for the three particle sizes were used unchanged as inputs to the hsdm in fitting column breakthrough data this lends further support to the hypothesis of non constant diffusivity in fixed bed bone char contactors however to obtain better visual fits to breakthrough data particularly for the early portion of f breakthrough it was necessary to invoke increased film mass transfer resistance this was accomplished by decreasing the film mass transfer coefficients kf model inputs relative to the calculated values listed in table 1 to further evaluate the robustness of these observations literature data were obtained from column studies that used different sized bone char particles brunson and sabatini 2014 brunson and sabatini 2014 conducted bottle point isotherm and column tests using bone char with particle sizes approximately 0 54 mm and 0 29 mm good visual fits of the hsdm to their column data were obtained using freundlich parameters near or within range of their batch test data and ds values falling between those used to fit column data in the present study fig 5 panels a and b similar to this study it was necessary to invoke additional film mass transfer resistance by lowering kf model inputs below calculated values to obtain good visual fits to the early portion of f breakthrough curves f breakthrough data were also obtained from pilot dp 0 92 mm and pd rssct dp 0 108 mm column experiments performed by kennedy and arias paic 2020 kennedy anthony and arias paic 2020 bottle point isotherm data are not available for their bone char and groundwater however visual fits of the hsdm to their column data were obtained by inputting interpolated ds values as guides and adjusting them along with freundlich parameters fig 5 panels c and d once again for obtaining good visual fits to early breakthrough it was necessary to invoke additional film mass transfer resistance via reduced kf inputs it is not surprising that film mass transfer resistance played a small but noticeable role in the shape of f breakthrough data observed in this study and those of kennedy and arias paic 2020 and brunson and sabatini 2014 the biot number expresses the relative contributions of external i e film and internal mass transfer resistance by convention film mass transfer resistance can be considered negligible for biot numbers greater than 30 hand david et al 1984 although other researchers consider film mass transport to be important at biot numbers up to 100 traegner and suidan 1989 the biot numbers for pilot and pd rssct columns in this study were 25 and were 31 and 29 for pilot and pd rssct column experiments respectively conducted by kennedy and aria paic 2020 biot numbers for the column tests carried out by brunson and sabatini 2014 were 16 dp 0 54 mm and 21 dp 0 29 mm in their study of arsenate sorption by gfh particles of different sizes and biot numbers ranging from 19 to 190 badruzzaman et al 2004 badruzzaman et al 2004a also found it necessary to invoke additional film mass transfer resistance by reducing kf values used in hsdm model fits by around one order of magnitude and noted that this phenomenon had also been observed for organic compound adsorption by gac additional ds values for f sorption by bone char were obtained by fitting the hsdm to kinetic data extracted from the literature nigri et al 2017 nigri et al 2017 obtained f sorption kinetic data by analyzing water samples from agitated batch reactors containing bone char particles with average diameter of 1 32 mm at prescribed time intervals ranging from approximately one to 96 h leyva ramos et al 2010 leyva ramos et al 2010 used a rotating basket apparatus reactor to obtain f sorption kinetics data for bone char at two particle sizes 1 29 mm and 0 79 mm freundlich parameters obtained from bottle point isotherm data as reported by nigri et al 2017 and leyva ramos et al 2010 were used as inputs to the hsdm obtaining good visual fits of the model to sorption kinetics data by modulating ds inputs fig 6 panels a c ds values obtained using these literature datasets ranged from 2 0 10 13 m2 s to 3 3 10 13 m2 s these values are similar but slightly larger than ds values obtained in the present study 1 5 10 13 m2 s and by kennedy and arias paic 2020 0 9 10 13 m2 s for bone char particles that are around 1 mm in diameter fig 7 displays ds values obtained by fitting the

as a function of bone char particle size dp the relationship between intraparticle diffusivity and particle size is suggested to be somewhat greater than linear proportionality as indicated by the slope factor of 1 2 shown in the power law regression fit to the data the 95 confidence intervals of the power law fit to the data are shown in parenthesis note that this interval encompasses a slope factor of 1 0 additional kinetic experiments with a wider range of bone char particles are recommended to increase the precision of this relationship for example to determine possible linear proportional diffusivity however the data in fig 7 do provide robust support for non constant approximately linear proportional diffusivity of intraparticle mass transport of f in bone char sorbents for the arsenate gfh system badruzzaman et al 2004 badruzzaman et al 2004a observed an analogous nonlinear slope factor 1 4 proportional diffusivity hsdm input parameter sensitivity analysis for practitioners who design and operate water treatment systems using bone char to remove excess fluoride it is helpful to have an understanding of the merits and limitations of conducting modeling scenarios using the hsdm the sensitivity of the hsdm output i e predicted f breakthrough curves to equilibrium and kinetic input parameters can underscore important limitations on the reliance on modeling over empirical approaches to predicting and assessing fixed bed bone char contactor performance as an illustrative exercise consider a hypothetical contactor using granular bone char with an average particle diameter of 1 mm used to treat water containing 8 mg l f at a 15 minute ebct with the objective to produce water below the who guideline value of 1 5 mg l f a base case and ranges of equilibrium kf 1 n and kinetic kf ds parameter inputs to the hsdm were selected from consideration of the experimental values obtained in this study and from the literature to reflect typical expected values the base case inputs with outer ranges shown in parenthesis were as follows ds 1 2 10 13 m2 s 0 7 10 13 to 3 0 10 13 m2 s kf 5 0 10 6 m2 s 2 0 10 6 to 20 10 6 m2 s kf 3 0 mg g l mg 1 n 2 0 to 4 0 mg g l mg 1 n 1 n 0 4 0 3 to 0 5 fig 8 displays base case and outer range hsdm predicted f breakthrough curves for the hypothetical bone char contactor equilibrium and kinetic model inputs were varied individually to obtain predicted f breakthrough scenarios bed lifecycle defined as the predicted number of bed volumes treated until the effluent f concentration reached 1 5 mg l bv1 5 is used for comparing the different modeling scenarios in the base case scenario the bv1 5 is 337 bv bv1 5 values for outer range model inputs varied from 251 to 441 bv for ds 304 to 349 bv for kf 182 to 585 bv for kf and 268 to 415 bv for 1 n thus under these modeling scenarios hsdm output sensitivity defined as the breadth of predicted bv1 5 values between outer range inputs increased in the order kf 1 n ds kf a treatment objective of 1 5 mg l for a source water containing 8 mg l f represents a relative c c0 breakthrough of just under 20 it is important to note that the hsdm output sensitivity to the different inputs can vary for lower or higher levels of relative f breakthrough the change in model sensitivity to kf input is low across a wide range of f c c0 values which is expected since kf represents effective sorption capacity and its modulation mainly shifts predicted breakthrough curves left or right model sensitivity to kf is the highest of the four parameters under nearly all scenarios however underscoring the importance of experimental accuracy and precision necessary for using this parameter as a model input model sensitivity to ds follows a decreasing trend but remains significant up to f c c0 60 whereas sensitivity to kf is significant only at f c c0 values below 20 model sensitivity to 1 n is significant and varies modestly across much of the range of likely c c0 values these observations are expected as ds kf and 1 n affect f sorption kinetics and therefore breakthrough curve shape workflow recommendations for fixed bed bone char contactor design studies have demonstrated that bone char preparation conditions including animal species of bone bone pretreatment prior to pyrolysis pyrolysis conditions and post pyrolysis bone char treatment e g exposure to acid s can exert profound effects on f uptake capacity alkurdi et al 2019 brunson and sabatini 2009 chatterjee et al 2018 kawasaki et al 2009 nahum andres medellin castillo et al 2016 rojas mayorga et al 2013 likewise background water characteristics such as ph and the presence of dom and or competing sorbates also influences f sorption capacity brunson and sabatini 2014 n a medellin castillo et al 2007 n a medellin castillo et al 2014 therefore experiments to quantify f sorption using the specific bone char and source water combination of interest should be used to obtain treatment system design inputs representative experimental water sample s should be obtained to match source water background characteristics as well as expected f levels one approach to obtaining treatment system design specifications would be to conduct pseudo equilibrium and kinetic tests of f uptake using the bone char and water combination of interest these experiments would provide input parameters kf 1 n kf ds to the hsdm for generating predicted breakthrough curves used to design and operate treatment units a second approach would be to conduct a pd rssct experiment using the bone char and water combination of interest and use the results directly as a guide to treatment system design and operation specifications comparison of fig 1 and fig 8 suggests that the latter approach is more reliable for predicting treatment system performance with precision conclusions this study compared cd and pd rssct methods for simulating f removal from model groundwater in granular bone char pilot columns f removal by the pd rssct closely matched pilot breakthrough on a scaled service time basis up to around 500 bv corresponding to a relative breakthrough c c0 of around 40 and provided a slightly conservative indicator of f removal thereafter the cd rssct closely matched the effective f sorption capacity of the pilot column i e the number of bv at 50 breakthrough but did not capture f sorption kinetics tracing a flatter breakthrough profile than the pilot column pseudo equilibrium freundlich kf 1 n and kinetics kf ds parameters describing f sorption by bone char were obtained from batch experiments kf and 1 n values measured in this study ranged from approximately 3 0 to 3 6 mg g l mg 1 n and 0 36 to 0 46 respectively and compared well with other studies of f uptake by unmodified cow bone char generated at around 600 c bone char intraparticle surface diffusion coefficients ds values were obtained from hsdm fits to dcbr data for bone char particle sizes ranging from 0 108 to 1 29 mm and ranged from 1 10 14 to 1 5 10 13 m2 s indicative of approximately linearly proportional i e non constant diffusivity with increasing bone char particle size literature data used to obtain additional pseudo equilibrium and kinetic data provided corroborating evidence of near linearly proportional diffusivity as a function of bone char particle size obtaining the best visual fits of the hsdm to pd rssct and pilot column breakthrough data using measured kf 1 n and ds values required the invocation of film mass transfer resistance exceeding values calculated by the common gnielinski method for borderline biot numbers of around 30 this effect is most consequential for treatment objectives that fall within early breakthrough c c0 20 a sensitivity analysis of hsdm inputs revealed increasing sensitivity in the order kf 1 n ds kf for a given water bone char combination the number of bv that could be treated to an effluent f concentration of 1 5 mg l varied substantially over the ranges of values that are typical for 1 n ds and kf and even over the ranges of precision with which these parameters can be determined experimentally accordingly it is preferable to use pd rssct experiments to simulate full scale treatment system performance rather than a hybrid approach of predicting f breakthrough using the hsdm with inputs obtained from batch experiments this study

19954,wastewater surveillance for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 rna can be integrated with covid 19 case data to inform timely pandemic response however more research is needed to apply and develop systematic methods to interpret the true sars cov 2 signal from noise introduced in wastewater samples e g from sewer conditions sampling and extraction methods etc in this study raw wastewater was collected weekly from five sewersheds and one residential facility the concentrations of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples were compared to geocoded covid 19 clinical testing data sars cov 2 was reliably detected 95 positivity in frozen wastewater samples when reported daily new covid 19 cases were 2 4 or more per 100 000 people to adjust for variation in sample fecal content four normalization biomarkers were evaluated crassphage pepper mild mottle virus bacteroides ribosomal rna rrna and human 18s rrna of these crassphage displayed the least spatial and temporal variability both unnormalized sars cov 2 rna signal and signal normalized to crassphage had positive and significant correlation with clinical testing data kendall s tau b τ 0 43 and 0 38 respectively but no normalization biomarker strengthened the correlation with clinical testing data locational dependencies and the date associated with testing data impacted the lead time of wastewater for clinical trends and no lead time was observed when the sample collection date versus the result date was used for both wastewater and clinical testing data this study supports that trends in wastewater surveillance data reflect trends in covid 19 disease occurrence and presents tools that could be applied to make wastewater signal more interpretable and comparable across studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords covid 19 wastewater based epidemiology pepper mild mottle virus crassphage bacteroides human 18s rrna 1 introduction increasing hospitalizations and limited diagnostic testing capacity early in the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemic made it clear that multiple methods to monitor circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 are needed bivins et al 2020 one such method is wastewater based epidemiology wbe which has provided community scale information on drug use personal care products antibiotic resistance and pathogen circulation choi et al 2018 sars cov 2 is a promising candidate for wbe because its rna can be detected in stool of infected individuals li et al 2021 parasa et al 2020 and wastewater surveillance has been shown to provide early detection of population level increases in occurrence compared to clinical data in some locations ahmed et al 2021 chavarria miró et al 2021 d aoust et al 2021a gerrity et al 2021 hata and honda 2020 kumar et al 2021 medema et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020b 2020a wong et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 however one meta analysis study reported that sars cov 2 was detected in stool samples from only 41 of infected patients parasa et al 2020 and the viral load has been shown to vary with disease progression benefield et al 2020 walsh et al 2020 more work is needed relating sars cov 2 rna measured in wastewater to covid 19 incidence in the contributing population together wastewater and clinical testing might provide more reliable information about disease burden in communities than either method alone clinical testing of individuals is resource intensive and has well known biases e g selection bias based on symptom severity symptom recognition occupation etc nunan et al 2017 griffith et al 2020 sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 which have compounded negative impacts in communities with higher proportions of low income residents and of black indigenous and people of color including in the san francisco bay area chamie et al 2020 misa et al 2020 in contrast wbe may provide a less biased assessment of covid 19 occurrence murakami et al 2020 sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 for covid 19 wbe to be useful for public health decision making a better understanding is needed of the variability of sars cov 2 in wastewater and how it relates to the true incidence or prevalence of covid 19 in the contributing population mcclary gutierrez et al 2021 sources of target signal variability in wastewater include inconsistencies in sample collection and laboratory processing ahmed et al 2020d feng et al 2021 nucleic acid degradation based on travel time and conditions in the sewer hart and halden 2020a and signal dilution due to rainfall and diurnal flow changes zahedi et al 2021 researchers have addressed some of these sources of variability through normalization to biomarkers increased sampling frequency processing sample replicates and smoothing forecasting d aoust et al 2021b feng et al 2021 graham et al 2020 mclellan et al 2021 nemudryi et al 2020 stadler et al 2020 normalization of target signal to flow population and or an endogenous biomarker has the potential to reduce variability and scale values for comparisons across samples and locations across wbe studies researchers have normalized wastewater concentrations to flow rate and population to calculate a per capita load chen et al 2014 choi et al 2018 zuccato et al 2005 zuccato zuccato et al 2008 or to a chemical parameter e g caffeine been et al 2014 choi et al 2018 d aoust et al 2021b polo et al 2020 more recently four biological markers have emerged as promising candidates to normalize sars cov 2 rna signal for fecal content pepper mild mottle virus pmmov a nonenveloped rna plant virus is commonly used for covid 19 wbe d aoust et al 2021b feng et al 2021 whitney et al 2021 wu et al 2020 but concentrations in sewage vary with season and local diet symonds et al 2019 another normalization biomarker is the cross assembly phage crassphage a non enveloped dna virus that ubiquitously infects the human gut commensal bacteria bacteroides edwards et al 2019 green et al 2020 stachler et al 2017 wilder et al 2021 in addition bacteroides hf183 16s rrna gene is widely used for detecting fecal contamination in environmental waters green et al 2020 shanks et al 2008 and recent studies d aoust et al 2021b kapoor et al 2015 pitkänen et al 2013 have targeted hf183 rrna versus the rrna gene to increase the sensitivity of the assay d aoust et al 2021b feng et al 2021 lastly the human 18s ribosomal subunit rna 18s rrna assay has been proposed as a normalization biomarker because it targets human cells that are shed in feces d aoust et al 2021b whitney et al 2021 while each of these normalization biomarkers has been assessed independently they have not all been compared within the same study in addition to normalizing the target signal smoothing procedures can assist in discerning temporal trends in sars cov 2 occurrence while seven day moving averages have been widely used for assessing clinical data trends in real time track testing trends n d wastewater sampling is often performed only 1 3 times per week therefore smoothing techniques are needed that can be applied to data with lower sampling frequency that minimize loss of temporal resolution such as locally weighted scatterplot smoothing lowess gibas et al 2021 gonzalez et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 vallejo et al 2020 however no standard value for the bandwidth parameter exists analogous to the selection of a seven day window for moving averages of clinical data and the default parameter value differs between two common languages used for data analysis r source code for spatialeco package n d 0 75 and python source code for statsmodels module n d 0 67 furthermore the bandwidth selection process generally has not been specified in studies incorporating lowess gibas et al 2021 gonzalez et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 vallejo et al 2020 wu et al 2020 systematic approaches are also needed to estimate the minimum number of clinical covid 19 cases for which sars cov 2 rna is reliably detected in wastewater wbe case detection limit the wbe case detection limit is dependent on the methods used to extract genetic material as well as the extent of local clinical testing and may require sewershed specific assessment this value can vary over time with clinical testing capabilities and is therefore referred to as the apparent wbe case detection limit in this study a systematic approach to estimate this value across studies can aid interpretation of nondetects and reproducibly estimate the number of covid 19 cases per capita above which covid 19 wbe will be a useful public health surveillance strategy in a recent study wu et al 2021 an apparent wbe case detection limit was estimated using a dataset with 1 687 samples which was large enough to include repeated wastewater measurements at low case numbers with fewer data points researchers have estimated this value observationally by reporting the number of cases they were able to detect or quantify hata and honda 2020 medema et al 2020 the goal of this research was to develop and assess approaches for covid 19 wbe data validation and interpretation specific objectives were to i evaluate normalization biomarkers crassphage pepper mild mottle virus bacteroides rrna and human 18s rrna for adjusting sars cov 2 rna signal to account for variable wastewater fecal content ii assess sars cov 2 wastewater testing as a complement to clinical testing for public health surveillance by determining the correlation between these two methods iii determine whether wastewater trends lead clinical trends and could provide early warning of covid 19 outbreaks iv evaluate a systematic method for trendline smoothing v develop a systematic method for estimating an apparent wbe case detection limit and vi apply these methods to interpret spatial and temporal trends in covid 19 occurrence based on wastewater and clinical testing data we analyzed a sample set from six locations in the san francisco bay area containing 5 months of weekly raw wastewater samples paired with geocoded clinical data 2 materials and methods six locations in the san francisco bay area were sampled referred to throughout as locations a s n k q and e fig 1 and table 1 raw wastewater was collected weekly and archived from april to september 2020 and extraction replicates were processed for some locations as indicated in table 1 sars cov 2 n1 rna and normalization biomarkers crassphage pmmov bacteroides rrna and 18s rrna were measured in wastewater samples via rt qpcr associated physicochemical data were collected by wastewater utilities and associated geocoded clinical covid 19 data were collected by public health departments table 1 2 1 wastewater sample collection and physicochemical data 24 hour time weighted composite samples of raw wastewater were collected using teledyne isco autosamplers some samples were collected and processed with extraction replicates i e wastewater subsamples were aliquoted from the same composite sample but independently extracted after collection all samples were transported to the lab on ice stored at either 20 c or 80 c and then thawed at 4 c for 36 48 hours before extractions wastewater data was not individually identifiable therefore no institutional review board approval was needed more information on location specific data collection and wastewater sampling transport storage and extraction replicates is provided in table 1 and the supplementary information si section a one rainfall event occurred may 12 19 during which sampling locations experienced 0 8 to 1 8 inches of precipitation noaa climate data online database although none of the

population data is provided in table 1 and si section e 2 3 wastewater sample processing via the 4s method wastewater samples were extracted following the 4s method whitney 2020 whitney et al 2021 with a minor modification the elution buffer was not pre warmed instead it was added to the column and the column was heated at 50 c for 10 minutes before centrifugation to collect the eluate both rna and dna were captured fig s1 each extraction batch contained a negative extraction control and each sample or control was spiked with a surrogate virus control bovilis coronavirus merck animal health bcov and a free rna control synthetic oligomer construct soc bcov and soc concentrations were significantly and strongly correlated τ 0 57 p 0 05 because it is not possible to independently quantify the surrogate spike without the influence of extraction efficiency kantor et al 2021b extraction controls were used to assess consistency of extractions rather than recovery outlier analysis alpha 0

qpcr limit of detection lod was calculated by analyzing all rna standard curves from the study as well as four additional extended triplicate standard curves the n1 lod was set at 5 gene copies per reaction which corresponds to a cq of 37 35 table s6 at which point 67 of rt qpcr replicates were positive in the standard curves table s8 further details on the data processing pipeline are provided in si section d 2 5 assessing pcr inhibition via serial dilution and an internal amplification control to our knowledge there is no standard methodology for assessing pcr inhibition in raw wastewater samples we combined two approaches to assess pcr inhibition in raw wastewater samples a non competitive internal amplification control ahmed et al 2020b nolan et al 2006 schrader et al 2012 staley et al 2012 and serial dilution graham et al 2020 the internal amplification control can easily be included in every sample but cannot detect assay specific inhibition schrader et al 2012 serial dilution consumes more resources and risks diluting the target signal below the detection limit but it more accurately tests the target itself and allows selection of a dilution value that best reduces the impacts of inhibition thus we used the vetmax xeno internal positive control thermofisher scientific assay duplexed with the n1 assay as a screening tool to select samples for further testing with serial dilution for all samples xeno rna was spiked into the reaction mix table s2 and ntcs were used as an inhibition free baseline to compare each sample on that plate ten samples showed 2 cq deviation from the baseline and were selected for further inhibition testing staley et al 2012 a dilution series 1x 2x 5x 10x was performed on these samples and the duplexed n1 and xeno assay was repeated a dilution was chosen by comparing sars cov 2 n1 signal in each dilution to theoretical expectations based on theoretical doubling per pcr cycle if diluting the sample led to a 1 cq difference between actual and expected change in cq then the sample at the base dilution was deemed inhibited as in graham et al 2020 following the serial dilution test only three samples required dilution table s9 and subsequent qpcr results in this study are reported using this chosen dilution results from the internal amplification control were inconsistent with inhibition assessed via serial dilution and we do not recommend the use of xeno for testing n1 inhibition in future studies 2 6 data analysis all data analysis was performed in python v3 6 9 using key modules pandas v1 1 5 numpy v1 19 5 scipy v1 4 1 and plotnine v0 6 0 2 6 1 normalization biomarker analyses for n1 normalization to biomarkers n1 gene copies per liter gc l was divided by the normalization biomarker concentration gc l to calculate flow scaled biomarker load gc person day target concentration gc l was multiplied by mean flow for the sampling location mgd and a unit conversion factor liter per million gallons and then divided by population daily flow rate data were not available for s n and a locations upstream of a treatment facility table s1 so mean dry weather flow rates and population were used to scale data when comparing across locations we expect that the mean flow rate likely approximates the daily flow rate throughout the study period but this may not hold true in other locations and seasons for comparisons of biomarker concentrations and variation fig 2 a kruskal wallis test scipy v1 4 1 was performed followed by pairwise dunn s tests scikit posthocs v0 6 6 to determine statistical differences rank correlations between wastewater and case data fig 3 were calculated as kendall s tau b coefficients τ scipy v1 4 1 a method adapted for left censored data i e datasets with data below a lower limit of detection wood et al 2011 because 22 of the data are below the n1 lod correlations were classified as weak τ 0 3 moderate 0 3 τ 0 5 or strong τ 0 5 coefficients of variation cv were calculated as the arithmetic standard deviation divided by the mean while geometric coefficients of variation gcv were calculated as the geometric standard deviation minus one 2 6 2 assessment of an apparent wbe case detection limit an apparent wbe case detection limit was estimated as follows the paired wastewater and case data for all sewersheds were combined and sorted from highest to lowest case counts for each case count all rt qpcr replicates in the wastewater data at and above that point were tallied to determine the cumulative percentage of replicates that amplified in rt qpcr equation 1 was used to fit a logistic function kyurkchiev and markov 2016 to the dataset scipy v1 4 1 where y is the fraction of amplified rt qpcr replicates x is the log10 moving average of new cases per person per day k sets the growth rate of y and γ sets the inflection point zero new cases per capita cannot be represented in a logistic growth model but in this study case values of zero were only available for location q and these values were substituted as 0 5 cases before the analysis the covid 19 per capita case rate that corresponded to 95 cumulative amplification of rt qpcr replicates was reported as the apparent wbe case detection limit and the analysis was repeated with samples where daily per capita cases were provided as masked

with bandwidth parameter α the fraction of the dataset used for smoothing set as previously shown jacoby 2000 figs 4 and s2 s5 lowess trends of sars cov 2 n1 signal were also visualized as heatmaps to aid in discerning peaks figs s6 and s7 the full dataset and associated code are available through github https zenodo org record 4730990 yixkrqlkguo 3 results raw wastewater was collected weekly from april to september 2020 at six locations table 1 the resulting dataset includes 91 samples 155 including extraction replicates which were paired with geocoded clinical testing data and analyzed for sars cov 2 along with four potential normalization biomarkers crassphage pmmov bacteroides rrna and human 18s rrna this dataset was generated from the san francisco bay area in separate sanitary sewer systems during a period with minimal rainfall see methods which naturally controlled for variability in wastewater strength due to precipitation thus we expected the concentrations of the measured normalization biomarkers to be relatively stable additionally geocoded clinical testing data included a range of per capita covid 19 case rates that varied by location 3 1 crassphage and pmmov were the most consistent biomarkers a subset of samples from all locations was used in experiments fig 2 comparing crassphage 98 unique samples 153 extraction replicates pmmov 93 unique samples 95 extraction replicates bacteroides rrna 97 unique samples 99 extraction replicates and 18s rrna 40 unique samples 41 extraction replicates as biomarkers for normalization to fecal content all normalization biomarkers were detected at high concentrations table s10 in all samples tested except for 18s rrna which was inconsistently quantifiable fig s8 flow rates and chemical wastewater parameters tss bod cod cbod were not consistently measured by utilities table s1 thus robust comparisons of physicochemical biomarkers could not be made in the absence of daily flow rate data we used mean flow rate to scale wastewater biomarker concentrations by the per capita wastewater flow for each sewershed to account for differences across sewersheds fig 2 mean per capita flow rates were similar for all locations except q a facility table 1 generally resulting in little change after flow scaling for this reason flow scaling was applied to compare biomarkers but unnormalized sars cov 2 n1 concentrations are used as a baseline in later analyses an ideal normalization biomarker would have minimal spatial variation in per capita shedding rates and minimal temporal differences in wastewater loads when flow rates are stable as they were in this study two methods were used to evaluate biomarker variability fig 2 i comparing per capita biomarker loads gene copies person day to assess differences in observed shedding by location and ii evaluating the temporal variation of loads for each location consistent with recent studies ahmed et al 2020d d aoust et al 2021b crassphage and pmmov were the least variable biomarkers across locations and over time mean gcvcrassphage 59 and mean gcvpmmov 56 not statistically different p 0 05 in contrast bacteroides rrna displayed more variability both spatially fig 2 and temporally mean gcv 130 and 18s rrna varied dramatically mean gcv 500 fig s8 crassphage pmmov and bacteroides rrna were quantifiable in all samples tested but 18s rrna was below the lod for 24 of samples furthermore 18s rrna was the only biomarker that amplified in the extraction negative controls 75 at similar levels as the samples p 0 05 fig s9 which suggests that this target could be a common laboratory contaminant based on our findings that 18s rrna was frequently detected in negative controls inconsistently detected in sewage and had high spatial and temporal variation in per capita shedding we conclude that human 18s rrna is not suitable as a normalization biomarker to adjust for fecal content location e had lower biomarker concentrations fig 2 frequently undetected 18s rrna fig s9 and high variability in n1 signal we suspect that these samples had rna degradation because i location e is the largest sewershed in the study i e longer residence time allowing for signal degradation and ii some samples from this site thawed during transportation back to the lab resulting in an additional freeze thaw cycle which could degrade rna ahmed et al 2020c coryell et al 2020 data from sewershed e were excluded from subsequent analyses because of the uncertainty surrounding the integrity of these samples 3 2 sars cov 2 n1 and clinical testing data were correlated in aggregate and normalization biomarkers did not strengthen this relationship the sars cov 2 n1 concentration in wastewater was moderately correlated to daily per capita clinical cases when aggregated across all locations τ 0 43 p 0 0001 fig 3 however there are several limitations to assessing correlation between clinical data and wastewater data first clinical testing data do not necessarily represent true incidence because of biases associated with testing including that asymptomatic cases are often not detected through clinical testing similarly wastewater testing data do not necessarily represent true incidence because studies have found that fecal shedding is less common than nasopharyngeal shedding in symptomatic individuals parasa et al 2020 thus there may be covid 19 cases that are detected through clinical public health surveillance but not through wastewater surveillance and vice versa furthermore viral load has been shown to vary throughout an infection and to differ in nasopharyngeal and fecal samples benefield et al 2020 walsh et al 2020 even if clinical and wastewater testing data correspond to the same date fecal shedding could peak before symptom onset which would impact the correlation unless the correct time offset is applied to reflect this discrepancy hoffmann and alsing 2021 additionally for this analysis clinical and wastewater testing data would ideally both correspond to the sample collection date as opposed to the result date to remove lag introduced by test result turnaround time see section 3 3 for more information however often only one date was available for clinical testing for example in this analysis the only date associated with the daily per capita cases from most locations all but k was the date that the testing results were provided result date while the date associated with the sars cov 2 n1 wastewater signal was the sample collection date finally due to the limited sizes and variation in individual datasets correlations were assessed for all locations in aggregate despite site specific factors that may influence the significance site specific analyses are conducted later in this section despite these potential limitations correlation to daily per capita covid 19 cases was used as a metric to assess the effect of normalization to biomarkers crassphage pmmov and bacteroides rrna moderate significant correlations were observed with covid 19 daily per capita cases when sars cov 2 n1 was unnormalized and normalized by crassphage or bacteroides τunnormalized 0 43 τcrassphage 0 38 and τ bacteroides 0 35 p 0 0001 fig 3 notably normalization did not strengthen the correlation compared to unnormalized signal conversely pmmov normalization produced only a weak correlation of 0 18 p 0 05 fig 3 analysis was performed with and without samples that were below the limit of detection and produced similar results table s11 of the normalization biomarkers tested crassphage had the lowest variability and also maintained significant and moderate correlation with clinical testing data so we included it in subsequent analyses alongside unnormalized concentrations the correlation analysis was repeated with data separated by location to determine whether locational dependencies affect the relationship between wastewater and clinical testing data as well as the performance of normalization strategies locations with at least 75 of data above the n1 qpcr lod locations k n and s table s12 were included in this analysis only location k had significant correlations with clinical testing data both with and without crassphage normalization τunnormalized 0 5 and τcrassphage 0 43 p 0 05 fig s10 location k is the only site with three extraction replicates for each sample which likely captured a more representative signal than that of locations s or n the lack of significance of correlation for locations s and n could also be due to the short time series that may not vary enough to establish rank location s or may have impacts of outside factors such as clinical undertesting location a that skew the rank overall locational dependencies e g differences in extent of clinical testing sewer system residence times etc likely affect the correlation with clinical testing data and should be considered when evaluating aggregated data additionally the location specific analysis was repeated including only samples with detectable sars cov 2 n1 signal and the results were no longer statistically significant fig s10 this finding is likely influenced by both the limited sample size and values below the n1 qpcr lod that affect rank correlations in addition to the limitations in clinical testing data mentioned at the beginning of this section there are several explanations for why wastewater signal at locations s n and k did not significantly correlate with clinical testing data after removing values below the lod i the daily per capita cases in the population were at or below the wbe case detection limit of the wastewater data ii the daily per capita cases that were masked by public health departments for patient privacy impaired the rank correlation analysis by left censoring the clinical testing data iii the wastewater signal did not vary enough over the time of sampling to establish rank the possibility that the wastewater signal leads the clinical testing data was subsequently tested for locations k n and s i e correlations were examined for zero one and two week offsets however location k was the only location with significant correlation between wastewater and clinical testing data for any lead time tested fig s10 3 3 impact of the date associated with clinical testing data on lead time in wastewater surveillance at location k the time for laboratories to process samples and return results testing turnaround time affects the potential for wastewater surveillance to provide lead time over clinical surveillance in general clinical testing data correspond to either the date the sample was collected or the date the results were returned the ideal date to use for informing public health decisions would be the result date to include differences between clinical and wastewater testing turnaround time in the analysis alternatively sample collection dates should be compared to understand the timing of the underlying biological mechanisms that result in a positive wastewater signal onset and duration of fecal shedding and positive clinical test onset and duration of nasopharyngeal shedding onset and duration of symptoms may influence the timing of the clinical test sample collection date depending on whether testing is routine or only available to symptomatic individuals hence the ideal date to use for comparison of wastewater and clinical testing data differs depending on the goals of the comparison the clinical testing data for location k included sample collection date result date and episode date the earliest date associated with the case allowing us to assess the correlation between case data and wastewater data with and without clinical testing turnaround time episode date was frequently the same as the sample collection date unless a patient reported symptoms prior to test date fig s11 it should be noted that wastewater testing data correspond to the sample collection date because all samples were processed retroactively in this study routine wastewater testing turnaround time in the san francisco bay area has been reported to be two days or fewer for most samples but this value varies depending on sample transport and laboratory methods covid web n d kantor et al 2021a to test the influence of the date associated with clinical testing we repeated correlation analysis for location k fig s11 the wastewater testing data sample collection date correlated with the clinical testing data by episode date τepisode unnormalized 0 56 τepisode crassphage 0 54 p 0 01 and sample collection date τcollection unnormalized 0 59 τcollection crassphage 0 62 p 0 01 without a lead or lag when the result date was used for clinical testing data the strongest correlation with wastewater data was associated with a two week lead time unnormalized n1 concentration or one week lead time n1 normalized to crassphage figs s10 and s11 when values below the n1 qpcr lod were removed wastewater data were no longer significantly correlated with episode date associated clinical data but the strongest correlations for the other date associations remained significant this analysis is limited because of the small dataset but the methodology presented here can be used to assess the lead time provided by wastewater surveillance with larger data sets and with wastewater data processed contemporaneously with decision making 3 4 the lowess bandwidth parameter affected wastewater data trend interpretation variation in wastewater sars cov 2 n1 signal from sources other than variation in true incidence or prevalence e g noise introduced during sample collection processing etc can obscure temporal trends smoothing techniques can be used to visually distinguish temporal trends from noise similar to the choice of the number of days included for each average calculation for moving averages window lowess requires selection of the fraction of the whole time series that is used for each local regression calculation bandwidth we employed a method to set the bandwidth parameter systematically based on residuals jacoby 2000 independently for each location the bandwidth was increased stepwise beginning with inclusion of one point in each local regression calculation and ending with inclusion of all points α 1 for each bandwidth value the residuals were calculated and plotted by date and a lowess trendline with α 1 was fit to these residual plots to monitor residual trends as the bandwidth varied finally the maximum bandwidth value was selected for which the residuals visually maintained horizontal lowess trendlines see figs 4 and s2 s5 as an example for unnormalized and crassphage normalized sars cov 2 n1 bandwidth parameters of 0 39 and 0 33 were respectively chosen for location n fig 4 a this process was repeated for all locations and bandwidths in the range of 0 25 0 6 were selected based on the optimization procedure see figs 4 and s2 s5 to assess the impact of bandwidth on sars cov 2 n1 signal interpretation lowess was performed for all locations sampled and for all possible bandwidths see figs 4 b and s2 s5 the bandwidth parameter influenced the overall temporal trends of wastewater data for some locations n and a figs 4 and s5 for example at location a fig s5 a bandwidth of 1 resulted in a gradual increase in sars cov 2 n1 signal during sampling while a bandwidth of 0 73 resulted in a peak around july however for location k fig s2 all bandwidths resulted in trends that would have similar interpretations these results illustrate that choice of bandwidth could have implications for interpreting wbe data and informing covid 19 response strategies and systematic methods should be used to select the appropriate bandwidth 3 5 wastewater and clinical data had similar overall trends regardless of normalization with notable exceptions to assess the impact of crassphage normalization on sars cov 2 n1 temporal trends we compared unnormalized and crassphage normalized lowess trendlines fig 5 we found that crassphage normalized trends were similar to unnormalized trends for three of the locations k n and a but had differences in overall trend for locations q fig 6 and s fig s12 discrepancies are concerning because they could have implications for pandemic response we note that the trend in location k for which extraction replicates were processed routinely was the least impacted by bandwidth or normalization figs s2 and s12 and was the only site analyzed with significant correlation with clinical data fig s10 larger datasets with more frequent sampling and processing of replicates would give single points less influence over the trend relative spatio temporal trends in clinical and wastewater testing results were compared across sampling sites figs 5 s6 and s7 in general clinical and wastewater data at all locations paralleled one another with san quentin prison q showing the highest covid 19 burden across locations due to a covid 19 outbreak location q had a maximum that was 53 times sars cov 2 n1 4 89 103 gene copies ml 17 times crassphage normalized sars cov 2 n1 ratio 2 9 10 3 and 203 times 85 new cases per 1000 people on 6 29 higher than the highest value at the sewershed scale there were a few discrepancies between clinical and wastewater trends heatmap visualizations in figs s6 and s7 highlight discrepancies in peaks for example at location n there may have been clinical undertesting based on the peak in wastewater data in august figs 5 and s6 and higher sars cov 2 signal in wastewater at location n relative to other locations than represented by the clinical data figs 5 and s7 3 6 the apparent wbe case detection limit was estimated to be 2 4 covid 19 cases per 100 000 people quantifying the minimum per capita new covid 19 cases in a sewershed at which there is reliable detection of sars cov 2 n1 in wastewater apparent wbe case detection limit is important for gauging the utility of covid 19 wbe when the true incidence is low this apparent wbe case detection limit depends on the detection limit of the wastewater measurement i e on the methods used to store concentrate extract and measure sars cov 2 rna in wastewater and the accuracy of the clinical testing data available as described in more detail in section 3 3 ideally this value would be calculated using the true incidence but that information is generally not available and the best available data should be used instead this limit will vary over time and location with the extent of clinical testing but could be useful in a practical sense to compare wastewater and clinical surveillance efforts locally to estimate an apparent wbe case detection limit in a way that is replicable across studies the cumulative percentage of amplified rt qpcr replicates of the wastewater data for inversely ranked daily per capita covid 19 cases was fit to a logistic growth model without samples associated with masked case values see methods when covid 19 case rates equaled or exceeded 2 4 daily cases per 100 000 people 95 of wastewater rt qpcr replicates amplified via rt qpcr for n1 fig 7 other researchers have used non cumulative methods to estimate an apparent wbe case detection limit by calculating the percent of amplified wastewater replicates for each case value wu et al 2021 this method requires repeated wastewater measurements associated with each possible clinical case value or range of case values i e bins otherwise the percent of amplified rt qpcr replicates is limited as was the case in this study where only one extraction replicate was often associated with each case number fig s13 a ideally all data would be unmasked when applying this method to verify that the masked clinical data did not affect the apparent wbe case detection limit the process was repeated with masked values and the estimate was similar 2 2 cases in 100 000 people fig s13 b these limits are within the theoretical range possible hart and halden 2020b and similar in magnitude to previous findings of 10 in 100 000 hata and honda 2020 and 13 in 100 000 wu et al 2021 based on the contributing population of each sewershed in this study the apparent wbe case detection limit translates to 11 6 cases for k 11 3 cases for s 3 3 cases for n 2 0 cases for a and 0 1 cases for q therefore theoretically a single case should be detectable at location q based on results from this analysis but this could not be tested observationally because there was only one instance when a single new case was detected by clinical testing after august 12th fig 6 only one rt qpcr replicate amplified for two samples taken within seven days of the single clinical case detected and these samples were classified below the limit of detection larger data sets with more instances of single clinical case detections are needed to assess the ability to detect a single case from this facility nonetheless a single case may still go undetected despite being above the apparent wbe case detection limit for example sars cov 2 rna is not shed consistently in stool samples of all infected individuals parasa et al 2020 and wastewater surveillance relies on the autosampler aliquots capturing the feces from each infected individual which becomes less likely when there are fewer infected individuals and wastewater has less mixing prior to the sampling location despite these limitations other studies have reported detection of one case in wastewater from residential facilities ranging from 60 to 415 people gibas et al 2021 karthikeyan et al 2021 spurbeck et al 2021 more work is needed applying wbe for sars cov 2 across a broader set of facilities with longer time series and higher frequency sampling 4 discussion 4 1 validation and potential use scenarios of sars cov 2 wastewater testing during the covid 19 pandemic both the methodological research for sars cov 2 testing in wastewater and the application of wbe have been occurring simultaneously for covid 19 wbe to be useful for public health decision making public health officials need to be confident that the resulting sars cov 2 signal reflects covid 19 trends in the contributing population despite limitations in clinical testing data and the potential lag in wastewater trends assessing correlations between clinical and wastewater testing data can help validate wbe xagoraraki and o brien 2020 moderate correlations with clinical data observed in this study τ 0 43 support that trends in wastewater surveillance data reflect trends in covid 19 disease occurrence however locational dependencies were observed wastewater data paired with clinical data can be a more robust public health surveillance strategy compared to either method alone both for sewershed scale and facility scale surveillance applications in some settings wastewater testing may be a less resource intensive way to implement population scale surveillance and policymakers will need to balance allocation of resources to each approach a critical question for public health decision making is how much early warning wbe can provide ahead of clinical testing which could allow more timely public health responses to slow covid 19 outbreaks however lead time is difficult to measure biologically the time between onset of fecal shedding and nasal shedding is unclear benefield et al 2020 walsh et al 2020 practically lead time depends on testing turnaround time and frequency of sampling for both wastewater and clinical testing for example clinical testing capabilities can increase the lead time of wastewater data if patients are only tested after symptom onset and can decrease the lead time if asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals are regularly screened with rapid turnaround time ideal assessments of wastewater data lead time due to biological mechanisms would not include turnaround time whereas assessments of the performance of clinical and wastewater laboratories for public health action and practical limitations would include turnaround time although other studies observed lead time for wastewater data over clinical data starting on the order of days d aoust et al 2021a nemudryi et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 the weekly sampling in our study could explain why no lead time was determined when the sample collection date was used for both wastewater and clinical testing data fig s14 however the impact of clinical testing strategy i e only screening symptomatic individuals could also be affecting this result we could not directly compare wastewater and clinical result dates in this retroactive study but when clinical data were associated with the result date and wastewater data were associated with sample collection date lead time of 1 2 weeks was observed fig s14 other researchers have observed lead time in wastewater data of up to three weeks ahmed et al 2021 medema et al 2020 and our results reflect a similar range in possible lead times 0 2 weeks depending on which date is associated with the clinical data at the sewershed scale the benefit of wbe to public health extends beyond early warning discrepancies between wastewater testing data and clinical testing data trends from early in the time series at location n april july 2020 fig s12 could be used to infer clinical undertesting which is supported by lower testing capacity in this time frame at nearby location k figs 1 s15 although pairing covid 19 clinical testing data with wastewater sars cov 2 data can generate new insights for public health decision making it can be challenging in practice pairing wastewater sars cov 2 data with geocoded covid 19 clinical testing data required collaboration between academics wastewater treatment facility representatives and public health officials these collaborations may be particularly difficult at sewershed scale where multiple public health department jurisdictions overlap within one sewershed e g location n partnerships for data sharing between agencies are critical to support ongoing wastewater based epidemiology for sars cov 2 and other pathogens at the facility scale monitoring raw wastewater for sars cov 2 might be particularly useful for early detection of covid 19 outbreaks especially when resources are insufficient for routine clinical testing of all individuals san quentin prison location q had a covid 19 outbreak during the study period after a transfer from the california institution for men cassidy and fagone 2020 where at its peak 47 of the incarcerated population had active covid 19 cases the maximum sars cov 2 n1 concentration 4 89 103 gene copies ml was higher than any sewershed sampled in this study and among the highest values we found in the literature for n1 in raw wastewater gerrity et al 2021 gonzalez et al 2020 medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020b wu et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 despite regular clinical testing fig s15 prison conditions cause incarcerated people to be particularly susceptible to respiratory disease outbreaks and maintaining safety in prisons requires deliberate planning and coordination by correctional institutions e g coordination with local public health systems to develop pandemic response plans coordination of transfers between institutions etc montoya barthelemy et al 2020 furthermore the health of incarcerated people is linked to the health of the surrounding community and incorporating correctional institutions into community safety plans will help ensure better protection against covid 19 for everyone montoya barthelemy et al 2020 once protective measures are implemented wbe may be useful to monitor prisons and other high risk facilities e g skilled nursing facilities homeless shelters etc especially where clinical testing is not available or routine 4 2 tools for translatable wbe 4 2 1 normalization of wastewater targets to adjust for fecal content results from this study suggest that pmmov bacteroides rrna and 18s rrna were less promising normalization biomarkers than crassphage while pmmov was present in high and stable concentrations the diet dependency symonds et al 2019 and large range in concentrations in the literature six orders of magnitude table s10 remain concerns for its use over longer time scales and across larger geographic regions normalization to pmmov resulted in the weakest significant correlation to clinical testing data of the biomarkers tested τ 0 18 p 0 05 bacteroides rrna loads varied more spatially and temporally than crassphage or pmmov in this study fig 2 but bacteroides normalized sars cov 2 n1 had a moderate correlation with clinical testing data τ 0 35 while measurement of bacteroides rrna gene in wastewater has been commonly applied for fecal source tracking and bacteroides rrna has been targeted to increase assay sensitivity d aoust et al 2021b feng et al 2021 to our knowledge no prior raw wastewater values have been reported in the literature for bacteroides rrna table s10 similarly no values were found in the literature for 18s rrna concentrations in raw wastewater table s10 in this study 18s rrna signal displayed a wide range in concentrations and consistently amplified in negative extraction controls furthermore 18s rrna was less stable in wastewater than sars cov 2 rna and nonenveloped viruses e g crassphage and pmmov which is consistent with previous studies whitney et al 2021 wurtzer et al 2020 therefore we do not recommend 18s rrna use as a normalization biomarker in comparison to all the biomarkers tested crassphage had low spatial variability i e the fewest locations with statistically different loads fig 2 and temporal variability gcv 59 fig 2 additionally sars cov 2 n1 normalized to crassphage correlated with daily per capita covid 19 cases τ 0 38 although crassphage concentrations in the literature had a wide range six orders of magnitude table s10 they were consistent across locations in this study based on this dataset and findings from earlier studies that biomarker normalization has utility in some settings d aoust et al 2021b wu et al 2020 wolfe et al 2021 crassphage remains a promising endogenous normalization biomarker for broader wbe applications that require adjustment for fecal content although a standardized approach would facilitate comparisons across studies the ideal normalization strategy may be situationally dependent for example in this study biomarker normalization did not improve correlations to clinical data compared to unnormalized signal which is in contrast to other studies that found normalization to pmmov improved relationships with clinical data however these conclusions were based on visual inspection of trends rather than correlations wu et al 2020 or measurements made in sludge rather than raw wastewater samples d aoust et al 2021b wolfe et al 2021 findings from this study suggest that biomarker normalization may have limited utility when comparing intra study composite samples across a confined region with stable wastewater flows which is in agreement with recent studies where biomarker normalization did not improve associations with clinical data feng et al 2021 graham et al 2020 several factors should be considered when deciding whether to normalize to a biomarker or report unnormalized concentrations first adding another assay introduces additional analytical variation that could outweigh the benefits of biomarker normalization in some settings especially when wastewater fecal content is expected to be stable across samples feng et al 2021 an additional consideration is ensuring methods compatibility with the wbe target and normalization biomarker ideally normalization to an endogenous biomarker would account for losses in target signal during residence time in sewers sample storage and laboratory processing but the ideal biomarker for fecal content may not be the best surrogate for the target of interest for example crassphage is not expected to be a good surrogate for sars cov 2 stability partitioning and extraction ye et al 2016 and as a dna virus crassphage may be incompatible with some extraction methods used for sars cov 2 rna other controls e g endogenous biomarkers recovery controls and modeling may be applied to improve measurement accuracy and translate results across labs and methods although there are challenges associated with these corrections kantor et al 2021b wolfe et al 2021 degradation modeling with target specific decay constants ahmed et al 2020a and sewershed specific parameters could assist in correcting for degradation or determining sample integrity but no comprehensive approach for this correction exists and more work is needed developing these methods 4 2 2 a systematic approach for data smoothing lowess in general public health decisions are based on temporal trends in disease burden not individual data points but trends in wastewater and clinical data can be difficult to visually distinguish especially when available resources constrain sampling frequencies applying lowess to wastewater data we found that the value of one parameter could influence the trend visualization such that the same dataset could lead to different public health responses figs 4 and s5 based on our analysis the bandwidth parameter for lowess should be determined for each sewershed sampled lowess with a systematically chosen bandwidth could be used to smooth trendlines and minimize the loss of temporal resolution the method presented here could be applied in retrospective analysis or in real time analysis completed as part of wastewater public health surveillance programs for real time applications the bandwidth parameter could be selected using a subset of data and the residuals plot could be frequently checked to ensure no new residual patterns emerge over time that could obscure the smoothed trend 4 2 3 a systematic approach to estimate an apparent wbe case detection limit our approach for identifying an apparent wbe case detection limit that can be applied systematically to studies using pcr based methods we applied this analysis to sars cov 2 n1 signal in wastewater and found that the daily new clinical cases at which wastewater surveillance could reliably detect clinically diagnosed covid 19 cases in the contributing population was estimated at 2 4 cases per 100 000 people there are multiple limitations to this analysis because wastewater detection depends on factors other than incidence such as sampling methods e g frequency of sampling aliquots which can influence the probability of capturing shed viral particles from an infected individual additionally the estimate may vary based on site specific clinical testing availability wastewater sampling methods e g composite sampling freezing before processing and laboratory processing e g 4s extraction method rt qpcr the estimation method for an apparent wbe case detection limit presented here could benefit both covid 19 wbe and other disease wbe by providing a systematic method to compare wastewater and clinical testing capabilities locally 5 conclusion wastewater n1 concentrations had a moderate correlation with geocoded clinical testing data τunnormalized 0 43 normalization of sars cov 2 n1 signal in wastewater to any biomarker did not improve the correlation with clinical testing data likely because of the low variation in daily flow rates of the four normalization biomarkers tested crassphage was the most promising due to low spatial and temporal variability and because crassphage normalized n1 had the strongest correlation with clinical testing data τcrassphage 0 38 τ bacteroides 0 35 τpmmov 0 18 18s rrna was not suitable as a normalization biomarker due to its variability in sample concentrations high degradation rate and ubiquity as a laboratory contaminant discrepancies between wastewater and clinical testing data provided evidence of clinical undertesting at location n which supports that wastewater testing could provide insights about covid 19 trends in the population when clinical testing capabilities are limited the covid 19 outbreak at san quentin prison location q corresponded to a measured n1 concentration that was higher than any sewershed tested 4 89 103 gene copies ml the wastewater based epidemiology case detection limit using the 4s rna extraction method on frozen samples was estimated to be 2 4 covid 19 cases in 100 000 people lead time in wastewater over clinical testing varied from 0 to 3 weeks depending on the location biomarker normalization and testing turnaround

19954,wastewater surveillance for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 rna can be integrated with covid 19 case data to inform timely pandemic response however more research is needed to apply and develop systematic methods to interpret the true sars cov 2 signal from noise introduced in wastewater samples e g from sewer conditions sampling and extraction methods etc in this study raw wastewater was collected weekly from five sewersheds and one residential facility the concentrations of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples were compared to geocoded covid 19 clinical testing data sars cov 2 was reliably detected 95 positivity in frozen wastewater samples when reported daily new covid 19 cases were 2 4 or more per 100 000 people to adjust for variation in sample fecal content four normalization biomarkers were evaluated crassphage pepper mild mottle virus bacteroides ribosomal rna rrna and human 18s rrna of these crassphage displayed the least spatial and temporal variability both unnormalized sars cov 2 rna signal and signal normalized to crassphage had positive and significant correlation with clinical testing data kendall s tau b τ 0 43 and 0 38 respectively but no normalization biomarker strengthened the correlation with clinical testing data locational dependencies and the date associated with testing data impacted the lead time of wastewater for clinical trends and no lead time was observed when the sample collection date versus the result date was used for both wastewater and clinical testing data this study supports that trends in wastewater surveillance data reflect trends in covid 19 disease occurrence and presents tools that could be applied to make wastewater signal more interpretable and comparable across studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords covid 19 wastewater based epidemiology pepper mild mottle virus crassphage bacteroides human 18s rrna 1 introduction increasing hospitalizations and limited diagnostic testing capacity early in the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemic made it clear that multiple methods to monitor circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 are needed bivins et al 2020 one such method is wastewater based epidemiology wbe which has provided community scale information on drug use personal care products antibiotic resistance and pathogen circulation choi et al 2018 sars cov 2 is a promising candidate for wbe because its rna can be detected in stool of infected individuals li et al 2021 parasa et al 2020 and wastewater surveillance has been shown to provide early detection of population level increases in occurrence compared to clinical data in some locations ahmed et al 2021 chavarria miró et al 2021 d aoust et al

analysis study reported that sars cov 2 was detected in stool samples from only 41 of infected patients parasa et al 2020 and the viral load has been shown to vary with disease progression benefield et al 2020 walsh et al 2020 more work is needed relating sars cov 2 rna measured in wastewater to covid 19 incidence in the contributing population together wastewater and clinical testing might provide more reliable information about disease burden in communities than either method alone clinical testing of individuals is resource intensive and has well known biases e g selection bias based on symptom severity symptom recognition occupation etc nunan et al 2017 griffith et al 2020 sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 which have compounded negative impacts in communities with higher proportions of low income residents and of black indigenous and people of color including in the san francisco bay area chamie et al 2020 misa et al 2020 in contrast wbe may provide a less biased assessment of covid 19 occurrence murakami et al 2020 sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 for covid 19 wbe to be useful for public health decision making a better understanding is needed of the variability of sars cov 2 in wastewater and how it relates to the true incidence or prevalence of covid 19 in the contributing population mcclary gutierrez et al 2021 sources of target signal variability in wastewater include inconsistencies in sample collection and laboratory processing ahmed et al 2020d feng et al 2021 nucleic acid degradation based on travel time and conditions in the sewer hart and halden 2020a and signal dilution due to rainfall and diurnal flow changes zahedi et al 2021 researchers have addressed some of these sources of variability through normalization to biomarkers increased sampling

target signal to flow population and or an endogenous biomarker has the potential to reduce variability and scale values for comparisons across samples and locations across wbe studies researchers have normalized wastewater concentrations to flow rate and population to calculate a per capita load chen et al 2014 choi et al 2018 zuccato et al 2005 zuccato zuccato et al 2008 or to a chemical parameter e g caffeine been et al 2014 choi et al 2018 d aoust et al 2021b polo et al 2020 more recently four biological markers have emerged as promising candidates to normalize sars cov 2 rna signal for fecal content pepper mild mottle virus pmmov a nonenveloped rna plant virus is commonly used for covid 19 wbe d aoust et al 2021b feng et al 2021 whitney et al 2021 wu et al 2020 but concentrations in sewage vary with season and local diet symonds et al 2019 another normalization biomarker is the cross assembly phage crassphage a non enveloped dna virus that ubiquitously infects the human gut commensal bacteria bacteroides edwards et al 2019 green et al 2020 stachler et al 2017 wilder et al 2021 in addition bacteroides hf183 16s rrna gene is widely used for detecting fecal contamination in environmental waters green et al 2020 shanks et al 2008 and recent studies d aoust et al 2021b kapoor et al 2015 pitkänen et al 2013 have targeted hf183 rrna versus the rrna gene to increase the sensitivity of the assay d aoust et al 2021b feng et al 2021 lastly the human 18s ribosomal subunit rna 18s rrna assay has been proposed as a normalization biomarker because it targets human cells that are shed in feces d aoust et al 2021b whitney et al 2021 while each of these normalization biomarkers has been assessed independently they have not all been compared within the same study in addition to normalizing the target signal smoothing procedures can assist in discerning temporal trends in sars cov 2 occurrence while seven day moving averages have been widely used for assessing clinical data trends in real time track testing trends n d wastewater sampling is often performed only 1 3 times per week therefore smoothing techniques are needed that can be applied to data with lower sampling frequency that minimize loss of temporal resolution such as locally weighted scatterplot smoothing lowess gibas et al 2021 gonzalez et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 vallejo et al 2020 however no standard value for the bandwidth parameter exists analogous to the selection of a seven day window for moving averages of clinical data and the default parameter value differs between two common languages used for data analysis r source code for spatialeco package n d 0 75 and python source code for statsmodels module n d 0 67 furthermore the bandwidth selection process generally has not been specified in studies incorporating lowess gibas et al 2021 gonzalez et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 vallejo et al 2020 wu et al 2020 systematic approaches are also needed to estimate the minimum number of clinical covid 19 cases for which sars cov 2 rna is reliably detected in wastewater wbe case detection limit the wbe case detection limit is dependent on the methods used to extract genetic material as well as the extent of local clinical testing and may require sewershed specific assessment this value can vary over time with clinical testing capabilities and is therefore referred to as the apparent wbe case detection limit in this study a systematic approach to estimate this value across studies can aid interpretation of nondetects and reproducibly estimate the number of covid 19 cases per capita above which covid 19 wbe will be a useful public health surveillance strategy in a recent study wu et al 2021 an apparent wbe case detection limit was estimated using a dataset with 1 687 samples which was large enough to include repeated wastewater measurements at low case numbers with fewer data points researchers have estimated this value observationally by reporting the number of cases they were able to detect or quantify hata and honda 2020 medema et al 2020 the goal of this research was to develop and assess approaches for covid 19 wbe data validation and interpretation specific objectives were to i evaluate normalization biomarkers crassphage pepper mild mottle virus bacteroides rrna and human 18s rrna for adjusting sars cov 2 rna signal to account for variable wastewater fecal content ii assess sars cov 2 wastewater testing as a complement to clinical testing for public health surveillance by determining the correlation between these two methods iii determine whether wastewater trends lead clinical trends and could provide early warning of covid 19 outbreaks iv evaluate a systematic method for trendline smoothing v develop a systematic method for estimating an apparent wbe case detection limit and vi apply these methods to interpret spatial and temporal trends in covid 19 occurrence based on wastewater and clinical testing data we analyzed a sample set from six locations in the san francisco bay area containing 5 months of weekly raw wastewater samples paired with geocoded clinical data 2 materials and methods six locations in the san francisco bay area were sampled referred to throughout as locations a s n k q and e fig 1 and table 1 raw wastewater was collected weekly and archived from april to september 2020 and extraction replicates were processed for some locations as indicated in table 1 sars cov 2 n1 rna and normalization biomarkers crassphage pmmov bacteroides rrna and 18s rrna were measured in wastewater samples via rt qpcr associated physicochemical data were collected by wastewater utilities and associated geocoded clinical covid 19 data were collected by public health departments table 1 2 1 wastewater sample collection and physicochemical data 24 hour time weighted composite samples of raw wastewater were collected using teledyne isco autosamplers some samples were collected and processed with extraction replicates i e wastewater subsamples were aliquoted from the same composite sample but independently extracted after collection all samples were transported to the lab on ice stored at either 20 c or 80 c and then thawed at 4 c for 36 48 hours before extractions wastewater data was not individually identifiable therefore no institutional review board approval was needed more information on location specific data collection and wastewater sampling transport storage and extraction replicates is provided in table 1 and the supplementary

population data is provided in table 1 and si section e 2 3 wastewater sample processing via the 4s method wastewater samples were extracted following the 4s method whitney 2020 whitney et al 2021 with a minor modification the elution buffer was not pre warmed instead it was added to the column and the column was heated at 50 c for 10 minutes before centrifugation to collect the eluate both rna and dna were captured fig s1 each extraction batch contained a negative extraction control and each sample or control was spiked with a surrogate virus control bovilis coronavirus merck animal health bcov and a free rna control synthetic oligomer construct soc bcov and soc concentrations were significantly and strongly correlated τ 0 57 p 0 05 because it is not possible to independently quantify the surrogate spike without the influence of extraction efficiency kantor et al 2021b extraction controls were used to assess consistency of extractions rather than recovery outlier analysis alpha 0

in si section d 2 5 assessing pcr inhibition via serial dilution and an internal amplification control to our knowledge there is no standard methodology for assessing pcr inhibition in raw wastewater samples we combined two approaches to assess pcr inhibition in raw wastewater samples a non competitive internal amplification control ahmed et al 2020b nolan et al 2006 schrader et al 2012 staley et al 2012 and serial dilution graham et al 2020 the internal amplification control can easily be included in every sample but cannot detect assay specific inhibition schrader et al 2012 serial dilution consumes more resources and risks diluting the target signal below the detection limit but it more accurately tests the target itself and allows selection of a dilution value that best reduces the impacts of inhibition thus we used the vetmax xeno internal positive control thermofisher scientific assay duplexed with the n1 assay as a screening tool to select samples for further testing with serial dilution for all samples xeno rna was spiked into the reaction mix table s2 and ntcs were used as an inhibition free baseline to compare each sample on that plate ten samples showed 2 cq deviation from the baseline and were selected for further inhibition testing staley et al 2012 a dilution series 1x 2x 5x 10x was performed on these samples and the duplexed n1 and xeno assay was repeated a dilution was chosen by comparing sars cov 2 n1 signal in each dilution to theoretical expectations based on theoretical doubling per pcr cycle if diluting the sample led to a 1 cq difference between actual and expected change in cq then the sample at the base dilution was deemed inhibited as in graham et al 2020 following the serial dilution test only three samples required dilution table s9 and subsequent qpcr results in this study are reported using this chosen dilution results from the internal amplification control were inconsistent with inhibition assessed via serial dilution and we do not recommend the use of xeno for testing n1 inhibition in future studies 2 6 data analysis all data analysis was performed in python v3 6 9 using key modules pandas v1 1 5 numpy v1 19 5 scipy v1 4 1 and plotnine v0 6 0 2 6 1 normalization biomarker analyses for n1 normalization to biomarkers n1 gene copies per liter gc l was divided by the normalization biomarker concentration gc l to calculate flow scaled biomarker load gc person day target concentration gc l was multiplied by mean flow for the sampling location mgd and a unit conversion factor liter per million gallons and then divided by population daily flow rate data were not available for s n and a locations upstream of a treatment facility table s1 so mean dry weather flow rates and population were used to scale data when comparing across locations we expect that the mean flow rate likely approximates the daily flow rate throughout the study period but this may not hold true in other locations and seasons for comparisons of biomarker concentrations and variation fig 2 a kruskal wallis test scipy v1 4 1 was performed followed by pairwise dunn s tests scikit posthocs v0 6 6 to determine statistical differences rank correlations between wastewater and case data fig 3 were calculated as kendall s tau b coefficients τ scipy v1 4 1 a method adapted for left censored data i e

coefficients of variation cv were calculated as the arithmetic standard deviation divided by the mean while geometric coefficients of variation gcv were calculated as the geometric standard deviation minus one 2 6 2 assessment of an apparent wbe case detection limit an apparent wbe case detection limit was estimated as follows the paired wastewater and case data for all sewersheds were combined and sorted from highest to lowest case counts for each case count all rt qpcr replicates in the wastewater data at and above that point were tallied to determine the cumulative percentage of replicates that amplified in rt qpcr equation 1 was used to fit a logistic function kyurkchiev and markov 2016 to the dataset scipy v1 4 1 where y is the fraction of amplified rt qpcr replicates x is the log10 moving average of new cases per person per day k sets the growth rate of y and γ sets the inflection point zero new cases per capita cannot be represented in a logistic growth model but in this study case values of zero were only available for location q and these values were substituted as 0 5 cases before the analysis the covid 19 per capita case rate that corresponded to 95 cumulative amplification of rt qpcr replicates was reported as the apparent wbe case detection limit and the analysis was repeated with samples where daily per capita cases were provided as masked

with bandwidth parameter α the fraction of the dataset used for smoothing set as previously shown jacoby 2000 figs 4 and s2 s5 lowess trends of sars cov 2 n1 signal were also visualized as heatmaps to aid in discerning peaks figs s6 and s7 the full dataset and associated code are available through github https zenodo org record 4730990 yixkrqlkguo 3 results raw wastewater was collected weekly from april to september 2020 at six locations table 1 the resulting dataset includes 91 samples 155 including extraction replicates which were paired with geocoded clinical testing data and analyzed for sars cov 2 along with four potential normalization biomarkers crassphage pmmov bacteroides rrna and human 18s rrna this dataset was generated from the san francisco bay area in separate sanitary sewer systems during a period with minimal rainfall see methods which naturally controlled for variability in wastewater strength due to precipitation thus we expected the concentrations of the measured normalization biomarkers to be relatively stable additionally geocoded clinical testing data included a range of per capita covid 19 case rates that varied by location 3 1 crassphage and pmmov were the most consistent biomarkers a subset of samples from all locations was used in experiments fig 2 comparing crassphage 98 unique samples 153 extraction replicates pmmov 93 unique samples 95 extraction replicates bacteroides rrna 97 unique samples 99 extraction replicates and 18s rrna 40 unique samples 41 extraction replicates as biomarkers for normalization to fecal content all normalization biomarkers were detected at high concentrations table s10 in all samples tested except for 18s rrna which was inconsistently quantifiable fig s8 flow rates and chemical wastewater parameters tss bod cod cbod were not consistently measured by utilities table s1 thus robust comparisons of physicochemical biomarkers could not be made in the absence of daily flow rate data we used mean flow rate to scale wastewater biomarker concentrations by the per capita wastewater flow for each sewershed to account for differences across sewersheds fig 2 mean per capita flow rates were similar for all locations except q a facility table 1 generally resulting in little change after flow scaling for this reason flow scaling was applied to compare biomarkers but unnormalized sars cov 2 n1 concentrations are used as a baseline in later analyses an ideal normalization biomarker would have minimal spatial variation in per capita shedding rates and minimal temporal differences in wastewater loads when flow rates are stable as they were in this study two methods were used to evaluate biomarker variability fig 2 i comparing per capita biomarker loads gene copies person day to assess differences in observed shedding by location and ii evaluating the temporal variation of loads for each location consistent with recent studies ahmed et al 2020d d aoust et al 2021b crassphage and pmmov were the least variable biomarkers across locations and over time mean gcvcrassphage 59 and mean gcvpmmov 56 not statistically different p 0 05 in contrast bacteroides rrna displayed more variability both spatially fig 2 and temporally mean gcv 130 and 18s rrna varied dramatically mean gcv 500 fig s8 crassphage pmmov and bacteroides rrna were quantifiable in all samples tested but 18s rrna was below the lod for 24 of samples furthermore 18s rrna was the only biomarker that amplified in the extraction negative controls 75 at similar levels as the samples p 0 05 fig s9 which suggests that this target could be a common laboratory contaminant based on our findings that 18s rrna was frequently detected in negative controls inconsistently detected in sewage and had high spatial and temporal variation in per capita shedding we conclude that human 18s rrna is not suitable as a normalization biomarker to adjust for fecal content location e had lower biomarker concentrations fig 2 frequently undetected 18s rrna fig s9 and high variability in n1 signal we suspect that these samples had rna degradation because i location e is the largest sewershed in the study i e longer residence time allowing for signal degradation and ii some samples from this site thawed during transportation back to the lab resulting in an additional freeze thaw cycle which could degrade rna ahmed et al 2020c coryell et al 2020 data from sewershed e were excluded from subsequent analyses because of the uncertainty surrounding the integrity of these samples 3 2 sars cov 2 n1 and clinical testing data were correlated in aggregate and normalization biomarkers did not strengthen this relationship the sars cov 2 n1 concentration in wastewater was moderately correlated to daily per capita clinical cases when aggregated across all locations τ 0 43 p 0 0001 fig 3 however there are several limitations to assessing correlation between clinical data and wastewater data first clinical testing data do not necessarily represent true incidence because of biases associated with testing including that asymptomatic cases are often not detected through clinical testing similarly wastewater testing data do not necessarily represent true incidence because studies have found that fecal shedding is less common than nasopharyngeal shedding in symptomatic individuals parasa et al 2020 thus there may be covid 19 cases that are detected through clinical public health surveillance but not through wastewater surveillance and vice versa furthermore viral load has been shown to vary throughout an infection and to differ in nasopharyngeal and fecal samples benefield et al 2020 walsh et al 2020 even if clinical and wastewater testing data correspond to the same date fecal shedding could peak before symptom onset which would impact the correlation unless the correct time offset is applied to reflect this discrepancy hoffmann and alsing 2021 additionally for this analysis clinical and wastewater testing data would ideally both correspond to the sample collection date as opposed to the result date to remove lag introduced by test result turnaround time see section 3 3 for more information however often only one date was available for clinical testing for example in this analysis the only date associated with the daily per capita cases from most locations all but k was the date that the testing results were provided result date while the date associated with the sars cov 2 n1 wastewater signal was the sample collection date finally due to the limited sizes and variation in individual datasets correlations were assessed for all locations in aggregate despite site specific factors that may influence the significance site specific analyses are conducted later in this section despite these potential limitations correlation to daily per capita covid 19 cases was used as a metric to assess the effect of normalization to biomarkers crassphage pmmov and bacteroides rrna moderate significant correlations were observed with covid 19 daily per capita cases when sars cov 2 n1 was unnormalized and normalized by crassphage or bacteroides τunnormalized 0 43 τcrassphage 0 38 and τ bacteroides 0 35 p 0 0001 fig 3 notably normalization did not strengthen the correlation compared to unnormalized signal conversely pmmov normalization produced only a weak correlation of 0 18 p 0 05 fig 3 analysis was performed with and without samples that were below the limit of detection and produced similar results table s11 of the normalization biomarkers tested crassphage had the lowest variability and also maintained significant and moderate correlation with clinical testing data so we included it in subsequent analyses alongside unnormalized concentrations the correlation analysis was repeated with data separated by location to determine whether locational dependencies affect the relationship between wastewater and clinical testing data as well as the performance of normalization strategies locations with at least 75 of data above the n1 qpcr lod locations k n and s table s12 were included in this analysis only location k had significant correlations with clinical testing data both with and without crassphage normalization τunnormalized 0 5 and τcrassphage 0 43 p 0 05 fig s10 location k is the only site with three extraction replicates for each sample which likely captured a more representative signal than that of locations s or n the lack of significance of correlation for locations s and n could also be due to the short time series that may not vary enough to establish rank location s or may have impacts of outside factors such as clinical undertesting location a that skew the rank overall locational dependencies e g differences in extent of clinical testing sewer system residence times etc likely affect the correlation with clinical testing data and should be considered when evaluating aggregated data additionally the location specific analysis was repeated including only samples with detectable sars cov 2 n1 signal and the results were no longer statistically significant fig s10 this finding is likely influenced by both the limited sample size and values below the n1 qpcr lod that affect rank correlations in addition to the limitations in clinical testing data mentioned at the beginning of this section there are several explanations for why wastewater signal at locations s n and k did not significantly correlate with clinical testing data after removing values below the lod i the daily per capita cases in the population were at or below the wbe case detection limit of the wastewater data ii the daily per capita cases that were masked by public health departments for patient privacy impaired the rank correlation analysis by left censoring the clinical testing data iii the wastewater signal did not vary enough over the time of sampling to establish rank the possibility that the wastewater signal leads the clinical testing data was subsequently tested for locations k n and s i e correlations were examined for zero one and two week offsets however location k was the only location with significant correlation between wastewater and clinical testing data for any lead time tested fig s10 3 3 impact of the date associated with clinical testing data on lead time in wastewater surveillance at location k the time for laboratories to process samples and return results testing turnaround time affects the potential for wastewater surveillance to provide lead time over clinical surveillance in general clinical testing data correspond to either the date the sample was collected or the date the results were returned the ideal date to use for informing public health decisions would be the result date to include differences between clinical and wastewater testing turnaround time in the analysis alternatively sample collection dates should be compared to understand the timing of the underlying biological mechanisms that result in a positive wastewater signal onset and duration of fecal shedding and positive clinical test onset and duration of nasopharyngeal shedding onset and duration of symptoms may influence the timing of the clinical test sample collection date depending on whether testing is routine or only available to symptomatic individuals hence the ideal date to use for comparison of wastewater and clinical testing data differs depending on the goals of the comparison the clinical testing data for location k included sample collection date result date and episode date the earliest date associated with the case allowing us to assess the correlation between case data and wastewater data with and without clinical testing turnaround time episode date was frequently the same as the sample collection date unless a patient reported symptoms prior to test date fig s11 it should be noted that wastewater testing data correspond to the sample collection date because all samples were processed retroactively in this study routine wastewater testing turnaround time in the san francisco bay area has been reported to be two days or fewer for most samples but this value varies depending on sample transport and laboratory methods covid web n d kantor et al 2021a to test the influence of the date associated with clinical testing we repeated correlation analysis for location k fig s11 the wastewater testing data sample collection date correlated with the clinical testing data by episode date τepisode unnormalized 0 56 τepisode crassphage 0 54 p 0 01 and sample collection date τcollection unnormalized 0 59 τcollection crassphage 0 62 p 0 01 without a lead or lag when the result date was used for clinical testing data the strongest correlation with wastewater data was associated with a two week lead time unnormalized n1 concentration or one week lead time n1 normalized to crassphage figs s10 and s11 when values below the n1 qpcr lod were removed wastewater data were no longer significantly correlated with episode date associated clinical data but the strongest correlations for the other date associations remained significant this analysis is limited because of the small dataset but the methodology presented here can be used to assess the lead time provided by wastewater surveillance with larger data sets and with wastewater data processed contemporaneously with decision making 3 4 the lowess bandwidth parameter affected wastewater data trend interpretation variation in wastewater sars cov 2 n1 signal from sources other than variation in true incidence or prevalence e g noise introduced during sample collection processing etc can obscure temporal trends smoothing techniques can be used to visually distinguish temporal trends from noise similar to the choice of the number of days included for each average calculation for moving averages window lowess requires selection of the fraction of the whole time series that is used for each local regression calculation bandwidth we employed a method to set the bandwidth parameter systematically based on residuals jacoby 2000 independently for each location the bandwidth was increased stepwise beginning with inclusion of one point in each local regression calculation and ending with inclusion of all points α 1 for each bandwidth value the residuals were calculated and plotted by date and a lowess trendline with α 1 was fit to these residual plots to monitor residual trends as the bandwidth varied finally the maximum bandwidth value was selected for which the residuals visually maintained horizontal lowess trendlines see figs 4 and s2 s5 as an example for unnormalized and crassphage normalized sars cov 2 n1 bandwidth parameters of 0 39 and 0 33 were respectively chosen for location n fig 4 a this process was repeated for all locations and bandwidths in the range of 0 25 0 6 were selected based on the optimization procedure see figs 4 and s2 s5 to assess the impact of bandwidth on sars cov 2 n1 signal interpretation lowess was performed for all locations sampled and for all possible bandwidths see figs 4 b and s2 s5 the bandwidth parameter influenced the overall temporal trends of wastewater data for some locations n and a figs 4 and s5 for example at location a fig s5 a bandwidth of 1 resulted in a gradual increase in sars cov 2 n1 signal during sampling while a bandwidth of 0 73 resulted in a peak around july however for location k fig s2 all bandwidths resulted in trends that would have similar interpretations these results illustrate that choice of bandwidth could have implications for interpreting wbe data and informing covid 19 response strategies and systematic methods should be used to select the appropriate bandwidth 3 5 wastewater and clinical data had similar overall trends regardless of normalization with notable exceptions to assess the impact of crassphage normalization on sars cov 2 n1 temporal trends we compared unnormalized and crassphage normalized lowess trendlines fig 5 we found that crassphage normalized trends were similar to unnormalized trends for three of the locations k n and a but had differences in overall trend for locations q fig 6 and s fig s12 discrepancies are concerning because they could have implications for pandemic response we note that the trend in location k for which extraction replicates were processed routinely was the least impacted by bandwidth or normalization figs s2 and s12 and was the only site analyzed with significant correlation with clinical data fig s10 larger datasets with more frequent sampling and processing of replicates would give single points less influence over the trend relative spatio temporal trends in clinical and wastewater testing results were compared across sampling sites figs 5 s6 and s7 in general clinical and wastewater data at all locations paralleled one another with san quentin prison q showing the highest covid 19 burden across locations due to a covid 19 outbreak location q had a maximum that was 53 times sars cov 2 n1 4 89 103 gene copies ml 17 times crassphage normalized sars cov 2 n1 ratio 2 9 10 3 and 203 times 85 new cases per 1000 people on 6 29 higher than the highest value at the sewershed scale there were a few discrepancies between clinical and wastewater trends heatmap visualizations in figs s6 and s7 highlight discrepancies in peaks for example at location n there may have been clinical undertesting based on the peak in wastewater data in august figs 5 and s6 and higher sars cov 2 signal in wastewater at location n relative to other locations than represented by the clinical data figs 5 and s7 3 6 the apparent wbe case detection limit was estimated to be 2 4 covid 19 cases per 100 000 people quantifying the minimum per capita new covid 19 cases in a sewershed at which there is reliable detection of sars cov 2 n1 in wastewater apparent wbe case detection limit is important for gauging the utility of covid 19 wbe when the true incidence is low this apparent wbe case detection limit depends on the detection limit of the wastewater measurement i e on the methods used to store concentrate extract and measure sars cov 2 rna in wastewater and the accuracy of the clinical testing data available as described in more detail in section 3 3 ideally this value would be calculated using the true incidence but that information is generally not available and the best available data should be used instead this limit will vary over time and location with the extent of clinical testing but could be useful in a practical sense to compare wastewater and clinical surveillance efforts locally to estimate an apparent wbe case detection limit in a way that is replicable across studies the cumulative percentage of amplified rt qpcr replicates of the wastewater data for inversely ranked daily per capita covid 19 cases was fit to a logistic growth model without samples associated with masked case values see methods when covid 19 case rates equaled or exceeded 2 4 daily cases per 100 000 people 95 of wastewater rt qpcr replicates amplified via rt qpcr for n1 fig 7 other researchers have used non cumulative methods to estimate an apparent wbe case detection limit by calculating the percent of amplified wastewater replicates for each case value wu et al 2021 this method requires repeated wastewater measurements associated with each possible clinical case value or range of case values i e bins otherwise the percent of amplified rt qpcr replicates is limited as was the case in this study where only one extraction replicate was often associated with each case number fig s13 a ideally all data would be unmasked when applying this method to verify that the masked clinical data did not affect the apparent wbe case detection limit the process was repeated with masked values and the estimate was similar 2 2 cases in 100 000 people fig s13 b these limits are within the theoretical range possible hart and halden 2020b and similar in magnitude to previous findings of 10 in 100 000 hata and honda 2020 and 13 in 100 000 wu et al 2021 based on the contributing population of each sewershed in this study the apparent wbe case detection limit translates to 11 6 cases for k 11 3 cases for s 3 3 cases for n 2 0 cases for a and 0 1 cases for q therefore theoretically a single case should be detectable at location q based on results from this analysis but this could not be tested observationally because there was only one instance when a single new case was detected by clinical testing after august 12th fig 6 only one rt qpcr replicate amplified for two samples taken within seven days of the single clinical case detected and these samples were classified below the limit of detection larger data sets with more instances of single clinical case detections are needed to assess the ability to detect a single case from this facility nonetheless a single case may still go undetected despite being above the apparent wbe case detection limit for example sars cov 2 rna is not shed consistently in stool samples of all infected individuals parasa et al 2020 and wastewater surveillance relies on the autosampler aliquots capturing the feces from each infected individual which becomes less likely when there are fewer infected individuals and wastewater has less mixing prior to the sampling location despite these limitations other studies have reported detection of one case in wastewater from residential facilities ranging from 60 to 415 people gibas et al 2021 karthikeyan et al 2021 spurbeck et al 2021 more work is needed applying wbe for sars cov 2 across a broader set of facilities with longer time series and higher frequency sampling 4 discussion 4 1 validation and potential use scenarios of sars cov 2 wastewater testing during the covid 19 pandemic both the methodological research for sars cov 2 testing in wastewater and the application of wbe have been occurring simultaneously for covid 19 wbe to be useful for public health decision making public health officials need to be confident that the resulting sars cov 2 signal reflects covid 19 trends in the contributing population despite limitations in clinical testing data and the potential lag in wastewater trends assessing correlations between clinical and wastewater testing data can help validate wbe xagoraraki and o brien 2020 moderate correlations with clinical data observed in this study τ 0 43 support that trends in wastewater surveillance data reflect trends in covid 19 disease occurrence however locational dependencies were observed wastewater data paired with clinical data can be a more robust public health surveillance strategy compared to either method alone both for sewershed scale and facility scale surveillance applications in some settings wastewater testing may be a less resource intensive way to implement population scale surveillance and policymakers will need to balance allocation of resources to each approach a critical question for public health decision making is how much early warning wbe can provide ahead of clinical testing which could allow more timely public health responses to slow covid 19 outbreaks however lead time is difficult to measure biologically the time between onset of fecal shedding and nasal shedding is unclear benefield et al 2020 walsh et al 2020 practically lead time depends on testing turnaround time and frequency of sampling for both wastewater and clinical testing for example clinical testing capabilities can increase the lead time of wastewater data if patients are only tested after symptom onset and can decrease the lead time if asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals are regularly screened with rapid turnaround time ideal assessments of wastewater data lead time due to biological mechanisms would not include turnaround time whereas assessments of the performance of clinical and wastewater laboratories for public health action and practical limitations would include turnaround time although other studies observed lead time for wastewater data over clinical data starting on the order of days d aoust et al 2021a nemudryi et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 the weekly sampling in our study could explain why no lead time was determined when the sample collection date was used for both wastewater and clinical testing data fig s14 however the impact of clinical testing strategy i e only screening symptomatic individuals could also be affecting this result we could not directly compare wastewater and clinical result dates in this retroactive study but when clinical data were associated with the result date and wastewater data were associated with sample collection date lead time of 1 2 weeks was observed fig s14 other researchers have observed lead time in wastewater data of up to three weeks ahmed et al 2021 medema et al 2020 and our results reflect a similar range in possible lead times 0 2 weeks depending on which date is associated with the clinical data at the sewershed scale the benefit of wbe to public health extends beyond early warning discrepancies between wastewater testing data and clinical testing data trends from early in the time series at location n april july 2020 fig s12 could be used to infer clinical undertesting which is supported by lower testing capacity in this time frame at nearby location k figs 1 s15 although pairing covid 19 clinical testing data with wastewater sars cov 2 data can generate new insights for public health decision making it can be challenging in practice pairing wastewater sars cov 2 data with geocoded covid 19 clinical testing data required collaboration between academics wastewater treatment facility representatives and public health officials these collaborations may be particularly difficult at sewershed scale where multiple public health department jurisdictions overlap within one sewershed e g location n partnerships for data sharing between agencies are critical to support ongoing wastewater based epidemiology for sars cov 2 and other pathogens at the facility scale monitoring raw wastewater for sars cov 2 might be particularly useful for early detection of covid 19 outbreaks especially when resources are insufficient for routine clinical testing of all individuals san quentin prison location q had a covid 19 outbreak during the study period after a transfer from the california institution for men cassidy and fagone 2020 where at its peak 47 of the incarcerated population had active covid 19 cases the maximum sars cov 2 n1 concentration 4 89 103 gene copies ml was higher than any sewershed sampled in this study and among the highest values we found in the literature for n1 in raw wastewater gerrity et al 2021 gonzalez et al 2020 medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020b wu et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 despite regular clinical testing fig s15 prison conditions cause incarcerated people to be particularly susceptible to respiratory disease outbreaks and maintaining safety in prisons requires deliberate planning and coordination by correctional institutions e g coordination with local public health systems to develop pandemic response plans coordination of transfers between institutions etc montoya barthelemy et al 2020 furthermore the health of incarcerated people is linked to the health of the surrounding community and incorporating correctional institutions into community safety plans will help ensure better protection against covid 19 for everyone montoya barthelemy et al 2020 once protective measures are implemented wbe may be useful to monitor prisons and other high risk facilities e g skilled nursing facilities homeless shelters etc especially where clinical testing is not available or routine 4 2 tools for translatable wbe 4 2 1 normalization of wastewater targets to adjust for fecal content results from this study suggest that pmmov bacteroides rrna and 18s rrna were less promising normalization biomarkers than crassphage while pmmov was present in high and stable concentrations the diet dependency symonds et al 2019 and large range in concentrations in the literature six orders of magnitude table s10 remain concerns for its use over longer time scales and across larger geographic regions normalization to pmmov resulted in the weakest significant correlation to clinical testing data of the biomarkers tested τ 0 18 p 0 05 bacteroides rrna loads varied more spatially and temporally than crassphage or pmmov in this study fig 2 but bacteroides normalized sars cov 2 n1 had a moderate correlation with clinical testing data τ 0 35 while measurement of bacteroides rrna gene in wastewater has been commonly applied for fecal source tracking and bacteroides rrna has been targeted to increase assay sensitivity d aoust et al 2021b feng et al 2021 to our knowledge no prior raw wastewater values have been reported in the literature for bacteroides rrna table s10 similarly no values were found in the literature for 18s rrna concentrations in raw wastewater table s10 in this study 18s rrna signal displayed a wide range in concentrations and consistently amplified in negative extraction controls furthermore 18s rrna was less stable in wastewater than sars cov 2 rna and nonenveloped viruses e g crassphage and pmmov which is consistent with previous studies whitney et al 2021 wurtzer et al 2020 therefore we do not recommend 18s rrna use as a normalization biomarker in comparison to all the biomarkers tested crassphage had low spatial variability i e the fewest locations with statistically different loads fig 2 and temporal variability gcv 59 fig 2 additionally sars cov 2 n1 normalized to crassphage correlated with daily per capita covid 19 cases τ 0 38 although crassphage concentrations in the literature had a wide range six orders of magnitude table s10 they were consistent across locations in this study based on this dataset and findings from earlier studies that biomarker normalization has utility in some settings d aoust et al 2021b wu et al 2020 wolfe et al 2021 crassphage remains a promising endogenous normalization biomarker for broader wbe applications that require adjustment for fecal content although a standardized approach would facilitate comparisons across studies the ideal normalization strategy may be situationally dependent for example in this study biomarker normalization did not improve correlations to clinical data compared to unnormalized signal which is in contrast to other studies that found normalization to pmmov improved relationships with clinical data however these conclusions were based on visual inspection of trends rather than correlations wu et al 2020 or measurements made in sludge rather than raw wastewater samples d aoust et al 2021b wolfe et al 2021 findings from this study suggest that biomarker normalization may have limited utility when comparing intra study composite samples across a confined region with stable wastewater flows which is in agreement with recent studies where biomarker normalization did not improve associations with clinical data feng et al 2021 graham et al 2020 several factors should be considered when deciding whether to normalize to a biomarker or report unnormalized concentrations first adding another assay introduces additional analytical variation that could outweigh the benefits of biomarker normalization in some settings especially when wastewater fecal content is expected to be stable across samples feng et al 2021 an additional consideration is ensuring methods compatibility with the wbe target and normalization biomarker ideally normalization to an endogenous biomarker would account for losses in target signal during residence time in sewers sample storage and laboratory processing but the ideal biomarker for fecal content may not be the best surrogate for the target of interest for example crassphage is not expected to be a good surrogate for sars cov 2 stability partitioning and extraction ye et al 2016 and as a dna virus crassphage may be incompatible with some extraction methods used for sars cov 2 rna other controls e g endogenous biomarkers recovery controls and modeling may be applied to improve measurement accuracy and translate results across labs and methods although there are challenges associated with these corrections kantor et al 2021b wolfe et al 2021 degradation modeling with target specific decay constants ahmed et al 2020a and sewershed specific parameters could assist in correcting for degradation or determining sample integrity but no comprehensive approach for this correction exists and more work is needed developing these methods 4 2 2 a systematic approach for data smoothing lowess in general public health decisions are based on temporal trends in disease burden not individual data points but trends in wastewater and clinical data can be difficult to visually distinguish especially when available resources constrain sampling frequencies applying lowess to wastewater data we found that the value of one parameter could influence the trend visualization such that the same dataset could lead to different public health responses figs 4 and s5 based on our analysis the bandwidth parameter for lowess should be determined for each sewershed sampled lowess with a systematically chosen bandwidth could be used to smooth trendlines and minimize the loss of temporal resolution the method presented here could be applied in retrospective analysis or in real time analysis completed as part of wastewater public health surveillance programs for real time applications the bandwidth parameter could be selected using a subset of data and the residuals plot could be frequently checked to ensure no new residual patterns emerge over time that could obscure the smoothed trend 4 2 3 a systematic approach to estimate an apparent wbe case detection limit our approach for identifying an apparent wbe case detection limit that can be applied systematically to studies using pcr based methods we applied this analysis to sars cov 2 n1 signal in wastewater and found that the daily new clinical cases at which wastewater surveillance could reliably detect clinically diagnosed covid 19 cases in the contributing population was estimated at 2 4 cases per 100 000 people there are multiple limitations to this analysis because wastewater detection depends on factors other than incidence such as sampling methods e g frequency of sampling aliquots which can influence the probability of capturing shed viral particles from an infected individual additionally the estimate may vary based on site specific clinical testing availability wastewater sampling methods e g composite sampling freezing before processing and laboratory processing e g 4s extraction method rt qpcr the estimation method for an apparent wbe case detection limit presented here could benefit both covid 19 wbe and other disease wbe by providing a systematic method to compare wastewater and clinical testing capabilities locally 5 conclusion wastewater n1 concentrations had a moderate correlation with geocoded clinical testing data τunnormalized 0 43 normalization of sars cov 2 n1 signal in wastewater to any biomarker did not improve the correlation with clinical testing data likely because of the low variation in daily flow rates of the four normalization biomarkers tested crassphage was the most promising due to low spatial and temporal variability and because crassphage normalized n1 had the strongest correlation with clinical testing data τcrassphage 0 38 τ bacteroides 0 35 τpmmov 0 18 18s rrna was not suitable as a normalization biomarker due to its variability in sample concentrations high degradation rate and ubiquity as a laboratory contaminant discrepancies between wastewater and clinical testing data provided evidence of clinical undertesting at location n which supports that wastewater testing could provide insights about covid 19 trends in the population when clinical testing capabilities are limited the covid 19 outbreak at san quentin prison location q corresponded to a measured n1 concentration that was higher than any sewershed tested 4 89 103 gene copies ml the wastewater based epidemiology case detection limit using the 4s rna extraction method on frozen samples was estimated to be 2 4 covid 19 cases in 100 000 people lead time in wastewater over clinical testing varied from 0 to 3 weeks depending on the location biomarker normalization and testing turnaround time systematic approaches for determining an apparent wbe case detection limit biomarker normalization and trendline smoothing were presented that can be applied in future wbe studies declaration of
