19020,this study has demonstrated that hydroxylamine ha could greatly enhance cu nanoparticles ncu in activating molecular oxygen and significantly elevate the diclofenac dcf degradation rate about two orders of magnitude in neutral circumstances effects of several important parameters on the dcf degradation such as ncu loading ha dosage ph and reaction temperature were investigated in the ncu ha o2 system multiple examinations revealed that the reactive cu iii species instead of oh would be predominant in the ncu ha o2 system despite their similar dcf degradation pathways based on a ha enhanced copper cycle depending on the pristine cu0 cu i hydro oxides core shell structure the heterogeneous homogeneous reaction mechanism was proposed it included solid liquid interfacial and bulk reactions e g heterogeneous activation of o2 by cu i to produce h2o2 and homogeneous cu i catalytic generation of cu iii from h2o2 further quantitative investigation of the main reactive species in the cycle revealed that the cu i regeneration instead of the o2 activation would be rate limited besides ncu could be recycled to effectively degrade dcf in four consecutive cycles in the raw neural ncu ha o2 system it suggested that the ncu ha o2 system with a more efficient copper cycle would be a good alternative fenton like system in treating neutral recalcitrant organic wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords cu nanoparticles neutral copper cycle molecule oxygen activation hydroxylamine fenton like 1 introduction fenton reaction which generates strong oxidant hydroxyl radical via the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 by fe2 i e haber weiss cycle has been generally acknowledged as an effective method for non selective oxidation of recalcitrant organic compounds neyens and baeyens 2003 however its application is commonly limited by slow regeneration of ferrous catalysts and essential acidic reaction circumstances that lead to excessive fe2 consumption as well as and large amounts of iron sludge qin et al 2015 hence some reductants e g ascorbate burkitt and gilbert 1990 protocatechuic acid qin et al 2015 and hydroxylamine ha chen et al 2011 had been used to maintain the effective iron cycle it was found that the regeneration of fe ii from fe iii could be effectively accelerated at ph up to 5 7 but became very slow in neutral circumstances recently cu i has been recognized as a more efficient fenton like catalyst since its reaction rate with h2o2 kcu i h2o2 4 105 m 1 s 1 was about four orders of magnitude higher than fe ii h2o2 kfe ii h2o2 63 76 m 1 s 1 moffett and zika 1987 qin et al 2015 despite that the reduction of cu ii by h2o2 is still slow perez benito 2001 the copper based fenton like system would be more suitable than the iron based technologies in neutral alkaline circumstances kankala et al 2015 2017a 2017b peng et al 2016 due to the much lower pkso of cu oh 2 as compared to fe oh 3 snoeyink and vernon 1980 moreover cu i could also activate molecular oxygen more efficiently than fe ii for creating reactive oxygen species ros in situ bhagidamodaran et al 2017 nevertheless rather slow regeneration of cu i would still block operation of the neutral copper cycle and inhibit the fenton like reactions perez benito 2004 ha could be used to maintain the neutral copper cycle in a cu ii o2 system for degrading benzoate continuously lee et al 2016 but it was noted that abundant ha 5 0 mm could only lead to c a 80 removal of 0 1 mm benzoate at ph 7 0 suggesting a rather low homogeneous electron utilizing efficiency during the o2 activation in heterogeneous iron based fenton like systems zero valent iron nano particles zvi are generally adopted to support a full and rapid iron cycle in promoting the heterogeneous or homogeneous generation of ros as well as degradation of target pollutants zhou et al 2008 the corrosion of zvi could continuously supply fe ii and accelerate the reduction of ferric on the surface moreover the surface bond fe ii on the surface of nzvi was thought to be more reactive for oxygen activation ai et al 2013 as reported in our recent studies the core shell structures of iron iron oxides could also enhance the heterogeneous homogeneous iron cycles xiang et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 analogous to zvi zero valent copper nanoparticles ncu was also able to activate molecular oxygen but degraded dna inefficiently at ph of 7 jose et al 2011 our verification test indicated that the generated h2o2 accumulated during the reaction it suggested that the neutral catalytic decomposition of h2o2 by ncu would be delayed or suppressed in the other hand although ha could maintain the neutral homogeneous copper cycle its performance in ncu based heterogeneous o2 activation systems has never been reported so far therefore in this study an ncu ha o2 system was established for the rapid catalytic degradation of a typical pharmaceutical pollutant diclofenac dcf which has been previously used as a substrate in some iron based fenton like systems chong et al 2017 ziylan et al 2013 after the investigations on parameters effects and ncu characterizations our main purpose was to reveal the ha enhanced neutral efficient copper cycle depending on the core shell ncu besides quantitative study of the reactive species during the copper cycle was conducted it would help us to clearly extinguish the rate limited steps during the cycle the cu i induced activation of o2 and or catalysis of h2o2 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemical were used as received diclofenac

neocuproine complex were examined at 250 mm dmso and neocuproine of different concentrations besides hcho was measured in the cases with different amounts of additional h2o2 to understand the

microscopy fetem tecnai g2 f30 3 results and discussion 3 1 synergistic degradation of dcf in the ncu ha o2 system and parameters investigation fig 1 exhibits the time dependent degradation of dcf in three comparative systems in the buffered neutral circumstance it was found that dcf was marginally removed by either ncu o2 or ha alone systems the related pseudo first order kinetic degradation constant kncu o2 dcf obs and kha dcf obs was 3 3 1 3 10 4 and 0 5 2 0 10 4 min 1 respectively it indicated that the direct oxidization of organic pollutant by ncu was very slow jose et al 2011 and ha would be inert to dcf or o2 without ncu combining ha and ncu i e the ncu ha o2 system would significantly enhance the dcf degradation the kncu ha o2 dcf obs value could be elevated with two orders of magnitude to 2 5 0 14 10 2 min 1 besides oxygen was also evidenced to be critical to the dcf degradation fig s2 these results revealed that ha would greatly promote the activation efficiency of molecular oxygen by copper species hou et al 2017 lee et al 2016 and suggested the presence of a homogeneous and or heterogeneous reaction mechanism including ha and ncu afterwards effects of several important parameters on the degradation of dcf were investigated in the ncu ha o2 system and the descriptions are listed as follows 3 1 1 effect of ha dosage fig 2 a shows that increasing ha dosage from 0 2 to 1 6 mm would be positive to the dcf degradation in the ncu ha o2 system it was reported that ha could rapidly reduce the surface fe iii of goethite and lead to a surface iron cycle hou et al 2017 similarly a surface cu ii cu i cycle would be suggested in the ncu ha o2 system eqs 1 4 the regeneration of surface cu i eq 1 would be most important during the cycle since it was liable to activation of o2 eqs 2 and 3 and fenton like decomposition of h2o2 eq 4 lanci et al 2007 moffett and zika 1987 furthermore it was found that the simultaneous depletion curve of ha fig s3 was consistent with the corresponding dcf degradation curve it suggested that the regenerated production of cu i would be satisfied to the occurrences of the cu induced fenton like reactions 1 cu ii 1 2nh2oh cu i 1 4n2o 1 4h2o h 2 cu i o2 cu ii o2 3 cu i 2h o2 cu ii h2o2 4 h2o2 cu i cu ii oh oh or cu iii 2oh obviously more amounts of ha could accelerate the reduction of cu ii to cu i in the system and lead to higher production of reactive oxidative species eqs 2 4 in addition the presence of ha would dramatically accelerate the copper dissolution fig s4 resulting in a companying homogeneous cu ii ha o2 degradation mechanism lee et al 2016 therefore it could be concluded that ha would not only maintain accelerate the surface copper cycle in the ncu ha o2 system but also induce a simultaneous homogeneous copper cycle 3 1 2 effect of ncu dosage although the presence of ncu was essential to the heterogeneous and homogeneous copper cycles increasing ncu dosage from 0 1 to 0 8 mm could only slightly improve the degradation of dcf in the ncu ha o2 system as presented in fig 2b this result implied that ha instead of ncu would be more critical to the copper cycles besides similar to our previous heterogeneous fenton like systems xiang et al 2016 phenomena of initial lag degradation phase of dcf were also observed in the cases of low ncu dosage it suggested a sequent heterogeneous homogeneous reaction mechanism in the ncu ha o2 system due to the initial trace dissolved copper huang et al 2017 3 1 3 effect of ph fig 2c presents the dcf degradation efficiency in the ncu ha o2 system as solution ph ranging from 5 4 to 9 the highest kobs dcf was achieved in the case of ph 6 0 and dcf molecule could be completely mineralized at 2 h of reaction time in weak acidic circumstances ph 5 4 6 inset in fig 2c despite dcf could be also effectively degraded in the case of ph 7 0 a sharp decline in the kobs dcf was observed as ph further increased from 7 0 to 9 0 it could ascribe to that the alkaline circumstances would strongly inhibit the copper dissolution pksocu ii 19 3 snoeyink and vernon 1980 resulting in very slow homogeneous reactions the dissolution of ncu as well as the following homogeneous reactions were more intensive in the case of ph 5 4 however the surface interfacial reactions such as the copper cycle and o2 activation would partly attenuate besides the reactivity of cu iii species was also thought to be dependent on ph with the ph changing from acid to alkali the specie of cu iii would undergo the transformation from cu3 to cu oh 2 cu oh 2 cu oh 3 and or cu oh 4 etc johnson et al 1985 metal hydroxo complexes have decreasing oxidation power with increasing ph as they shift to the forms with more hydroxo ligands lee et al 2016 therefore the degradation efficiency of diclofenac in the ncu ha o2 system would decrease when ph was increased upper than 7 3 1 4 effect of reaction temperature as shown in fig 2d reaction temperature would favor the dcf degradation in the ncu ha o2 system the kobs dcf would increase near linearly as the reaction temperature increases from 10 to 50 c the arrhenius activation energies ea were calculated for the ncu ha o2 system and its counter homogeneous cu ii ha o2 system fig 3 the values were 31 7 4 5 and 34 3 4 2 kj mol 1 respectively it indicated that the homogeneous degradation of dcf in the cu ii ha o2 system would be co controlled by the mass transfer and chemical reaction zhang and zhu 2004 while the similar ea value in the ncu ha o2 system suggested that the degradation of dcf would be almost homogeneously zhou et al 2018 3 2 the heterogeneous homogeneous reaction mechanism in the ncu ha o2 system 3 2 1 characterizations of cu nanoparticles fig 4 a and b presents the tem images of the cu nanoparticles ncu although slightly agglomerated individual ncu particles were easily recognized with diameter less than 10 nm the result of size distribution measurement also showed that the diameter of individual particles was mostly at the range of 6 10 nm fig s5 the xps spectrum of ncu particles present in fig 4c showed the cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 at 930 4 and 950 3 ev peak 5 respectively yin et al 2010 the peakfit of cu 2p3 2 peak revealed a main peak at 930 3 ev peak 1 identified as cu i where the three accompanying satellites peaks on the high binding energy side i e 930 9 peak 2 942 1 peak 3 and 944 8 ev peak 4 could be identified to cu ii the xps data revealed that cu i was the dominant species on the ncu surface moreover xrd characterization indicated that the ncu particles contained cu0 and cu2o crystals fig 4d based on the above analysis it could be concluded that the ncu particles would be a core shell structure with cu0 core crusted by cu i hydro oxides shell 3 2 2 identification of the predominant oxidants in the ncu ha o2 system generally fenton and fenton like reactions generate reactive oxygen species ros such as oh o2 and h2o2 where oh is recognized as the main or predominant oxidant for the degradation of target pollutants chamarro et al 2001 therefore to identify the role of above mentioned ros scavenging experiments were conducted in the presence of tba ipa and bq respectively tba and ipa are generally used to scavenge oh in bulk solution and or solid interface ktba oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and kipa oh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 while bq can be used for o2 kbq o 2 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 jovanovic et al 1995 as shown in fig 5 all three scavengers could significantly suppress the dcf degradation in the ncu ha o2 system it indicated that o2 would be the predominant reactive oxygen intermediate and oh seemed to be responsible for the oxidative decomposition of dcf diaz uribe et al 2010 yang et al 2009 however an alternative main reactive species i e cu iii was recently proposed in the copper based fenton like system pham et al 2013 the cu iii species has similar oxidative ability like oh yamamoto and kawanishi 1989 and can be also well quenched by tba or ipa pham et al 2013 a semi quantitative investigation for evaluating the scavenging effect of tba was further carried out pham et al 2013 an oh based zvi edta o2 system noradoun and cheng 2005 zhou et al 2018 was adopted to compare with our ncu ha o2 systems to evaluate the scavenge effects of different concentrations of tba it was observed that the two scavenging patterns were rather different by varying tba concentration from 0 to 100 mm fig 6 indicating the oxidant was more likely to be cu iii in order to further verify the predominant role cu iii species epr examinations were adopted in the five comparative systems including ha cu ii cu ii ha o2 ncu o2 and ncu ha o2 systems as shown in fig 7 any signal peak was not found in the ha alone system while a quartet peak with hyperfine constants of a n a h 14 9 g appeared in the cu ii alone system it indicated the presence of copper complex which has similar signal peak like the dmpo oh adducts chen et al 2015 ozawa and hanaki 1991 the quartet peak was also observed in the patterns of the other three systems cu ii ha o2 ncu o2 and ncu ha o2 with similar intensity moreover a simultaneous sextet peak of signals appeared in all three above systems wherein activation of o2 and cu based fenton like reactions occurred the sextet signal could be recognized as dmpo ch3 as a result of the dmpo oxidative derivatives chen et al 2015 johnson et al 1985 therefore it was believed that the reactive cu iii species instead of oh would be the dominant reactive oxidant in the ncu ha o2 system similar to the cu ii based fenton like system pham et al 2013 the degradation of dcf in the ncu ha o2 system were also strong ph dependent as depicted in section 3 1 3 it would be explained by the different reactivity of cu iii dcf and oh dcf depending on the solution ph fig 8 illustrates the ph dependent accumulation of the oxidant in the ncu ha o2 system in contrast to their ph affecting dcf degradation performances fig 2c yield of the oxidant was high in neutral and weak alkaline circumstances but low in weak acidic circumstances the neutral system could achieve the highest oxidant yield c a 281 μm and relative low kobs dcf of 0 025 min 1 while the weak acid system ph 6 received about one third oxidant yield c a 105 μm but the highest kobs dcf of 0 041 min 1 this observation could further evidence the predominant role of the reactive cu iii species in the ncu ha o2 system ph dependent speciation of cu iii species would be responsible since cu oh 3 and cu oh 4 species of less oxidation ability appears at high ph while strong oxidant cu oh 2 exist at low ph johnson et al 1985 3 2 3 distinguishing the dominant roles of interfacial o2 activation and homogeneous dcf degradation to clarify the o2 activation mechanism in the ncu ha o2 system comparative experiments were conducted in homogeneous cu ii ha o2 and heterogeneous cu2o ha o2 systems since either aqueous cu i or cu2o could activate molecular oxygen hua et al 2014 li and trush 1993 as shown in fig 9 both comparative systems achieved lower dcf degradation performances than the ncu ha o2 system but with similar accumulation patterns of aqueous copper fig s6 huang et al 2017 it suggested that the activation of oxygen by cu i species would be heterogeneous and homogeneous the simultaneous evolutions of h2o2 and aqueous copper in the ncu ha o2 system fig 10 could further explore the interfacial o2 activation mechanism in the initial reaction period 0 5 min less than 10 of dcf c a 1 mg l was removed at 5 min with a simultaneous slow release of aqueous copper almost cu i less than 1 2 μm but a rapid generation of h2o2 up to c a 220 μm however the evolutions of h2o2 was different in the counter homogeneous cu ii ha o2 system in the initial period with a lower dcf degradation efficiency fig s7 it indicated that the interfacial o2 activation mechanism would be dominant as depicted by eqs 2 4 the rate limited step of the homogeneous cu i activation of o2 is the homogeneous generation of h2o2 instead of the decomposition since the respective reaction constants were 3 1 104 2 0 109 and 4 105 m 1 s 1 moffett and zika 1987 yuan et al 2012 thus h2o2 scavenging experiment was carried out in the heterogeneous ncu ha o2 system fig s8 shows that 60 000 unit catalase cat had little effect on the dcf degradation while 600 000 unit cat could slightly suppress the degradation this result indicated that the generation reaction of h2o2 was not the rate limiting step joo et al 2004 therefore it could be concluded that the interfacial generation of h2o2 from activation of o2 by surface cu i should be dominant as discussed in section 3 1 4 dcf was suggested to be mainly degraded homogeneously in the ncu ha o2 system from fig 10 it was observed that most dcf were decomposed rapidly in the reaction period after 10 min with the released aqueous copper higher than 3 μm in the heterogeneous cu2o ha o2 system the rapid degradation of dcf also occurred as the aqueous copper accumulated above 2 5 μm fig s6 with analogous accumulation patterns of aqueous copper dcf was degraded similarly during 10 60 min in the ncu ha o2 system and its counter homogeneous system it could be concluded that the degradation of dcf in the ncu ha o2 system would mainly occur homogeneously huang et al 2017 hplc esi ms was used to determine the intermediates during the dcf degradation in the ncu ha o2 system based on the identified twelve compounds three possible pathways were proposed scheme 1 zhou et al 2018 for the pathway 1 hydroxylation of the dcf molecule would occur followed by the two step substituted dechlorination after that the c n cleavage would happen between the two benzene rings with respect to the pathway 2 two step substituted dechlorination occurred and then the dechlorinated product would be deacetoxylated resulting in low weight molecular acids products in addition the dehydration between the n atom and the acetoxyl in the dcf molecule would also occur this pathway 3 would further lead to the c n cleavage hydroxylation as well as substituted dechlorination furthermore the biotoxicity test indicated the degradation of dcf in the ncu ha o2 system would decrease its toxicity fig s9 and toc variation showed that the simultaneous mineralization occurred as dcf degraded fig s10 therefore the ncu ha o2 system was applicable for dcf degradation concerning the environmental implication 3 2 4 the heterogeneous homogeneous reaction mechanism based on the cycle of reactive coppers according to the above discussion a heterogeneous homogeneous reaction mechanism based on the cycle of reactive coppers could be proposed as illustrated in scheme 2 first molecular oxygen would be rapidly reduced by the surface cu i species of the core shell ncu with two step single electron transfer to generate h2o2 the h2o2 would accumulate rapidly in the initial reaction period due to rather low consumption by the surface copper species section 3 2 3 besides the direct reaction of ha with h2o2 to generate oh could be ignored in our weak acid to alkaline systems fig s11 as essential aqueous cu i accumulated simultaneously homogeneous fenton like reactions would be involved the aqueous cu i would react with h2o2 to produce cu iii in oxidizing the dcf molecules lee et al 2016 pham et al 2013 during the reaction mechanism the production of cu iii would be the rate limited step pham et al 2013 in our ncu ha o2 system the dominant production of h2o2 occurred heterogeneously on the ncu surface while cu iii would be generated homogeneously furthermore the dual roles of ha would be very important in the system ha could not only sustain the heterogeneous homogeneous cu ii cu i cycle promoting the heterogeneous production of h2o2 but also strongly accelerate the dissolution of ncu benefiting the homogeneous reductive generation of cu i as a result the production of cu iii and degradation of dcf were significantly improved 3 3 quantification investigation of the reactive coppers cycle according to the homogeneous cu i activation reactions of o2 eqs 1 4 a theoretical stoichiometric yield of cu iii could be calculated as 1066 μm however it was found that the yield of cu iii in the related ncu ha o2 system was only 281 10 μm fig 8 therefore a quantitative investigation of the reactive species was conducted based on the reactive copper cycle for further clarifying the above proposed heterogeneous homogeneous reaction mechanism fig 11 illustrates the correlations in pairs of the four studied species cu iii cu i ha and h2o2 in the ncu ha o2 system as well as their theoretical stoichiometric relationships the overall yield ratio of cu iii relative to ha d cu iii d ha was determined as 0 171 0 004 η o fig 11a which was much lower than the related theoretical stoichiometric value of 0 667 fig 11e it suggested that inefficient but essential steps would exist in the whole production procedure of cu iii a high d cu i d ha value of 1 74 0 12 η 1 was obtained as shown in fig 11b it is near to the related theoretical stoichiometric value of 2 00 revealing that the regeneration of cu i by ha was very efficient and the rate limited procedures of cu iii generation could be attributed to the oxygen activation by cu i and or cu iii generation by h2o2 fig 11e the high degradation efficiency of dcf in the ncu ha h2o2 system also strongly evidenced it fig 9 as expected the d cu iii d cu i value η 2 was measured to be just 0 148 0 017 fig 11c despite that the value of d cu i d h 2 o 2 η 3 was hardly experimentally determined the small value of d cu iii d h 2 o 2 η 4 0 195 0 017 fig 11d indicated that the low overall yield of cu iii could mostly ascribe to the unsatisfactory production of cu iii from h2o2 instead of the cu i induced activation of o2 h2o2 production this result was consistent with the discussion in section 3 2 2 where the fenton like reaction i e cu i induced decomposition of h2o2 to generate cu iii was concluded as the rate limited step for the overall production of cu iii in addition we found that the concentration of h2o2 was higher than 100 μm throughout the reaction time fig s5 it further indicated that the limited regeneration of aqueous cu i would mainly determine the oxygen activation as well as the dcf degradation 3 4 repeated test of dcf degradation in the ncu ha o2 system by using recycled ncu in the above buffered neutral systems the final accumulation of aqueous copper after 2 h treatment was measured as 19 4 μm which was below the related u s epa regulation i e 20 5 μm however the aqueous copper released more rapidly in a raw neutral ncu ha o2 system and the solid ncu particles would use up after 2 h it could be attributed to the fast decrease of solution ph in the system due to the generation of low molecular weight organic acids data not shown it was previously reported that nano zero valent iron nzvi was able to rapidly reduce cu ii to ncu and discharge low toxic dissolved iron in effluents huang et al 2013 in this study we also found the effluent aqueous copper of 200 μm could be reduced by nzvi at the ratio of 1 2 and the residual cu ii would be less than 20 μm therefore to evaluate the ncu recyclability after the dcf degradation in the ncu ha o2 system four repeated runs for the dcf degradation were conducted before each run the ncu in use was obtained from nzvi reduction of the solution from the previous run as illustrated in fig 12 the degradation efficiency of dcf decreased slightly after the four repeated runs probably due to the slight loss of recycled ncu amounts it was noticed that the recovery efficiency of copper could be still above 71 even after three recycles table s1 4 conclusion in this study it was found that addition of ha could significantly promote the dcf degradation rate kobs dcf in ncu o2 system about two orders of magnitude based on the pristine cu0 cu i hydro oxides core shell structure the ncu ha o2 system could effectively degrade dcf in weak acid to weak alkaline circumstances despite that dcf decomposed in pathways similar to the oh oxidation detailed examinations revealed that the reactive cu iii species would be predominant in the ncu ha o2 system and generated from the proposed ha enhanced heterogeneous homogeneous cycle of the reactive copper species quantitative investigation of the main reactive species in the cycle further explored that the cu i regeneration instead of the o2 activation would be rate limited in addition ncu could be efficiently recycled by nzvi and effectively degrade dcf for four consecutive cycles in the raw neural ncu ha o2 system the result of this study suggested that the ncu ha o2 system with a more efficient copper cycle would be a good alternative fenton like system in rapidly degrading recalcitrant organic pollutants moreover the related electron transfer mechanism depending on the core shell structure in the copper cycle would need to be further explored declaration of interests the authors

19020,this study has demonstrated that hydroxylamine ha could greatly enhance cu nanoparticles ncu in activating molecular oxygen and significantly elevate the diclofenac dcf degradation rate about two orders of magnitude in neutral circumstances effects of several important parameters on the dcf degradation such as ncu loading ha dosage ph and reaction temperature were investigated in the ncu ha o2 system multiple examinations revealed that the reactive cu iii species instead of oh would be predominant in the ncu ha o2 system despite their similar dcf degradation pathways based on a ha enhanced copper cycle depending on the pristine cu0 cu i hydro oxides core shell structure the heterogeneous homogeneous reaction mechanism was proposed it included solid liquid interfacial and bulk reactions e g heterogeneous activation of o2 by cu i to produce h2o2 and homogeneous cu i catalytic generation of cu iii from h2o2 further quantitative investigation of the main reactive species in the cycle revealed that the cu i regeneration instead of the o2 activation would be rate limited besides ncu could be recycled to effectively degrade dcf in four consecutive cycles in the raw neural ncu ha o2 system it suggested that the ncu ha o2 system with a more efficient copper cycle would be a good alternative fenton like system in treating neutral recalcitrant organic wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords cu nanoparticles neutral copper cycle molecule oxygen activation hydroxylamine fenton like 1 introduction fenton reaction which generates strong oxidant hydroxyl radical via the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 by fe2 i e haber weiss cycle has been generally acknowledged as an effective method for non selective oxidation of recalcitrant organic compounds neyens and baeyens 2003 however its application is commonly limited by slow regeneration of ferrous catalysts and essential acidic reaction circumstances that lead to excessive fe2 consumption as well as and large amounts of iron sludge qin et al 2015 hence some reductants e g ascorbate burkitt and gilbert 1990 protocatechuic acid qin et al 2015 and hydroxylamine ha chen et al 2011 had been used to maintain the effective iron cycle it was found that the regeneration of fe ii from fe iii could be effectively accelerated at ph up to 5 7 but became very slow in neutral circumstances recently cu i has been recognized as a more efficient fenton like catalyst since its reaction rate with h2o2 kcu i h2o2 4 105 m 1 s 1 was about four orders of magnitude higher than fe ii h2o2 kfe ii h2o2 63 76 m 1 s 1 moffett and zika 1987 qin et al 2015 despite that the reduction of cu ii by h2o2 is still slow perez benito 2001 the copper based fenton like system would be more suitable than the iron based technologies in neutral alkaline circumstances kankala et al 2015 2017a 2017b peng et al 2016 due to the much lower pkso of cu oh 2 as compared to fe oh 3 snoeyink and vernon 1980 moreover cu i could also activate molecular oxygen more efficiently than fe ii for creating reactive oxygen species ros in situ bhagidamodaran et al 2017 nevertheless rather slow regeneration of cu i would still block operation of the neutral copper cycle and inhibit the fenton like reactions perez benito 2004 ha could be used to maintain the neutral copper cycle in a cu ii o2 system for degrading benzoate continuously lee et al 2016 but it was noted that abundant ha 5 0 mm could only lead to c a 80 removal of 0 1 mm benzoate at ph 7 0 suggesting a rather low homogeneous electron utilizing efficiency during the o2 activation in heterogeneous iron based fenton like systems zero valent iron nano particles zvi are generally adopted to support a full and rapid iron cycle in promoting the heterogeneous or homogeneous generation of ros as well as degradation of target pollutants zhou et al 2008 the corrosion of zvi could continuously supply fe ii and accelerate the reduction of ferric on the surface moreover the surface bond fe ii on the surface of nzvi was thought to be more reactive for oxygen activation ai et al 2013 as reported in our recent studies the core shell structures of iron iron oxides could also enhance the heterogeneous homogeneous iron cycles xiang et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 analogous to zvi zero valent copper nanoparticles ncu was also able to activate molecular oxygen but degraded dna inefficiently at ph of 7 jose et al 2011 our verification test indicated that the generated h2o2 accumulated during the reaction it suggested that the neutral catalytic decomposition of h2o2 by ncu would be delayed or suppressed in the other hand although ha could maintain the neutral homogeneous copper cycle its performance in ncu based heterogeneous o2 activation systems has never been reported so far therefore in this study an ncu ha o2 system was established for the rapid catalytic degradation of a typical pharmaceutical pollutant diclofenac dcf which has been previously used as a substrate in some iron based fenton like systems chong et al 2017 ziylan et al 2013 after the investigations on parameters effects and ncu characterizations our main purpose was to reveal the ha enhanced neutral efficient copper cycle depending on the core shell ncu besides quantitative study of the reactive species during the copper cycle was conducted it would help us to clearly extinguish the rate limited steps during the cycle the cu i induced activation of o2 and or catalysis of h2o2 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemical were used as received diclofenac

neocuproine complex were examined at 250 mm dmso and neocuproine of different concentrations besides hcho was measured in the cases with different amounts of additional h2o2 to understand the

microscopy fetem tecnai g2 f30 3 results and discussion 3 1 synergistic degradation of dcf in the ncu ha o2 system and parameters investigation fig 1 exhibits the time dependent degradation of dcf in three comparative systems in the buffered neutral circumstance it was found that dcf was marginally removed by either ncu o2 or ha alone systems the related pseudo first order kinetic degradation constant kncu o2 dcf obs and kha dcf obs was 3 3 1 3 10 4 and 0 5 2 0 10 4 min 1 respectively it indicated that the direct oxidization of organic pollutant by ncu was very slow jose et al 2011 and ha would be inert to dcf or o2 without ncu combining ha and ncu i e the ncu ha o2 system would significantly enhance the dcf degradation the kncu ha o2 dcf obs value could be elevated with two orders of magnitude to 2 5 0 14 10 2 min 1 besides oxygen was also evidenced to be critical to the dcf degradation fig s2 these results revealed that ha would greatly promote the activation efficiency of molecular oxygen by copper species hou et al 2017 lee et al 2016 and suggested the presence of a homogeneous and or heterogeneous reaction mechanism including ha and ncu afterwards effects of several important parameters on the degradation of dcf were investigated in the ncu ha o2 system and the descriptions are listed as follows 3 1 1 effect of ha dosage fig 2 a shows that increasing ha dosage from 0 2 to 1 6 mm would be positive to the dcf degradation in the ncu ha o2 system it was reported that ha could rapidly reduce the surface fe iii of goethite and lead to a surface iron cycle hou et al 2017 similarly a surface cu ii cu i cycle would be suggested in the ncu ha o2 system eqs 1 4 the regeneration of surface cu i eq 1 would be most important during the cycle since it was liable to activation of o2 eqs 2 and 3 and fenton like decomposition of h2o2 eq 4 lanci et al 2007 moffett and zika 1987 furthermore it was found that the simultaneous depletion curve of ha fig s3 was consistent with the corresponding dcf degradation curve it suggested that the regenerated production of cu i would be satisfied to the occurrences of the cu induced fenton like reactions 1 cu ii 1 2nh2oh cu i 1 4n2o 1 4h2o h 2 cu i o2 cu ii o2 3 cu i 2h o2 cu ii h2o2 4 h2o2 cu i cu ii oh oh or cu iii 2oh obviously more amounts of ha could accelerate the reduction of cu ii to cu i in the system and lead to higher production of reactive oxidative species eqs 2 4 in addition the presence of ha would dramatically accelerate the copper dissolution fig s4 resulting in a companying homogeneous cu ii ha o2 degradation mechanism lee et al 2016 therefore it could be concluded that ha would not only maintain accelerate the surface copper cycle in the ncu ha o2 system but also induce a simultaneous homogeneous copper cycle 3 1 2 effect of ncu dosage although the presence of ncu was essential to the heterogeneous and homogeneous copper cycles increasing ncu dosage from 0 1 to 0 8 mm could only slightly improve the degradation of dcf in the ncu ha o2 system as presented in fig 2b this result implied that ha instead of ncu would be more critical to the copper cycles besides similar to our previous heterogeneous fenton like systems xiang et al 2016 phenomena of initial lag degradation phase of dcf were also observed in the cases of low ncu dosage it suggested a sequent heterogeneous homogeneous reaction mechanism in the ncu ha o2 system due to the initial trace dissolved copper huang et al 2017 3 1 3 effect of ph fig 2c presents the dcf degradation efficiency in the ncu ha o2 system as solution ph ranging from 5 4 to 9 the highest kobs dcf was achieved in the case of ph 6 0 and dcf molecule could be completely mineralized at 2 h of reaction time in weak acidic circumstances ph 5 4 6 inset in fig 2c despite dcf could be also effectively degraded in the case of ph 7 0 a sharp decline in the kobs dcf was observed as ph further increased from 7 0 to 9 0 it could ascribe to that the alkaline circumstances would strongly inhibit the copper dissolution pksocu ii 19 3 snoeyink and vernon 1980 resulting in very slow homogeneous reactions the dissolution of ncu as well as the following homogeneous reactions were more intensive in the case of ph 5 4 however the surface interfacial reactions such as the copper cycle and o2 activation would partly attenuate besides the reactivity of cu iii species was also thought to be dependent on ph with the ph changing from acid to alkali the specie of cu iii would undergo the transformation from cu3 to cu oh 2 cu oh 2 cu oh 3 and or cu oh 4 etc johnson et al 1985 metal hydroxo complexes have decreasing oxidation power with increasing ph as they shift to the forms with more hydroxo ligands lee et al 2016 therefore the degradation efficiency of diclofenac in the ncu ha o2 system would decrease when ph was increased upper than 7 3 1 4 effect of reaction temperature as shown in fig 2d reaction temperature would favor the dcf degradation in the ncu ha o2 system the kobs dcf would increase near linearly as the reaction temperature increases from 10 to 50 c the arrhenius activation energies ea were calculated for the ncu ha o2 system and its counter homogeneous cu ii ha o2 system fig 3 the values were 31 7 4 5 and 34 3 4 2 kj mol 1 respectively it indicated that the homogeneous degradation of dcf in the cu ii ha o2 system would be co controlled by the mass transfer and chemical reaction zhang and zhu 2004 while the similar ea value in the ncu ha o2 system suggested that the degradation of dcf would be almost homogeneously zhou et al 2018 3 2 the heterogeneous homogeneous reaction mechanism in the ncu ha o2 system 3 2 1 characterizations of cu nanoparticles fig 4 a and b presents the tem images of the cu nanoparticles ncu although slightly agglomerated individual ncu particles were easily recognized with diameter less than 10 nm the result of size distribution measurement also showed that the diameter of individual particles was mostly at the range of 6 10 nm fig s5 the xps spectrum of ncu particles present in fig 4c showed the cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 at 930 4 and 950 3 ev peak 5 respectively yin et al 2010 the peakfit of cu 2p3 2 peak revealed a main peak at 930 3 ev peak 1 identified as cu i where the three accompanying satellites peaks on the high binding energy side i e 930 9 peak 2 942 1 peak 3 and 944 8 ev peak 4 could be identified to cu ii the xps data revealed that cu i was the dominant species on the ncu surface moreover xrd characterization indicated that the ncu particles contained cu0 and cu2o crystals fig 4d based on the above analysis it could be concluded that the ncu particles would be a core shell structure with cu0 core crusted by cu i hydro oxides shell 3 2 2 identification of the predominant oxidants in the ncu ha o2 system generally fenton and fenton like reactions generate reactive oxygen species ros such as oh o2 and h2o2 where oh is recognized as the main or predominant oxidant for the degradation of target pollutants chamarro et al 2001 therefore to identify the role of above mentioned ros scavenging experiments were conducted in the presence of tba ipa and bq respectively tba and ipa are generally used to scavenge oh in bulk solution and or solid interface ktba oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and kipa oh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 while bq can be used for o2 kbq o 2 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 jovanovic et al 1995 as shown in fig 5 all three scavengers could significantly suppress the dcf degradation in the ncu ha o2 system it indicated that o2 would be the predominant reactive oxygen intermediate and oh seemed to be responsible for the oxidative decomposition of dcf diaz uribe et al 2010 yang et al 2009 however an alternative main reactive species i e cu iii was recently proposed in the copper based fenton like system pham et al 2013 the cu iii species has similar oxidative ability like oh yamamoto and kawanishi 1989 and can be also well quenched by tba or ipa pham et al 2013 a semi quantitative investigation for evaluating the scavenging effect of tba was further carried out pham et al 2013 an oh based zvi edta o2 system noradoun and cheng 2005 zhou et al 2018 was adopted to compare with our ncu ha o2 systems to evaluate the scavenge effects of different concentrations of tba it was observed that the two scavenging patterns were rather different by varying tba concentration from 0 to 100 mm fig 6 indicating the oxidant was more likely to be cu iii in order to further verify the predominant role cu iii species epr examinations were adopted in the five comparative systems including ha cu ii cu ii ha o2 ncu o2 and ncu ha o2 systems as shown in fig 7 any signal peak was not found in the ha alone system while a quartet peak with hyperfine constants of a n a h 14 9 g appeared in the cu ii alone system it indicated the presence of copper complex which has similar signal peak like the dmpo oh adducts chen et al 2015 ozawa and hanaki 1991 the quartet peak was also observed in the patterns of the other three systems cu ii ha o2 ncu o2 and ncu ha o2 with similar intensity moreover a simultaneous sextet peak of signals appeared in all three above systems wherein activation of o2 and cu based fenton like reactions occurred the sextet signal could be recognized as dmpo ch3 as a result of the dmpo oxidative derivatives chen et al 2015 johnson et al 1985 therefore it was believed that the reactive cu iii species instead of oh would be the dominant reactive oxidant in the ncu ha o2 system similar to the cu ii based fenton like system pham et al 2013 the degradation of dcf in the ncu ha o2 system were also strong ph dependent as depicted in section 3 1 3 it would be explained by the different reactivity of cu iii dcf and oh dcf depending on the solution ph fig 8 illustrates the ph dependent accumulation of the oxidant in the ncu ha o2 system in contrast to their ph affecting dcf degradation performances fig 2c yield of the oxidant was high in neutral and weak alkaline circumstances but low in weak acidic circumstances the neutral system could achieve the highest oxidant yield c a 281 μm and relative low kobs dcf of 0 025 min 1 while the weak acid system ph 6 received about one third oxidant yield c a 105 μm but the highest kobs dcf of 0 041 min 1 this observation could further evidence the predominant role of the reactive cu iii species in the ncu ha o2 system ph dependent speciation of cu iii species would be responsible since cu oh 3 and cu oh 4 species of less oxidation ability appears at high ph while strong oxidant cu oh 2 exist at low ph johnson et al 1985 3 2 3 distinguishing the dominant roles of interfacial o2 activation and homogeneous dcf degradation to clarify the o2 activation mechanism in the ncu ha o2 system comparative experiments were conducted in homogeneous cu ii ha o2 and heterogeneous cu2o ha o2 systems since either aqueous cu i or cu2o could activate molecular oxygen hua et al 2014 li and trush 1993 as shown in fig 9 both comparative systems achieved lower dcf degradation performances than the ncu ha o2 system but with similar accumulation patterns of aqueous copper fig s6 huang et al 2017 it suggested that the activation of oxygen by cu i species would be heterogeneous and homogeneous the simultaneous evolutions of h2o2 and aqueous copper in the ncu ha o2 system fig 10 could further explore the interfacial o2 activation mechanism in the initial reaction period 0 5 min less than 10 of dcf c a 1 mg l was removed at 5 min with a simultaneous slow release of aqueous copper almost cu i less than 1 2 μm but a rapid generation of h2o2 up to c a 220 μm however the evolutions of h2o2 was different in the counter homogeneous cu ii ha o2 system in the initial period with a lower dcf degradation efficiency fig s7 it indicated that the interfacial o2 activation mechanism would be dominant as depicted by eqs 2 4 the rate limited step of the homogeneous cu i activation of o2 is the homogeneous generation of h2o2 instead of the decomposition since the respective reaction constants were 3 1 104 2 0 109 and 4 105 m 1 s 1 moffett and zika 1987 yuan et al 2012 thus h2o2 scavenging experiment was carried out in the heterogeneous ncu ha o2 system fig s8 shows that 60 000 unit catalase cat had little effect on the dcf degradation while 600 000 unit cat could slightly suppress the degradation this result indicated that the generation reaction of h2o2 was not the rate limiting step joo et al 2004 therefore it could be concluded that the interfacial generation of h2o2 from activation of o2 by surface cu i should be dominant as discussed in section 3 1 4 dcf was suggested to be mainly degraded homogeneously in the ncu ha o2 system from fig 10 it was observed that most dcf were decomposed rapidly in the reaction period after 10 min with the released aqueous copper higher than 3 μm in the heterogeneous cu2o ha o2 system the rapid degradation of dcf also occurred as the aqueous copper accumulated above 2 5 μm fig s6 with analogous accumulation patterns of aqueous copper dcf was degraded similarly during 10 60 min in the ncu ha o2 system and its counter homogeneous system it could be concluded that the degradation of dcf in the ncu ha o2 system would mainly occur homogeneously huang et al 2017 hplc esi ms was used to determine the intermediates during the dcf degradation in the ncu ha o2 system based on the identified twelve compounds three possible pathways were proposed scheme 1 zhou et al 2018 for the pathway 1 hydroxylation of the dcf molecule would occur followed by the two step substituted dechlorination after that the c n cleavage would happen between the two benzene rings with respect to the pathway 2 two step substituted dechlorination occurred and then the dechlorinated product would be deacetoxylated resulting in low weight molecular acids products in addition the dehydration between the n atom and the acetoxyl in the dcf molecule would also occur this pathway 3 would further lead to the c n cleavage hydroxylation as well as substituted dechlorination furthermore the biotoxicity test indicated the degradation of dcf in the ncu ha o2 system would decrease its toxicity fig s9 and toc variation showed that the simultaneous mineralization occurred as dcf degraded fig s10 therefore the ncu ha o2 system was applicable for dcf degradation concerning the environmental implication 3 2 4 the heterogeneous homogeneous reaction mechanism based on the cycle of reactive coppers according to the above discussion a heterogeneous homogeneous reaction mechanism based on the cycle of reactive coppers could be proposed as illustrated in scheme 2 first molecular oxygen would be rapidly reduced by the surface cu i species of the core shell ncu with two step single electron transfer to generate h2o2 the h2o2 would accumulate rapidly in the initial reaction period due to rather low consumption by the surface copper species section 3 2 3 besides the direct reaction of ha with h2o2 to generate oh could be ignored in our weak acid to alkaline systems fig s11 as essential aqueous cu i accumulated simultaneously homogeneous fenton like reactions would be involved the aqueous cu i would react with h2o2 to produce cu iii in oxidizing the dcf molecules lee et al 2016 pham et al 2013 during the reaction mechanism the production of cu iii would be the rate limited step pham et al 2013 in our ncu ha o2 system the dominant production of h2o2 occurred heterogeneously on the ncu surface while cu iii would be generated homogeneously furthermore the dual roles of ha would be very important in the system ha could not only sustain the heterogeneous homogeneous cu ii cu i cycle promoting the heterogeneous production of h2o2 but also strongly accelerate the dissolution of ncu benefiting the homogeneous reductive generation of cu i as a result the production of cu iii and degradation of dcf were significantly improved 3 3 quantification investigation of the reactive coppers cycle according to the homogeneous cu i activation reactions of o2 eqs 1 4 a theoretical stoichiometric yield of cu iii could be calculated as 1066 μm however it was found that the yield of cu iii in the related ncu ha o2 system was only 281 10 μm fig 8 therefore a quantitative investigation of the reactive species was conducted based on the reactive copper cycle for further clarifying the above proposed heterogeneous homogeneous reaction mechanism fig 11 illustrates the correlations in pairs of the four studied species cu iii cu i ha and h2o2 in the ncu ha o2 system as well as their theoretical stoichiometric relationships the overall yield ratio of cu iii relative to ha d cu iii d ha was determined as 0 171 0 004 η o fig 11a which was much lower than the related theoretical stoichiometric value of 0 667 fig 11e it suggested that inefficient but essential steps would exist in the whole production procedure of cu iii a high d cu i d ha value of 1 74 0 12 η 1 was obtained as shown in fig 11b it is near to the related theoretical stoichiometric value of 2 00 revealing that the regeneration of cu i by ha was very efficient and the rate limited procedures of cu iii generation could be attributed to the oxygen activation by cu i and or cu iii generation by h2o2 fig 11e the high degradation efficiency of dcf in the ncu ha h2o2 system also strongly evidenced it fig 9 as expected the d cu iii d cu i value η 2 was measured to be just 0 148 0 017 fig 11c despite that the value of d cu i d h 2 o 2 η 3 was hardly experimentally determined the small value of d cu iii d h 2 o 2 η 4 0 195 0 017 fig 11d indicated that the low overall yield of cu iii could mostly ascribe to the unsatisfactory production of cu iii from h2o2 instead of the cu i induced activation of o2 h2o2 production this result was consistent with the discussion in section 3 2 2 where the fenton like reaction i e cu i induced decomposition of h2o2 to generate cu iii was concluded as the rate limited step for the overall production of cu iii in addition we found that the concentration of h2o2 was higher than 100 μm throughout the reaction time fig s5 it further indicated that the limited regeneration of aqueous cu i would mainly determine the oxygen activation as well as the dcf degradation 3 4 repeated test of dcf degradation in the ncu ha o2 system by using recycled ncu in the above buffered neutral systems the final accumulation of aqueous copper after 2 h treatment was measured as 19 4 μm which was below the related u s epa regulation i e 20 5 μm however the aqueous copper released more rapidly in a raw neutral ncu ha o2 system and the solid ncu particles would use up after 2 h it could be attributed to the fast decrease of solution ph in the system due to the generation of low molecular weight organic acids data not shown it was previously reported that nano zero valent iron nzvi was able to rapidly reduce cu ii to ncu and discharge low toxic dissolved iron in effluents huang et al 2013 in this study we also found the effluent aqueous copper of 200 μm could be reduced by nzvi at the ratio of 1 2 and the residual cu ii would be less than 20 μm therefore to evaluate the ncu recyclability after the dcf degradation in the ncu ha o2 system four repeated runs for the dcf degradation were conducted before each run the ncu in use was obtained from nzvi reduction of the solution from the previous run as illustrated in fig 12 the degradation efficiency of dcf decreased slightly after the four repeated runs probably due to the slight loss of recycled ncu amounts it was noticed that the recovery efficiency of copper could be still above 71 even after three recycles table s1 4 conclusion in this study it was found that addition of ha could significantly promote the dcf degradation rate kobs dcf in ncu o2 system about two orders of magnitude based on the pristine cu0 cu i hydro oxides core shell structure the ncu ha o2 system could effectively degrade dcf in weak acid to weak alkaline circumstances despite that dcf decomposed in pathways similar to the oh oxidation detailed examinations revealed that the reactive cu iii species would be predominant in the ncu ha o2 system and generated from the proposed ha enhanced heterogeneous homogeneous cycle of the reactive copper species quantitative investigation of the main reactive species in the cycle further explored that the cu i regeneration instead of the o2 activation would be rate limited in addition ncu could be efficiently recycled by nzvi and effectively degrade dcf for four consecutive cycles in the raw neural ncu ha o2 system the result of this study suggested that the ncu ha o2 system with a more efficient copper cycle would be a good alternative fenton like system in rapidly degrading recalcitrant organic pollutants moreover the related electron transfer mechanism depending on the core shell structure in the copper cycle would need to be further explored declaration of interests the authors

strategies in short term experiments nzvi fe ii dosing and n2 purging nzvi is more effective in recovering anammox activity with a high do exposure 2 mg l 1 compared to a low do exposure 0 2 mg l 1 after inhibiting by 2 0 mg l 1 do anammox activity recovery normalized to the control was ranked in the order of nzvi 5 mg l 1 addition 63 8 2 fe ii 5 mg l 1 addition 41 8 0 n2 purging 39 4 0 in contrast to fe ii ion additions the shell structure of nzvi combined with the buffering effect of biomass extracellular polysaccharide eps prevented the sharp ph variation and excessive dissolved fe ii fe iii in solution under such circumstances nzvi addition 5 and 25 mg l 1 increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species ros to a moderate level 200 which might be responsible for the better activity recovery of anammox than that of fe ii addition and n2 purging specifically 5 mg l 1 nzvi dosage moderately enhanced the intracellular o2 production 150 of the control after scavenging 2 0 mg l 1 do and the anammox activity recovered better than that of both 5 and 25 mg l 1 fe ii ions additions however high dosage nzvi 75 mg l 1 inhibited anammox activity in spite of low or high do exposure our findings elucidate that appropriate amount of nzvi short term dosing can rapidly recover anammox activity when anammox bacteria encountering oxygen exposure accidentally and could be

be precisely controlled at a relatively low level 0 1 1 0 mg l 1 lackner et al 2014 van hulle et al 2010 however do might not be exactly consumed by the coexisting aob in pn a systems in which do will penetrate to the anammox zone thus inhibiting the activity of anammox bacteria as a consequence the nitrogen removal rate in one stage pn a systems is often 3 5 times lower than that in the sole anammox process sliekers et al 2003 third et al 2005 to improve nitrogen removal capacity effective control strategies need to be developed to remove residual do after aeration periods to quickly recover the anammox activity nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi may be an intriguing candidate for quickly recovering the anammox activity after anammox encountering high do inhibition nzvi has a strong reductive capability because of its large active surface area liu et al 2017 yan et al 2013 accordingly nzvi can rapidly consume residual do and decrease the oxidation reduction potential yu et al 2014 creating favorable conditions for anammox bacteria moreover the iron ions fe ii fe iii produced from nzvi corrosion can stimulate the anammox activity liu and ni 2015 qiao et al 2013 shu et al 2016 as they are the important component of heme containing enzymes including cytochrome c proteins hydrazine synthase and hydrazine dehydrogenase that play key roles in anammox catabolism kartal et al 2013 kartal and keltjens 2016 therefore we put forward that nzvi might have a great potential for recovering anammox activity after encountering do shocks previously the impacts of nzvi on microorganisms has attracted increasing attention on one hand nzvi could exhibit inhibitory effects on the growth of microorganisms for example pure cultured laboratory studies have shown that nzvi is deleterious to microorganisms such as escherichia coli nitrifiers and denitrifiers due to its toxicity inactivation the intracellular reactive oxygen species ros formation potentially through fenton reaction and cell membrane damage auffan et al 2008 keenan and sedlak 2008 lefevre et al 2015 lv et al 2017 ševců et al 2011 on the other hand appropriate nzvi additions have shown positive enhancement on microbial activities in anammox erdim et al 2019 anaerobic digestion suanon et al 2016 nitrate reduction lefevre et al 2015 shin and cha 2008 and dechlorination kocur et al 2015 for example low nzvi dose 4 10 5 5 mg l 1 could enhance anammox activity through eps secretion and granulation after a long term operation erdim et al 2019 in addition a pilot scale carboxymethyl cellullose nzvi injection 700 g was performed on a site contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds which increased the abundance of dehalococcoides spp by an order of magnitude kocur et al 2015 although substantial studies have investigated the impacts of nzvis on various microorganisms little is known about the effects of nzvi on anammox systems after encountering do exposure to test our hypothesis we conducted nzvi addition assays using anammox bacteria after do inhibition do 0 2 and 2 0 mg l 1 for 90 min and determined whether nzvi addition could accelerate the activity recovery of anammox bacteria after do inhibition to this end we evaluated the anammox activity and the ros production of anammox bacteria along the nzvi dosages ranging from 5 to 75 mg l 1 after do exposure in parallel we measured the effect of ferrous ions additions using a series of batch assays the water chemistry variations induced by different nzvi and ferrous ions additions under do presence absence and biotic abiotic conditions were also investigated with special regards to fe ii fe iii dissolution and aquatic ph variations the possible mechanism by which nzvi fe ii influences anammox processes were also elucidated from both hydrochemical and biological aspects our findings provide compelling evidence that nzvi at the dosage of 5 and 25 mg l 1 can accelerate anammox activity recovery from high do exposure 2 mg l 1 2 material and methods 2 1 parent anammox reactor and nzvi nanoparticles the experimental anammox biomass was collected from a laboratory scale anammox sequencing batch reactor sbr with a 20 l working volume in our laboratory wang et al 2016 the reactor achieved a stable tn volumetric removal rate of approximately 0 99 kg n m 3 d 1 after cultivation for 270 d the dominant anammox bacteria in the reactor were identified as candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis with 81 9 of the total bacteria based on fluorescence in situ hybridization the experimental nzvi was synthesized freshly as described previously sun et al 2006 and the preparation procedure is described in text s1 supplementary information si morphology of the nzvi nanoparticles was characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 4300 japan fig s1 when this preparation method is used the average diameter of the particles is approximately 60 nm with majority 90 in the nano domain 1 100 nm sun et al 2006 2 2 batch tests with nzvi or fe ii additions the anammox biomass taken from the parent sbr was sieved through an 80 mesh screen approximately 0 18 mm to remove flocs and resuspended in a medium without nh4cl and nano2 a series of batch tests were performed at 35 2 c in plexiglass reactors with a 250 ml working volume and a mixing rate of 150 rpm each reactor was inoculated with a suspension of anammox bacteria with a final mixed liquid volatile suspended solid mlvss concentration of approximately 2 g l 1 before the experiment the reactor was purged with a n2 gas mixture for 30 min to remove do completely 0 05 mg l 1 the initial ph of the bioreactor was adjusted to 7 3 0 1 by adding 0 1 m hcl or naoh an aliquot solution 4 ml containing 500

conditions of batch tests are summarized in table 1 and the details as follows 2 2 1 biotic experiments with nzvi addition during expts an o2 low high n2 and an o2 low high nzvi in total 300 min the anammox batch reactors were operated under anaerobic condition for 90 min for the subsequent 90 min air was introduced with syringes through air diffusers from the bottom of the reactors the do concentration was maintained at 0 2 mg l 1 for o2 low tests and 2 0 mg l 1 for o2 high tests by manually controlling the air input after do exposure n2 or nzvi were applied into reactors respectively for expt an o2 low high n2 reactors were flushed with n2 until the do concentration was less than 0 05 mg l 1 for expt an o2 low high nzvi aliquots of nzvi were added into reactors reaching the designed iron concentrations 0 5 25 75 mg l 1 table 1 expt an nzvi in total 210 min was set up in 9 reactors to test the effect of nzvi on the anammox activity in the absence of do after the first anoxic 90 min nzvi was added directly to the reactor with the concentrations of 5 25 or 75 mg l 1 respectively throughout the expt an nzvi the headspace of the bioreactor was flushed with n2 to prevent oxygen from transferring into the solution 2 2 2 biotic experiments with fe ii ions addition in expt an o2 high fe ii in total 300 min all the procedures and the do concentrations were the same as expt an o2 high nzvi except that different dosages of feso4 was added instead of nzvi reaching the designed concentrations of 5 25 and 75 mg fe ii l 1 table 1 2 2 3 abiotic experiments with nzvi addition in the absence of do total 210 min considering that the substrate no2 for anammox bacteria can also be reduced by nzvi to nh4 and or n2 as the end product eqs 1 and 2 abiotic tests expt abiotic nzvi were conducted to calculate the lost nitrogen amount through chemical reduction of no2 by nzvi both nh4 and no2 were added to reactors initially and operated for 210 min without biomass

about 1 5 ml were taken from the reactors every 30 min by syringe to avoid contacting with air and transferred to an anaerobic chamber for intracellular ros detection at the end of each experiment 5 ml sludge samples were collected to extract the extracellular polymeric substances eps using the modified heat extraction method described previously li and yang 2007 the experiments were conducted in triplicates for each iron concentration for all above batch tests approximately 2 ml mixed liquid samples were taken from the reactors at regular intervals and immediately filtered through a 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membrane to determine the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n fe ii and total iron 2 3 analytical techniques 2 3 1 chemical analyses the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were determined in duplicates with an ic 5000 ion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific equipped with an ionpac cs12a column 250 mm 4 mm or an ionpac as11 hc column 250 mm 4 mm thermo fisher scientific usa for anion or cation determination respectively the concentrations of dissolved fe ii total dissolved iron and mlvss were determined in triplicates by the 1 10 phenanthroline method and the gravimetric method american public health association apha et al 2005 without addition of hydroxylamine hydrochloride only fe ii in samples can react with 1 10 phenanthroline while the total concentration of fe was quantified after adding hydroxylamine hydrochloride final concentration 60 mm and fe iii concentration was calculated as the difference between fe total and fe ii the concentrations of protein and humic substances in eps were measured in triplicates using the modified lowry method frølund et al 1995 the polysaccharides in eps were measured in triplicates using the anthrone sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 see text s6 for details the concentration of total iron in eps was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes agilent technologies china the do and ph values were monitored online through multi350i cellox 325 do probe and multi 340i sentix 41 ph probe wtw germany the limit of detection lod of these methods were summarized in table s1 2 3 2 the anammox activity measurement the preliminary abiotic tests indicated that only 0 7 0 4 of the tn was lost through nzvi reduction by nitrogen mass balance calculation see text s2 for details in addition the inhibition tests proved that anammox bacteria was responsible for the nitrogen removal see text s3 and table s3 for details therefore the specific anammox activity saa in the biotic experiments can be quantified by dividing the tn consumption rate the maximum slope of the plot of the tn remaining with time by the biomass concentration the saa in aeration and recovery period of each biotic experiments were normalized with respect to the saa in anoxic period using the following equation relative activity saa in do inhibition or recovery period

onoo the signal detected by the dcfh da probe was denoted by rosdcfh in this study because the total ros generally include o2 and other oxidative nitrogen species the water soluble reagent wst 1 s0060 beyotime china was used to detect intracellular o2 the detection procedure and the effectiveness of dcfh da probe were conducted and verified by positive control according to the manufacturer s instructions text s4 according to the manufacturer s instruction the incubation time should be adjusted within 15 60 min preliminary experiments indicated that ros signal is stable within 50 min fig s2 and thus we adopted 30 min as the final incubation time in our study after incubation the next centrifugation washing and detection steps were conducted within 10 min to assure that ros signal is receivable in addition the effectiveness of kit was verified by an active oxygen reagent rosup 0 05 mg ml 1 as a positive control fig s3 2 4 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance was performed with spss 19 0 spss inc chicago il usa to analyze the differences among intracellular o2 and ros production by different samples in which p 0 05 was considered statistically significant linear fittings were performed with originpro 2016 originlab northampton ma usa to explore the correlations between intracellular o2 and fe ii fe iii in solution 3 results 3 1 inhibition of anammox activity by do exposure the exposure of anammox activity to 0 2 and 2 0 mg l 1 do for 90 min exhibited different inhibitory effects table 1 under do exposure of 0 2 mg l 1 the anammox activity was inhibited to 76 5 4 of the control p 0 05 when exposed to 2 0 mg l 1 do the anammox activity decreased to 8 0 3 0 of the control p 0 05 fig 1 obviously high do exposure 2 0 mg l 1 for 90 min caused a significant inhibition to the activity of anammox bacteria candidatus k stuttgartiensis 3 2 recovery of annamox activity with n2 purging or nzvi addition after do inhibition n2 purging approach was applied to remove the residual do expt an o2 low n2 and an o2 high n2 as shown in table 1 the anammox activity remained approximately 66 4 5 of the control after 0 2 mg l 1 do was removed an o2 low n2 while it recovered to 39 4 0 p 0 05 after 2 0 mg l 1 do was removed an o2 high n2 fig 1 and table 1 these results demonstrate that anammox bacteria cannot completely recover their activity even though the residual do was fully removed for the nzvi addition approach expt an o2 low high nzvi anammox activity performed better with low dosages of nzvi 5 and 25 mg l 1 than with n2 purging but a high dosage of nzvi 75 mg l 1 inhibited anammox activity in the expt an o2 low nzvi i e anammox encountering 0 2 mg l 1 do exposure the anammox activities were 71 4 7 and 79 5 8 of the control after addition of 5 and 25 mg l 1 nzvi respectively table 1 both of which were higher than that of the n2 purged approach 66 4 5 of the control p 0 05 but just close to the activity in 0 2 mg l 1 do exposure 76 5 4 of the control for the an o2 high nzvi assays i e anammox encountering 2 0 mg l 1 do exposure the anammox activities recovered to 63 8 2 and 53 5 9 of the control when 5 and 25 mg l 1 nzvi were added respectively both being higher than 39 4 0 for the n2 purged assays p 0 05 fig 1 these results indicate that nzvi is more effective recovering anammox activity from high do 2 mg l 1 inhibition however when the nzvi dosage was increased to 75 mg l 1 the anammox activities for both 0 2 and 2 0 mg l 1 do exposures was 28 2 0 and 24 2 5 of the control respectively being lower than that of the n2 purged assays p 0 05 indicating an inhibitory effect by high nzvi additions table 1 and fig 1 3 3 effect of nzvi on anammox activity without do exposure to assess whether nzvi could directly enhance the anammox activity except playing do scavenger nzvi was added into anammox biomass without any do exposure treatment expt an nzvi it is found that all three nzvi additions 5 25 and 75 mg l 1 inhibited the anammox activity instead of promotion even with 5 mg l 1 nzvi addition the anammox activity decreased to 82 1 3 of the control expt an nzvi table 1 in contrast to the promotional effect of 5 mg l 1 nzvi in the presence of do this is consistent with the previous studies that nzvi has shown higher toxicity to bacteria under deoxygenated conditions lee et al 2008 as do may lead to the corrosion and surface oxidation of nzvi reducing its redox activity 3 4 ph variation and fe ii fe iii dissolution with nzvi additions as ph and fe ii dissolution in nzvi corrosion reactions eqs 3 and 6 have significant effects on the reactivity of nzvi and further determines the nzvi toxicity to the microorganisms ph variation and fe ii fe iii dissolution were investigated in the nzvi addition assays 3 2fe0 o2 4h 2fe ii 2h2o 4 4fe ii 4h o2 4fe iii 2h2o 5 fe ii 2fe iii 8oh fe3o4 4h2o 6 fe0 2h2o fe ii h2 2oh for the nzvi addition approach expt an o2 low high nzvi adding nzvi after do exposure did not induce a remarkable change in ph profile fig 2 a and b partially due to the simultaneous consumption of h and oh by nzvi in the presence of do eqs 3 5 in an nzvi experiments without do exposure there was also no substantial ph variation after nzvi additions eq 6 fig 2c in contrast nzvi addition 25 and 75 mg l 1 led to a rapid increase in ph from approximately 7 3 to 8 4 within initial 10 min in the expt abiotic nzvi without biomass fig 3 due to consumption of a large amount of proton eqs 1 2 and 6 the discrepancy of ph variations between biotic and abiotic experiments was mainly attributed to the presence of biomass matrix in the expt an nzvi which might have induced nanoparticle aggregation or coating of biomass on the nzvi surface reducing the nzvi reaction rate chen et al 2011 tratnyek et al 2001 it seems that the presence of biomass matrix may have acted as a ph buffer that avoids the severe ph increase to produce negative alkalinity effect on anammox bacteria the dissolved fe ii fe iii concentrations were investigated after dosing nzvi for the an o2 low high nzvi tests the dissolved fe ii fe iii concentration in 5 and 25 mg l 1 nzvi addition assays were below the detection limit 0 01 mg l 1 when the nzvi dosage reached 75 mg l 1 the dissolved fe ii fe iii concentration slowly increased to 0 9 0 04 and 2 4 0 1 mg l 1 within 300 min in an o2 low nzvi and an o2 high nzvi assays respectively fig 4 a in the biotic an nzvi assays the dissolved fe ii fe iii concentrations rapidly reached a plateau in 30 min and then remained at 0 2 0 02 1 5 0 1 and 3 2 0 03 mg l 1 under 5 25 and 75 mg l 1 nzvi additions respectively fig 4a in contrast the dissolved iron ions fe ii fe iii peaked at 2 9 0 01 17 0 0 1 and 34 5 0 5 mg l 1 respectively within 15 min with 5 25 and 75 mg l 1 nzvi additions in the abiotic test fig 3 the ten fold lower fe ii fe iii concentrations in biotic assays than in abiotic assays suggests that a large amount of fe ii might have been complexed by biomass matrix and or form iron oxides with increased ph eqs 5 7 and 8 7 fe iii 3oh fe oh 3 8 fe iii 2h2o feooh 3h for the studied anammox biomass the total amount of eps including proteins polysaccharides and humic acids was 158 6 14 0 mg g 1 ss derived from 2 g mlvss l 1 anammox sludge table s2 the total fe contents in the eps were 1 1 0 2 to 1 8

dosage up to 75 mg l 1 the total fe contents in eps did not increase further table 2 due to the complexation saturation of the eps 3 5 effects of fe ii ions on the anammox activity to verify whether fe ii ion has a similar effect on the anammox activity as nzvi feso4 solution was added in expt an o2 high fe ii tests after 2 0 mg l 1 do exposure table 1 with 5 mg l 1 fe ii 2 0 mg l 1 do was decreased below 0 2 mg l 1 within 38 min fig 2d i and anammox activity recovered to 41 8 of the control table 1 and fig 1 close to 39 4 0 of that of n2 purging when 25 mg l 1 fe ii was added 2 0 mg l 1 do was consumed below 0 01 mg l 1 within 4 min much more rapidly than that nzvi did fig 2b iii and anammox activity recovered to 54 13 5 of the control fig 1 after fe ii dosage increase further to 75 mg l 1 the anammox activity decreased to 44 6 7 of the control fig 1 in accordance with the anammox inhibition at 75 mg l 1 nzvi in an o2 low nzvi and an o high nzvi assays in addition after additions of 5 25 and 75 mg fe ii l 1 the ph sharply decreased from 8 19 8 20 and 8 03 to 8 06 7 54 and 7 3 within 1 min respectively fig 2d primarily due to the rapid precipitation formation and oh consumption eqs 4 5 7 and 8 the dissolved fe ii fe iii concentrations gradually decreased to 0 1 0 03 0 3 0 01 and 10 0 0 8 mg l 1 respectively fig 4a iv indicating that a large amounts of fe ii were entrapped by biomass and or form precipitation with gradual increasing ph 3 6 intracellular o2 production response to nzvi or fe ii ions additions intracellular ros generation as a direct physiological response induced by either do or high dosage of nzvi auffan et al 2008 imlay 2013 ševců et al 2011 might have profound effects on various biological metabolic processes we firstly applied probe dcfh da zhen et al 2018 zheng et al 2011 to detect the total ros but no ros response was observed to both do exposure and nzvi additions p 0 05 fig s5 then the wst 1 probe was applied to detect intracellular o2 which was not included in the detection range of rosdcfh we found the intracellular o2 was induced to a moderate level 140 150 of the control in both an o2 low nzvi and an o2 high nzvi assays after dosing low nzvi 5 and 25 mg l 1 fig 4b i and ii when the nzvi addition was increased to 75 mg l 1 after 0 2 and 2 0 mg l 1 do exposures the amount of intracellular o2 dramatically increased to 375 86 and 332 37 of the control p 0 01 which is 2 fold higher than that in the 5 and 25 mg l 1 nzvi addition tests fig 4b i and ii likewise the intracellular o2 under fe ii treatment condition expt an o2 high fe ii increased to 179 27 and 248 49 compared to the control p 0 01 after 25 and 75 mg l 1 fe ii additions fig 4b iv regarding to expt an nzvi without do exposure assays 5 25 and 75 mg l 1 nzvi additions led to an increase in the amount of intracellular o2 to 104 8 0 219 62 and 683 6 5 of the control respectively fig 4b iii 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms of enhanced anammox activity by nzvi addition after do exposure our results elucidate that eliminating the inhibitor do can be an important function of nzvi to recover anammox bacteria from do exposure and 5 75 mg l 1 nzvi additions were observed sufficient to consume residual do 0 2 2 0 mg l 1 fig 2a and b especially nzvi is more effective in recovering anammox activity from high do 2 mg l 1 inhibition while it barely promoted anammox activity and even inhibited anammox bacteria with low 0 2 mg l 1 or without do also the dissolved fe ii produced from nzvi corrosion reaction might have the bio stimulation impact on anammox bacteria which can be supported by the an o2 low high nzvi and an o2 high fe ii assays table 1 that adding appropriate amount of iron i e nzvi and fe ii directly into anammox biomass enhanced the anammox activity table 1 these findings agree with the previous studies that fe ii 4 5 5 0 mg l 1 liu and ni 2015 shu et al 2016 or iron oxide gao et al 2014 addition at a reasonable dosage significantly improved the anammox activity mainly because iron is the key component of many heme containing enzymes that play key roles in anammox catabolism kartal et al 2013 kartal and keltjens 2016 in addition it is intriguing to find that after 2 mg l 1 do exposure nzvi gave 50 better anammox recovery than fe ii iron addition did even with the same iron dosages 5 mg l 1 fig 1 corresponding to its higher o2 production than fe ii 152 vs 111 thus nzvi inducted ros formation to a low or moderate level might have partially contributed to the better anammox recovery by nzvi addition than by fe ii ion additions or n2 purging table 1 and fig 1 our pre experiments showed that 150 mg l 1 nzvi additions did not change the live dead ratio of anammox biomass in both anoxic and aerobic conditions data not shown therefore the anammox activity may be influenced by the intracellular o2 variation and their correlation was depicted in fig 5 obviously when the anammox activity was promoted by adding nzvi or fe ii ions the corresponding intracellular o2 levels were approximately 140 150 of the control fig 5a in contrast when the intracellular o2 level was over 200 of the control the anammox activity decreased fig 5a indeed intracellular ros has been classified into three board categories including mild oxidative stress mos temperate oxidative stress tos and severe oxidative stress sos in which mos may be beneficial the activity recovery by strengthening of protective potential of organism lushchak 2014 for example o2 can protect bacterial cells by inducing a variety of protective genes largely through the soxrs regulon and mitigate the antimicrobial lethality of antibiotics burger and drlica 2009 zhao and drlica 2014 similarly for escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis a moderate increase in the o2 amount decreased the antimicrobial mediated killing djorić and kristich 2015 mosel et al 2013 likewise a moderate o2 accumulation may also play a positive bio stimulation role in the rapid recovery of anammox bacteria from do inhibition in the present study potentially via expression of certain protective genes by anammox bacteria the exact mechanism requires to be elucidated in further studies 4 2 mechanism of intracellular o2 production after nzvi and fe ii ions additions intracellular fenton reaction is an important source of ros in biological systems where fe ii or fe iii reacts with h2o2 and produces oxygen free radicals in this study an increase in the amount of intracellular o2 was detected for anammox biomass after addition of nzvi fig 4b this postulation is also supported by a close linear relationship observed between the intracellular o2 level and the dissolved free fe ii fe iii concentration in nzvi addition assays that with a correction coefficient r of 0 863 fig 5b a possible mechanism of intracellular o2 production after nzvi and fe ii ions additions have been proposed in fig 6 fe ii ion as the basic reactant of the fenton reaction can be produced from the nzvi corrosion eq 6 or oxidation in the presence of do eq 1 fig 2a and freely diffuse into the periplasm through outer membrane porins de almeida et al 2016 before they are transported into the cytoplasm by the feob transporter ferousi et al 2017 fig 6 h2o2 another reactant of fenton reaction can be formed in solution through nzvi reaction katsoyiannis et al 2008 or autoxidation of fe ii reinke et al 1994 fig 6 and then penetrate into typical lipid bilayers of bacteria with a permeability coefficient similar to water alternatively h2o2 can also be generated intracellularly through autoxidation of redox enzymes imlay 2013 thus once both fe ii and h2o2 are available inside microbial cells the fenton reaction can occur and produce o2 fig 6 4 3 reduced toxic impact of nzvi added to anammox bio systems using an anammox enriched system our results proved that the toxicity of nzvi was largely mitigated by physic chemical conditions encountered in situ in addition to the quick shell formation of nzvi in the presence of do the complexation ability of biomass derived eps may also reduce the free fe iii fe ii ions fig 4a i ii thus preventing the high o2 production sos risk in application the sos risk could be avoided by considering the reasonable nzvi dosages according to the online do monitoring signal and biomass concentration in biological systems 4 3 1 function of rapid formation of nzvi core shell in the presence of do nzvi tends to form a core shell structure that the outer layer is covered by precipitated corrosion products eqs 5 8 which decreases both the chemical corrosion rate and the fe ii fe iii dissolution rate by preventing physical contact between the nzvi core and water keenan and sedlak 2008 mu et al 2017 comparing an o2 low high nzvi and an nzvi experiments though with the same amount of biomass 2 g vss l 1 and nzvi additions 75 mg l 1 the free fe ii fe iii dissolution rate and its maximum concentration were much lower in expt an o2 low high nzvi assays than in an nzvi assays fig 4a i iii this is because nzvi formed shell faster and thicker with do presence than that of without do liu et al 2017 thus retarding the fe ii fe iii dissolution rate fig 6 the decreased fe ii fe iii dissolution further favored to reduce the nzvi toxicity as only moderate intracellular o2 was detected i e sos emergency was avoided fig 5b which ensures the safety of nzvi application to biological systems 4 3 2 complexation and storage of fe ii fe iii by microbial eps matrix our results indicated that microbial eps has the ability to entrap the fe ii fe iii from nzvi or fe2 addition table 2 previous studies have reported that the humic acid contained in eps can form strong complexes with metal ions and change the metal solubility the dissolution kinetics and equilibria fujii et al 2014 rangsivek and jekel 2005 rose and waite 2003 tratnyek et al 2001 zhang et al 2011 thereby mitigating the toxicity of nzvi to bacteria li et al 2010 the complexation ability of eps is influenced by the species and the amount of functional groups such as carboxyl catechol bipyridine like groups daugherty et al 2017 which led to the heterogeneous complexation rate and capacity to dissolved fe ii fe iii and thus the highly non linear iron ions in eps table 2 in addition the microbial eps in the present study is sufficient to complex the slow dissolved iron from 25 mg l 1 nzvi after do exposure fig 4a i and ii as the excess dissolved fe ii fe iii that comes from either nzvi or fe2 may therefore lead to high o2 and produce a severe toxic effect to microorganisms fig 5b the metal complexation ability of microbial eps would possibly mitigate the toxicity effect in the excessive nzvi addition scenario fig 6 4 4 engineering applications the do exposure to anammox bacteria is prevail during operation of anammox bioreactors such as in one stage pn a system excessive do supply or air leakage of anaerobic bioreactors in the present study the optimum anammox activity promotion function was achieved with 5 mg l 1 nzvi after 90 min 2 0 mg l 1 do inhibition with the anammox performance being about 50 higher than that achieved with both n2 purging and fe ii addition approaches fig 1 with the high recovery capability under high do exposure condition the nzvi addition may be used to reduce the non aeration time simultaneously improved anammox performance in one stage nitritation anammox like reactors in addition the bio stimulation effect of nzvi may also be applied to the incubation period of anammox biomass during which the low abundance of anammox bacteria makes the reactor be highly sensitive to even low concentrations of do the nzvi addition should be accurately assessed in advance it should be noted that although the fe ii addition can also consume do it needs at least five times more iron dosages than nzvi to effectively enhance the anammox activity from 2 0 mg l 1 do inhibition tables 1 5 mg l 1 nzvi with 25 mg l 1 fe ii thus leading to high chemical sludge production issues as predicted by wang and waite 2010 although the manufacturing cost of nzvi is now still somewhat high around 0 05 0 10 g 1 compared to less than 0 001 g 1 of micro and bulk fe0 cost crane and scott 2012 our results show that the nzvi dosage required for anammox activity recovery after do inhibition even at 2 0 mg l 1 was much lower than that required in current applications such as soil remediation groundwater and wastewater treatments which generally require dosages in the range 0 25 20 g l 1 comba et al 2011 crane and scott 2012 yan et al 2013 it should be noted that the high do inhibition to anammox bacteria occasionally or incidentally appear in anammox systems rather than frequent occurrence therefore our short term aims to solve the incidental emergence of do inhibition scenario in the anammox bioreactors rather than constant occurrence of do inhibition thus the dosage of nzvi is required only if the activity of anammox bacteria has been incidentally inhibited by do rather than long term dosage from this aspect infrequent addition of nzvi at low dosage e g 5 mg l 1 is economically feasible on the other hand as the effects of nzvi on the anammox system may vary for different species of anammox bacteria in long term reactions further studies are required to develop long term nzvi additional approach for anammox bioreactors and to obtain the optimized nzvi dosages avoid the possible biotoxicity impact at various do levels in complex wastewater environment 5 conclusions in this work nzvi 1 100 nm was prepared and utilized in the recovery of anammox activity from do inhibition the activity recovery of anammox bacteria encountering oxygen exposure 0 2 and 2 0 mg l 1 were compared by three strategies short term dosing nzvi fe ii and n2 purging paying special regards to the intracellular ros production fe ii fe iii dissolution and aquatic ph variations with various iron nzvi and fe ii dosages the main conclusions are as follows after inhibited by 2 0 mg l 1 do for 90 min ranking of anammox activity recovery was in the order nzvi 5 mg l 1 addition 63 8 2 fe ii 5 mg l 1 addition 41 8 0 n2 purging 39 3 0 under the condition of low do exposure 0 2 mg l 1 for 90 min the anammox recovery by n2 purging or nzvi addition was less efficient than under high do exposure condition a moderate o2 production 140 150 of the control induced by low dose nzvi 5 and 25 mg l 1 played a positive bio stimulation role in the rapid recovery of anammox activity from do inhibition high dose nzvi 75 mg l 1 led to high levels of o2 over 200 of the control and inhibited anammox activity the limited ph changes and less fe ii fe iii release in low dose of nzvi additions to anammox bio systems could also be an advantage for the nzvi technique since a vigorous ph increase and decrease as well as the excessive release of dissolved iron ions is not favorable to the activity recovery of anammox bacteria short term dosing nzvi was effective in recovering anammox activity with a high do exposure 2 mg l 1 yet it inhibited anammox activity as low as 5 mg l 1 when it was dosed in absence of do exposure acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51522809 the

19021,as obligate anaerobes anammox bacteria are sensitive to oxygen which might hinder the maximization of anammox activity however there are very few effective strategies to rapidly recover anammox activity after its deterioration under exposure of oxygen in this study the activity recovery of anammox bacteria encountering dissolved oxygen do exposure 0 2 and 2 0 mg l 1 were compared by three strategies in short term experiments nzvi fe ii dosing and n2 purging nzvi is more effective in recovering anammox activity with a high do exposure 2 mg l 1 compared to a low do exposure 0 2 mg l 1 after inhibiting by 2 0 mg l 1 do anammox activity recovery normalized to the control was ranked in the order of nzvi 5 mg l 1 addition 63 8 2 fe ii 5 mg l 1 addition 41 8 0 n2 purging 39 4 0 in contrast to fe ii ion additions the shell structure of nzvi combined with the buffering effect of biomass extracellular polysaccharide eps prevented the sharp ph variation and excessive dissolved fe ii fe iii in solution under such circumstances nzvi addition 5 and 25 mg l 1 increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species ros to a moderate level 200 which might be responsible for the better activity recovery of anammox than that of fe ii addition and n2 purging specifically 5 mg l 1 nzvi dosage moderately enhanced the intracellular o2 production 150 of the control after scavenging 2 0 mg l 1 do and the anammox activity recovered better than that of both 5 and 25 mg l 1 fe ii ions additions however high dosage nzvi 75 mg l 1 inhibited anammox activity in spite of low or high do exposure our findings elucidate that appropriate amount of nzvi short term dosing can rapidly recover anammox activity when anammox bacteria encountering oxygen exposure accidentally and could be

penetrate to the anammox zone thus inhibiting the activity of anammox bacteria as a consequence the nitrogen removal rate in one stage pn a systems is often 3 5 times lower than that in the sole anammox process sliekers et al 2003 third et al 2005 to improve nitrogen removal capacity effective control strategies need to be developed to remove residual do after aeration periods to quickly recover the anammox activity nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi may be an intriguing candidate for quickly recovering the anammox activity after anammox encountering high do inhibition nzvi has a strong reductive capability because of its large active surface area liu et al 2017 yan et al 2013 accordingly nzvi can rapidly consume residual do and decrease the oxidation reduction potential yu et al 2014 creating favorable conditions for anammox bacteria moreover the iron ions fe ii fe iii produced from nzvi corrosion can stimulate the anammox activity liu and ni 2015 qiao et al 2013 shu et al 2016 as they are the important component of heme containing enzymes including cytochrome c proteins hydrazine synthase and hydrazine dehydrogenase that play key roles in anammox catabolism kartal et al 2013 kartal and keltjens 2016 therefore we put forward that nzvi might have a great potential for recovering anammox activity after encountering do shocks previously the impacts of nzvi on microorganisms has attracted increasing attention on one hand nzvi could exhibit inhibitory effects on the growth of microorganisms for example pure cultured laboratory studies have shown that nzvi is deleterious to microorganisms such as escherichia coli nitrifiers and denitrifiers due to its toxicity inactivation the intracellular reactive oxygen species ros formation potentially through fenton reaction and cell membrane damage auffan et al 2008 keenan and sedlak 2008 lefevre et al 2015 lv et al 2017 ševců et al 2011 on the other hand appropriate nzvi additions have shown positive enhancement on microbial activities in anammox erdim et al 2019 anaerobic digestion suanon et al 2016 nitrate reduction lefevre et al 2015 shin and cha 2008 and dechlorination kocur et al 2015 for example low nzvi dose 4 10 5 5 mg l 1 could enhance anammox activity through eps secretion and granulation after a long term operation erdim et al 2019 in addition a pilot scale carboxymethyl cellullose nzvi injection 700 g was performed on a site contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds which increased the abundance of dehalococcoides spp by an order of magnitude kocur et al 2015 although substantial studies have investigated the impacts of nzvis on various microorganisms little is known about the effects of nzvi on anammox systems after encountering do exposure to test our hypothesis we conducted nzvi addition assays using anammox bacteria after do inhibition do 0 2 and 2 0 mg l 1 for 90 min and determined whether nzvi addition could accelerate the activity recovery of anammox bacteria after do inhibition to this end we evaluated the anammox activity and the ros production of anammox bacteria along the nzvi dosages ranging from 5 to 75 mg l 1 after do exposure in parallel we measured the effect of ferrous ions additions using a series of batch assays the water chemistry variations induced by different nzvi and ferrous ions additions under do presence absence and biotic abiotic conditions were also investigated with special regards to fe ii fe iii dissolution and aquatic ph variations the possible mechanism by which nzvi fe ii influences anammox processes were also elucidated from both hydrochemical and biological aspects our findings provide compelling evidence that nzvi at the dosage of 5 and 25 mg l 1 can accelerate anammox activity recovery from high do exposure 2 mg l 1 2 material and methods 2 1 parent anammox reactor and nzvi nanoparticles the experimental anammox biomass was collected from a laboratory scale anammox sequencing batch

remove flocs and resuspended in a medium without nh4cl and nano2 a series of batch tests were performed at 35 2 c in plexiglass reactors with a 250 ml working volume and a mixing rate of 150 rpm each reactor was inoculated with a suspension of anammox bacteria with a final mixed liquid volatile suspended solid mlvss concentration of approximately 2 g l 1 before the experiment the reactor was purged with a n2 gas mixture for 30 min to remove do completely 0 05 mg l 1 the initial ph of the bioreactor was adjusted to 7 3 0 1 by adding 0 1 m hcl or naoh an aliquot solution 4 ml containing 500

conditions of batch tests are summarized in table 1 and the details as follows 2 2 1 biotic experiments with nzvi addition during expts an o2 low high n2 and an o2 low high nzvi in total 300 min the anammox batch reactors were operated under anaerobic condition for 90 min for the subsequent 90 min air was introduced with syringes through air diffusers from the bottom of the reactors the do concentration was maintained at 0 2 mg l 1 for o2 low tests and 2 0 mg l 1 for o2 high tests by manually controlling the air input after do exposure n2 or nzvi were applied into reactors respectively for expt an o2 low high n2 reactors were flushed with n2 until the do concentration was less than 0 05 mg l 1 for expt an o2 low high nzvi aliquots of nzvi were added into reactors reaching the designed iron concentrations 0 5 25 75 mg l 1 table 1 expt an nzvi in total 210 min was set up in 9 reactors to test the effect of nzvi on the anammox activity in the absence of do after the first anoxic 90 min nzvi was added directly to the reactor with the concentrations of 5 25 or 75 mg l 1 respectively throughout the expt an nzvi the headspace of the bioreactor was flushed with n2 to prevent oxygen from transferring into the solution 2 2 2 biotic experiments with fe ii ions addition in expt an o2 high fe ii in total 300 min all the procedures and the do concentrations were the same as expt an o2 high nzvi except that different dosages of feso4 was added instead of nzvi reaching the designed concentrations of 5 25 and 75 mg fe ii l 1 table 1 2 2 3 abiotic experiments with nzvi addition in the absence of do total 210 min considering that the substrate no2 for anammox bacteria can also be reduced by nzvi to nh4 and or n2 as the end product eqs 1 and 2 abiotic tests expt abiotic nzvi were conducted to calculate the lost nitrogen amount through chemical reduction of no2 by nzvi both nh4 and no2 were added to reactors initially and operated for 210 min without biomass

about 1 5 ml were taken from the reactors every 30 min by syringe to avoid contacting with air and transferred to an anaerobic chamber for intracellular ros detection at the end of each experiment 5 ml sludge samples were collected to extract the extracellular polymeric substances eps using the modified heat extraction method described previously li and yang 2007 the experiments were conducted in triplicates for each iron concentration for all above batch tests approximately 2 ml mixed liquid samples were taken from the reactors at regular intervals and immediately filtered through a 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membrane to determine the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n fe ii and total iron 2 3 analytical techniques 2 3 1 chemical analyses the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were determined in duplicates with an ic 5000 ion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific equipped with an ionpac cs12a column 250 mm 4 mm or an ionpac as11 hc column 250 mm 4 mm thermo fisher scientific usa for anion or cation determination respectively the concentrations of dissolved fe ii total dissolved iron and mlvss were determined in triplicates by the 1 10 phenanthroline method and the gravimetric method american public health association apha et al 2005 without addition of hydroxylamine hydrochloride only fe ii in samples can react with 1 10 phenanthroline while the total concentration of fe was quantified after adding hydroxylamine hydrochloride final concentration 60 mm and fe iii concentration was calculated as the difference between fe total and fe ii the concentrations of protein and humic substances in eps were measured in triplicates using the modified lowry method frølund et al 1995 the polysaccharides in eps were measured in triplicates using the anthrone sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 see text s6 for details the concentration of total iron in eps was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes agilent technologies china the do and ph values were monitored online through multi350i cellox 325 do probe and multi 340i sentix 41 ph probe wtw germany the limit of detection lod of these methods were summarized in table s1 2 3 2 the anammox activity measurement the preliminary abiotic tests indicated that only 0 7 0 4 of the tn was lost through nzvi reduction by nitrogen mass balance calculation see text s2 for details in addition the inhibition tests proved that anammox bacteria was responsible for the nitrogen removal see text s3 and table s3 for details therefore the specific anammox activity saa in the biotic experiments can be quantified by dividing the tn consumption rate the maximum slope of the plot of the tn remaining with time by the biomass concentration the saa in aeration and recovery period of each biotic experiments were normalized with respect to the saa in anoxic period using the following equation relative activity saa in do inhibition or recovery period

beyotime china was used to detect intracellular o2 the detection procedure and the effectiveness of dcfh da probe were conducted and verified by positive control according to the manufacturer s instructions text s4 according to the manufacturer s instruction the incubation time should be adjusted within 15 60 min preliminary experiments indicated that ros signal is stable within 50 min fig s2 and thus we adopted 30 min as the final incubation time in our study after incubation the next centrifugation washing and detection steps were conducted within 10 min to assure that ros signal is

activity by do exposure the exposure of anammox activity to 0 2 and 2 0 mg l 1 do for 90 min exhibited different inhibitory effects table 1 under do exposure of 0 2 mg l 1 the anammox activity was inhibited to 76 5 4 of the control p 0 05 when exposed to 2 0 mg l 1 do the anammox activity decreased to 8 0 3 0 of the control p 0 05 fig 1 obviously high do exposure 2 0 mg l 1 for 90 min caused a significant inhibition to the activity of anammox bacteria candidatus k stuttgartiensis 3 2 recovery of annamox activity with n2 purging or nzvi addition after do inhibition n2 purging approach was applied to remove the residual do expt an o2 low n2 and an o2 high n2 as shown in table 1 the anammox activity remained approximately 66 4 5 of the control after 0 2 mg l 1 do was removed an o2 low n2 while it recovered to 39 4 0 p 0 05 after 2 0 mg l 1 do was removed an o2 high n2 fig 1 and table 1 these results demonstrate that anammox bacteria cannot completely recover their activity even though the residual do was fully removed for the nzvi addition approach expt an o2 low high nzvi anammox activity performed better with low dosages of nzvi 5 and 25 mg l 1 than with n2 purging but a high dosage of nzvi 75 mg l 1 inhibited anammox activity in the expt an o2 low nzvi i e anammox encountering 0 2 mg l 1 do exposure the anammox activities were 71 4 7 and 79 5 8 of the control after addition of 5 and 25 mg l 1 nzvi respectively table 1 both of which were higher than that of the n2 purged approach 66 4 5 of the control p 0 05 but just close to the activity in 0 2 mg l 1 do exposure 76 5 4 of the control for the an o2 high nzvi assays i e anammox encountering 2 0 mg l 1 do exposure the anammox activities recovered to 63 8 2 and 53 5 9 of the control when 5 and 25 mg l 1 nzvi were added respectively both being higher than 39 4 0 for the n2 purged assays p 0 05 fig 1 these results indicate that nzvi is more effective recovering anammox activity from high do 2 mg l 1 inhibition however when the nzvi dosage was increased to 75 mg l 1 the anammox activities for both 0 2 and 2 0 mg l 1 do exposures was 28 2 0 and 24 2 5 of the control respectively being lower than that of the n2 purged assays p 0 05 indicating an inhibitory effect by high nzvi additions table 1 and fig 1 3 3 effect of nzvi on anammox activity without do exposure to assess whether nzvi could directly enhance the anammox activity except playing do scavenger nzvi was added into anammox biomass without any do exposure treatment expt an nzvi it is found that all three nzvi additions 5 25 and 75 mg l 1 inhibited the anammox activity instead of promotion even with 5 mg l 1 nzvi addition the anammox activity decreased to 82 1 3 of the control expt an nzvi table 1 in contrast to the promotional effect of 5 mg l 1 nzvi in the presence of do this is consistent with the previous studies that nzvi has shown higher toxicity to bacteria under deoxygenated conditions lee et al 2008 as do may lead to the corrosion and surface oxidation of nzvi reducing its redox activity 3 4 ph variation and fe ii fe iii dissolution with nzvi additions as ph and fe ii dissolution in nzvi corrosion reactions eqs 3 and 6 have significant effects on the reactivity of nzvi and further determines the nzvi toxicity to the microorganisms ph variation and fe ii fe iii dissolution were investigated in

after do exposure did not induce a remarkable change in ph profile fig 2 a and b partially due to the simultaneous consumption of h and oh by nzvi in the presence of do eqs 3 5 in an nzvi experiments without do exposure there was also no substantial ph variation after nzvi additions eq 6 fig 2c in contrast nzvi addition 25 and 75 mg l 1 led to a rapid increase in ph from approximately 7 3 to 8 4 within initial 10 min in the expt abiotic nzvi without biomass fig 3 due to consumption of a large amount of proton eqs 1 2 and 6 the discrepancy of ph variations between biotic and abiotic experiments was mainly attributed to the presence of biomass matrix in the expt an nzvi which might have induced nanoparticle aggregation or coating of biomass on the nzvi surface reducing the nzvi reaction rate chen et al 2011 tratnyek et al 2001 it seems that the presence of biomass matrix may have acted as a ph buffer that avoids the severe ph increase to produce negative alkalinity effect on anammox bacteria the dissolved fe ii fe iii concentrations were investigated after dosing nzvi for the an o2 low high nzvi tests the dissolved fe ii fe iii concentration in 5 and 25 mg l 1 nzvi addition assays were below the detection limit 0 01 mg l 1 when the nzvi dosage reached 75 mg l 1 the dissolved fe ii fe iii concentration slowly increased to 0 9 0 04 and 2 4 0 1 mg l 1 within 300 min in an o2 low nzvi and an o2 high nzvi assays respectively fig 4 a in the biotic an nzvi assays the dissolved fe ii fe iii concentrations rapidly reached a plateau in 30 min and then remained at 0 2 0 02 1 5 0 1 and 3 2 0 03 mg l 1 under 5 25 and 75 mg l 1 nzvi additions respectively fig 4a in contrast the dissolved iron ions fe ii fe iii peaked at 2 9 0 01 17 0 0 1 and 34 5 0 5 mg l 1 respectively within 15 min with 5 25 and 75 mg l 1 nzvi additions in the abiotic test fig 3 the ten fold lower fe ii fe iii concentrations in biotic assays than in abiotic assays suggests that a large

decreased below 0 2 mg l 1 within 38 min fig 2d i and anammox activity recovered to 41 8 of the control table 1 and fig 1 close to 39 4 0 of that of n2 purging when 25 mg l 1 fe ii was added 2 0 mg l

physiological response induced by either do or high dosage of nzvi auffan et al 2008 imlay 2013 ševců et al 2011 might have profound effects on various biological metabolic processes we firstly applied probe dcfh da zhen et al 2018 zheng et al 2011 to detect the total ros but no ros response was observed to both do exposure and nzvi additions p 0 05 fig s5 then the wst 1 probe was applied to detect intracellular o2 which was not included in the detection range of rosdcfh we found the intracellular o2 was induced to a moderate level 140 150 of the control in both an o2 low nzvi and an o2 high nzvi assays after dosing low nzvi 5 and 25 mg l 1 fig 4b i and ii when the nzvi addition was increased to 75 mg l 1 after 0 2 and 2 0 mg l 1 do exposures the amount of intracellular o2 dramatically increased to 375 86 and 332 37 of the control p 0 01 which is 2 fold higher than that in the 5 and 25 mg l 1 nzvi addition tests fig 4b i and ii likewise the intracellular o2 under fe ii treatment condition expt an o2 high fe ii increased to 179 27 and 248 49 compared to the control p 0 01 after 25 and 75 mg l 1 fe ii additions fig 4b iv regarding to expt an nzvi without do exposure assays 5 25 and 75 mg l 1 nzvi additions led to an increase in the amount of intracellular o2 to 104 8 0 219 62 and 683 6 5 of the control respectively fig 4b iii 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms of enhanced anammox activity by nzvi addition after do exposure our results elucidate that eliminating the inhibitor do can be an important function of nzvi to recover anammox bacteria from do exposure and 5 75 mg l 1 nzvi additions were observed sufficient to consume residual do 0 2 2 0 mg l 1 fig 2a and b especially nzvi is more effective in recovering anammox activity from high do 2 mg l 1 inhibition while it barely promoted anammox activity and even inhibited anammox bacteria with low 0 2 mg l 1 or without do also the dissolved fe ii produced from nzvi corrosion reaction might have the bio stimulation impact on anammox bacteria which can be supported by the an o2 low high nzvi and an o2 high fe ii assays table 1 that adding appropriate amount of iron i e nzvi and fe ii directly into anammox biomass enhanced the anammox activity table 1 these findings agree with the previous studies that fe ii 4 5 5 0 mg l 1 liu and ni 2015 shu et al 2016 or iron oxide gao et al 2014 addition at a reasonable dosage significantly improved the anammox activity mainly because iron is the key component of many heme containing enzymes that play key roles in anammox catabolism kartal et al 2013 kartal and keltjens 2016 in addition it is intriguing to find that after 2 mg l 1 do exposure nzvi gave 50 better anammox recovery than fe ii iron addition did even with the same iron dosages 5 mg l 1 fig 1 corresponding to its higher o2 production than fe ii 152 vs 111 thus nzvi inducted ros formation to a low or moderate level might have partially contributed to the better anammox recovery by nzvi addition than by fe ii ion additions or n2 purging table 1 and fig 1 our pre experiments showed that 150 mg l 1 nzvi additions did not change the live dead ratio of anammox biomass in both anoxic and aerobic conditions data not shown therefore the anammox activity may be influenced by the intracellular o2 variation and their correlation was depicted in fig 5 obviously when the anammox activity was promoted by adding nzvi or fe ii ions the corresponding intracellular o2 levels were approximately 140 150 of the control fig 5a in contrast when the intracellular o2 level was over 200 of the control the anammox activity decreased fig 5a indeed intracellular ros has been classified into three board categories including mild oxidative stress mos temperate oxidative stress tos and severe oxidative stress sos in which mos may be beneficial the activity recovery by strengthening of protective potential of organism lushchak 2014 for example o2 can protect bacterial cells by inducing a variety of protective genes largely through the soxrs regulon and mitigate the antimicrobial lethality of antibiotics burger and drlica 2009 zhao and drlica 2014 similarly for escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis a moderate increase in the o2 amount decreased the antimicrobial mediated killing djorić and kristich 2015 mosel et al 2013 likewise a moderate o2 accumulation may also play a positive bio stimulation role in the rapid recovery of anammox bacteria from do inhibition in the present study potentially via expression of certain protective genes by anammox bacteria the exact mechanism requires to be elucidated in further studies 4 2 mechanism of intracellular o2 production after nzvi and fe ii ions additions intracellular fenton reaction is an important source of ros in biological systems where fe ii or fe iii reacts with h2o2 and produces oxygen free radicals in this study an increase in the amount of intracellular o2 was detected for anammox biomass after addition of nzvi fig 4b this postulation is also supported by a close linear relationship observed between the intracellular o2 level and the dissolved free fe ii fe iii concentration in nzvi addition assays that with a correction coefficient r of 0 863 fig 5b a possible mechanism of intracellular o2 production after nzvi and fe ii ions additions have been proposed in fig 6 fe ii ion as the basic reactant of the fenton reaction can be produced from the nzvi corrosion eq 6 or oxidation in the presence of do eq 1 fig 2a and freely diffuse into the periplasm through outer membrane porins de almeida et al 2016 before they are transported into the cytoplasm by the feob transporter ferousi et al 2017 fig 6 h2o2 another reactant of fenton reaction can be formed in solution through nzvi reaction katsoyiannis et al 2008 or autoxidation of fe ii reinke et al 1994 fig 6 and then penetrate into typical lipid bilayers of bacteria with a permeability coefficient similar to water alternatively h2o2 can also be generated intracellularly through autoxidation of redox enzymes imlay 2013 thus once both fe ii and h2o2 are available inside microbial cells the fenton reaction can occur and produce o2 fig 6 4 3 reduced toxic impact of nzvi added to anammox bio systems using an anammox enriched system our results proved that the toxicity of nzvi was largely mitigated by physic chemical conditions encountered in situ in addition to the quick shell formation of nzvi in the presence of do the complexation ability of biomass derived eps may also reduce the free fe iii fe ii ions fig 4a i ii thus preventing the high o2 production sos risk in application the sos risk could be avoided by considering the reasonable nzvi dosages according to the online do monitoring signal and biomass concentration in biological systems 4 3 1 function of rapid formation of nzvi core shell in the presence of do nzvi tends to form a core shell structure that the outer layer is covered by precipitated corrosion products eqs 5 8 which decreases both the chemical corrosion rate and the fe ii fe iii dissolution rate by preventing physical contact between the nzvi core and water keenan and sedlak 2008 mu et al 2017 comparing an o2 low high nzvi and an nzvi experiments though with the same amount of biomass 2 g vss l 1 and nzvi additions 75 mg l 1 the free fe ii fe iii dissolution rate and its maximum concentration were much lower in expt an o2 low high nzvi assays than in an nzvi assays fig 4a i iii this is because nzvi formed shell faster and thicker with do presence than that of without do liu et al 2017 thus retarding the fe ii fe iii dissolution rate fig 6 the decreased fe ii fe iii dissolution further favored to reduce the nzvi toxicity as only moderate intracellular o2 was detected i e sos emergency was avoided fig 5b which ensures the safety of nzvi application to biological systems 4 3 2 complexation and storage of fe ii fe iii by microbial eps matrix our results indicated that microbial eps has the ability to entrap the fe ii fe iii from nzvi or fe2 addition table 2 previous studies have reported that the humic acid contained in eps can form strong complexes with metal ions and change the metal solubility the dissolution kinetics and equilibria fujii et al 2014 rangsivek and jekel 2005 rose and waite 2003 tratnyek et al 2001 zhang et al 2011 thereby mitigating the toxicity of nzvi to bacteria li et al 2010 the complexation ability of eps is influenced by the species and the amount of functional groups such as carboxyl catechol bipyridine like groups daugherty et al 2017 which led to the heterogeneous complexation rate and capacity to dissolved fe ii fe iii and thus the highly non linear iron ions in eps table 2 in addition the microbial eps in the present study is sufficient to complex the slow dissolved iron from 25 mg l 1 nzvi after do exposure fig 4a i and ii as the excess dissolved fe ii fe iii that comes from either nzvi or fe2 may therefore lead to high o2 and produce a severe toxic effect to microorganisms fig 5b the metal complexation ability of microbial eps would possibly mitigate the toxicity effect in the excessive nzvi addition scenario fig 6 4 4 engineering applications the do exposure to anammox bacteria is prevail during operation of anammox bioreactors such as in one stage pn a system excessive do supply or air leakage of anaerobic bioreactors in the present study the optimum anammox activity promotion function was achieved with 5 mg l 1 nzvi after 90 min 2 0 mg l 1 do inhibition with the anammox performance being about 50 higher than that achieved with both n2 purging and fe ii addition approaches fig 1 with the high recovery capability under high do exposure condition the nzvi addition may be used to reduce the non aeration time simultaneously improved anammox performance in one stage nitritation anammox like reactors in addition the bio stimulation effect of nzvi may also be applied to the incubation period of anammox biomass during which the low abundance of anammox bacteria makes the reactor be highly sensitive to even low concentrations of do the nzvi addition should be accurately assessed in advance it should be noted that although the fe ii addition can also consume do it needs at least five times more iron dosages than nzvi to effectively enhance the anammox activity from 2 0 mg l 1 do inhibition tables 1 5 mg l 1 nzvi with 25 mg l 1 fe ii thus leading to high chemical sludge production issues as predicted by wang and waite 2010 although the manufacturing cost of nzvi is now still somewhat high around 0 05 0 10 g 1 compared to less than 0 001 g 1 of micro and bulk fe0 cost crane and scott 2012 our results show that the nzvi dosage required for anammox activity recovery after do inhibition even at 2 0 mg l 1 was much lower than that required in current applications such as soil remediation groundwater and wastewater treatments which generally require dosages in the range 0 25 20 g l 1 comba et al 2011 crane and scott 2012 yan et al 2013 it should be noted that the high do inhibition to anammox bacteria occasionally or incidentally appear in anammox systems rather than frequent occurrence therefore our short term aims to solve the incidental emergence of do inhibition scenario in the anammox bioreactors rather than constant occurrence of do inhibition thus the dosage of nzvi is required only if the activity of anammox bacteria has been incidentally inhibited by do rather than long term dosage from this aspect infrequent addition of nzvi at low dosage e g 5 mg l 1 is economically feasible on the other hand as the effects of nzvi on the anammox system may vary for different species of anammox bacteria in long term reactions further studies are required to develop long term nzvi additional approach for anammox bioreactors and to obtain the optimized nzvi dosages avoid the possible biotoxicity impact at various do levels in complex wastewater environment 5 conclusions in this work nzvi 1 100 nm was prepared and utilized in the recovery of anammox activity from do inhibition the activity recovery of anammox bacteria encountering oxygen exposure 0 2 and 2 0 mg l 1 were compared by three strategies short term dosing nzvi fe ii and n2 purging paying special regards to the intracellular ros production fe ii fe iii dissolution and aquatic ph variations with various iron nzvi and fe ii dosages the main conclusions are as follows after inhibited by 2 0 mg l 1 do for 90 min ranking of anammox activity recovery was in the order nzvi 5 mg l 1 addition 63 8 2 fe ii 5 mg l 1 addition 41 8 0 n2 purging 39 3 0 under the condition of low do exposure 0 2 mg l 1 for 90 min the anammox recovery by n2 purging or nzvi addition was less efficient than under high do exposure condition a moderate o2 production 140 150 of the control induced by low dose nzvi 5 and 25 mg l 1 played a positive bio stimulation role in the rapid recovery of anammox activity from do inhibition high dose nzvi 75 mg l 1 led to high levels of o2 over 200 of the control and inhibited anammox activity the limited ph changes and less fe ii fe iii release in low dose of nzvi additions to anammox bio systems could also be an advantage for the nzvi technique since a vigorous ph increase and decrease as well as the excessive release of dissolved iron ions is not favorable to the activity recovery of anammox bacteria short term dosing nzvi was effective in recovering anammox activity with a high do exposure 2 mg l 1 yet it inhibited anammox activity as low as 5 mg l 1 when it was dosed in absence of do exposure acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51522809 the

19022,the well known virtual water hypothesis states that water deficient regions countries could alleviate water stress through importing water intensive products from water abundant regions countries although observed trading patterns do often not support this hypothesis there is a lack of research to explore the reasons why trade patterns often do not support the intuitive virtual water hypothesis to fill this important gap we introduce comparative advantage theory in a quantitative way to track the driving forces of net virtual water export based on the spatial temporal distribution of resource productivity and opportunity costs of land labor and water use in agricultural and non agricultural sectors across chinese provinces between 1995 and 2015 the results show that regional differences in land productivity between agricultural and non agricultural sectors are the main forces determining the pattern of virtual water flows across major regions and other resources such as labor and water have played only a limited role our study shows that the current market forces reflect the scarcity of land resources but does not reflect the water scarcity in the context of interregional trade in china our findings suggest that the ongoing efforts to increase land productivity of agriculture in the southern regions would contribute to reducing water scarcity in the north and northeast china plain graphical abstract image 1 keywords virtual water productivity comparative advantage opportunity cost 1 introduction substantial attention has been paid to the topic of virtual water in recent years since tony allan coined the term to describe water used for the production of crops traded in international markets allan 1996 2002 2003 numerous studies have estimated virtual water flows by calculating how much water is used to produce goods and services at the river basin regional national and global scales chapagain and hoekstra 2008 feng and hubacek 2015 feng et al 2012 guan and hubacek 2007 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 hoekstra and hung 2005 serrano et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 2016 2017 estimates of virtual water flows largely reflect international trade statistics whereby major food exporting countries such as argentina australia and the usa are large net virtual water exporters while major food importing countries such as japan north african and europe are large net virtual water importers mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 the virtual water perspective was initially proposed as a strategy for countries with water shortage to import commodities that consume substantial amounts of water and are produced in water abundant countries to alleviate existing water stress however numerous studies show that this strategy is not reflected in the international trade data for example ramirez vallejo and rogers 2004 find that observed trading patterns are independent of water resources endowments ramirez vallejo and rogers 2004 du fraiture 2004 suggest that water savings cannot always be reallocated to other beneficial purposes including relieving ecological scarcities to mitigate water scarcity implying that economic and political considerations may have more influence than water scarcity in determining national trade strategies du fraiture 2004 wichelns 2010 shows that trading strategies based on the virtual water perspective are not consistent with the economic concept of comparative advantage ca and cannot be used alone as a criterion for developing optimal policies wichelns 2010 similarly a number of studies have found that often water abundant countries import water intensive products while water scarce countries export water intensive products due to the dominating influence of others factors such as land endowment labor costs and institutions kumar and singh 2005 similar results can also be found in the context of studies on water flows in china for example guan and hubacek 2007 find that the water scarce northern areas of china predominantly export water intensive goods while the water abundant southern areas import water intensive goods feng et al 2014 expand the scope by including all provinces and incorporated water stress index into the virtual water flow analysis and they found that water consumption in highly developed and water rich coastal provinces largely rely on virtual water inflows from water scarce northern provinces such as xinjiang hebei and inner mongolia thus significantly increasing water scarcity in these regions similarly zhao et al 2015 show that major virtual water flows from the economically poor and water scarce northwest areas to the more affluent and water abundant coastal areas by far exceed the annual real water transfer proposed by the south north water transfer project zhuo et al 2016a b demonstrate that crop related virtual water flows within china was from north to south since 2000 thus south china gradually became dependent on food supply from the water scarce north their results confirm the view that domestic virtual water trade is dominated by economic and government policies rather than regional disparity in water endowments one important conclusion of these studies is that factors such as population density land endowment policy considerations and water pricing may be more important than water endowment for guiding trade and virtual water flows ca theory is an economic theory about the benefits that individuals firms or nations achieve from trade that originated from differences in their factor endowments or technological progress and opportunity cost is a key concept in ca theory deardorff 2005 2014 dornbusch et al 1977 2004 hidalgo and hausmann 2009 hartmann et al 2015 this theory provides a powerful perspective that could explain the driving forces of commodity trade similarly all of these factors related to virtual water trade could also be reflected in the notion of ca disparity across trading partners and the distribution patterns of resource productivity however previous studies supply only some narrative explanations or hypothetical examples an exception is the work by duchin and morales 2015 who introduced the rectangular choice of technology rcot model within an input output framework to quantify the ca of food production in water rich regions nevertheless their model focuses on the constraints of water endowment to agriculture production without attention to land and the competition for land water and labor between agricultural and non agricultural sectors other studies are more conceptual for example wichelns 2010 used one hypothetical example to demonstrate how optimal trading strategies would be influenced by a ca of water endowment in two virtual small countries most studies do not quantify the ca of production factors associated with the virtual water trade in a multi regional context empirically to fill this research gap we select land use labor input and water consumption as the main production factors to model the linkages between virtual water trade and ca in terms of opportunity costs in a multi sectoral framework first we assess the spatial distribution of resource productivity in china s 31 provinces in 2015 excluding hong kong macao and taiwan then we show how these productivities change between 1995 and 2015 furthermore based on ca theory we assess the ca of each resource in three aggregate sectors agriculture industry and services at the provincial scale to detect whether the spatial distribution of these factors has a significant association with the patterns of china s virtual water trade across provinces there are several reasons why we choose china as our research focus first china s regional development shows a persistent imbalance this imbalance has been associated with pronounced disparity in factor productivity and differences in resource endowment regional specialization and economic booming during the reform and opening era have led to significant increase in inter regional commodity trade as a result the virtual water flows embodied in trade across regions is extensive wang and mao 2017 sheng et al 2014 second as the largest exporting country and the second largest economy in the world china s exports present a significant part of the global economy dynamics of interregional trade structure within china would have significant implications for the global trade and global economy nevertheless the reasons underpinning the persistent unsustainable trading structure with water deficient regions exporting virtual water to water abundant regions in china has not yet been found to fill in this important gap a systematic analysis of key production factors that shape the patterns of virtual water trading becomes essential 2 methods and data 2 1 method productivity refers to the amount of output in physical or monetary units per unit of resource input upadhyaya and alok 2016 to allow for the

w c i j is the water consumption of industry i in region j m3 yr in this study we work with three aggregate economic sectors agriculture industry sector including industry manufacturing and construction and services we introduce the concepts of opportunity cost oc and comparative advantage ca to assess one region s productive advantage in one sector when compared with another region deardorff 2014 opportunity cost is a key concept in economics it represents the benefits an individual investor or business misses from all other alternatives when one alternative is chosen buchanan 2008 that means for example in our case when using a specific unit of a resource e g water for producing agricultural goods the region has to simultaneously give up its use for producing non agricultural goods and vice versa in other words this specific unit of the resource is no longer available anymore for other uses and the opportunity costs are the benefits that would have been incurred for the best alternative use of this unit equations 4 and 5 refer to the oc of agricultural goods and non agricultural good per unit of land in km2 labor per worker and water in m3 4 o c r a

the oc of agriculture goods which equals the maximum value between the industry sector s productivity and the service sector s productivity for resource r land labor force and water o c r n o n a g r i c u l t u r e is the oc of non agriculture goods which equals the agriculture productivity for resource r across regions and sectors different economic benefits will be obtained from one unit of resource land labor force and water consumption ca is a way to compare such differences based on the oc measurements as presented in equation 6 below 6 c a r j o c r j a g r i c u l u t r e o c r j n

agricultural commodities relative to producing agriculture goods compared to region k to explore the association between the ca of a specific resource and virtual water flows in other words to investigate which resource s ca is a significant factor in driving virtual water export we conduct a multivariate linear regression analysis to test the statistical connection between the oc and net virtual water flows controlling for relevant geographical features hartmann et al 2015 the following regression is the baseline specification that we use to study the role of the three resources 7 y p

oc for agriculture production x 5 p and water s oc for non agriculture production x 6 p respectively a positive and statistically significant coefficient in the equation indicates that virtual water export increases with an increase in oc in contrast a negative and statistically significant coefficient means that there is a negative relation between virtual water exports and oc please note that the six explanatory variables in equations 1 5 include the essential components of regional gdp and therefore we do not include gdp as a separate variable to avoid a high level of implicit multicollinearity in other words our study puts the essential components of regional gdp into comparative advantage measures so that we can see whether the disparity of resource s comparative advantage exerts a significance influence on virtual water flow in our study the net virtual water outflow by sector and province is the dependent variable and independent variables include ocs of three resources used for agriculture production industrial production and services we use variance inflation factors vif to detect collinearity among all independent variables the results show that all the vifs are smaller than 10 empirical threshold so there is no severe collinearity among these variables table s2 shows vif details given data availability our econometric modeling is based on a panel dataset of 30 provinces for the years 2007 2010 and 2012 y p measures the net virtual water exports from province p to all other provinces in china there are two types of approaches that are frequently used to calculate virtual water flows one is the bottom up approach commonly used for water footprint accounting which estimates virtual water flows by multiplying the amount of water used per unit of product by the amount of the product that is traded by using detailed trade data chapagain and hoekstra 2008 da silva et al 2016 zhuo et al 2016 orlowsky et al 2014 this approach has been one of the most popular approaches in water footprint studies because data is available from a relatively good database mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 the other one is the top down approach which calculates the virtual water flow by tracing entire regional national or global supply chains based on input output tables provided by national statistical agencies in this way water consumed during production is attributed to final consumers rather than intermediate consumers this approach aggregates the processes and products at the level of economic sectors usually coupling water consumption in economic sectors with environmental input output analysis zhao et al 2015 2017 cai et al 2019 white et al 2018 raul et al 2017 feng et al 2014 and hubacek and feng 2016 present a detailed comparison of the two approaches china s virtual water flows among 30 provinces in 2007 2010 and 2012 are calculated based on environmental multiregional input output analysis

data sources to calculate resource productivity at the province level based on equations 1 3 we need regional domestic production or economic output land use labor input and water consumption for agriculture industry and services we collect regional domestic production from the china statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 1996a 2001a 2006a 2011a 2016a the chinese

virtual water trade among provinces using china multi regional input output table for years 2007 2010 and 2012 compiled by liu et al 2014 and mi et al 2017 we collected data on water consumption and annual local water availability from the provincial water resource bulletin the ministry of water resources of china 1998 2001 2006 2011 2016 and we used the urbanization rate to estimate water consumption of the service sector in each province table s6 shows the correspondence between urbanization rate and service s water consumption detailed procedures could be found in liu 2016 3 results

productivity was 1 5 million cny km2 for agriculture 744 2 million cny km2 for industry and 575 million cny km2 for services note that 1 cny equals 0 1582 us land productivity of the industry sector was nearly 510 times greater than that of agriculture see table 2 land productivity varied between 1411 3 million cny km2 in tianjin for the industry sector and 0 9 million cny km2 in ningxia for agriculture beijing as the capital had the highest land productivity for both agriculture and services with 3 0 million cny km2 and 1392 1 million cny km2 respectively however because of its special role in china beijing was changing its industrial structure from resource intensive products to advanced service products and the livelihood of most of its citizens and most necessities relied on imports from other regions or abroad as a result although beijing showed very high productivity for agriculture much higher land productivity was actually captured by services the top three maps in fig 1 indicate that most of the high values of land productivity were clustered in the eastern coastal areas of china especially in the yangtze river delta yrd the bohai economic rim ber except hebei and the pearl river delta prd whereas nearly all of the low values were located in the economically less developed northwest areas of china in terms of the spatial pattern of labor productivity one worker would create either 11 8 thousand cny 115 2 thousand cny or 59 3 thousand cny if he or she had ability to freely enter the agriculture industry or service sector respectively see table 1 labor productivity of the industry sector was ten times greater than that of agriculture and twice that of services specifically we noticed that labor productivity in agriculture ranged from 4 7 thousand cny worker in tibet to 28 thousand cny worker in jiangsu this value varied from 66 6 thousand cny worker in zhejiang to 374 2 thousand cny worker in inner mongolia for industry and services ranged from 31 2 thousand cny worker in guizhou to 189 5 thousand cny worker in tianjin in terms of the spatial pattern of labor productivity we noticed that the high values of agricultural labor productivity were dispersed in different regions including jiangsu shanghai heilongjiang xinjiang and tianjin but industry s hotpots were concentrated in several northern regions such as inner mongolia tianjin xinjiang and jilin the eastern regions had a flourishing service economy the southwest regions lagged far behind in labor productivity for both agriculture and services as for water productivity the results show that service enterprises reaped the highest economic benefit per unit of water use 1846 4 cny m3 followed by industry and agriculture for which the corresponding figures were 729 5 cny m3 and 11 5 cny m3 respectively see table 1 these findings are similar to ye et al 2018 in that agriculture had the lowest water productivity but consumed the most water resources and was the predominant water user there was a huge difference between the region with the highest and that with the lowest water productivity across the three economic sectors this disparity was 19 times in agriculture 30 times in industry and 20 times in services respectively regarding to the spatial pattern of water productivity as fig 1 shows high water productivity in the agricultural sector was mainly located in the main diagonal section of china chongqing guizhou henan shandong etc similar to land productivity high values of water productivity in the industry and service sector were clustered in the yrd the ber except hebei and the prd but low values were clustered in the western regions 3 2 the spatial pattern of comparative advantage in china in 2015 fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of ca for agriculture and the non agricultural sectors in 2015 and more detailed information is provided in table 2 at the national average oc of agricultural use was 508 5 9 8 and 160 times higher than the productivity of agriculture in terms of land labor and water respectively in terms of land shaanxi would suffer the highest oc if land changed from non agricultural use to crop planting which was equivalent to non agricultural land being 900 times more productive than agricultural land productivity on the other hand hainan had the lowest oc because of the small resource productivity gap across the three sectors followed by xinjiang in terms of the labor force the ca ratios varied from 32 6 in tibet to 3 2 in jiangsu and we noticed that in most western regions tibet qinghai yunnan and guangxi with a considerable labor productivity gap between the agricultural and non agricultural sectors the ca ratio was over 20 but for the developed coastal areas zhejiang shanghai and jiangsu this value was lower than six as for ca of water our results show considerable differences across regions the highest ca value was located in shanghai which was higher than 1600 while the lowest value was in guizhou with just 43 furthermore most of water scarce regions in north china except jilin and shaanxi had significant ca of water in industry 3 3 the changes in resource productivity and comparative advantage from 1995 to 2015 fig 3 and table s7 show the changes in resource productivity and ca of land labor and water over the past two decades from 1995 to 2015 we see from the figure that all the indicators increased over time the productivity per unit of land for agriculture increased slightly from just 0 97 million cny km2 to 1 46 million cny km2 labor productivity increased from 4645 cny worker to 11 758 cny worker and water yield increased from 6 cny m3 to 12 cny m3 however industrial productivity grew sharply by 3 6 times in land productivity 5 9 times in labor and 8 5 times in water productivity similar results are found in the service sector the results demonstrate that the national average resource productivity between the agricultural and non agricultural sectors was increasing over the 20 years most significantly the discrepancy of land resource productivity between agriculture and non agricultural sectors has grown from 209 times in 1995 to 510 times in 2015 in contrast the range of national average ca varies from 4 2 to 9 8 per unit of labor for water this value changed from 38 in 1995 to 154 in 2015 3 4 net virtual water outflows and opportunity cost at provincial scale table 3 reports the results of nine multivariate pooled panel regressions between the net virtual water outflow as dependent variable and ocs of resources for agriculture and non agricultural production as the key explanatory variables columns 1 9 illustrated a sequence of nested models that regressed the net virtual water exports against x1p land s oc for agriculture production x2p land s oc for non agricultural production x3p labor s oc for agriculture production x4p labor s oc for non agricultural production x5p water s oc for agriculture production x6p water s oc for non agricultural production log pop population and log irr irrigation land in nearly every model the x2p land s oc for non agricultural production is positive and significant predictors of net virtual water exports whereas x1p land s oc for agriculture is negatively correlated with the dependent variable together all the variables explained 53 of the variance in net virtual water exports across the 30 provinces over the period table 3 column 1 however x2p land s oc for non agricultural production proved to be the most significant variable in the regression analysis and explained the largest percentage of the variance in net virtual water exports after the effects of all other variables have been considered in more detail the semi partial correlation of x2p the difference in the adjusted r2 between the full model and one for which only x2p was removed was 5 4 0 53 0 476 meaning that 5 4 of the variance in net virtual water exports was explained by x2p table 1 followed by x1p in contrast other key explanatory variables x3p to x6p are not statistically significant across models 1 8 and did not improve the accuracy of the model when irrigation land is excluded from the model see column ⅸ x4p and x5p show statistically significant influence on virtual water flow at the 10 level with the marginal effect lower and significant level less than x1p thus we find that other resources comparative advantages do not play an important role in shaping virtual water trade as a matter of fact a one standard deviation increase in x1p decreased net virtual water exports by approximately 0 295 standard deviation and a one standard deviation increase of x2p increased net virtual water exports by about 0 656 standard deviation in the most completely specified model see column i as a result net virtual water exports was most significantly associated with the change of x2p and x1p 4 discussion this study investigated the spatial temporal distribution of resource productivity and comparative advantage ca for land labor and water based on economic output per unit of resource consumption in 31 provinces of china from 1995 to 2015 for the first time we introduced ca theory to study the driving forces of virtual water exports the results show that the provinces with high land productivity were clustered in the eastern coastal areas of china especially in the yellow river delta the bohai economic rim except hebei and the pearl river delta however high values of labor productivity were dispersed throughout different regions for instance a hotspot of the industry sector was found in the northern regions whereas the eastern regions were dominated by service sectors the findings show that there were huge differences in water productivity across sectors and regions the ca analysis reveals that the average opportunity cost oc of agricultural production was 510 9 8 and 160 times higher than the agricultural productivity of land labor and water respectively our pooled panel data regression results demonstrate that increases in land s oc for agricultural use would curb virtual water exports whereas an increase in land s oc for non agricultural use would tend to be accompanied by an increase in virtual water exports in other words if land produces higher returns outside agricultural production then the net outflow of virtual water tends to be lower this conclusion is similar to the observations in feng et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 ye et al 2018 and chen et al 2017 in these studies xinjiang as the biggest virtual water exporter had exported a large amount of virtual water through exporting water intensive food commodities to other provinces particularly to the eastern coastal provinces such as shandong shanghai tianjin and jiangsu the results for land ca confirm the existing huge disparity between xinjiang and the regions receiving its virtual water such as shanghai in shanghai we found that land productivity in services was about 440 times higher than that in agriculture for xinjiang this value was just 230 which is the second smallest in china as a result shanghai will purchase water intensive commodities from these regions that have lower land oc for agricultural production in tianjin another high net importer of virtual water one km2 of land will produce 1411 3 million cny for non agricultural enterprises which is 610 times bigger than that for agricultural land however in xinjiang this gap is only 230 times similar results could also be found between the second biggest virtual water exporter hebei and its water receiving regions in other words water net importers have higher returns of land from industrial production or services and thus import more agricultural products our regression analysis highlights the dominant role played by land in shaping virtual water export this finding is notably interesting our explanation is as follows land is a capital intensive and indispensable production factor for all sectors and is not movable across regions in contrast labor in general and skilled labor in particular have become increasingly mobile in china at the same time landholders aim to utilize their land resources to produce products with the highest ca and import commodities with a comparative disadvantage in less developed regions the gap of land productivity between non agricultural and agricultural sectors has been smaller than that in developed regions in addition non agricultural job opportunities are more limited in less developed regions these together drive land holders in less developed regions to explore comparative advantage in producing and exporting food related commodities for example the north china plain and the northeast region despite being water scarce have become major exporters of water intensive food products to more industrialized and water rich regions the intensification and expansion of agricultural production in these two water scarce regions have led to over exploitation of ground water the rapid drop of groundwater tables in the north china plain has caused many environmental problems such as dried up rivers and lakes seawater intrusion land subsidence and ground fissures xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 as well as health problems when pumping reaches deep layers with water containing toxic levels of fluoride and arsenic currell et al 2012 the above tension means that how to recover local groundwater tables without undermining regional grain production level has become the most important policy challenge in the region zhong et al 2017 our research highlights the nationwide drivers of this tension the relative gaps of land productivity between non agricultural and agricultural production across regions moreover in china the spatial distribution of industry is mainly determined by scarcity of land resources and the effects of labor and water resources are secondary in the water rich regions of china arable land per capita is smaller and the land productivity gap between non agricultural and agricultural production is much bigger than those in water scarce regions the above economic logic means that it is more profitable for water rich regions to use their scarce land resources for non agricultural production and import land intensive products from other regions for example guangdong and zhejiang two water rich but land scarce provinces have become highly industrialized and urbanized and are increasingly dependent on importing land and water intensive goods like food from other regions and abroad our findings reveal that the gap between agricultural productivity and non agricultural productivity in the three resource categories have increased during the past two decades which means that the growth in resource productivity of agriculture is much slower than that of the non agricultural sectors especially in the northern regions our results indicate that the northern regions can export large amounts of food products to southern provinces because of their high total production driven by more available land and not because they have higher land productivity in comparison with the southern provinces because agricultural production is land and water intensive improving resource productivity of the agricultural sector is of fundamental importance for alleviating arable land scarcity and reducing water stress in china our findings further indicate that increasing land productivity of agriculture in the southern regions will contribute to water stress reduction in the north and northeast china plains in our study the ca of labor and water do not play an important role in shaping net virtual water exports this is not surprising because of the following reasons first skilled labor is mobile and can relatively easily move from one place to another especially if it is within the same country vast numbers of manufacturing centers in the southern regions like guangdong and zhejiang have been manpowered by cheap labor of immigrants from other regions as a result the gap of labor productivity in non agricultural sectors between water scarce and water rich regions are more a reflection of differences in living costs earning opportunity and overall economic development which are fundamentally different from differences in land productivity second the production of goods and services requires water however in many instances water is an open access resource that is subject to the tragedy of the commons which explains why water is often freely used and water resources are over exploited especially in agriculture our study shows that the current market forces reflect the scarcity of land resources it does not reflect the scarcity of water resources in the context of interregional trade in china a number of limitations should be taken into consideration when interpreting the main results of this study first spatial resolution is restricted to provincial administrative boundaries rather than watershed level due to a lack of trade and thus virtual water flow data at the sub province level second our analysis focuses on three aggregated sectors agriculture industry and the services however different crops have very different land productivity nevertheless the comparison across aggregated sectors is a suitable starting point third the data constraints and the resultant small sample size do not allow us to run more complicated panel regressions than the pooled ols although we introduced regional and time dummy variables to represent regional and temporal variations the two regional dummy variables may not be sufficient to capture specificities of individual provinces for example the difference in crop mix and productive specialization in the future once more data become available it will be straightforward to extend our analysis using fixed effect and other regression techniques another potential extension can be based on a bilateral measurements of virtual water flows and cas between two regions when such bilateral flow data become available for multiple years finally similar to most other scholars exploring water issues at the national and provincial level we rely on official chinese statistics both at the national scale such as data obtained from the china statistical yearbook and the chinese agricultural yearbook and at the provincial scale such as data obtained from provincial water resources bulletin the reliability of chinese statistics has often been questioned but still presents the best available comprehensive secondary datasets available for our research questions zhao et al 2015 2016 5 conclusion this study introduces a quantitative framework to comparative advantage theory and then uses it to track the driving forces of virtual water exports based on the spatial temporal distribution of resource productivity and opportunity cost of land labor and water use in agricultural and non agricultural sectors across chinese provinces our findings reveal that the regional differences in land productivity between agricultural and non agricultural sectors are the main forces shaping the pattern of virtual water flows across regions whereas other resources such as labor and water have played a less important role the regions that tend to show a net import of virtual water flows such as southern china are also the ones that have high opportunity costs for their land resources and gain higher shares of value added by using their land for non agricultural production and import agricultural products even if they have fertile land and rich water resources our findings suggest that efforts to increase land productivity of agriculture in the southern regions would contribute to reducing water scarcity in the north and northeast china plains in this way our study presents an excellent example of how an innovative coupling of economic theories with natural resource management can explain the counter intuitive phenomenon of the virtual water flows in trade from water scarce regions to water rich

19022,the well known virtual water hypothesis states that water deficient regions countries could alleviate water stress through importing water intensive products from water abundant regions countries although observed trading patterns do often not support this hypothesis there is a lack of research to explore the reasons why trade patterns often do not support the intuitive virtual water hypothesis to fill this important gap we introduce comparative advantage theory in a quantitative way to track the driving forces of net virtual water export based on the spatial temporal distribution of resource productivity and opportunity costs of land labor and water use in agricultural and non agricultural sectors across chinese provinces between 1995 and 2015 the results show that regional differences in land productivity between agricultural and non agricultural sectors are the main forces determining the pattern of virtual water flows across major regions and other resources such as labor and water have played only a limited role our study shows that the current market forces reflect the scarcity of land resources but does not reflect the water scarcity in the context of interregional trade in china our findings suggest that the ongoing efforts to increase land productivity of agriculture in the southern regions would contribute to reducing water scarcity in the north and northeast china plain graphical abstract image 1 keywords virtual water productivity comparative advantage opportunity cost 1 introduction substantial attention has been paid to the topic of virtual water in recent years since tony allan coined the term to describe water used for the production of crops traded in international markets allan 1996 2002 2003 numerous studies have estimated virtual water flows by calculating how much water is used to produce goods and services at the river basin regional national and global scales chapagain and hoekstra 2008 feng and hubacek 2015 feng et al 2012 guan and hubacek 2007 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 hoekstra and hung 2005 serrano et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 2016 2017 estimates of virtual water flows largely reflect international trade statistics whereby major food exporting countries such as argentina australia and the usa are large net virtual water exporters while major food importing countries such as japan north african and europe are large net virtual water importers mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 the virtual water perspective was initially proposed as a strategy for countries with water shortage to import commodities that consume substantial amounts of water and are produced in water abundant countries to alleviate existing water stress however numerous studies show that this strategy is not reflected in the international trade data for example ramirez vallejo and rogers 2004 find that observed trading patterns are independent of water resources endowments ramirez vallejo and rogers 2004 du fraiture 2004 suggest that water savings cannot always be reallocated to other beneficial purposes including relieving ecological scarcities to mitigate water scarcity implying that economic and political considerations may have more influence than water scarcity in determining national trade strategies du fraiture 2004 wichelns 2010 shows that trading strategies based on the virtual water perspective are not consistent with the economic concept of comparative advantage ca and cannot be used alone as a criterion for developing optimal policies wichelns 2010 similarly a number of studies have found that often water abundant countries import water intensive products while water scarce countries export water intensive products due to the dominating influence of others factors such as land endowment labor costs and institutions kumar and singh 2005 similar results can also be found in the context of studies on water flows in china for example guan and hubacek 2007 find that the water scarce northern areas of china predominantly export water intensive goods while the water abundant southern areas import water intensive goods feng et al 2014 expand the scope by including all provinces and incorporated water stress index into the virtual water flow analysis and they found that water consumption in highly developed and water rich coastal provinces largely rely on virtual water inflows from water scarce northern provinces such as xinjiang hebei and inner mongolia thus significantly increasing water scarcity in these regions similarly zhao et al 2015 show that major virtual water flows from the economically poor and water scarce northwest areas to the more affluent and water abundant coastal areas by far exceed the annual real water transfer proposed by the south north water transfer project zhuo et al 2016a b demonstrate that crop related virtual water flows within china was from north to south since 2000 thus south china gradually became dependent on food supply from the water scarce north their results confirm the view that domestic virtual water trade is dominated by economic and government policies rather than regional disparity in water endowments one important conclusion of these studies is that factors such as population density land endowment policy considerations and water pricing may be more important than water endowment for guiding trade and virtual water flows ca theory is an economic theory about the benefits that individuals firms or nations achieve from trade that originated from differences in their factor endowments or technological progress and opportunity cost is a key concept in ca theory deardorff 2005 2014 dornbusch et al 1977 2004 hidalgo and hausmann 2009 hartmann et al 2015 this theory provides a powerful perspective that could explain the driving forces of commodity trade similarly all of these factors related to virtual water trade could also be reflected in the notion of ca disparity across trading partners and the distribution patterns of resource productivity however previous studies supply only some narrative explanations or hypothetical examples an exception is the work by duchin and morales 2015 who introduced the rectangular choice of technology rcot model within an input output framework to quantify the ca of food production in water rich regions nevertheless their model focuses on the constraints of water endowment to agriculture production without attention to land and the competition for land water and labor between agricultural and non agricultural sectors other studies are more conceptual for example wichelns 2010 used one hypothetical example to demonstrate how optimal trading strategies would be influenced by a ca of water endowment in two virtual small countries most studies do not quantify the ca of production factors associated with the virtual water trade in a multi regional context empirically to fill this research gap we select land use labor input and water consumption as the main production factors to model the linkages between virtual water trade and ca in terms of opportunity costs in a multi sectoral framework first we assess the spatial distribution of resource productivity in china s 31 provinces in 2015 excluding hong kong macao and taiwan then we show how these productivities change between 1995 and 2015 furthermore based on ca theory we assess the ca of each resource in three aggregate sectors agriculture industry and services at the provincial scale to detect whether the spatial distribution of these factors has a significant association with the patterns of china s virtual water trade across provinces there are several reasons why we choose china as our research focus first china s regional development shows a persistent imbalance this imbalance has been associated with pronounced disparity in factor productivity and differences in resource endowment regional specialization and economic booming during the reform and opening era have led to significant increase in inter regional commodity trade as a result the virtual water flows embodied in trade across regions is extensive wang and mao 2017 sheng et al 2014 second as the largest exporting country and the second largest economy in the world china s exports present a significant part of the global economy dynamics of interregional trade structure within china would have significant implications for the global trade and global economy nevertheless the reasons underpinning the persistent unsustainable trading structure with water deficient regions exporting virtual water to water abundant regions in china has not yet been found to fill in this important gap a systematic analysis of key production factors that shape the patterns of virtual water trading becomes essential 2 methods and data 2 1 method productivity refers to the amount of output in physical or monetary units per unit of resource input upadhyaya and alok 2016 to allow for the

construction and services we introduce the concepts of opportunity cost oc and comparative advantage ca to assess one region s productive advantage in one sector when compared with another region deardorff 2014 opportunity cost is a key concept in economics it represents the benefits an individual investor or business misses from all other alternatives when one alternative is chosen buchanan 2008 that means for example in our case when using a specific unit of a resource e g water for producing agricultural goods the region has to simultaneously give up its use for producing non agricultural goods and vice versa in other words this specific unit of the resource is no longer available anymore for other uses and the opportunity costs are the benefits that would have been incurred for the best alternative use of this unit equations 4 and 5 refer to the oc of agricultural goods and non agricultural good per unit of land in km2 labor per worker and water in m3 4 o c r a

agricultural commodities relative to producing agriculture goods compared to region k to explore the association between the ca of a specific resource and virtual water flows in other words to investigate which resource s ca is a significant factor in driving virtual water export we conduct a multivariate linear regression analysis to test the statistical connection between the oc and net virtual water flows controlling for relevant geographical features hartmann et al 2015 the following regression is the baseline specification that we use to study the role of the three resources 7 y p

export increases with an increase in oc in contrast a negative and statistically significant coefficient means that there is a negative relation between virtual water exports and oc please note that the six explanatory variables in equations 1 5 include the essential components of regional gdp and therefore we do not include gdp as a separate variable to avoid a high level of implicit multicollinearity in other words our study puts the essential components of regional gdp into comparative advantage measures so that we can see whether the disparity of resource s comparative advantage exerts a significance influence on virtual water flow in our study the net virtual water outflow by sector and province is the dependent variable and independent variables include ocs of three resources used for agriculture production industrial production and services we use variance inflation factors vif to detect collinearity among all independent variables the results show that all the vifs are smaller than 10 empirical threshold so there is no severe collinearity among these variables table s2 shows vif details given data availability our econometric modeling is based on a panel dataset of 30 provinces for the years 2007 2010 and 2012 y p measures the net virtual water exports from province p to all other provinces in china there are two types of approaches that are frequently used to calculate virtual water flows one is the bottom up approach commonly used for water footprint accounting which estimates virtual water flows by multiplying the amount of water used per unit of product by the amount of the product that is traded by using detailed trade data chapagain and hoekstra 2008 da silva et al 2016 zhuo et al 2016 orlowsky et al 2014 this approach has been one of the most popular approaches in water footprint studies because data is available from a relatively good database mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 the other one is the top down approach which calculates the virtual water flow by tracing entire regional national or global supply chains based on input output tables provided by national statistical agencies in this way water consumed during production is attributed to final consumers rather than intermediate consumers this approach aggregates the processes and products at the level of economic sectors usually coupling water consumption in economic sectors with environmental input output analysis zhao et al 2015 2017 cai et al 2019 white et al 2018 raul et al 2017 feng et al 2014 and hubacek and feng 2016 present a detailed comparison of the two approaches china s virtual water flows among 30 provinces in 2007 2010 and 2012 are calculated based on environmental multiregional input output analysis

data sources to calculate resource productivity at the province level based on equations 1 3 we need regional domestic production or economic output land use labor input and water consumption for agriculture industry and services we collect regional domestic production from the china statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 1996a 2001a 2006a 2011a 2016a the chinese agricultural yearbook ministry of agriculture 1996 2001 2006 2011 2016 and the china rural statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 1996b 2001b 2006b 2011b 2016b regional domestic production values are deflated to 2005 constant prices land use area for each industry are provided by the ministry of housing and urban rural development ministry of housing and urban rural development 2006 2010 2015 the yearbooks supply land use data at different scales therefore we aggregated this data into the same scale as regional gdp according to the standard on current land use classification of china ministry of land and resources of china and the standard classification of national economy national bureau of statistics of china 2011c the working labor force for each sector at the regional scale was obtained from the china labor statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 1996c 2001c 2006c 2011d 2016 the china statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 1996a 2001a 2006a 2011a 2016a and the china rural statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 1996b 2001b 2006b 2011b 2016b based on equations 9 10 we calculated virtual water trade among provinces using china multi regional input output table for years 2007 2010 and 2012 compiled by liu et al 2014 and mi et al 2017 we collected data on water consumption and annual local water availability from the provincial water resource bulletin the ministry of water resources of china 1998 2001 2006 2011 2016 and we used the urbanization rate to estimate water consumption of the service sector in each province table s6 shows the correspondence between urbanization rate and service s water consumption detailed procedures could be found in liu 2016 3 results 3 1 the spatial distribution of land labor and water productivity in 2015 fig 1 and table 1 show the spatial distribution of land labor and water productivity in 2015 in china in 2015 the average land productivity was 1 5 million cny km2 for agriculture 744 2 million cny km2 for industry and 575 million cny km2 for services note that 1 cny equals 0 1582 us land productivity of the industry sector was nearly 510 times greater than that of agriculture see table 2 land productivity varied between 1411 3 million cny km2 in tianjin for the industry sector and 0 9 million cny km2 in ningxia for agriculture beijing as the capital had the highest land productivity for both agriculture and services with 3 0 million cny km2 and 1392 1 million cny km2 respectively however because of its special role in china beijing was changing its industrial structure from resource intensive products to advanced service products and the livelihood of most of its citizens and most necessities relied on imports from other regions or abroad as a result although beijing showed very high productivity for agriculture much higher land productivity was actually captured by services the top three maps in fig 1 indicate that most of the high values of land productivity were clustered in the eastern coastal areas of china especially in the yangtze river delta yrd the bohai economic rim ber except hebei and the pearl river delta prd whereas nearly all of the low values were located in the economically less developed northwest areas of china in terms of the spatial pattern of labor productivity one worker would create either 11 8 thousand cny 115 2 thousand cny or 59 3 thousand cny if he or she had ability to freely enter the agriculture industry or service sector respectively see table 1 labor productivity of the industry sector was ten times greater than that of agriculture and twice that of services specifically we noticed that labor productivity in agriculture ranged from 4 7 thousand cny worker in tibet to 28 thousand cny worker in jiangsu this value varied from 66 6 thousand cny worker in zhejiang to 374 2 thousand cny worker in inner mongolia for industry and services ranged from 31 2 thousand cny worker in guizhou to 189 5 thousand cny worker in tianjin in terms of the spatial pattern of labor productivity we noticed that the high values of agricultural labor productivity were dispersed in different regions including jiangsu shanghai heilongjiang xinjiang and tianjin but industry s hotpots were concentrated in several northern regions such as inner mongolia tianjin xinjiang and jilin the eastern regions had a flourishing service economy the southwest regions lagged far behind in labor productivity for both agriculture and services as for water productivity the results show that service enterprises reaped the highest economic benefit per unit of water use 1846 4 cny m3 followed by industry and agriculture for which the corresponding figures were 729 5 cny m3 and 11 5 cny m3 respectively see table 1 these findings are similar to ye et al 2018 in that agriculture had the lowest water productivity but consumed the most water resources and was the predominant water user there was a huge difference between the region with the highest and that with the lowest water productivity across the three economic sectors this disparity was 19 times in agriculture 30 times in industry and 20 times in services respectively regarding to the spatial pattern of water productivity as fig 1 shows high water productivity in the agricultural sector was mainly located in the main diagonal section of china chongqing guizhou henan shandong etc similar to land productivity high values of water productivity in the industry and service sector were clustered in the yrd the ber except hebei and the prd but low values were clustered in the western regions 3 2 the spatial pattern of comparative advantage in china in 2015 fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of ca for agriculture and the non agricultural sectors in 2015 and more detailed information is provided in table 2 at the national average oc of agricultural use was 508 5 9 8 and 160 times higher than the productivity of agriculture in terms of land labor and water respectively in terms of land shaanxi would suffer the highest oc if land changed from non agricultural use to crop planting which was equivalent to non agricultural land being 900 times more productive than agricultural land productivity on the other hand hainan had the lowest oc because of the small resource productivity gap across the three sectors followed by xinjiang in terms of the labor force the ca ratios varied from 32 6 in tibet to 3 2 in jiangsu and we noticed that in most western regions tibet qinghai yunnan and guangxi with a considerable labor productivity gap between the agricultural and non agricultural sectors the ca ratio was over 20 but for the developed coastal areas zhejiang shanghai and jiangsu this value was lower than six as for ca of water our results show considerable differences across regions the highest ca value was located in shanghai which was higher than 1600 while the lowest value was in guizhou with just 43 furthermore most of water scarce regions in north china except jilin and shaanxi had significant ca of water in industry 3 3 the changes in resource productivity and comparative advantage from 1995 to 2015 fig 3 and table s7 show the changes in resource productivity and ca of land labor and water over the past two decades from 1995 to 2015 we see from the figure that all the indicators increased over time the productivity per unit of land for agriculture increased slightly from just 0 97 million cny km2 to 1 46 million cny km2 labor productivity increased from 4645 cny worker to 11 758 cny worker and water yield increased from 6 cny m3 to 12 cny m3 however industrial productivity grew sharply by 3 6 times in land productivity 5 9 times in labor and 8 5 times in water productivity similar results are found in the service sector the results demonstrate that the national average resource productivity between the agricultural and non agricultural sectors was increasing over the 20 years most significantly the discrepancy of land resource productivity between agriculture and non agricultural sectors has grown from 209 times in 1995 to 510 times in 2015 in contrast the range of national average ca varies from 4 2 to 9 8 per unit of labor for water this value changed from 38 in 1995 to 154 in 2015 3 4 net virtual water outflows and opportunity cost at provincial scale table 3 reports the results of nine multivariate pooled panel regressions between the net virtual water outflow as dependent variable and ocs of resources for agriculture and non agricultural production as the key explanatory variables columns 1 9 illustrated a sequence of nested models that regressed the net virtual water exports against x1p land s oc for agriculture production x2p land s oc for non agricultural production x3p labor s oc for agriculture production x4p labor s oc for non agricultural production x5p water s oc for agriculture production x6p water s oc for non agricultural production log pop population and log irr irrigation land in nearly every model the x2p land s oc for non agricultural production is positive and significant predictors of net virtual water exports whereas x1p land s oc for agriculture is negatively correlated with the dependent variable together all the variables explained 53 of the variance in net virtual water exports across the 30 provinces over the period table 3 column 1 however x2p land s oc for non agricultural production proved to be the most significant variable in the regression analysis and explained the largest percentage of the variance in net virtual water exports after the effects of all other variables have been considered in more detail the semi partial correlation of x2p the difference in the adjusted r2 between the full model and one for which only x2p was removed was 5 4 0 53 0 476 meaning that 5 4 of the variance in net virtual water exports was explained by x2p table 1 followed by x1p in contrast other key explanatory variables x3p to x6p are not statistically significant across models 1 8 and did not improve the accuracy of the model when irrigation land is excluded from the model see column ⅸ x4p and x5p show statistically significant influence on virtual water flow at the 10 level with the marginal effect lower and significant level less than x1p thus we find that other resources comparative advantages do not play an important role in shaping virtual water trade as a matter of fact a one standard deviation increase in x1p decreased net virtual water exports by approximately 0 295 standard deviation and a one standard deviation increase of x2p increased net virtual water exports by about 0 656 standard deviation in the most completely specified model see column i as a result net virtual water exports was most significantly associated with the change of x2p and x1p 4 discussion this study investigated the spatial temporal distribution of resource productivity and comparative advantage ca for land labor and water based on economic output per unit of resource consumption in 31 provinces of china from 1995 to 2015 for the first time we introduced ca theory to study the driving forces of virtual water exports the results show that the provinces with high land productivity were clustered in the eastern coastal areas of china especially in the yellow river delta the bohai economic rim except hebei and the pearl river delta however high values of labor productivity were dispersed throughout different regions for instance a hotspot of the industry sector was found in the northern regions whereas the eastern regions were dominated by service sectors the findings show that there were huge differences in water productivity across sectors and regions the ca analysis reveals that the average opportunity cost oc of agricultural production was 510 9 8 and 160 times higher than the agricultural productivity of land labor and water respectively our pooled panel data regression results demonstrate that increases in land s oc for agricultural use would curb virtual water exports whereas an increase in land s oc for non agricultural use would tend to be accompanied by an increase in virtual water exports in other words if land produces higher returns outside agricultural production then the net outflow of virtual water tends to be lower this conclusion is similar to the observations in feng et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 ye et al 2018 and chen et al 2017 in these studies xinjiang as the biggest virtual water exporter had exported a large amount of virtual water through exporting water intensive food commodities to other provinces particularly to the eastern coastal provinces such as shandong shanghai tianjin and jiangsu the results for land ca confirm the existing huge disparity between xinjiang and the regions receiving its virtual water such as shanghai in shanghai we found that land productivity in services was about 440 times higher than that in agriculture for xinjiang this value was just 230 which is the second smallest in china as a result shanghai will purchase water intensive commodities from these regions that have lower land oc for agricultural production in tianjin another high net importer of virtual water one km2 of land will produce 1411 3 million cny for non agricultural enterprises which is 610 times bigger than that for agricultural land however in xinjiang this gap is only 230 times similar results could also be found between the second biggest virtual water exporter hebei and its water receiving regions in other words water net importers have higher returns of land from industrial production or services and thus import more agricultural products our regression analysis highlights the dominant role played by land in shaping virtual water export this finding is notably interesting our explanation is as follows land is a capital intensive and indispensable production factor for all sectors and is not movable across regions in contrast labor in general and skilled labor in particular have become increasingly mobile in china at the same time landholders aim to utilize their land resources to produce products with the highest ca and import commodities with a comparative disadvantage in less developed regions the gap of land productivity between non agricultural and agricultural sectors has been smaller than that in developed regions in addition non agricultural job opportunities are more limited in less developed regions these together drive land holders in less developed regions to explore comparative advantage in producing and exporting food related commodities for example the north china plain and the northeast region despite being water scarce have become major exporters of water intensive food products to more industrialized and water rich regions the intensification and expansion of agricultural production in these two water scarce regions have led to over exploitation of ground water the rapid drop of groundwater tables in the north china plain has caused many environmental problems such as dried up rivers and lakes seawater intrusion land subsidence and ground fissures xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 as well as health problems when pumping reaches deep layers with water containing toxic levels of fluoride and arsenic currell et al 2012 the above tension means that how to recover local groundwater tables without undermining regional grain production level has become the most important policy challenge in the region zhong et al 2017 our research highlights the nationwide drivers of this tension the relative gaps of land productivity between non agricultural and agricultural production across regions moreover in china the spatial distribution of industry is mainly determined by scarcity of land resources and the effects of labor and water resources are secondary in the water rich regions of china arable land per capita is smaller and the land productivity gap between non agricultural and agricultural production is much bigger than those in water scarce regions the above economic logic means that it is more profitable for water rich regions to use their scarce land resources for non agricultural production and import land intensive products from other regions for example guangdong and zhejiang two water rich but land scarce provinces have become highly industrialized and urbanized and are increasingly dependent on importing land and water intensive goods like food from other regions and abroad our findings reveal that the gap between agricultural productivity and non agricultural productivity in the three resource categories have increased during the past two decades which means that the growth in resource productivity of agriculture is much slower than that of the non agricultural sectors especially in the northern regions our results indicate that the northern regions can export large amounts of food products to southern provinces because of their high total production driven by more available land and not because they have higher land productivity in comparison with the southern provinces because agricultural production is land and water intensive improving resource productivity of the agricultural sector is of fundamental importance for alleviating arable land scarcity and reducing water stress in china our findings further indicate that increasing land productivity of agriculture in the southern regions will contribute to water stress reduction in the north and northeast china plains in our study the ca of labor and water do not play an important role in shaping net virtual water exports this is not surprising because of the following reasons first skilled labor is mobile and can relatively easily move from one place to another especially if it is within the same country vast numbers of manufacturing centers in the southern regions like guangdong and zhejiang have been manpowered by cheap labor of immigrants from other regions as a result the gap of labor productivity in non agricultural sectors between water scarce and water rich regions are more a reflection of differences in living costs earning opportunity and overall economic development which are fundamentally different from differences in land productivity second the production of goods and services requires water however in many instances water is an open access resource that is subject to the tragedy of the commons which explains why water is often freely used and water resources are over exploited especially in agriculture our study shows that the current market forces reflect the scarcity of land resources it does not reflect the scarcity of water resources in the context of interregional trade in china a number of limitations should be taken into consideration when interpreting the main results of this study first spatial resolution is restricted to provincial administrative boundaries rather than watershed level due to a lack of trade and thus virtual water flow data at the sub province level second our analysis focuses on three aggregated sectors agriculture industry and the services however different crops have very different land productivity nevertheless the comparison across aggregated sectors is a suitable starting point third the data constraints and the resultant small sample size do not allow us to run more complicated panel regressions than the pooled ols although we introduced regional and time dummy variables to represent regional and temporal variations the two regional dummy variables may not be sufficient to capture specificities of individual provinces for example the difference in crop mix and productive specialization in the future once more data become available it will be straightforward to extend our analysis using fixed effect and other regression techniques another potential extension can be based on a bilateral measurements of virtual water flows and cas between two regions when such bilateral flow data become available for multiple years finally similar to most other scholars exploring water issues at the national and provincial level we rely on official chinese statistics both at the national scale such as data obtained from the china statistical yearbook and the chinese agricultural yearbook and at the provincial scale such as data obtained from provincial water resources bulletin the reliability of chinese statistics has often been questioned but still presents the best available comprehensive secondary datasets available for our research questions zhao et al 2015 2016 5 conclusion this study introduces a quantitative framework to comparative advantage theory and then uses it to track the driving forces of virtual water exports based on the spatial temporal distribution of resource productivity and opportunity cost of land labor and water use in agricultural and non agricultural sectors across chinese provinces our findings reveal that the regional differences in land productivity between agricultural and non agricultural sectors are the main forces shaping the pattern of virtual water flows across regions whereas other resources such as labor and water have played a less important role the regions that tend to show a net import of virtual water flows such as southern china are also the ones that have high opportunity costs for their land resources and gain higher shares of value added by using their land for non agricultural production and import agricultural products even if they have fertile land and rich water resources our findings suggest that efforts to increase land productivity of agriculture in the southern regions would contribute to reducing water scarcity in the north and northeast china plains in this way our study presents an excellent example of how an innovative coupling of economic theories with natural resource management can explain the counter intuitive phenomenon of the virtual water flows in trade from water scarce regions to water rich

19023,mycobacteria represent one of the most persistent bacterial populations in drinking water distribution system dwds biofilm communities however mycobacterial in situ metabolic profiles are largely unknown in this study the metabolic characteristics of mycobacteria in a household water meter biofilm were unveiled using a coupled metagenomic metatranscriptomic approach the water meter biofilm appeared to express nitrogenase genes nifdkh and a full complement of genes coding for several carbon fixation pathways especially the calvin cycle suggesting the co2 sequestration and dinitrogen fixation potential of the biofilm these findings indicate that it may be difficult to prevent the formation of dwds biofilms simply by controlling the availability of organic carbon or nitrogen the composite genome of mycobacteria cg m was reconstructed based on the obtained omics data cg m shared similar genome phylogeny and virulence factor profiles with mycobacterium avium complex suggesting that population cg m might represent a member of mycobacteria with pathogenicity according to the gene expression patterns population cg m showed the metabolic potential to assimilate co2 via the calvin cycle and or anaplerotic reactions and even to grow autotrophically with co as the sole carbon and energy source this suggests that organic carbon may not be a limiting factor for mycobacterial growth in dwdss moreover our results suggest that mycobacterial aromatic degradation is primarily achieved through the catechol meta cleavage pathway and biofilm mycobacteria could prefer phosphate as the phosphorus source graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water distribution system biofilm mycobacteria metabolic potential carbon fixation omics analysis 1 introduction to ensure the biological safety of drinking water an oligotrophic and disinfectant environment in drinking water distribution systems dwdss is usually maintained to prevent microbial regrowth despite these practices some microorganisms can still survive in dwdss and mainly grow as biofilms formed on pipe surfaces causing a series of problems such as the growth of pathogens generation of unpleasant tastes and odors consumption of residue disinfectants and internal corrosion of pipelines hammes et al 2008 accordingly substantial attention has been paid toward developing effective strategies for the prevention and removal of dwds biofilms to improve water quality therefore microbial features in dwds biofilms have been extensively studied using a variety of culture independent molecular techniques for in situ unveiling providing useful information regarding the microbial community structure in dwds biofilms and its environmental impact factors liu et al 2016 in particular the high throughput sequencing of phylogenetic marker genes e g small subunit ribosomal rna genes has yielded high resolution data to provide new insights into biofilm community structures gomez smith et al 2015 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2014 however scientific information on the metabolic potential of dwds biofilms especially those of specific biofilm bacteria such as potential pathogens remains rather scarce mycobacteria represent one of the most persistent bacterial populations in dwds biofilm communities rather than obligate mycobacterial pathogens in humans and animals e g mycobacterium tuberculosis m leprae and m ulcerans mycobacteria found in dwdss are usually those so called non tuberculous mycobacteria ntm or environmental mycobacteria em some of which are clinical relevant e g m avium complex m kansasii and m xenopi ashbolt 2015 murcia et al 2006 vaerewijck et al 2005 posing potential health risks to humans especially immunocompromised individuals falkinham 2009 2015 estimates based on hospital admissions showed that the rate of mycobacterial infection has been increasing by 8 10 annually in the united states falkinham 2015 according to the knowledge obtained dwdss are important sources of mycobacterial infections falkinham 2009 torvinen et al 2004 to realize the effective control of mycobacterial growth in dwdss it is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the survival mechanisms of mycobacteria in dwdss ntm can be divided into the fast and slow growing groups but the rapidly growing ntm still grow substantially slower i e 0 2 0 5 days per generation than many other bacteria falkinham 2009 however some of their traits permit their survival and reproduction in oligotrophic environments such as dwdss for example possibly due to the hydrophobic and complex cell wall mycobacteria are quite resistant to disinfectants and they can adhere and form biofilms on pipe surfaces so as to avoid being washed away notably with respect to nutrient utilization mycobacteria can survive in nutrient deficient environments even in sterile distilled water carson et al 1978 and some organic compounds generally found in water e g humic and fulvic acids can also stimulate mycobacterial growth kirschner et al 1999 nonetheless mycobacterial nutrient metabolism in dwdss especially the metabolic pathways for carbon source utilization is still unclear with regard to in situ metabolic function analyses metagenomics approaches can provide deep insights into the functional profiles of microbial communities in various environments while metatranscriptomics approaches can characterize the gene expression patterns of complex microbial assemblages recent advances in bioinformatics can further reveal the metabolic potentials of specific microorganisms normally the dominant members in communities by reconstructing their genomes from the omics data moreover a coupled metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assay which involves the simultaneous analysis of dna and rna sequence pools from the same community has shown great advantages in unraveling the metabolic functions and gene expression activities of a microbial community and particularly specific community members in situ hua et al 2015 muller et al 2014 however omics based analysis has rarely been applied to dwds biofilm communities which is possibly due to the limited access and high costs of sampling biofilms formed in water meters can be a good alternative to dwds biofilms because water meters are relatively easily obtained from households hong et al 2010 in this study we performed a coupled metagenomic metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbiota in a water meter biofilm and characterized metabolic profiles of mycobacteria in the biofilm based on the omics analysis we aim to reveal the metabolic pathways contributing to the survival of mycobacteria in oligotrophic dwds environments with disinfectant residues and to identify the factors limiting the proliferation of biofilm bacteria in dwdss 2 materials and methods 2 1 biofilm sample collection biofilm samples were collected from fifteen water meters located at five residential buildings b c j x bc in different downtown areas of beijing in october 2014 all water meters are made of cast iron similar to connecting pipes hence the biofilms formed within these water meters can be used as representatives of dwds biofilms the biofilms were scraped out from the inner surface of the water meters at the connection juncture with pipes using a sterile scraper and then immediately suspended in rnalater solution invitrogen carlsbad ca usa and placed into an icebox containing dry ice all biofilm samples were quickly transported to our laboratory and stored at 70 c until use 2 2 water quality analysis before demounting the water meters approximately 10 l of tap water samples were individually collected in sterilized brown glass bottles from the five residential buildings for water quality analysis water quality parameters including chemical oxygen demand cod free chlorine ammonia nitrate sulfate turbidity and total dissolved solid were measured with chinese national standard methods gb5750 85 the concentrations of total phosphorus and phosphate were analyzed using colorimetric malachite green phosphomolybdic heteropoly acid methods based on the water and wastewater monitoring and analysis methods the state environmental protection administration 2002 the detailed values of water quality parameters are summarized in table 1 2 3 nucleic acid extraction total genomic dna and rna in the biofilm samples was extracted using fastdna spin kits mp biomedicals santa ana ca usa and trizol reagents invitrogen carlsbad ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions respectively dna contamination in the rna preparation was checked by including a control in which the reverse transcriptase enzyme was not added to the polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification procedure mixture fig s1 the quality and quantity of total dna and rna were subsequently determined on a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer thermofisher scientific usa the obtained nucleic acids were stored at 70 c until use dna was easily recovered from each biofilm sample dna concentrations ranged from 16 to 32 ng μl whereas rna was successfully extracted only from the bc3 biofilm sample 18 ng μl therefore the bc3 biofilm was used to perform the coupled metagenomic metatranscriptomic analysis 2 4 bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing and analyses the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified using primers 338f and 806r gomez smith et al 2015 with barcodes incorporated into the 5 end of the forward primer after purification of the pcr products on a 2 0 w v agarose gel paired end sequencing was performed on an illumina miseq pe300 sequencer majorbio co ltd shanghai china according to standard protocols after filtering low quality miseq sequences with trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 taxonomic classification of valid sequencing data was performed using the rdp classifier with 16s rrna gene copy number adjustment wang et al 2007 2 5 metagenome and metatranscriptome sequencing and processing dna rna library preparation and illumina sequencing were performed at sinogenomax co ltd beijing china before rna library construction the rna sample were treated with dnase to remove possible dna contamination and then the rrna was removed from the total genomic rna using ribominus transcriptome isolation kits for bacteria thermofisher scientific usa subsequently the cdna library was constructed with a truseq stranded total rna sample preparation kit illumina usa following the manufacturer guidelines paired end sequencing was performed on an illumina hiseq 2500 platform massive parallel sequencing of dna and rna generated 17 8 gb and 34 gb raw metagenomic and metatranscriptomic reads respectively the raw data were then submitted to the mg rast webserver for assembly free analysis of the biofilm microbial community structure meyer et al 2008 2 5 1 assembly and binning raw paired end reads were initially trimmed for quality score q threshold of 15 and adaptor contamination using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 subsequently the rrna sequences were further filtered from the trimmed metatranscriptomic data set with sortmerna v2 0 kopylova et al 2012 the remaining reads were used as clean data for downstream analyses to reduce the complexity we first assembled the metagenomic reads with soapdenovo li et al 2010 the metatranscriptomic reads were then mapped against the assembled metagenomic fragments using burrows wheeler aligner bwa li and durbin 2009 non mapped reads were assembled separately with idba tran peng et al 2012 and then merged with the metagenomic assembly obtained assembled sequences longer than 1500 bp were grouped using vizbin software based on a reference free binning algorithm laczny et al 2014 2015 the binning method is based on nonlinear dimension reduction via barnes hut stochastic neighbor embedding of centered log ratio transformed oligonucleotide signatures extracted from assembled genomic sequence fragments followed by human augmented clustering into composite genomes cgs genome completeness of the cgs was estimated on the basis of 40 universal single copy genes as described previously muller et al 2014 taxonomies of the cgs were classified by amphora2 and the rast webserver aziz et al 2008 kerepesi et al 2015 wu and scott 2012 for the mycobacteria associated cg

prediction zhu et al 2010 mao et al 2014 predicted protein sequences were annotated using ghostkoala based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthology kanehisa et al 2016 the annotation results were then used to reconstruct metabolic pathways of the biofilm and the recovered mycobacterial population cg m with kegg mapping tools https www genome jp kegg mapper html the tophat2 cufflinks pipeline was applied to perform the gene expression analysis trapnell et al 2012 the metatranscriptomic reads were mapped against the total assembled sequences with tophat2 then cufflinks

from the cufflinks output gene expression levels were estimated on the basis of the cufflinks calculated fpkms a minimum fpkm expression threshold of 1 was applied to the data in order to minimize possible noise trakhtenberg et al 2016 2 5 3 mycobacterial composite genome phylogenomic analysis of cg m was conducted using gegenees 2 2 1 agren et al 2012 the percentages of blastn similarity was calculated with a cutoff threshold of 10 for non conserved material and then used to generate a phylogenomic tree using splitstree4 with the neighbor joining method huson and bryant 2006 phylogenetic analysis of the predicted ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase rubisco a key enzyme of the calvin cycle genes encoded by cg m was performed using mega7 kumar et al 2016 potential virulence factors in cg m were identified by searching ghostkoala annotations of cg m against the mycobacterial virulence factors described by forrellad et al 2013 2 6 data availability raw sequencing data including 16s rrna sequencing data metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data can be found at the national center for biotechnology information ncbi website under bioproject prjna487710 3 results and discussion 3 1 bacterial community composition in water meter biofilms fifteen 16s rrna gene v3 v4 region libraries with an average of 30 000 sequences per library were constructed to reveal bacterial communities of the biofilm samples collected from household water meters based on the rdp classifier analysis with 16s rrna gene copy adjustment proteobacteria and actinobacteria were generally the dominant phyla identified in the biofilm bacterial communities fig s2 as shown in fig 1 consistent with previous studies on dwds biofilms chao et al 2015 li et al 2016 mycobacterium and pseudomonas were the prevalent genera in dwds biofilms mycobacterium was detected in 14 of the 15 biofilm samples 20 of sequences in 8 communities with a maximum of 58 6 pseudomonas appeared in all biofilm samples 10 of sequences in 7 communities with a maximum of 71 9 notably many nitrogen cycling bacteria were detected including bradyrhizobium along with autotrophic bacteria such as nitrospira and nitrosomonas bradyrhizobium many members of which fix atmospheric nitrogen appeared frequently 13 of 15 samples and dominated in some biofilm communities 3 15 3 3 14 9 of sequences nitrospira 12 15 and nitrosomonas 7 14 were also frequently detected and nitrospira showed high abundances 20 of sequences in two biofilm samples bc3 and x2 because these chemoautotrophic nitrifiers can fix co2 they may supply available carbon sources for other heterotrophic biofilm bacteria 3 2 omics based analyses of the water meter biofilm the coupled metagenomic metatranscriptomic analysis was performed for only one biofilm sample bc3 whose total rna and dna were successfully extracted first assembly free community analysis was performed to assess the bacterial composition of the bc3 biofilm using mg rast consistent with the 16s rrna gene sequencing result mycobacterium nitrospira and bradyrhizobium were the dominant genera identified in the bc3 biofilm based on both the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data the assembled fragments derived from the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data were used to evaluate the metabolic profile of the bc3 biofilm by the kegg analysis with the gene expression pattern characterized based on the metatranscriptomic data with regard to carbon source utilization the biofilm contained genes coding for several complete carbon fixation pathways especially the calvin cycle tables 2 and s2 furthermore according to the metatranscriptomic analysis a full complement of calvin cycle genes appeared to be actively expressed with fpkm values of 3219 and 4324 for rubisco genes rbcl and rbcs respectively the results indicate that the biofilm bacteria have the metabolic potential to fix co2 which may be important for the biofilm development in oligotrophic dwdss the frequent occurrence of co2 fixation genes could be associated with the abundant autotrophic bacteria e g nitrospira detected in the biofilm fig 1 given that organic compounds in drinking water are generally derived from natural organic matters nom that is normally rich in aromatic components blokker et al 2013 brocca et al 2002 we estimated the aromatic degradation potential of the biofilm based on the omics data the bc3 biofilm contained a full complement of genes coding for several aerobic aromatic biodegradation pathways including catechol meta ortho cleavage benzoate and salicylic acid degradation table s2 diverse aromatic degradation pathways usually involve the formation of substituted catechols as common intermediates kasuga et al 2007 therefore functional genes encoding key enzymes for catechol ortho or meta cleavage i e catechol 1 2 dioxygenase c12o or catechol 2 3 dioxygenase c23o are generally used as markers of the biodegradation of aromatic compounds the bc3 biofilm contained more c23o genes dmpb and cate than c12o genes cata although both genes got expressed in situ the expression of c23o genes was more active table 2 this suggests that biofilm bacteria might prefer the catechol meta cleavage pathway for degrading aromatic compounds in dwdss phosphorus availability is essential for bacterial growth in dwdss the total phosphorus concentrations in the tap water were around 15 μg l while the phosphate concentrations were below the phosphate threshold 10 μg l that stimulate microbial growth in drinking water table 1 miettinen et al 1996 the metatranscriptomic analysis showed active expression of genes phobrp senx3 and regx3 associated with phosphate starvation responses table 2 indicating that some biofilm microorganisms are under phosphate deficient conditions the genes coding for phosphate and phosphonate transport systems pstscab and phncde were actively expressed table 2 demonstrating that both organic and inorganic phosphorus can be utilized by biofilm bacteria this may be particularly relevant for dwds biofilms to resist phosphorus limited environments in addition the dwds biofilm exhibited high expression levels of the genes ppk ppk2 and ppx gppa coding for synthesis and hydrolysis of polyphosphate polyp which have been found to be more abundant in environments where available phosphate is limited temperton et al 2011 polyp was reported to be able to influence bacterial gene expression under stress conditions thereby modulating adaptive mechanisms to protect bacteria from environmental stress nelson et al 2008 seufferheld et al 2008 hence it is possible that polyp metabolism in the water meter biofilm is associated with microbial stress responses as for nitrogen metabolism the bc3 biofilm contained and expressed a full complement of genes coding for versatile nitrogen metabolism pathways including nitrogen fixation assimilatory dissimilatory nitrate reduction a dnr nitrification and denitrification tables 2 and s2 notably the presence of nitrogen fixing genes and the expression of nitrogenase genes nifdkh suggest the nitrogen fixation potential of the water meter biofilm in addition the active expression of nitrification genes is likely associated with the prevalence of nitrospira in the biofilm community fig 1 nitrospira can oxidize nitrite to nitrate and some members of which with the capability of performing complete nitrification comammox have been discovered recently van kessel et al 2015 3 3 mycobacterial composite genome to resolve the metabolic traits of the dominant populations within the water meter biofilm composite genomes were reconstructed binning based on the assembled fragments derived from the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequence data laczny et al 2015 taxonomic classification with amphora2 and rast assigned one reconstructed composite genome gg m to the genus mycobacterium fig s3 and table s3 further phylogenomic analysis showed that cg m shared high blastn similarity with the genomes of pathogenic m avium complex stains i e m avium m intracellulare and m colombiense fig 2 murcia et al 2006 based on the estimation with checkm and the method described by muller et al 2014 the genome completeness of cg m was 93 and 95 respectively table s1 notably except one all of the 179 checkm identified marker gene sequences had significant similarities ncbi blastp with homologous sequences from mycobacteria meanwhile the amphora2 analysis showed that 67 in 70 identified marker genes were assigned to the mycobacterium genus with high confidence scores 4 scores 0 84 63 scores 0 95 these indicate that the contamination level of the cg m bin is low at the genus level and support its mycobacterial identity however the repeated occurrence of single copy genes suggests that the cg m bin may be composed of genomes from different mycobacterium species because cg m represented the nearly complete genomic reconstruction and was associated with the potential pathogens of concern in dwdss a detailed analysis of cg m was conducted 3 3 1 mycobacterial carbon source utilization population cg m showed expression of a full complement of calvin cycle genes tables 2 and s3 suggesting mycobacterial capability of fixing co2 in the water meter biofilm the predicted rubisco gene sequences encoded by cg m showed high similarities ncbi blastn with the rubisco genes from mycobacterium spp reflecting their mycobacterial phylogeny fig 3 it has been found that many mycobacteria possess rubisco like genes and cloned rubisco genes from mycobacteria in escherichia coli can exhibit rubisco activity park et al 2003 2009 the capability of co2 fixation could be important for the survival of mycobacteria in the environment where exogenous organic substrates is limited such as dwdss notably some mycobacteria can even grow autotrophically with co as sole carbon and energy resource via the calvin cycle by oxidizing co to co2 via carbon monoxide dehydrogenase codh for energy supply park et al 2003 in this study population cg m also appeared to express codh genes coxsml table 2 suggesting that mycobacteria in dwdss may be able to grow with such an autotrophic pathway fig 4 in addition population cg m showed expression of the genes ppc pcka and pyc encoding anaplerotic carbon fixation enzymes table 2 including phosphoenolpyruvate pep carboxylase and carboxykinase ppc and pcka and pyruvate carboxylase pyc ppc and pyc catalyze the bicarbonate fixation on pep and pyruvate respectively to form oxaloacetate oaa while pcka attaches co2 to pep to form oaa in heterotrophic bacteria the anaplerotic process primarily feeds oaa into the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle however recent studies have indicated that anaplerotic co2 fixation is essential for the intracellular survival of m tuberculosis basu et al 2018 beste et al 2013 hence we suggest that the mycobacterium population represented by cg m may also be able to assimilate co2 though anaplerotic reactions in oligotrophic dwdss fig 4 as for aromatic biodegradation population cg m contained a full complement of genes coding for catechol meta cleavage dmpbcd and mhpdef rather than ortho cleavage and all of these genes got expressed table 2 a previous study found that humic and fulvic acids common aromatic components of nom can stimulate the growth of m avium kirschner et al 1999 based on our omics analysis catechol meta cleavage is likely the primary pathway for mycobacterial aromatic degradation in dwdss fig 4 3 3 2 mycobacterial metabolic versatility population cg m showed relatively active expression of phosphate transport genes pstscab whereas genes coding for the phosphonate transport system was incomplete tables 2 and s2 this indicates that mycobacteria in dwdss may prefer phosphate as the phosphorus source in addition population cg m appeared to express polyp metabolism genes ppk ppk2 and ppx gppa table 2 which could be associated with mycobacterial stress response boutte and crosson 2013 it is reported that elevated levels of polyp may increase mycobacterial persistence sureka et al 2007 population cg m appeared to express genes narghi and nirbd encoding nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase table 2 it is reported that m avium prefers to utilize nitrite or nitrate as a sole nitrogen source rather than amino acids and nitrite reductase activity is prevalent in m avium species mccarthy 1987 in addition given that narg or nirb mutants of m tuberculosis failed to grow on nitrate malm et al 2009 indicate that narghi and nirbd of m tuberculosis can mediate the assimilatory reduction of nitrate and nitrite respectively accordingly it is suggested that cg m coded narghi and nirbd may play a role in mycobacterial nitrate assimilation in dwdss as for mycobacterial sulfur metabolism only the genes associated with sulfate reduction were detected in cg m based on kegg analysis given the expression of a full complement of genes coding for assimilatory sulfate reduction and the presence of abundant sulfate in drinking water tables 1 and s2 sulfate should be the main sulfur source for mycobacteria in dwds biofilms 3 3 3 mycobacterial virulence factors because of the high phylogenomic relatedness to m avium complex fig 2 population cg m might represent an opportunistic pathogen to further evaluate its pathogenicity we compared the mycobacterial virulence factors vfs encoded by cg m and closely related m avium complex strains nc 002944 nc 016946 and nz cp020821 and m smegmatis nc 008596 fig 2 the m avium complex strains encoded identical vfs suggesting that they share similar virulence mechanisms in contrast cg m encoded more vfs table s4 than the relatives and shared more similar vf profiles with m avium complex 88 of total vfs shared than m smegmatis 78 of total vfs shared specifically except hbha and fade28 29 population cg m encoded all vfs in m avium complex as well as four different vfs ahpc ctac fbpa and tpx all of these virulence genes except tpx and senx3 showed expression table s4 these results indicate that population cg m might represent a member of ntm with pathogenicity soto giron et al 2016 and attention should be paid to its potential health risks in dwdss 4 conclusions the ability of mycobacteria to grow in nutrient poor conditions is vital for their persistence in dwdss here for the first time we provide an in situ resolution of the mycobacterial metabolic profiles in a water meter biofilm based on a coupled metagenomic metatranscriptomic analysis the resident mycobacteria showed aromatic degradation potential via catechol meta cleavage possibly linking to mycobacterial utilization of nom in drinking water most notably the biofilm mycobacteria exhibited metabolic potential to assimilate co2 through the calvin cycle and or anaplerotic reactions and even to grow autotrophically with co as the sole carbon and energy source hence availability of organic carbon does not appear to be a limiting factor for mycobacterial growth in dwdss in addition mycobacteria in water meter biofilms require more attention due to their potential implications for health according to our omics based analysis the active expression of co2 fixation genes highlights the metabolic potential for carbon self maintenance of the biofilm ecosystem co2 assimilation by autotrophs e g nitrospira and some heterotrophs e g mycobacteria as discussed above may supply available organic carbon for dwds biofilm communities thereby promoting the formation and development of dwds biofilms moreover the expression of nitrogenase genes nifdkh suggests the dinitrogen assimilation potential of the water meter biofilm microorganisms capable of fixing carbon or nitrogen could play an important role possibly as primary producers in the biofilm ecosystem in oligotrophic dwdss although organic carbon availability is generally considered the key factor controlling microbial regrowth in dwdss from a metabolic point of view our data suggest that it would be difficult to prevent the formation of dwds biofilms and mycobacterial growth by controlling the availability of organic carbon in drinking water alternatively the control of phosphorus availability may be a more effective strategy to reduce

19023,mycobacteria represent one of the most persistent bacterial populations in drinking water distribution system dwds biofilm communities however mycobacterial in situ metabolic profiles are largely unknown in this study the metabolic characteristics of mycobacteria in a household water meter biofilm were unveiled using a coupled metagenomic metatranscriptomic approach the water meter biofilm appeared to express nitrogenase genes nifdkh and a full complement of genes coding for several carbon fixation pathways especially the calvin cycle suggesting the co2 sequestration and dinitrogen fixation potential of the biofilm these findings indicate that it may be difficult to prevent the formation of dwds biofilms simply by controlling the availability of organic carbon or nitrogen the composite genome of mycobacteria cg m was reconstructed based on the obtained omics data cg m shared similar genome phylogeny and virulence factor profiles with mycobacterium avium complex suggesting that population cg m might represent a member of mycobacteria with pathogenicity according to the gene expression patterns population cg m showed the metabolic potential to assimilate co2 via the calvin cycle and or anaplerotic reactions and even to grow autotrophically with co as the sole carbon and energy source this suggests that organic carbon may not be a limiting factor for mycobacterial growth in dwdss moreover our results suggest that mycobacterial aromatic degradation is primarily achieved through the catechol meta cleavage pathway and biofilm mycobacteria could prefer phosphate as the phosphorus source graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water distribution system biofilm mycobacteria metabolic potential carbon fixation omics analysis 1 introduction to ensure the biological safety of drinking water an oligotrophic and disinfectant environment in drinking water distribution systems dwdss is usually maintained to prevent microbial regrowth despite these practices some microorganisms can still survive in dwdss and mainly grow as biofilms formed on pipe surfaces causing a series of problems such as the growth of pathogens generation of unpleasant tastes and odors consumption of residue disinfectants and internal corrosion of pipelines hammes et al 2008 accordingly substantial attention has been paid toward developing effective strategies for the prevention and removal of dwds biofilms to improve water quality therefore microbial features in dwds biofilms have been extensively studied using a variety of culture independent molecular techniques for in situ unveiling providing useful information regarding the microbial community structure in dwds biofilms and its environmental impact factors liu et al 2016 in particular the high throughput sequencing of phylogenetic marker genes e g small subunit ribosomal rna genes has yielded high resolution data to provide new insights into biofilm community structures gomez smith et al 2015 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2014 however scientific information on the metabolic potential of dwds biofilms especially those of specific biofilm bacteria such as potential pathogens remains rather scarce mycobacteria represent one of the most persistent bacterial populations in dwds biofilm communities rather than obligate mycobacterial pathogens in humans and animals e g mycobacterium tuberculosis m leprae and m ulcerans mycobacteria found in dwdss are usually those so called non tuberculous mycobacteria ntm or environmental mycobacteria em some of which are clinical relevant e g m avium complex m kansasii and m xenopi ashbolt 2015 murcia et al 2006 vaerewijck et al 2005 posing potential health risks to humans especially immunocompromised individuals falkinham 2009 2015 estimates based on hospital admissions showed that the rate of mycobacterial infection has been increasing by 8 10 annually in the united states falkinham 2015 according to the knowledge obtained dwdss are important sources of mycobacterial infections falkinham 2009 torvinen et al 2004 to realize the effective control of mycobacterial growth in dwdss it is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the survival mechanisms of mycobacteria in dwdss ntm can be divided into the fast and slow growing groups but the rapidly growing ntm still grow substantially slower i e 0 2 0 5 days per generation than many other bacteria falkinham 2009 however some of their traits permit their survival and reproduction in oligotrophic environments such as dwdss for example possibly due to the hydrophobic and complex cell wall mycobacteria are quite resistant to disinfectants and they can adhere and form biofilms on pipe surfaces so as to avoid being washed away notably with respect to nutrient utilization mycobacteria can survive in nutrient deficient environments even in sterile distilled water carson et al 1978 and some organic compounds generally found in water e g humic and fulvic acids can also stimulate mycobacterial growth kirschner et al 1999 nonetheless mycobacterial nutrient metabolism in dwdss especially the metabolic pathways for carbon source utilization is still unclear with regard to in situ metabolic function analyses metagenomics approaches can provide deep insights into the functional profiles of microbial communities in various environments while metatranscriptomics approaches can characterize the gene expression patterns of complex microbial assemblages recent advances in bioinformatics can further reveal the metabolic potentials of specific microorganisms normally the dominant members in communities by reconstructing their genomes from the omics data moreover a coupled metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assay which involves the simultaneous analysis of dna and rna sequence pools from the same community has shown great advantages in unraveling the metabolic functions and gene expression activities of a microbial community and particularly specific community members in situ hua et al 2015 muller et al 2014 however omics based analysis has rarely been applied to dwds biofilm communities which is possibly due to the limited access and high costs of sampling biofilms formed in water meters can be a good alternative to dwds biofilms because water meters are relatively easily obtained from households hong et al 2010 in this study we performed a coupled metagenomic metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbiota in a water meter biofilm and characterized metabolic profiles of mycobacteria in the biofilm based on the omics analysis we aim to reveal the metabolic pathways contributing to the survival of mycobacteria in oligotrophic dwds environments with disinfectant residues and to identify the factors limiting the proliferation of biofilm bacteria in dwdss 2 materials and methods 2 1 biofilm sample collection biofilm samples were collected from fifteen water meters located at five residential buildings b c j x bc in different downtown areas of beijing in october 2014 all water meters are made of cast iron similar to connecting pipes hence the biofilms formed within these water meters can be used as representatives of dwds biofilms the biofilms were scraped out from the inner surface of the water meters at the connection juncture with pipes using a sterile scraper and then immediately suspended in rnalater solution invitrogen carlsbad ca usa and placed into an icebox containing dry ice all biofilm samples were quickly transported to our laboratory and stored at 70 c until use 2 2 water quality analysis before demounting the water meters approximately 10 l of tap water samples were individually collected in sterilized brown glass bottles from the five residential buildings for water quality analysis water quality parameters including chemical oxygen demand cod free chlorine ammonia nitrate sulfate turbidity and total dissolved solid were measured with chinese national standard methods gb5750 85 the concentrations of total phosphorus and phosphate were analyzed using colorimetric malachite green phosphomolybdic heteropoly acid methods based on the water and wastewater monitoring and analysis methods the state environmental protection administration 2002 the detailed values of water quality parameters are summarized in table 1 2 3 nucleic acid extraction total genomic dna and rna in the biofilm samples was extracted using fastdna spin kits mp biomedicals santa ana ca usa and trizol reagents invitrogen carlsbad ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions respectively dna contamination in the rna preparation was checked by including a control in which the reverse transcriptase enzyme was not added to the polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification procedure mixture fig s1 the quality and quantity of total dna and rna were subsequently determined on a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer thermofisher scientific usa the obtained nucleic acids were stored at 70 c until use dna was easily recovered from each biofilm sample dna concentrations ranged from 16 to 32 ng μl whereas rna was successfully extracted only from the bc3 biofilm sample 18 ng μl therefore the bc3 biofilm was used to perform the coupled metagenomic metatranscriptomic analysis 2 4 bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing and analyses the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified using primers 338f and 806r gomez smith et al 2015 with barcodes incorporated into the 5 end of the forward primer after purification of the pcr products on a 2 0 w v agarose gel paired end sequencing was performed on an illumina miseq pe300 sequencer majorbio co ltd shanghai china according to standard protocols after filtering low quality miseq sequences with trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 taxonomic classification of valid sequencing data was performed using the rdp classifier with 16s rrna gene copy number adjustment wang et al 2007 2 5 metagenome and metatranscriptome sequencing and processing dna rna library preparation and illumina sequencing were performed at sinogenomax co ltd beijing china before rna library construction the rna sample were treated with dnase to remove possible dna contamination and then the rrna was removed from the total genomic rna using ribominus transcriptome isolation kits for bacteria thermofisher scientific usa subsequently the cdna library was constructed with a truseq stranded total rna sample preparation kit illumina usa following the manufacturer guidelines paired end sequencing was performed on an illumina hiseq 2500 platform massive parallel sequencing of dna and rna generated 17 8 gb and 34 gb raw metagenomic and metatranscriptomic reads respectively the raw data were then submitted to the mg rast webserver for assembly free analysis of the biofilm microbial community structure meyer et al 2008 2 5 1 assembly and binning raw paired end reads were initially trimmed for quality score q threshold of 15 and adaptor contamination using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 subsequently the rrna sequences were further filtered from the trimmed metatranscriptomic data set with sortmerna v2 0 kopylova et al 2012 the remaining reads were used as clean data for downstream analyses to reduce the complexity we first assembled the metagenomic reads with soapdenovo li et al 2010 the metatranscriptomic reads were then mapped against the assembled metagenomic fragments using burrows wheeler aligner bwa li and durbin 2009 non mapped reads were assembled separately with idba tran peng et al 2012 and then merged with the metagenomic assembly obtained assembled sequences longer than 1500 bp were grouped using vizbin software based on a reference free binning algorithm laczny et al 2014 2015 the binning method is based on nonlinear dimension reduction via barnes hut stochastic neighbor embedding of centered log ratio transformed oligonucleotide signatures extracted from assembled genomic sequence fragments followed by human augmented clustering into composite genomes cgs genome completeness of the cgs was estimated on the basis of 40 universal single copy genes as described previously muller et al 2014 taxonomies of the cgs were classified by amphora2 and the rast webserver aziz et al 2008 kerepesi et al 2015 wu and scott 2012 for the mycobacteria associated cg

biofilm bacteria might prefer the catechol meta cleavage pathway for degrading aromatic compounds in dwdss phosphorus availability is essential for bacterial growth in dwdss the total phosphorus concentrations in the tap water were around 15 μg l while the phosphate concentrations were below the phosphate threshold 10 μg l that stimulate microbial growth in drinking water table 1 miettinen et

under phosphate deficient conditions the genes coding for phosphate and phosphonate transport systems pstscab and phncde were actively expressed table 2 demonstrating that both organic and inorganic

dominant populations within the water meter biofilm composite genomes were reconstructed binning based on the assembled fragments derived from the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequence data laczny et al 2015 taxonomic classification with amphora2 and rast assigned one reconstructed composite genome gg m to the genus mycobacterium fig s3 and table s3 further phylogenomic analysis showed that cg m shared high blastn similarity with the genomes of pathogenic m avium complex stains i e m avium m intracellulare and m colombiense fig 2 murcia et al 2006 based on the estimation with checkm and the method described by muller et al 2014 the genome completeness of cg m was 93 and 95 respectively table s1 notably except one all of the 179 checkm identified marker gene sequences had significant similarities ncbi blastp with homologous sequences from mycobacteria meanwhile the amphora2 analysis showed that 67 in 70 identified marker genes were assigned to the mycobacterium genus with high confidence scores 4 scores 0 84 63 scores 0 95 these indicate that the contamination level of the cg m bin is low at the genus level and support its mycobacterial identity however the repeated occurrence of single copy genes suggests that the cg m bin may be composed of genomes from different mycobacterium species because cg m represented the nearly complete genomic reconstruction and was associated with the potential pathogens of concern in dwdss a detailed analysis of cg m was conducted 3 3 1 mycobacterial carbon source utilization population cg m showed expression of a full complement of calvin cycle genes tables 2 and s3 suggesting mycobacterial capability of fixing co2 in the water meter biofilm the predicted rubisco gene sequences encoded by cg m showed high similarities ncbi blastn with the rubisco genes from mycobacterium spp reflecting their mycobacterial phylogeny fig 3 it has been found that many mycobacteria possess rubisco like genes and cloned rubisco genes from mycobacteria in escherichia coli can exhibit rubisco activity park et al 2003 2009 the capability of co2 fixation could be important for the survival of mycobacteria in the environment where exogenous organic substrates is limited such as dwdss notably some mycobacteria can even grow autotrophically with co as sole carbon and energy resource via the calvin cycle by oxidizing co to co2 via carbon monoxide dehydrogenase codh for energy supply park et al 2003 in this study population cg m also appeared to express codh genes coxsml table 2 suggesting that mycobacteria in dwdss may be able to grow with such an autotrophic pathway fig 4 in addition population cg m showed expression of the genes ppc pcka and pyc encoding anaplerotic carbon fixation enzymes table 2 including phosphoenolpyruvate pep carboxylase and carboxykinase ppc and pcka and pyruvate carboxylase pyc ppc and pyc catalyze the bicarbonate fixation on pep and pyruvate respectively to form oxaloacetate oaa while pcka attaches co2 to pep to form oaa in heterotrophic bacteria the anaplerotic process primarily feeds oaa into the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle however recent studies have indicated that anaplerotic co2 fixation is essential for the intracellular survival of m tuberculosis basu et al 2018 beste et al 2013 hence we suggest that the mycobacterium population represented by cg m may also be able to assimilate co2 though anaplerotic reactions in oligotrophic dwdss fig 4 as for aromatic biodegradation population cg m contained a full complement of genes coding for catechol meta cleavage dmpbcd and mhpdef rather than ortho cleavage and all of these genes got expressed table 2 a previous study found that humic and fulvic acids common aromatic components of nom can stimulate the growth of m avium kirschner et al 1999 based on our omics analysis catechol meta cleavage is likely the primary pathway for mycobacterial aromatic degradation in dwdss fig 4 3 3 2 mycobacterial metabolic versatility population cg m showed relatively active expression of phosphate transport genes pstscab whereas genes coding for the phosphonate transport system was incomplete tables 2 and s2 this indicates that mycobacteria in dwdss may prefer phosphate as the phosphorus source in addition population cg m appeared to express polyp metabolism genes ppk ppk2 and ppx gppa table 2 which could be associated with mycobacterial stress response boutte and crosson 2013 it is reported that elevated levels of polyp may increase mycobacterial persistence sureka et al 2007 population cg m appeared to express genes narghi and nirbd encoding nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase table 2 it is reported that m avium prefers to utilize nitrite or nitrate as a sole nitrogen source rather than amino acids and nitrite reductase activity is prevalent in m avium species mccarthy 1987 in addition given that narg or nirb mutants of m tuberculosis failed to grow on nitrate malm et al 2009 indicate that narghi and nirbd of m tuberculosis can mediate the assimilatory reduction of nitrate and nitrite respectively accordingly it is suggested that cg m coded narghi and nirbd may play a role in mycobacterial nitrate assimilation in dwdss as for mycobacterial sulfur metabolism only the genes associated with sulfate reduction were detected in cg m based on kegg analysis given the expression of a full complement of genes coding for assimilatory sulfate reduction and the presence of abundant sulfate in drinking water tables 1 and s2 sulfate should be the main sulfur source for mycobacteria in dwds biofilms 3 3 3 mycobacterial virulence factors because of the high phylogenomic relatedness to m avium complex fig 2 population cg m might represent an opportunistic pathogen to further evaluate its pathogenicity we compared the mycobacterial virulence factors vfs encoded by cg m and closely related m avium complex strains nc 002944 nc 016946 and nz cp020821 and m smegmatis nc 008596 fig 2 the m avium complex strains encoded identical vfs suggesting that they share similar virulence mechanisms in contrast cg m encoded more vfs table s4 than the relatives and shared more similar vf profiles with m avium complex 88 of total vfs shared than m smegmatis 78 of total vfs shared specifically except hbha and fade28 29 population cg m encoded all vfs in m avium complex as well as four different vfs ahpc ctac fbpa and tpx all of these virulence genes except tpx and senx3 showed expression table s4 these results indicate that population cg m might represent a member of ntm with pathogenicity soto giron et al 2016 and attention should be paid to its potential health risks in dwdss 4 conclusions the ability of mycobacteria to grow in nutrient poor conditions is vital for their persistence in dwdss here for the first time we provide an in situ resolution of the mycobacterial metabolic profiles in a water meter biofilm based on a coupled metagenomic metatranscriptomic analysis the resident mycobacteria showed aromatic degradation potential via catechol meta cleavage possibly linking to mycobacterial utilization of nom in drinking water most notably the biofilm mycobacteria exhibited metabolic potential to assimilate co2 through the calvin cycle and or anaplerotic reactions and even to grow autotrophically with co as the sole carbon and energy source hence availability of organic carbon does not appear to be a limiting factor for mycobacterial growth in dwdss in addition mycobacteria in water meter biofilms require more attention due to their potential implications for health according to our omics based analysis the active expression of co2 fixation genes highlights the metabolic potential for carbon self maintenance of the biofilm ecosystem co2 assimilation by autotrophs e g nitrospira and some heterotrophs e g mycobacteria as discussed above may supply available organic carbon for dwds biofilm communities thereby promoting the formation and development of dwds biofilms moreover the expression of nitrogenase genes nifdkh suggests the dinitrogen assimilation potential of the water meter biofilm microorganisms capable of fixing carbon or nitrogen could play an important role possibly as primary producers in the biofilm ecosystem in oligotrophic dwdss although organic carbon availability is generally considered the key factor controlling microbial regrowth in dwdss from a metabolic point of view our data suggest that it would be difficult to prevent the formation of dwds biofilms and mycobacterial growth by controlling the availability of organic carbon in drinking water alternatively the control of phosphorus availability may be a more effective strategy to reduce

19024,the aim of this study was to develop and test a non diffusion limited high cell density bioreactor for biodegradation of various phenol derivatives the bioreactor was obtained using a straightforward one step preparation method using cryostructuration and direct cross linking of bacteria into a 3d structured sponge like macroporous cryogel composite material consisting of 11 6 by mass cells and 1 2 1 7 polymer with approximately 87 water in the material pores the macroporous cryogel composite material composed of live bacteria has pore sizes in the range of 20 150 μm confirmed by sem and laser scanning confocal microscopy the enzymatic activity of bacteria within the cryogel structure and the effect of freezing on the viability of the cross linked cells was estimated by mtt assay cryogels based on pseudomonas mendocina rhodococcus koreensis and acinetobacter radioresistens were exploited for the effective bioremediation of phenol and m cresol and to a lesser extent 2 chlorophenol and 4 chlorophenol utilising these phenolic contaminants in water as their only source of carbon for evaluation of treatment scalability the bioreactors were prepared in plastic kaldnes carriers to improve their mechanical properties and allow application in batch or fluidised bed water treatment modes graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacteria immobilisation bioremediation phenol cresol chlorophenols 1 introduction bioremediation of contaminated water and soil is an effective approach for the removal of xenobiotics and other contaminants from the environment it utilises the ability of microorganisms to degrade or reduce the toxicity or mobility of specific target compounds and is considered one of the more efficient cost effective and eco friendly remediation methods an extensive body of research has focused on utilising this method for a wide range of contaminants including pesticides heavy metals and aromatic hydrocarbons for water treatment applications the use of bacteria immobilised on a substrate has numerous advantages over the use of bacterial suspensions such as higher biomass density high metabolic activity and higher resistance to toxic chemicals allowing continuous operation processes villegas et al 2016 chen et al 2007 börner et al 2014 zaushitsyna et al 2014 gonzalez et al 2001 several bacterial immobilisation methods have been developed and various synthetic and natural carriers are known anku et al 2017 dzionek et al 2016 chiellini et al 1999 the degree of bacterial immobilisation depends on the structure pore size and surface area of the support as well as the nature of the material i e its hydrophobi city charge etc and environmental conditions such as ph and temperature hailei et al 2016 cortez et al 2017 adsorption to the substrate or biofilm formation is often a long process however and represents the main cost and one of the major limitations of bioremediation using immobilised bacteria immobilisation methods via encapsulation of cells inside a polymer matrix e g polyvinylalcohol pva carrageenan and agar gel can produce relatively high cell densities cortez et al 2017 el naas et al 2009 sinha et al 2011 however such materials tend to have diffusion limitations due to the use of high concentrations of polymer 6 10 which coats the cells and restricts their interaction with contaminated water polyethylenimine pei derivatives are a popular immobilising agent which have restricted application for bacterial immobilisation due to high toxicity issues virgen ortíz et al 2017 milović et al 2005 in this study we suggest a novel approach to the design of immobilised bacteria based bioreactors for water treatment applications to overcome existing limitations a minimum concentration of polymers

groups pva al briefly 0 6 ml of ga 50 v v was added to a 2 acidified pva solution in distilled water note that the pva modification is inefficient at neutral conditions the reaction was terminated by ph adjustment to ph 6 7 5 unreacted ga was removed by dialysis utilising a dialysis bag cut off 12 kda against water polyethyleneimine pei was modified in similar manner by adding 8 8 ml of ga 20 v v to 2 polymer solution in water the ph was adjusted to 7 prior to ga addition to avoid aldol condensation of aldehyde under alkaline conditions and therefore to achieve a more consistent chemical composition of the polymer the reaction mixture was incubated under stirring for 2h at room temperature the ph adjusted to seven and then the mixture was dialysed against water a dialysis bag cut off 1 kda the obtained polymer solution was filtered through a 0 45μm membrane and stored at 4 c until subsequent use the concentration of the polymer in the solution was estimated by using a freeze

cell density of 2 085 mg ml kim et al 2012 the wet weight of the pelleted cells was calculated accordingly for calculation of the bacterial cell density of rho and acn the following ratio was applied an od600 of one resulted in a cell wet weight of 1 7 g l and 0 39 g l of dry weight respectively glazyrina et al 2010 the pelleted cells wet mass of 0 29g were mixed gently with 2 5 ml of cross linker

using the same method as detailed above incorporation of the cbrs into plastic carriers improves their mechanical stability and decreases the possibility of mechanical damage under intensive mixing or

assessed using a mtt assay hao et al 2002 following standard methods 2 4 3d macroporous bioreactor characterisation the elastic moduli of the cryogel bacteria reactors cbrs were studied using a ta xt2 instrument stable micro systems godalming surrey uk the compression test was performed at room temperature the cryogels were prepared with a diameter of 8 mm and height of 9 mm samples were compressed up to a deformation level of 50 at a speed of 0 05 mm s the elastic modulus was calculated at a deformation of 5 using the equation e f s δh h where e is the elastic modulus pa f is the force applied n s is the cross sectional area of the sample m2 δh is the height m at compression and h is the original height m kirsebom et al 2013 three samples were used for each type of composite cryogel scanning electronic microscopy sem images were obtained using a zeiss sigma field emission gun sem zeiss nts slices of cbrs with thickness of 1 2 mm were washed with pbs and then samples were fixed in 5 v v ga in pbs overnight following by washing with pbs and water then slices were frozen at 20 c overnight and freeze dried in a christ alpha 2 4 freeze dryer for 24 h finally freeze dried samples were coated with a layer of platinum using a quorum q150tes coater confocal laser scan microscopy clsm images were obtained using a leica tcs sp5 using objective lens x10 x20 x40 and x63 cbrs were fixed in 5 v v ga in pbs buffer overnight and then cut into slices with a thickness of 1 mm samples were washed with distilled water to remove non crosslinked bacteria and stained with rhodamine b solution overnight unbound rhodamine b was washed out with water another batch of cbrs was stained with fitc solution 0 02 mg ml in sodium phosphate buffer ph 9 0 overnight non reacted fitc was washed out with water the 488 and 530 nm excitation and emission wavelengths were applied images were produced by optical sectioning in the xy planes along the z axis with 30 70 optical sections with 1 μm intervals evaluation of the viability of crosslinked bacteria within the cryogel was performed using standard live dead assay cryogels were cut into thin slices with a thickness of 1 mm and washed out with nacl 0 9 solution to remove uncross linked cells samples were stained using live dead bac light kit containing syto 9 stain at wavelength 480 500 nm and propidium iodide at wavelength 490 635 nm for 15 min at room temperature under dark conditions according to the protocol of the live dead bacterial viability kit of staining 2 5 bioremediation by suspensions of bacteria and cbrs the degradation of phenol m cresol and 2 chlorophenol 2 cp or 4 chlorophenol 4 cp by a suspension of non crosslinked bacteria and by various cbrs was studied in the case of bioremediation by a bacterial suspension planktonic state the same amount of bacteria measured based on od600 as applied in the cryogel preparation was used forty ml of phenol derivative were added to the pellet of bacteria in a sterile 50 ml plastic falcon tube the tube was regularly opened for sampling 207 μl at each time point under sterile conditions note that the tube contained approximately 10 ml of air the tubes were shaken at 150 rpm at 30 c in the dark dynamic mode the number of bacteria in the solution during the bioremediation process was monitored by measurement of od600 at each sampling point cbrs were placed in 40 ml of phenol derivative phenol m cresol 2 cp and 4 cp in minimum salt media msm buffer at ph 7 0 in a static mode without additional shaking at 30 c control sterile solutions phenol m cresol 2 cp and 4 cp in msm were prepared under the same conditions and tested to estimate stability against degradation over time in a static mode nonspecific adsorption of 4 cp on the pei al pva al and pva al control cryogels without bacteria see section 2 3 was evaluated in msm at 30 c in dymanic mode due to observable biofilm formation in the glass bottle during the bioremediation process each cycle was performed in a new set of sterile bottles to eliminate the effect of biofilm formation on the following bioremediation cycles the efficiency of the bioreactors was calculated as previously discussed börner et al 2014 based on the change of contaminant concentration at a given time point 48 and 220h divided by the experimental duration i e the number of hours of bioreactor or bacteria exposure to the target contaminant mg l h according to the equation efficiency c0 ct t where c0 is initial concentration ct concentration at a time point the error was calculated according to the standard equation error stdev a1 ai count a1 ai where stdev is standard deviation count a1 ai number of replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 cryobacteria reactor cbr preparation and characterisation in our recent work we used combinations of polymers ga 0 385 ga pva 0 385 0 77 pva al pei al 0 385 0 46 pva al pei al 0 77 0 19 keeping the concentration of bacteria at 23 by mass for preparation of cryogels al jwaid et al 2018 here to select the best performing bioremediation system cryobacteria reactors based on three bacterial strains and six immobilising polymers and their combinations were screened pva and pei modified with aldehyde groups were used as cross linkers the presence of aldehyde group in the modified polymers was confirmed by ftir and 1h nmr spectroscopy figs s2 a c as expected the zeta potentials of the pva and pva al were close to zero illustrating the electroneutrality of the cross linking agent whereas pei al showed a zeta potential of 32 4 mv indicating that the cross linker is positively charged fig s3 and therefore can additionally interact with cell membranes via electrostatic interactions additionally cryogels with chitosan and gellan gum were prepared to analyse the bacteria immobilisation as result of electrostatic interaction between the cell membrane and these polymers in previous work bacteria capable of the bioremediation of phenol were immobilised on cryogel surfaces in three steps overall the cryogel preparation and the following biofilm formation was completed in 10 days and required the use of additional equipment such as uv lamps 400 w satchanska et al 2015 the subsequent bioreactor contained a large amount of bulk polymer leading to issues of disposal after its use and this technique therefore is less practical for industrial application here suspensions of p mendocina pse r koreensis rho and a radioresistens acn 11 6 w w were cross linked by a combination of pei al pva al 0 6 0 6 w w prepared in pb in a one step cryostructuration process when the suspension of cells and cross linker freezes under semi frozen conditions 12 c ice crystals form which leads to phase separation of the cells and the cross linker suspension and ice fig 1 the growing ice crystals expel all solutes and bacteria into a non frozen liquid microphase which remains non frozen even at 12 c kirsebom et al 2013 the bacteria and cross linker therefore concentrate in the thin non frozen liquid microphase and the bacteria become densely packed and cross linked by functional polymers interacting with their cell membranes thawing of samples results in the melting of the ice crystals producing water filled voids pores this results in a 3d structured macroporous material formed in a one step preparation method with the pore walls composed mostly of bacterial cells tightly attached to each other surrounding a well developed system of interconnected large pores with size 20 150 μm fig 2 the obtained cryogels were self supporting mechanically stable fig s4 and withstand processing in a static and a dynamic mode i e shaking at 150 rpm for at least 4 weeks fig s5 a d rapid aggregation of cells was observed upon addition of glutaraldehyde the cryo acn pva al has no obvious cells in the cryogel wall due to use of a relatively high concentration of cross linking agent 1 7 fig 2i a c it was observed that the change of composition of the buffer did not change the morphology of the material significantly fig 2ii nevertheless the use of pb or pb glucose has advantages compared to cryogels prepared in pure water as these decrease the osmotic stress during cryogel preparation and keep the ph constant to visualise the efficiency of mixing of the bacteria with the polymer as well as to assess the distribution and amount of live cells cbrs were stained with live dead stains the hydrogel based on gellan was characterised by the absence of large pores in the structure of the composite hydrogels and a homogeneous distribution of cells within the material fig 3 e h a strong fluorescence background due to electrostatic binding of the positively charged dyes with the negatively charged polymer can be observed under clsm nevertheless at magnification x100 the images clearly distinguish between cells and background fig 3h the material has a predominantly microporous structure however and therefore can be used only in batch application in a dynamic mode fig 3e h we focused on preparation and assessment of the bioremediation activity of macroporous materials which potentially could be used additionally in a flow through mode some of the key beneficial properties of cryogels relate to their elastic strength flexibility and shape recovery in our recent study we comprehensively investigated the rheological properties of cryogels based on bacteria al jwaid et al 2018 however the elastic modulus was not measured the elastic modulus of the cryogels acn pva al 1 0 and acn pva al pei al 1 0 0 25 was 3 52 0 7 and 4 64 0 1 kpa respectively these values were similar to those previously reported for cryogels made of e coli and activated polyethylenimine which had an elastic modulus of 3 1 0 39 kpa zaushitsyna et al 2014 or porous material c saccharolyticus cross linked by glutaraldehyde which showed a modulus in the range 8 29 kpa kirsebom et al 2009 our data were also comparable with the elastic modulus of cryogels based on polymers such as enzymatically cross linked casein 1 3 7 kpa and gelatin 0 95 1 9 kpa kirsebom et al 2013 or combinations of polymeric cross linking agent aldehyde dextran and gelatin 0 6 2 8 kpa respectively berillo and volkova 2014 cryo rho pva al pei al gel 11 6 0 5 0 6 0 3 cryo rho pva al gel 11 6 1 0 0 3 prepared in water and cryo rho pva al gel 11 6 1 0 0 3 formed in phosphate buffer had elastic moduli of 16 1 1 7 87 7 16 3 28 7 17 0 kpa respectively as expected an increase of chi concentration from 0 5 to 1 0 at constant polymer cross linking mass ratio 2 1 led to a significant increase in the toughness of the material fig s4 cryogels based on rho 11 6 in combination with polymers chi ga 0 5 0 25 and chi ga 1 0 0 5 pei ga1 0 0 25 and 1 0 0 5 pei pva ga 1 0 1 0 0 25 showed an elastic modulus of 34 7 15 5 1955 268 12 4 8 10 8 0 9 7 2 1 5 kpa respectively as expected the highest elasticity modulus was found for samples based on chi which is related to the rigid structure of this polysaccharide the incorporation of gel to the structure significantly improves the mechanical properties of the material due to formation of a physical gel in fig s4 an illustrated comparison of the elastic properties of composite cryogels based on rhodococcus sp is given the analysis of live and dead bacteria using live dead kit indicates that most of the bacteria after cross linking were viable stained green fig 3e h even after undergoing freeze thawing conditions during the cryogelation process potentially cryogenic conditions particularly ice crystal formation as well as the cross linker and the osmotic stress itself could damage the bacterial cells and reduce viable cell numbers to distinguish the potential harmful effects of the polymer cross linker from those caused by cryogenic conditions the experiments were performed at 4 c 12 c respectively incubation of rho suspension in the solution of pbs containing 0 25 or 0 5 of ga negative control at 4 c for 24 h led to a significant decrease in the number of live bacteria to 27 and 22 of initial numbers respectively due to the toxicity of ga the use of pei al 0 365 w v in pbs resulted in a 25 of live acn bacteria pei al was more toxic compared to unmodified pei where 50 of bacteria survived pva al 1 2 in pbs buffer at 4 c revealed a high survival of acn 92 4 compared to a bacterial suspension stored in phosphate buffer without polymer 100 positive control table s1 the issue of the relatively high toxicity of pei al was overcome by the use of a combination of nontoxic pva al with pei al leading to 72 5 active bacteria the use of only pva al led to formation of a material with low water permeability while using a combination of pva al pei al 1 1 resulted in formation of a material with desirable porosity characteristics and mechanical properties a small amount of glucose which acted as a cryoprotector and potentially as a source of carbon was added to the bacterial suspension to decrease the effect of cell bacteria damage due to ice crystal formation and osmotic shock moslemy et al 2002 pva al 1 2 dissolved in pbs buffer in the presence of 2 glucose showed some growth of the acn bacteria at 4 c 109 after 24h table s1 the frozen suspension of acn in pva al 1 2 and pbs buffer with 2 glucose added showed 88 6 survival from the initial number of cells thus a decrease of 11 4 in live bacteria was related to bacterial damage by growing ice crystals the effect of 1 0 glucose in pbs buffer on bacterial viability was also investigated table s1 the incubation of pse suspension in pbs buffer containing 1 0 glucose over 24 h at 4 c led to a 13 8 decrease in cell populations compared to the pbs buffer the presence of glucose did not significantly improve the viability of pse during the cryogelation process either table s1 it can be concluded that addition of glucose in combination with pva al pei al 1 1 did not significantly improve the survival of the bacteria or even had some negative effect on pse but conversely it had a positive effect on acn during incubation for 24 h at 4 c it can also be concluded that the 23 pse bacteria population decrease observed after incubation at 4 c for 24h was due to cumulative toxicity from the pva al pei al polymers while the 53 loss of bacteria after cryogelation was presumably due to damage of the bacteria by growing ice crystals during the cryo structuration process table s1 3 2 bioremediation of phenol and cresols recently we illustrated the bioremediation efficiency of cryogels based on pse rho and a pse rho mixture for 50 ppm phenol in carbonate buffer in a dynamic mode al jwaid et al 2018 in this study phenol and m cresol bioremediation by cryo rho cryo pse and cryo acn cryogels was examined in dynamic and static mode in msm buffer 50 ppm 40 ml and compared with bacterial suspensions fig s5 d and s6 suspensions of bacteria of pse or acn degraded 50 ppm 40 ml of phenol in 7 days 166h whereas rho completed the degradation in 9 days 220h fig s5 d increasing the phenol concentration to 100 ppm resulted in 39 5 phenol degradation by a suspension of acn over 220h bioremediation efficiency 0 123 mg l h rho formed a biofilm on the glass surface in the solution of phenol 100 ppm 200 ml and did not degrade phenol over 12 days of incubation data not shown cbr pse cbr acn and cbr rho were more efficient for phenol degradation compared to a suspension of equivalent bacteria table 1 bacterial suspensions of pse or acn degraded 50 ppm 40 ml phenol in 166h whereas rho completed the degradation in 220h fig s5 c cryogel pse gel 0 5 showed slow bioremediation of m cresol 300 ppm with 21 degraded over 17 days in a static mode the presence of polysaccharide gel in the structure of the cryogel decreased the bioremediation efficiency of the material which might be related to its consumption as a source of carbon a cryogel composed of a combination of rho 0 13 of pva al and 0 5 gel was not as effective for phenol bioremediation as cryo rho pva al gel 1 0 0 3 fig 4 a other polymer compositions were used for cryogels preparation based on pei pva ga 1 1 0 25 pei pva ga 0 6 0 5 0 25 chi ga 1 0 25 fig 4b which revealed complete bioremediation of m cresol 50 ppm in 116 and 225h respectively the suspension of bacteria acn produced only 10 degradation of m cresol 50 ppm 200 ml a static mode within 12 days there was no significant difference in m cresol biodegradation by pse and rho the suspension of rho degraded only 11 of m cresol 50 ppm 200 ml after 12 days data not shown the first bioremediation cycle of m cresol 50 ppm 200 ml by cbr acn 9 106 cfu was completed within 5 days the addition of fresh phenol solution 100 ppm 200 ml to the cbr acn instead of m cresol resulted in only 50 consumption of phenol within 8 days indicating that the same batch of cbr acn might be utilised for bioremediation of mixed or complex mixtures but with similar by structure contaminants i e it can be acclimatised to a new contaminant however it took a longer time compared to the model system fig 4c the bioremediation of the m cresol was slower over the first 90h of testing for the three bacteria cryogels of cryo rho pei pva ga cryo rho pei pva ga and cryo rho chi ga due to bacterial acclimatisation prior to m cresol consumption fig 4b bioremediation with cbr rho and cbr pse consumed 71 of m cresol 40 ml 50 ppm after 10 days fig 4c the bioremediation using cbr rho at higher m cresol concentrations 40 ml 100 ppm indicated only a 30 decrease in m cresol concentration data is not shown cbr acn revealed better ability to degrade m cresol compared to cbr rho and cbr pse the 1st 2nd and 3rd bioremediation cycles of m cresol 50 ppm by cbr acn were completed within 265 90 and 46h respectively regardless of which bacterial strains were used pse rho and acn the cbr had an adaptation period to phenol and m cresol of 48h and 90h respectively cbr acn showed the best degradation efficiency for m cresol among the studied bacterial strains following this the bioremediation process was scaled up in a static mode and the volume of the solution was increased to 200 ml revealing a significant decrease of concentration within 100 120h for the studied bacterial strains fig 5 the biodegradation of phenol by cbr pse cbr rho and cbr acn was studied with addition of a fresh portion of phenol after each bioremediation cycle cbr pse and cbr acn consumed 60 ppm of phenol within 200h whereas cbr rho completed the bioremediation in approximately 100h for the first cycle it is important to note that cbr pse cbr rho and cbr acn revealed similar phenol degradation activity for following 2 10 cycles which were complited within approximately 60 65h fig s6 a c to the best of our knowledge there is still no information about the efficiency of rho to degrade phenol cresols and chlorophenols pseudomonas spp has been previously used for bioremediation of benzene and toluene into phenol and cresol tao et al 2004 2005 calculation of degradation efficiency showed that cbr pse caused a more rapid bioremediation of phenol compared to cbr rho or cbr acn fig 5 and table 1 cbr rho needed an acclimatisation period of approximately 48h before the bacteria became active for bioremediation cbr pse cbr acn and cbr rho were more efficient for phenol degradation compared to a suspension of equivalent bacteria table 1 and phenol bioremediation efficiencies were 0 6 0 363 and 0 0915 mg l h 48h respectively fig 5 it can be concluded that the selected strains pse rho and acn preferably degrade phenol while the biodegradation of m cresol took place at least 3 times more slowly fig 4c overall the cbrs show resistance to high concentrations of phenol derivatives and significantly faster bioremediation fig 5 fig s5 a c compared to equivalent suspensions of bacteria in a static mode fig s5 d moreover the recovery of the bioreactors is straightforward and does not require centrifugation to separate suspensions of bacteria from the aqueous solution making the whole bioremediation process considerably simpler to apply the same cbr pse cbr rho cbr acn biorectors were used over 10 bioremediation cycles without showing any decline in activity over more than one month of exploitation demonstrating the ability for reuse of the material over repeat cycles fig s5 a c as noted above suspensions of bacteria cannot be used instantly for bioremediation of high phenol concentrations 60 ppm an increase in phenol concentration resulted in prolongation of the bioremediation process required for its complete degradation fig 5a c there was no delay of bioremediation at high concentrations of contaminant for the 2nd and following bioremediation cycles mtt assay after 17 days of the bioremediation process showed for cbr pse a significant increase in bacterial numbers compared to initial numbers table 2 indicating their existence in an exponential growth phase in contrast cbr acn and cbr rho showed a decrease in bacterial numbers following treatment table 2 indicating that these bacteria had entered a senescence phase based on fig 5 one can assume that 300 ppm is not the limit for the bioremediation process however there are few examples where such high concentrations would be encountered in a real case scenario therefore higher phenol concentrations were not tested further usually the concentration of phenols in waste water is quite low and adaptation of the cbr is unnecessary but in cases where faster bioremediation of high concentrations of phenols 200 300 ppm is required cbrs may be pre adapted to phenol at concentrations of 25 50 ppm analysis of treated water via hplc confirmed the absence of phenol or release of its derivatives such as p hydroxybenzoic acid hydroquinone catechol and protocatechuate tao et al 2005 martínková et al 2009 a few peaks with retention times in the range of 1 2 min were observed which most probably relate to the peak of the solvent or to the final degradation products of phenol possibly tri carbonic acids the biodegradation of p cresol performed using suspensions of pse and rho revealed a trace amount of p cresol and some trace amounts of its derivatives were detected after 2 weeks of bioremediation by suspensions of bacteria pse rho and the corresponding cryobacteria reactors the bioremediation results for p cresol and m cresol were comparable indirect evidence of the release of tri carbonic acids was given by a ph shift from 7 1 to 6 5 6 4 which is in agreement with previously described pathways of degradation of phenols and cresols kolomytseva et al 2007 3 3 biodegradation of chlorophenols chlorophenols cps are relatively stable products of the biodegradation of triclosan and triclocarban which are widely used as antimicrobial agents in toothpaste soaps and detergents and are present in most waste waters dhillon et al 2015 therefore the efficiency of the developed cryo rho cryo pse cryo acn reactors for degrading various cps was examined the viability of bacteria via monitoring of turbidity as well as their biodegradation efficiency for 4cp and 2cp in carbonate buffer and minimum salt media msm at ph 7 2 was estimated figs s7 and s9 data indicated that bioremediation efficiency for suspensions of acn rho and pse were negligible 40 ml 50 ppm 4cp in carbonate buffer at 48 and 120 h respectively bioremediation efficiencies for suspension of the rho and pse in msm were 0 044 0 019 mg l h and 0 032 0 025 mg l h 40 ml 50 ppm 4cp at 48 and 220h respectively fig s8 from the cryobacteria reactors tested only cryo pse pva al or pva al pei al showed consistent ability to degrade 4cp fig 6 and table 1 although cryo rho showed some degradative the 4cp degradation efficiency was much lower compared to bioremediation efficiencies for phenol or m cresol using the same bacterial strains biodegradation of 2cp 60 ppm resulted in only a 9 decrease after 6 6 days table s2 control cryogels of pei al pva al and pva al without bacteria did not reveal adsorption of phenols or cps or self decomposition of the contaminant within 1000h of incubation in the 4 cp 50 ppm solution 40 ml one can observe that gel based cryogels cross linked by magnesium ions were less efficient in the bioremediation process compared to sodium cross linked physical gel which may be related to some diffusion restriction as gel forms a hydrogel such faster estimation of the final concentration of 4cp was performed using hplc illustrating that suspensions of bacteria pse and rho and cryo pse and cryo rho can slowly degrade 4cp table s2 fig 6 it was observed that rho immobilized within the cryogel structure is capable of degrading chlorophenol without additional sources of carbon these data indicate that cryo pse and cryo rho bioreactors while less effective for 4cp and 2cp warrant further study in their application for treatment of waste water from hospitals which has high concentrations of recalcitrant chlorophenols and their metabolites which require removal 4 conclusion 3d structured bioreactors based on live bacteria suitable for the bioremediation of a range of phenol derivatives phenol cresols chlorophenols were prepared by cryogelation in a one step process using water as a solvent the macroporous material consisted of 11 6 live bacteria 1 2 polymers and 87 voids pores for the first time toxicity levels of novel aldehyde containing polymers cross linking agents pei al and pva al were estimated and their suitable combination proposed the cryobacteria reactors maintain their degradation activity over at least 10 cycles the efficiencies of cryobacteria reactors of pse rho and acn for degradation of four concentrations of phenol derivatives revealed complete rapid bioremediation in dynamic as well as static mode moreover the developed material exhibited significantly better performance for phenol degradation than recently reported by our group where the bioremediation of 50 ppm of phenol 40 ml in a dynamic mode was studied al jwaid et al 2018 bioremediation cycles 2nd 10th cycle were completed within 2 6 days compared to about 10 days for equivalent cell suspensions the purification of 200 ml of 300 ppm of phenol by pse rho and acn within cryobacteria reactors took approximately 7 days the use of plastic carriers showed slightly slower bioremediation of cresols compared to conventional cryobacteria reactors overall six polymers and their combinations were utilised to produce materials for bioremediation purposes using three bacterial strains the activities of which were tested using four model phenol derivatives the developed technology preserves the native structure and activity of the bacteria cryobacteria reactors have several advantages cryogels based on live bacteria can be easily reprocessed after inactivation due to low content of a polymeric cross linker 10 in the structure and therefore the technology can be considered as green there is no diffusion restriction as materials are macroporous with well developed connected micro channels that improve interaction of the cells with contaminated water the macroporous structure of interconnected pores also creates the possibility of exploiting the bioreactor as a flow through column or filter system with no requirement to separate the bacteria after the bioremediation process the technique is faster and simpler than a previously published three step cryogel surface immobilisation techniques for phenol degrading bacteria which also contain a large bulk content of polymer resulting in more complex processing after use acknowledgements this project received funding from the marie skłodowska curie

19024,the aim of this study was to develop and test a non diffusion limited high cell density bioreactor for biodegradation of various phenol derivatives the bioreactor was obtained using a straightforward one step preparation method using cryostructuration and direct cross linking of bacteria into a 3d structured sponge like macroporous cryogel composite material consisting of 11 6 by mass cells and 1 2 1 7 polymer with approximately 87 water in the material pores the macroporous cryogel composite material composed of live bacteria has pore sizes in the range of 20 150 μm confirmed by sem and laser scanning confocal microscopy the enzymatic activity of bacteria within the cryogel structure and the effect of freezing on the viability of the cross linked cells was estimated by mtt assay cryogels based on pseudomonas mendocina rhodococcus koreensis and acinetobacter radioresistens were exploited for the effective bioremediation of phenol and m cresol and to a lesser extent 2 chlorophenol and 4 chlorophenol utilising these phenolic contaminants in water as their only source of carbon for evaluation of treatment scalability the bioreactors were prepared in plastic kaldnes carriers to improve their mechanical properties and allow application in batch or fluidised bed water treatment modes graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacteria immobilisation bioremediation phenol cresol chlorophenols 1 introduction bioremediation of contaminated water and soil is an effective approach for the removal of xenobiotics and other contaminants from the environment it utilises the ability of microorganisms to degrade or reduce the toxicity or mobility of specific target compounds and is considered one of the more efficient cost effective and eco friendly remediation methods an extensive body of research has focused on utilising this method for a wide range of contaminants including pesticides heavy metals and aromatic hydrocarbons for water treatment applications the use of bacteria immobilised on a substrate has numerous advantages over the use of bacterial suspensions such as higher biomass density high metabolic activity and higher resistance to toxic chemicals allowing continuous operation processes villegas et al 2016 chen et al 2007 börner et al 2014 zaushitsyna et al 2014 gonzalez et al 2001 several bacterial immobilisation methods have been developed and various synthetic and natural carriers are known anku et al 2017 dzionek et al 2016 chiellini et al 1999 the degree of bacterial immobilisation depends on the structure pore size and surface area of the support as well as the nature of the material i e its hydrophobi city charge etc and environmental conditions such as ph and temperature hailei et al 2016 cortez et al 2017 adsorption to the substrate or biofilm formation is often a long process however and represents the main cost and one of the major limitations of bioremediation using immobilised bacteria immobilisation methods via encapsulation of cells inside a polymer matrix e g polyvinylalcohol pva carrageenan and agar gel can produce relatively high cell densities cortez et al 2017 el naas et al 2009 sinha et al 2011 however such materials tend to have diffusion limitations due to the use of high concentrations of polymer 6 10 which coats the cells and restricts their interaction with contaminated water polyethylenimine pei derivatives are a popular immobilising agent which have restricted application for bacterial immobilisation due to high toxicity issues virgen ortíz et al 2017 milović et al 2005 in this study we suggest a novel approach to the design of immobilised bacteria based bioreactors for water treatment applications to overcome existing limitations a minimum concentration of polymers

groups pva al briefly 0 6 ml of ga 50 v v was added to a 2 acidified pva solution in distilled water note that the pva modification is inefficient at neutral conditions the reaction was terminated by ph adjustment to ph 6 7 5 unreacted ga was removed by dialysis utilising a dialysis bag cut off 12 kda against water polyethyleneimine pei was modified in similar manner by adding 8 8 ml of ga 20 v v to 2 polymer solution in water the ph was adjusted to 7 prior to ga addition to avoid aldol condensation of aldehyde under alkaline conditions and therefore to achieve a more consistent chemical composition of the polymer the reaction mixture was incubated under stirring for 2h at room temperature the ph adjusted to seven and then the mixture was dialysed against water a dialysis bag cut off 1 kda the obtained polymer solution was filtered through a 0 45μm membrane and stored at 4 c until subsequent use the concentration of the polymer in the solution was estimated by using a freeze drying method and measuring the final dry weight of the polymer 2 2 characterisation of polymers ft ir analysis of freeze dried polymers pva al and pva and pei al was performed using a bruker alpha p

cell density of 2 085 mg ml kim et al 2012 the wet weight of the pelleted cells was calculated accordingly for calculation of the bacterial cell density of rho and acn the following ratio was applied an od600 of one resulted in a cell wet weight of 1 7 g l and 0 39 g l of dry weight respectively glazyrina et al 2010 the pelleted cells wet mass of 0 29g were mixed gently with 2 5 ml of cross linker

prepared from a combination of polymers pva pei chitosan chi gellan gum gel and glutaraldehyde ga as well as only ga 0 5 and were prepared analogously to the above mentioned procedure prior to the

using the same method as detailed above incorporation of the cbrs into plastic carriers improves their mechanical stability and decreases the possibility of mechanical damage under intensive mixing or application of high flow rate or during the recharging of solutions between bioremediation cycles önnby et al 2010 rusten et al 2006 cbrs based on pse pellet of 100 ml od600 1 06 or 221 mg pva al pei

assessed using a mtt assay hao et al 2002 following standard methods 2 4 3d macroporous bioreactor characterisation the elastic moduli of the cryogel bacteria reactors cbrs were studied using a ta xt2 instrument stable micro systems godalming surrey uk the compression test was performed at room temperature the cryogels were prepared with a diameter of 8 mm and height of 9 mm samples were compressed up to a deformation level of 50 at a speed of 0 05 mm s the elastic modulus was calculated at a deformation of 5 using the equation e f s δh h where e is the elastic modulus pa f is the force applied n s is the cross sectional area of the sample m2 δh is the height m at compression and h is the original height m kirsebom et al 2013 three samples were used for each type of composite cryogel scanning electronic microscopy sem images were obtained using a zeiss sigma field emission gun sem zeiss nts slices of cbrs with thickness of 1 2 mm were washed with pbs and then samples were fixed in 5 v v ga in pbs overnight following by washing with pbs and water then slices were frozen at 20 c overnight and freeze dried in a christ alpha 2 4 freeze dryer for 24 h finally freeze dried samples were coated with a layer of platinum using a quorum q150tes coater confocal laser scan microscopy clsm images were obtained using a leica tcs sp5 using objective lens x10 x20 x40 and x63 cbrs were fixed in 5 v v ga in pbs buffer overnight and then cut into slices with a thickness of 1 mm samples were washed with distilled water to remove non crosslinked bacteria and stained with rhodamine b solution overnight unbound rhodamine b was washed out with water another batch of cbrs was stained with fitc solution 0 02 mg ml in sodium phosphate buffer ph 9 0 overnight non reacted fitc was washed out with water the 488 and 530 nm excitation and emission wavelengths were applied images were produced by optical sectioning in the xy planes along the z axis with 30 70 optical sections with 1 μm intervals evaluation of the viability of crosslinked bacteria within the cryogel was performed using standard live dead assay cryogels were cut into thin slices with a thickness of 1 mm and washed out with nacl 0 9 solution to remove uncross linked cells samples were stained using live dead bac light kit containing syto 9 stain at wavelength 480 500 nm and propidium iodide at wavelength 490 635 nm for 15 min at room temperature under dark conditions according to the protocol of the live dead bacterial viability kit of staining 2 5 bioremediation by suspensions of bacteria and cbrs the degradation of phenol m cresol and 2 chlorophenol 2 cp or 4 chlorophenol 4 cp by a suspension of non crosslinked bacteria and by various cbrs was studied in the case of bioremediation by a bacterial suspension planktonic state the same amount of bacteria measured based on od600 as applied in the cryogel preparation was used forty ml of phenol derivative were added to the pellet of bacteria in a sterile 50 ml plastic falcon tube the tube was regularly opened for sampling 207 μl at each time point under sterile conditions note that the tube contained approximately 10 ml of air the tubes were shaken at 150 rpm at 30 c in the dark dynamic mode the number of bacteria in the solution during the bioremediation process was monitored by measurement of od600 at each sampling point cbrs were placed in 40 ml of phenol derivative phenol m cresol 2 cp and 4 cp in minimum salt media msm buffer at ph 7 0 in a static mode without additional shaking at 30 c control sterile solutions phenol m cresol 2 cp and 4 cp in msm were prepared under the same conditions and tested to estimate stability against degradation over time in a static mode nonspecific adsorption of 4 cp on the pei al pva al and pva al control cryogels without bacteria see section 2 3 was evaluated in msm at 30 c in dymanic mode due to observable biofilm formation in the glass bottle during the bioremediation process each cycle was performed in a new set of sterile bottles to eliminate the effect of biofilm formation on the following bioremediation cycles the efficiency of the bioreactors was calculated as previously discussed börner et al 2014 based on the change of contaminant concentration at a given time point 48 and 220h divided by the experimental duration i e the number of hours of bioreactor or bacteria exposure to the target contaminant mg l h according to the equation efficiency c0 ct t where c0 is initial concentration ct concentration at a time point the error was calculated according to the standard equation error stdev a1 ai count a1 ai where stdev is standard deviation count a1 ai number of replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 cryobacteria reactor cbr preparation and characterisation in our recent work we used combinations of polymers ga 0 385 ga pva 0 385 0 77 pva al pei al 0 385 0 46 pva al pei al 0 77 0 19 keeping the concentration of bacteria at 23 by mass for preparation of cryogels al jwaid et al 2018 here to select the best performing bioremediation system cryobacteria reactors based on three bacterial strains and six immobilising polymers and their combinations were screened pva and pei modified with aldehyde groups were used as cross linkers the presence of aldehyde group in the modified polymers was confirmed by ftir and 1h nmr spectroscopy figs s2 a c as expected the zeta potentials of the pva and pva al were close to zero illustrating the electroneutrality of the cross linking agent whereas pei al showed a zeta potential of 32 4 mv indicating that the cross linker is positively charged fig s3 and therefore can additionally interact with cell membranes via electrostatic interactions additionally cryogels with chitosan and gellan gum were prepared to analyse the bacteria immobilisation as result of electrostatic interaction between the cell membrane and these polymers in previous work bacteria capable of the bioremediation of phenol were immobilised on cryogel surfaces in three steps overall the cryogel preparation and the following biofilm formation was completed in 10 days and required the use of additional equipment such as uv lamps 400 w satchanska et al 2015 the subsequent bioreactor contained a large amount of bulk polymer leading to issues of disposal after its use and this technique therefore is less practical for industrial application here suspensions of p mendocina pse r koreensis rho and a radioresistens acn 11 6 w w were cross linked by a combination of pei al pva al 0 6 0 6 w w prepared in pb in a one step cryostructuration process when the suspension of cells and cross linker freezes under semi frozen conditions 12 c ice crystals form which leads to phase separation of the cells and the cross linker suspension and ice fig 1 the growing ice crystals expel all solutes and bacteria into a non frozen liquid microphase which remains non frozen even at 12 c kirsebom et al 2013 the bacteria and cross linker therefore concentrate in the thin non frozen liquid microphase and the bacteria become densely packed and cross linked by functional polymers interacting with their cell membranes thawing of samples results in the melting of the ice crystals producing water filled voids pores this results in a 3d structured macroporous material formed in a one step preparation method with the pore walls composed mostly of bacterial cells tightly attached to each other surrounding a well developed system of interconnected large pores with size 20 150 μm fig 2 the obtained cryogels were self supporting mechanically stable fig s4 and withstand processing in a static and a dynamic mode i e shaking at 150 rpm for at least 4 weeks fig s5 a d rapid aggregation of cells was observed upon addition of glutaraldehyde the cryo acn pva al has no obvious cells in the cryogel wall due to use of a relatively high concentration of cross linking agent 1 7 fig 2i a c it was observed that the change of composition of the buffer did not change the morphology of the material significantly fig 2ii nevertheless the use of pb or pb glucose has advantages compared to cryogels prepared in pure water as these decrease the osmotic stress during cryogel preparation and keep the ph constant to visualise the efficiency of mixing of the bacteria with the polymer as well as to assess the distribution and amount of live cells cbrs were stained with live dead stains the hydrogel based on gellan was characterised by the absence of large pores in the structure of the composite hydrogels and a homogeneous distribution of cells within the material fig 3 e h a strong fluorescence background due to electrostatic binding of the positively charged dyes with the negatively charged polymer can be observed under clsm nevertheless at magnification x100 the images clearly distinguish between cells and background fig 3h the material has a predominantly microporous structure however and therefore can be used only in batch application in a dynamic mode fig 3e h we focused on preparation and assessment of the bioremediation activity of macroporous materials which potentially could be used additionally in a flow through mode some of the key beneficial properties of cryogels relate to their elastic strength flexibility and shape recovery in our recent study we comprehensively investigated the rheological properties of cryogels based on bacteria al jwaid et al 2018 however the elastic modulus was not measured the elastic modulus of the cryogels acn pva al 1 0 and acn pva al pei al 1 0 0 25 was 3 52 0 7 and 4 64 0 1 kpa respectively these values were similar to those previously reported for cryogels made of e coli and activated polyethylenimine which had an elastic modulus of 3 1 0 39 kpa zaushitsyna et al 2014 or porous material c saccharolyticus cross linked by glutaraldehyde which showed a modulus in the range 8 29 kpa kirsebom et al 2009 our data were also comparable with the elastic modulus of cryogels based on polymers such as enzymatically cross linked casein 1 3 7 kpa and gelatin 0 95 1 9 kpa kirsebom et al 2013 or combinations of polymeric cross linking agent aldehyde dextran and gelatin 0 6 2 8 kpa respectively berillo and volkova 2014 cryo rho pva al pei al gel 11 6 0 5 0 6 0 3 cryo rho pva al gel 11 6 1 0 0 3 prepared in water and cryo rho pva al gel 11 6 1 0 0 3 formed in phosphate buffer had elastic moduli of 16 1 1 7 87 7 16 3 28 7 17 0 kpa respectively as expected an increase of chi concentration from 0 5 to 1 0 at constant polymer cross linking mass ratio 2 1 led to a significant increase in the toughness of the material fig s4 cryogels based on rho 11 6 in combination with polymers chi ga 0 5 0 25 and chi ga 1 0 0 5 pei ga1 0 0 25 and 1 0 0 5 pei pva ga 1 0 1 0 0 25 showed an elastic modulus of 34 7 15 5 1955 268 12 4 8 10 8 0 9 7 2 1 5 kpa respectively as expected the highest elasticity modulus was found for samples based on chi which is related to the rigid structure of this polysaccharide the incorporation of gel to the structure significantly improves the mechanical properties of the material due to formation of a physical gel in fig s4 an illustrated comparison of the elastic properties of composite cryogels based on rhodococcus sp is given the analysis of live and dead bacteria using live dead kit indicates that most of the bacteria after cross linking were viable stained green fig 3e h even after undergoing freeze thawing conditions during the cryogelation process potentially cryogenic conditions particularly ice crystal formation as well as the cross linker and the osmotic stress itself could damage the bacterial cells and reduce viable cell numbers to distinguish the potential harmful effects of the polymer cross linker from those caused by cryogenic conditions the experiments were performed at 4 c 12 c respectively incubation of rho suspension in the solution of pbs containing 0 25 or 0 5 of ga negative control at 4 c for 24 h led to a significant decrease in the number of live bacteria to 27 and 22 of initial numbers respectively due to the toxicity of ga the use of pei al 0 365 w v in pbs resulted in a 25 of live acn bacteria pei al was more toxic compared to unmodified pei where 50 of bacteria survived pva al 1 2 in pbs buffer at 4 c revealed a high survival of acn 92 4 compared to a bacterial suspension stored in phosphate buffer without polymer 100 positive control table s1 the issue of the relatively high toxicity of pei al was overcome by the use of a combination of nontoxic pva al with pei al leading to 72 5 active bacteria the use of only pva al led to formation of a material with low water permeability while using a combination of pva al pei al 1 1 resulted in formation of a material with desirable porosity characteristics and mechanical properties a small amount of glucose which acted as a cryoprotector and potentially as a source of carbon was added to the bacterial suspension to decrease the effect of cell bacteria damage due to ice crystal formation and osmotic shock moslemy et al 2002 pva al 1 2 dissolved in pbs buffer in the presence of 2 glucose showed some growth of the acn bacteria at 4 c 109 after 24h table s1 the frozen suspension of acn in pva al 1 2 and pbs buffer with 2 glucose added showed 88 6 survival from the initial number of cells thus a decrease of 11 4 in live bacteria was related to bacterial damage by growing ice crystals the effect of 1 0 glucose in pbs buffer on bacterial viability was also investigated table s1 the incubation of pse suspension in pbs buffer containing 1 0 glucose over 24 h at 4 c led to a 13 8 decrease in cell populations compared to the pbs buffer the presence of glucose did not significantly improve the viability of pse during the cryogelation process either table s1 it can be concluded that addition of glucose in combination with pva al pei al 1 1 did not significantly improve the survival of the bacteria or even had some negative effect on pse but conversely it had a positive effect on acn during incubation for 24 h at 4 c it can also be concluded that the 23 pse bacteria population decrease observed after incubation at 4 c for 24h was due to cumulative toxicity from the pva al pei al polymers while the 53 loss of bacteria after cryogelation was presumably due to damage of the bacteria by growing ice crystals during the cryo structuration process table s1 3 2 bioremediation of phenol and cresols recently we illustrated the bioremediation efficiency of cryogels based on pse rho and a pse rho mixture for 50 ppm phenol in carbonate buffer in a dynamic mode al jwaid et al 2018 in this study phenol and m cresol bioremediation by cryo rho cryo pse and cryo acn cryogels was examined in dynamic and static mode in msm buffer 50 ppm 40 ml and compared with bacterial suspensions fig s5 d and s6 suspensions of bacteria of pse or acn degraded 50 ppm 40 ml of phenol in 7 days 166h whereas rho completed the degradation in 9 days 220h fig s5 d increasing the phenol concentration to 100 ppm resulted in 39 5 phenol degradation by a suspension of acn over 220h bioremediation efficiency 0 123 mg l h rho formed a biofilm on the glass surface in the solution of phenol 100 ppm 200 ml and did not degrade phenol over 12 days of incubation data not shown cbr pse cbr acn and cbr rho were more efficient for phenol degradation compared to a suspension of equivalent bacteria table 1 bacterial suspensions of pse or acn degraded 50 ppm 40 ml phenol in 166h whereas rho completed the degradation in 220h fig s5 c cryogel pse gel 0 5 showed slow bioremediation of m cresol 300 ppm with 21 degraded over 17 days in a static mode the presence of polysaccharide gel in the structure of the cryogel decreased the bioremediation efficiency of the material which might be related to its consumption as a source of carbon a cryogel composed of a combination of rho 0 13 of pva al and 0 5 gel was not as effective for phenol bioremediation as cryo rho pva al gel 1 0 0 3 fig 4 a other polymer compositions were used for cryogels preparation based on pei pva ga 1 1 0 25 pei pva ga 0 6 0 5 0 25 chi ga 1 0 25 fig 4b which revealed complete bioremediation of m cresol 50 ppm in 116 and 225h respectively the suspension of bacteria acn produced only 10 degradation of m cresol 50 ppm 200 ml a static mode within 12 days there was no significant difference in m cresol biodegradation by pse and rho the suspension of rho degraded only 11 of m cresol 50 ppm 200 ml after 12 days data not shown the first bioremediation cycle of m cresol 50 ppm 200 ml by cbr acn 9 106 cfu was completed within 5 days the addition of fresh phenol solution 100 ppm 200 ml to the cbr acn instead of m cresol resulted in only 50 consumption of phenol within 8 days indicating that the same batch of cbr acn might be utilised for bioremediation of mixed or complex mixtures but with similar by structure contaminants i e it can be acclimatised to a new contaminant however it took a longer time compared to the model system fig 4c the bioremediation of the m cresol was slower over the first 90h of testing for the three bacteria cryogels of cryo rho pei pva ga cryo rho pei pva ga and cryo rho chi ga due to bacterial acclimatisation prior to m cresol consumption fig 4b bioremediation with cbr rho and cbr pse consumed 71 of m cresol 40 ml 50 ppm after 10 days fig 4c the bioremediation using cbr rho at higher m cresol concentrations 40 ml 100 ppm indicated only a 30 decrease in m cresol concentration data is not shown cbr acn revealed better ability to degrade m cresol compared to cbr rho and cbr pse the 1st 2nd and 3rd bioremediation cycles of m cresol 50 ppm by cbr acn were completed within 265 90 and 46h respectively regardless of which bacterial strains were used pse rho and acn the cbr had an adaptation period to phenol and m cresol of 48h and 90h respectively cbr acn showed the best degradation efficiency for m cresol among the studied bacterial strains following this the bioremediation process was scaled up in a static mode and the volume of the solution was increased to 200 ml revealing a significant decrease of concentration within 100 120h for the studied bacterial strains fig 5 the biodegradation of phenol by cbr pse cbr rho and cbr acn was studied with addition of a fresh portion of phenol after each bioremediation cycle cbr pse and cbr acn consumed 60 ppm of phenol within 200h whereas cbr rho completed the bioremediation in approximately 100h for the first cycle it is important to note that cbr pse cbr rho and cbr acn revealed similar phenol degradation activity for following 2 10 cycles which were complited within approximately 60 65h fig s6 a c to the best of our knowledge there is still no information about the efficiency of rho to degrade phenol cresols and chlorophenols pseudomonas spp has been previously used for bioremediation of benzene and toluene into phenol and cresol tao et al 2004 2005 calculation of degradation efficiency showed that cbr pse caused a more rapid bioremediation of phenol compared to cbr rho or cbr acn fig 5 and table 1 cbr rho needed an acclimatisation period of approximately 48h before the bacteria became active for bioremediation cbr pse cbr acn and cbr rho were more efficient for phenol degradation compared to a suspension of equivalent bacteria table 1 and phenol bioremediation efficiencies were 0 6 0 363 and 0 0915 mg l h 48h respectively fig 5 it can be concluded that the selected strains pse rho and acn preferably degrade phenol while the biodegradation of m cresol took place at least 3 times more slowly fig 4c overall the cbrs show resistance to high concentrations of phenol derivatives and significantly faster bioremediation fig 5 fig s5 a c compared to equivalent suspensions of bacteria in a static mode fig s5 d moreover the recovery of the bioreactors is straightforward and does not require centrifugation to separate suspensions of bacteria from the aqueous solution making the whole bioremediation process considerably simpler to apply the same cbr pse cbr rho cbr acn biorectors were used over 10 bioremediation cycles without showing any decline in activity over more than one month of exploitation demonstrating the ability for reuse of the material over repeat cycles fig s5 a c as noted above suspensions of bacteria cannot be used instantly for bioremediation of high phenol concentrations 60 ppm an increase in phenol concentration resulted in prolongation of the bioremediation process required for its complete degradation fig 5a c there was no delay of bioremediation at high concentrations of contaminant for the 2nd and following bioremediation cycles mtt assay after 17 days of the bioremediation process showed for cbr pse a significant increase in bacterial numbers compared to initial numbers table 2 indicating their existence in an exponential growth phase in contrast cbr acn and cbr rho showed a decrease in bacterial numbers following treatment table 2 indicating that these bacteria had entered a senescence phase based on fig 5 one can assume that 300 ppm is not the limit for the bioremediation process however there are few examples where such high concentrations would be encountered in a real case scenario therefore higher phenol concentrations were not tested further usually the concentration of phenols in waste water is quite low and adaptation of the cbr is unnecessary but in cases where faster bioremediation of high concentrations of phenols 200 300 ppm is required cbrs may be pre adapted to phenol at concentrations of 25 50 ppm analysis of treated water via hplc confirmed the absence of phenol or release of its derivatives such as p hydroxybenzoic acid hydroquinone catechol and protocatechuate tao et al 2005 martínková et al 2009 a few peaks with retention times in the range of 1 2 min were observed which most probably relate to the peak of the solvent or to the final degradation products of phenol possibly tri carbonic acids the biodegradation of p cresol performed using suspensions of pse and rho revealed a trace amount of p cresol and some trace amounts of its derivatives were detected after 2 weeks of bioremediation by suspensions of bacteria pse rho and the corresponding cryobacteria reactors the bioremediation results for p cresol and m cresol were comparable indirect evidence of the release of tri carbonic acids was given by a ph shift from 7 1 to 6 5 6 4 which is in agreement with previously described pathways of degradation of phenols and cresols kolomytseva et al 2007 3 3 biodegradation of chlorophenols chlorophenols cps are relatively stable products of the biodegradation of triclosan and triclocarban which are widely used as antimicrobial agents in toothpaste soaps and detergents and are present in most waste waters dhillon et al 2015 therefore the efficiency of the developed cryo rho cryo pse cryo acn reactors for degrading various cps was examined the viability of bacteria via monitoring of turbidity as well as their biodegradation efficiency for 4cp and 2cp in carbonate buffer and minimum salt media msm at ph 7 2 was estimated figs s7 and s9 data indicated that bioremediation efficiency for suspensions of acn rho and pse were negligible 40 ml 50 ppm 4cp in carbonate buffer at 48 and 120 h respectively bioremediation efficiencies for suspension of the rho and pse in msm were 0 044 0 019 mg l h and 0 032 0 025 mg l h 40 ml 50 ppm 4cp at 48 and 220h respectively fig s8 from the cryobacteria reactors tested only cryo pse pva al or pva al pei al showed consistent ability to degrade 4cp fig 6 and table 1 although cryo rho showed some degradative the 4cp degradation efficiency was much lower compared to bioremediation efficiencies for phenol or m cresol using the same bacterial strains biodegradation of 2cp 60 ppm resulted in only a 9 decrease after 6 6 days table s2 control cryogels of pei al pva al and pva al without bacteria did not reveal adsorption of phenols or cps or self decomposition of the contaminant within 1000h of incubation in the 4 cp 50 ppm solution 40 ml one can observe that gel based cryogels cross linked by magnesium ions were less efficient in the bioremediation process compared to sodium cross linked physical gel which may be related to some diffusion restriction as gel forms a hydrogel such faster estimation of the final concentration of 4cp was performed using hplc illustrating that suspensions of bacteria pse and rho and cryo pse and cryo rho can slowly degrade 4cp table s2 fig 6 it was observed that rho immobilized within the cryogel structure is capable of degrading chlorophenol without additional sources of carbon these data indicate that cryo pse and cryo rho bioreactors while less effective for 4cp and 2cp warrant further study in their application for treatment of waste water from hospitals which has high concentrations of recalcitrant chlorophenols and their metabolites which require removal 4 conclusion 3d structured bioreactors based on live bacteria suitable for the bioremediation of a range of phenol derivatives phenol cresols chlorophenols were prepared by cryogelation in a one step process using water as a solvent the macroporous material consisted of 11 6 live bacteria 1 2 polymers and 87 voids pores for the first time toxicity levels of novel aldehyde containing polymers cross linking agents pei al and pva al were estimated and their suitable combination proposed the cryobacteria reactors maintain their degradation activity over at least 10 cycles the efficiencies of cryobacteria reactors of pse rho and acn for degradation of four concentrations of phenol derivatives revealed complete rapid bioremediation in dynamic as well as static mode moreover the developed material exhibited significantly better performance for phenol degradation than recently reported by our group where the bioremediation of 50 ppm of phenol 40 ml in a dynamic mode was studied al jwaid et al 2018 bioremediation cycles 2nd 10th cycle were completed within 2 6 days compared to about 10 days for equivalent cell suspensions the purification of 200 ml of 300 ppm of phenol by pse rho and acn within cryobacteria reactors took approximately 7 days the use of plastic carriers showed slightly slower bioremediation of cresols compared to conventional cryobacteria reactors overall six polymers and their combinations were utilised to produce materials for bioremediation purposes using three bacterial strains the activities of which were tested using four model phenol derivatives the developed technology preserves the native structure and activity of the bacteria cryobacteria reactors have several advantages cryogels based on live bacteria can be easily reprocessed after inactivation due to low content of a polymeric cross linker 10 in the structure and therefore the technology can be considered as green there is no diffusion restriction as materials are macroporous with well developed connected micro channels that improve interaction of the cells with contaminated water the macroporous structure of interconnected pores also creates the possibility of exploiting the bioreactor as a flow through column or filter system with no requirement to separate the bacteria after the bioremediation process the technique is faster and simpler than a previously published three step cryogel surface immobilisation techniques for phenol degrading bacteria which also contain a large bulk content of polymer resulting in more complex processing after use acknowledgements this project received funding from the marie skłodowska curie
