11305,a tool implemented in matlab called gredrip has been developed to simulate the behavior of an on demand irrigation network taking into account crop distributions in an irrigable area it was applied during two complete irrigation seasons 2015 and 2016 for weekly irrigation scheduling this tool portends to be useful as a decision support system tool to manage on demand collective irrigable areas with minimum energy costs at the pumping station and by performing an irrigation schedule to guarantee crop water requirements hence it is possible to go from an on demand irrigation management system to a restricted arranged operation carried out with centralized management where the manager of the irrigation network satisfies the demand of farmers within a short period of time the main novelty of this paper is to show a simulation tool which integrate the energy efficiency of the pumping station taking into account irrigation events distribution according to the crop irrigation scheduling at each plot in this regard this tool respects the irrigation scheduling of farmers and it controls the starting time for each hydrant to minimize the energy cost it was applied considering two types of pressure regulations i e fixed and variable pressure heads the distribution of open hydrants and the starting times of the irrigation events at each case performed by this tool led to optimization of the flow discharge distribution in the irrigation network guaranteeing adequate flow discharge and pressure to all hydrants which affected the uniformity of irrigation in the plot although the regulation using fixed pressure management represented energy costs 10 higher than the regulation using the variable pressure head this difference would not compensate for the implementation of variable pressure management given the complexity of managing a variable pressure head in a pumping station the actual irrigation network management which does not consider the energy efficiency at the pumping station showed higher energy consumed and energy costs at the pumping system in comparison with the results using gredrip this fact suggest that it is necessary to improve the technical advisory system for irrigation scheduling at the plot scale and irrigation network management keywords irrigation network restricted arranged operation irrigation scheduling pumping station energy costss 1 introduction in recent years the modernization of irrigation systems from gravity systems to pressurized systems has led to increased water and land productivity but also to an increase in energy consumption fernández garcía et al 2014a tarjuelo et al 2015 in irrigation societies increased energy costs along with investment costs linked to modernization may put the economic viability of some modernized farms at risk the lack of knowledge on the relationship between water and energy use can lead to increases in energy costs this fact is especially relevant to on demand irrigation networks where inefficient water use as well as significant increases in energy consumption can result even when farmers do not schedule irrigation adequately in these types of irrigation networks typically farmers irrigate whenever they want and this is characterized by irrigation management flexibility lamaddalena and sagardoy 2000 this management is subjected to high variability of flow regimes because it depends on the number of hydrants simultaneously opened which can contribute to low energy efficiency in some of these irrigation networks because the pumping station is not working in designed conditions lamaddalena and pereira 2007 rodríguez díaz et al 2009 according to this it is necessary to use tools to improve the efficiency of these types of pressurized irrigation networks several strategies have been developed to improve water and energy use efficiency in on demand pressurized irrigation networks one of them consists of sectoring and grouping hydrants with similar energy demands jiménez bello et al 2011 carrillo cobo et al 2011 navarro navajas et al 2012 other methodologies are based on detecting and controlling critical points rodríguez díaz et al 2009 2012 which are defined as hydrants with special energy requirements depending on their distance to the pump station or their difference in elevation daccache et al 2010 developed a methodology combining network design and performance analysis of a sprinkler network simulating the interaction between on demand water distribution systems and on farm networks the variation in pumping station efficiency at each combination of flow discharge and pressure head is an important factor to consider in irrigation networks which was not always considered in previous operational studies in those cases a fixed efficiency was considered which might not be representative when the pumping station is working during an irrigation season it is related to the fact that when pumping stations are designed only high discharges are considered to determine the design flow but in most of the cases low and medium discharges are generated moreno et al 2010 and the required pumping head changes occur during the irrigation season pérez urrestarazu and burt 2012 in this regard moreno et al 2007b developed the maeeb model with the aim of analysing the energy efficiency of the pumping stations fernández garcía et al 2014a developed a pumping station model to analyse the performance of pumps for several activation sequences that were applied to study optimum pumping station management for irrigation network sectoring in spain córcoles et al 2016a considered the energy efficiency at each combination of flow discharge and pressure head to develop a methodology to determine the optimum pressure head that minimizes the power needed at the pumping station the aforementioned studies did not consider electricity tariffs and they used an average fixed cost for the energy consumed hence fernández garcía et al 2016 developed a decision making support system to analyse several network operation scenarios considering different energy prices according to the electricity tariff they applied this methodology in sectoring and critical points control in previous studies developed by the same authors fernández garcía et al 2013 fernández garcía et al 2014b córcoles et al 2015 took into account the energy costs for several energy rate periods when developing a methodology to minimize the energy cost of the pumping stations in on demand irrigation networks with the organization of the starting irrigation times for each hydrant khadra et al 2016 analysed energy and hydraulic performance based management of large scale pressurized irrigation systems which analysed the interaction between the irrigation system use and the energy consumption based on to generate demand scenarios according to a random selection of open hydrants few studies have considered the influence of irrigation scheduling at the plot scale on irrigation networks in this regard gonzález perea et al 2016 developed a tool based on optimizing irrigation scheduling using the soil water balance and a genetic algorithm they used a model that establishes the optimal sectoring operation during the irrigation season and focused on the simultaneous optimization of irrigation scheduling at the plot scale considering water demand at a hydrant level and energy consumption at the pumping station in southern spain they determined daily irrigation needs during the peak demand period most of these studies focused on analysing the performance of irrigation networks in a peak period with maximum crop water requirements likewise other studies are based on creating demand scenarios using methodologies to define the probability of open hydrants moreno et al 2007a and considering a random selection of open hydrants none of the above mentioned methodologies considered crop water requirements over a complete irrigation season the aim of this paper is to present a matlab tool called gredrip this tool can be useful to compare irrigation network behavior under several irrigation strategies which is analysed in the part ii of this work focused on the economic impact of regulated deficit irrigation in irrigation networks the main novelty of gredrip is that it considers several aspects in one tool it combines the hydraulic and energy behavior of the irrigation network considering the well known variability of the energy efficiency in a pumping station and the electricity tariffs depending on the period along with irrigation scheduling and crop water requirements in the plots during the whole irrigation season low and peak water demand this tool is not based on a probability of open hydrants and simulates the behavior of an on demand irrigation network taking into account the actual crop distribution in the irrigable area and the actual irrigation scheduling in the plots likewise gredrip respects the irrigation scheduling of farmers and it controls the starting time combinations at each plot which minimizes energy costs the main contribution of this research is to set up a model that enables a centralized management of the irrigation network minimizing the energy costs while considering the irrigation scheduling at farm level in this regard it is possible to go from an on demand irrigation management system to a restricted arranged operation 2 material and methods 2 1 irrigation network the gredrip model was applied to the irrigation network named soreta in the province of albacete in the castilla la mancha region spain fig 1 during two complete irrigation seasons 2015 and 2016 for weekly irrigation scheduling which is the common management of irrigation used by farmers this was an on demand irrigation network that covered an irrigable area of 550 ha with 323 hydrants it used ground water resources pumped from four boreholes to a reservoir 23 000 m3 using submerged pumps installed at 150 m in depth with absorbed power from 139 kw to 330 kw depending on the extracted flow discharge a pumping station composed of 9 pumps 140 hp one of them with variable frequency speed drive and the rest with soft starters delivered water to the irrigation network the pumping station was managed with a fixed pressure head of 52 m to guarantee 35 m at each open hydrant for a sprinkler and drip irrigation system at a plot scale which represented 65 and 35 of the irrigated area respectively the most common are permanent sprinkler irrigation systems with 17 m 17 m spacing two nozzles of 4 4 2 8 mm or one nozzle of 5 2 mm and a drip irrigation system with self compensating emitters of 4 l h 1 lateral spacing of 0 75 m and 3 m between laterals which is typical of the vineyard crop which is one of the most relevant crops in the irrigable area the crop distribution in both irrigation seasons is indicated in table 1 the irrigable area was distributed into several plots whose sizes ranged from 1 ha to 11 ha the number of sectors per plot depended on its size table 2 approximately 80 of the plots had an area lower than 2 ha each plot had a hydrant that allowed remote opening and closing of the valves controlled by an automation system from a central computer each hydrant of the irrigation network had a flow limiter to regulate the water discharge to a constant value for any pressure higher than 35 m thus in the modelling process a constant discharge was considered at each hydrant the contract with the electric company had six energy rate periods p1 to p6 with different electricity pricing table 3 soreta was managed under on demand operation where farmers could irrigate whatever they wanted however all the irrigation events were meant to be carried out only during the cheaper energy rate period p6 for the entire irrigation season this energy rate period was maintained at 24 h for the weekend and 8 h from 12 a m to 8 a m during the weekdays except for august in which all days were included in p6 2 2 data acquisition the irrigation network was implemented in epanet software rossman 2001 fig 2 information about pipe diameters and the network layout was obtained using the database of the irrigable area moreover the measured data were obtained to ensure that the information about the pumping station and the network model was accurate the roughness coefficients of the pipes were estimated based on the previous works performed by the authors in this network moreno et al 2008 córcoles et al 2016a and adjusted using epanet at each node of the irrigation network information about the crop distribution was obtained in the field hydraulic and electric data were also measured following the proposed methodology of córcoles et al 2010 hence an ultrasound flow meter was used to measure the flow discharge at each pump of the pumping station the pressure was monitored using pressure transducers collecting data at 1 minute time intervals one pressure transducer was installed at the exit of the pumping station and three additional pressure transducers were installed at specific points distributed along the irrigation network according to córcoles et al 2016b the electrical parameters of the pumps current voltage and absorbed power were measured with a portable electrical network analyser this information was used to check that the behavior of each pump of the pumping station was similar to the theoretical characteristic curves considering hydraulic power nh 9 81 q h in kw with q in m3 s 1 and h in m and the absorbed power nabs in kw measured with the electrical network analyser the global efficiency η in was computed using eq 1 this efficiency included pump efficiency motor efficiency electrical conductors electronic starter or variable speed drive efficiency and the performance of the wiring and possible volumetric losses in the connection of the pump with the discharge pipe 1 η n h n a b s 100 where η is the global efficiency nh is the hydraulic power kw and nab s is the absorbed power kw in both irrigation seasons 2015 and 2016 the previous information was completed with the actual energy consumed obtained from the invoices kw h of the pumping station provided by the managers of the irrigable area to control the quality of irrigation in some selected plots evaluations of the on farm irrigation system were carried out in both irrigation seasons plots irrigated with the sprinkler irrigation system were evaluated following the methodology of merriam and keller 1978 and iso standards 7749 2 1990 iso 15886 3 2012 and asae standard asae s330 1 1985 the coefficient of uniformity cu christiansen 1942 uniformity of distribution ud and the proportion of water reaching the surface soil pe were calculated in plots irrigated with the drip irrigation system evaluations were developed using keller and karmeli 1974 methodology in this case the emission uniformity eu the flow coefficient of variation cvq bralts and kesner 1983 the statistical emission uniformity uee and the pressure coefficient of variation cvp bralts et al 1987 were calculated in the plots indicated above crop monitoring was carried out once per week following the biologische bundesarstalt bundessoztenamt and chemical bbch scale bleiholder et al 2001 the dynamic water demand of different crops in different growth period has been considered in the irrigation scheduling calculated with mopeco model this model domínguez et al 2012 is based on the food and agriculture organization fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 using the simplified water balance in the root depth method it considers water inlets irrigation precipitation and root growth and outlets percolation and evapotranspiration rainfall was monitored using a rain gage located at the field site and effective rainfall was estimated with the usda methodology using curve number 2 scs 1972 nrcs 2004 for each crop daily maximum evapotranspiration etm was calculated as the product of the crop coefficient kc dimensionless and the reference evapotranspiration eto mm allen et al 1998 daily eto was calculated with the fao penman monteith equation and the climatic data were obtained daily from the la gineta albacete weather station utm coordinates x 585 237 y 432 8310 altitude 722 msnm above sea level installation date 9 29 2000 this is located 15 km from the irrigable area in a large level area with uniform vegetation finally according to the characteristics of the soil irrigation system and the irrigation management the days of the week with irrigation events and water irrigation applied at each one were determined to guarantee crop water requirements 2 3 model description the gredrip tool was developed in matlab pratap 2010 in combination with the epanet toolkit rossman 2001 the proposed tool allowed the distribution of open hydrants during each week of the complete irrigation season defining the starting time for irrigation daily at each open hydrant the flowchart of the proposed methodology is included in fig 3 2 3 1 weekly distribution of open hydrants the gredrip tool performs weekly simulations which is the most common management of irrigation by the farmers using on demand irrigation networks the simulations were based on determining the minimum energy costs at the pumping station for each irrigation day the first step is to compute the irrigation schedule and crop water requirements for each crop which allows determining the irrigation time required at each hydrant for each crop a weekly irrigation schedule was established from which the number of hydrants that were opened each week was known the next step is to distribute the open hydrants in the corresponding week for this all hydrants that needed to be used that week were open during the weekend and depending on the number of irrigation events that each hydrant must perform during the week they could be open during the rest of the days of the week thus if the corresponding plot only required one irrigation event per week irrigation interval ir 7 days it was established as a criterion that the plot was irrigated during the weekend in the case of crops requiring two weekly irrigation events ir 3 5 days one irrigation was applied during the weekend period and the other during one day of the rest of the week in plots with higher demand for which three irrigation events were performed during the week ir 2 3 days one was during the weekend and the other two during the week for this management and coinciding with what farmers do a maximum time of irrigation tr of 4 h was set which may be lowered to adapt to the needs of the crop at any time according to this it is important to take into account that soils of the irrigable area had a depth less than 0 5 m and there were only 8 h of operating time ot for a day of the week for the weekend the ot was 24 h most of the plots have several irrigation sectors which makes it necessary to satisfy the demand of each one of them in this study it has been considered that each sector is irrigated independently and consecutively never irrigating several sectors of one plot at the same time thus the duration of the irrigation event at each plot was calculated using eq 2 2 d r n s t r where dr is the duration of the irrigation event ns is the number of sectors of the plot and tr is the irrigation time of one sector in the case of plots with several sectors to be irrigated more than once a week when dr ot all the sectors are irrigated on the same day consecutively if dr ot the sectors were irrigated on consecutive days 2 3 2 daily distribution of open hydrants to distribute open hydrants on different days of the week monday to friday the starting time of irrigation at each plot during the weekend saturday and sunday was taken as a reference therefore considering the irrigation time required and the number of irrigations events per week the most adequate day to irrigate was established to determine the starting time at each plot during the weekend 5 000 randomized scenarios for the starting time of open hydrants were generated taking into account that the duration of the irrigation event tr could not exceed the time of completion of the operating time ot this number of scenarios was highly accurate obtaining similar results when a higher number of scenarios 10 000 20 000 50 000 and 100 000 were used hence if a plot needed 4 h of irrigation and the available ot was 8 h between 0 a m to 8 a m assuming a week day the time limit for starting irrigation was 4 a m the available interval of time was divided into 15 minute intervals to define the time when a hydrant could be operating at each generated simulation the flow discharge in the inlet of the irrigation network was calculated using epanet software which represents the flow discharge that must be supplied by the pumping station at each irrigation time interval to obtain this it is necessary to know the flow discharge at each hydrant assuming that all sectors in a plot have the same size the flow discharge at each hydrant is calculated by eq 3 3 q t a p m 3600 where qt is the flow discharge at the hydrant l s 1 a is the surface per sector m2 and pm is the average application rate l m 2 h 1 the pm values were obtained from the data measured during the evaluations of the irrigation systems obtaining average values of 6 3 l m 2 h 1 and 1 8 l m 2 h 1 for plots with sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation respectively in addition in each simulation the pressure head was determined depending on the pressure head management strategy considered in this paper two management strategies were analysed one strategy was similar to the current strategy followed by management of the irrigable area using a constant pressure of 52 m in the head of the network which coincided with the measured pressure by the pressure transducer installed at the pumping station 51 5 m in 2015 and 51 7 m in 2016 the second strategy considered variable pressure in the head of the network to guarantee a minimum pressure of 35 m at the most restrictive hydrant at each scenario the energy consumption and cost at the pumping station were calculated for this aim it was necessary to obtain the performance of the pumping station at each combination of flow discharge and pressure head it was obtained using a model implemented in matlab that considered the characteristic pressure head and efficiency curves of the pumps fernández garcía et al 2014a for pressure head intervals of 1 m and a flow discharge of 25 l min 1 hence those characteristics curves resulted in a matrix of three variables and the efficiency was obtained at each combination of pressure head and flow discharge the input data for this model were the number of fixed and variable speed pumps pump characteristic curves motor efficiency working range of the pressure heads and flow discharge thus by knowing the operating points of the fixed pumps and using the affinity laws for variable speed pumps it was possible to determine the pumping station efficiency at each flow discharge demanded by the irrigation network the next step was to calculate the energy consumption and its costs at each scenario at the weekend for each scenario with the flow discharge and the pressure head at the inlet of the irrigation network along with the pumping station efficiency the energy consumed was calculated for that scenario the energy costs were computed using the energy cost depending on the energy rate period table 3 finally after 5 000 randomized scenarios for the starting time of open hydrants the scenario that minimized the energy costs at the pumping station during the weekend was selected once it was determined the open hydrants distribution for the remaining days of the week was carried out determining the starting time that minimized the energy cost at the pumping station per day according to the open hydrants at each one following the aforementioned procedure the main parameters included in the gredrip model which determined the energy consumption and its cost are the following crop distribution and location which were set at each irrigation season by farmers this determined crop water demand and the irrigation scheduling pressure head which was calculated by the model to guarantee a minimum pressure at the most restrictive hydrant it may be defined as a fixed pressure head to simplify the irrigation network management equivalent roughness of the pipes which takes into account the local losses in the network this was fixed during the calibration of the irrigation network process efficiency of the pumping station at each operating point this depended on the measured data at the pumping system such as absorbed power pressure head and flow discharge electricity tariffs which depended on the energy prices regarding these parameters it was considered unnecessary to carry out a sensitivity analysis on the pumping station performance which will change with the aging of pumps or the electricity tariffs prices because the other parameters can be considered fixed such as the roughness coefficient or conditioned by the crop distribution although any change in the parameters mentioned would influence the energy cost of the pumping station the gredrip model is able to minimize the energy consumed and its cost for any given condition in this study the values of the measured parameters of the irrigable area were used to compare the simulated results with the actual energy consumption and its cost according to the management carried out by the farmers 3 results and discussion the obtained results were related to the corresponding scenario that minimized the energy costs at the pumping station several periods of time weekly monthly and annual were considered to analyse the most relevant variables such as flow discharge pressure head efficiency at the pumping system energy consumed and energy costs 3 1 flow discharge distribution in this section we analyse the flow discharge at the inlet of the irrigation network obtained with the gredrip model for 2015 and 2016 irrigation seasons for fixed and variable pressure heads and considering two demand periods low and high of the irrigation season fig 4 shows the flow discharge distribution for a low demand week march 2nd to 8th in 2015 and march 28th to april 3rd in 2016 fig 4a y c and another week with high demand fig 4b y d may 18th to 24th in 2015 and july 11th to 17th in 2016 considering fixed and variable pressure heads in 2015 the maximum flow discharges at the inlet of the irrigation network ranged from 381 l s 1 fig 4a and 1045 l s 1 fig 4b for low and high demand periods respectively and ranged from 274 l s 1 fig 4c and 657 l s 1 fig 4d in 2016 these differences can be explained by the greater proportion of spring crops barley wheat peas and garlic in 2015 which concentrated the irrigation events in may in none of the simulated scenarios was the maximum theoretical flow discharge that could be delivered by the pumping station exceeded in all cases it can be highlighted that for a weekend ot 48 h the flow discharge distribution was similar to a normal distribution because of the randomness of the starting time of open hydrants generated by the simulation tool for the high demand week fig 4b and d the peak flow discharge occurred for a weekday wednesday this fact is related to the limited ot 8 h per day which led to a higher concentration of open hydrants in a shorter period of time compared to the weekend ot 24 h per day 3 2 pressure head fig 5 shows the evolution of the simulated variable and fixed 52 m pressure heads during two times of peak demand periods corresponding to may 2015 fig 5a and june 2016 fig 5b along with the actual measured pressure heads in the 2015 irrigation season it was highlighted that for variable pressure head management the pressure requirements only exceeded the fixed pressure head value on some days in the 2016 irrigation season fig 5b the trend was very similar although with slightly lower values in comparison to 2015 the actual measured pressure was close to 52 m although it was decreased in some periods reaching values ranging from 39 m to 52 5 m regarding a low demand period in 2015 fig 5c and 2016 fig 5d the actual pressures measured showed similar values to the fixed pressure heads more differences were obtained for the variable pressure heads with average values approximately 20 lower than the fixed pressure heads for both irrigation seasons the pressure head behavior for the simulated cases was different to the actual irrigation network management in this case during the peak water demand period may in 2015 and july in 2016 high concentration of flow discharges were reached resulting in pressure head drops it was related to several factors detected such as high number of open hydrants simultaneously high presence of crops with high irrigation water requirements as well as failures detected in two pumps of the pumping station in this regard moreno et al 2008 in the same area in the year of 2004 had already detected eventual pressure drops in the system due to the period of high water demand and concentration of open hydrants the current fixed pressure head value used in the irrigable area 52 m may be adequate even in the peak demand period in other periods such as the low demand period the fixed pressure head value might be reduced although it would require direct action on the regulation depending on the expected flow demand which might significantly complicate the network management with regard to the pressure of the specific points distributed along the irrigation network both simulated and measured pressure values showed a similar behavior to the pressure in the head of the network although the pressure drop in the farthest hydrant from the pumping head was more relevant thus a pressure drop in the head of the network of approximately 5 could cause a pressure drop in the hydrant that is close to 14 3 3 efficiency of the pumping system fig 6 shows the daily average efficiency of the pumping station for simulations carried out in 2015 and 2016 for a low demand week fig 6a y c march 2nd to 8th in 2015 and march 28th to april 3rd in 2016 and high demand week fig 6b y d may 18th to 24th in 2015 and july 11th to 17th in 2016 in general in all cases it was observed that the pumping station efficiency was higher with the fixed pressure head fig 6b due to better adaptation of the operating point to the pump characteristics curves the trend indicated above can be shown when the average annual simulated efficiency is compared considering the two complete irrigation seasons with pumping station efficiency for the fixed pressure management higher approximately 8 than the variable pressure management in both irrigation seasons 3 4 energy consumed the results related to the energy consumed at the pumping station fig 7 showed a similar trend to the results obtained for the flow discharge in a low demand week fig 7a y c march 2nd to 8th in 2015 and march 28th to april 3rd in 2016 and high demand week fig 7b y d may 18th to 24th in 2015 and july 11th to 17th in 2016 the energy consumed was higher in 2015 than in 2016 due to the greater proportion of spring crops in 2015 and the higher rainfall volume registered in 2016 which reduced the total irrigation volume supplied by the pumping station for the high demand week it was also observed as occurred for the flow discharges that a high energy was consumed on wednesdays when analysing the distribution of monthly energy consumed in both irrigation seasons fig 8 the highest energy consumption was reached in 2015 fig 8a in this case it can be observed that the energy consumption was concentrated in may representing 38 of the total annual energy consumed in 2016 fig 8b the highest energy consumed was in june with 27 of the total energy consumed for the complete irrigation season for both irrigation seasons the results of the annual energy consumed obtained with the simulations carried out for the different pressure management strategies are shown in table 4 in addition some performance indicators related to the annual energy consumed per unit irrigated area kwh ha 1 and per irrigation water supplied kwh m 3 are shown table 4 also includes data obtained from the actual energy consumed in both irrigation seasons provided by the managers of the irrigable area related to fixed pressure head management regarding fixed pressure head management the simulated energy consumed was higher than for the variable pressure head approximately 9 5 in 2015 and 10 5 in 2016 when analysing the annual energy consumed per unit irrigated area it was highlighted that this indicator in 2016 was lower than in 2015 the higher energy consumption with the fixed pressure head management was related to the use of a constant pressure head of 52 m which in many cases was higher than for the variable pressure head fig 5 although the efficiency was slightly higher than that with variable pressure head fig 6 it is related to the fact that in those days during the irrigation season with low water demand a fixed pressure of 52 m might be too high which does not compensate the efficiency improvement of the pumping system in comparison with the variable pressure head this trend was similar when comparing the energy consumed per irrigation water supplied which was slightly higher for fixed pressure management than for the variable pressure head taking into account that in both simulated cases the annual irrigation water supplied was the same some differences can be highlighted when comparing the simulated results with those of actual energy consumed by the pumping station in both irrigation seasons the actual annual energy consumed was slightly higher than that simulated apart from the fixed pressure head in 2015 which was very similar moreover the actual annual irrigation water applied was approximately 35 and 22 lower than the simulated amounts in 2015 and 2016 respectively which contributed to the explanation that farmers tend to irrigate under the crop water requirements hence the actual energy consumed per unit irrigation water supplied was more than 50 higher than the simulated amount for both fixed and variable pressure heads regarding this indicator the actual annual energy results in 2015 and 2016 were similar to those obtained by moreno et al 2010 during the 2007 and 2008 irrigation seasons with values of 0 36 kw h m 3 and 0 37 kw h m 3 respectively when analysing the same irrigable area according to these results it can be highlighted that the ratio between energy consumed and irrigation water supplied for the actual management was high in comparison with the simulated cases table 4 it was related to the fact that in the simulated results irrigation events were distributed taking into account the energy efficiency at the pumping station reaching high values in most of cases fig 6 with regard to the actual management where farmers irrigated whenever they wanted there was no control about the energy efficiency at the pumping station resulting generally in low efficiency values which increased energy consumed 3 5 energy costs regarding the energy costs the trend was very similar to the energy consumed in this regard table 5 shows the results corresponding to the simulated and actual annual energy costs in the 2015 and 2016 irrigation seasons as well as the indicators related to the energy cost per unit irrigated area ha 1 and irrigation water supplied m 3 for management of both pressure heads in both irrigation seasons as in the case of energy consumption the total annual energy costs for the fixed pressure head was approximately 10 higher than those of the variable pressure head as indicated for the energy consumed the variable pressure head was lower than the fixed pressure head in some irrigation events of the irrigation season which contributed to reduce the energy consumed and its costs when comparing simulated energy costs with the actual costs provided by the managers of the irrigable area the actual energy costs per unit irrigation water supplied were approximately 50 higher than those simulated for the fixed pressure head according to this it can be highlighted that the actual irrigation water supplied was lower than the simulated ones table 4 note that the difference between irrigation water applied by simulation and actual is because of the different irrigation scheduling at each case regarding the actual management it is the actual water applied by the farmers for the simulated case water applied was obtained with the irrigation scheduling following fao methodology in spite of the low level of water actually consumed the actual energy consumed was very similar to the simulated cases this can be explained by the actual management of the irrigable area where farmers decided the irrigation time which can result in low efficiency of the pumping system and consequently of the energy consumed and hence the costs increase these differences show that the use of the simulation tool with a control in the irrigation scheduling on a plot scale where it attempts to distribute the starting times at the hydrant during each irrigation day to minimize energy costs can lead to a more efficient management of the network compared to the current situation in which the farmer establishes the starting irrigation time autonomously 4 conclusions in collective irrigable areas the control of irrigation scheduling on a plot scale along with an analysis of the network performance is necessary to improve the integral management of an irrigation network to perform more efficient management of water and energy use the gredrip tool that was developed portends to be useful as a decision support system tool to manage collective irrigable areas adapt the irrigation network management to the crop distribution and their irrigation water requirements and minimize the energy costs at the pumping station the distribution of open hydrants and starting times of the irrigation events for each case was determined using the gredrip tool which allowed optimization of the flow discharge distribution in the irrigation network guaranteeing adequate flow discharge and pressure to all hydrants which affected the uniformity of irrigation in the plots although regulation using fixed pressure management has energy costs that are 10 higher than the regulation using a variable pressure head this difference would not compensate for implementing variable pressure management given the complexity of managing a variable pressure head in the pumping station for this management it is necessary to determine the most restrictive hydrants at each moment as well as evolution of the real time pressure at each hydrant for which it is necessary to permanently manage the calibrated model of the network the actual irrigation network management which does not consider the energy efficiency at the pumping station showed higher energy consumed and energy costs at the pumping system in comparison with the results using gredrip this fact suggest that it is necessary to improve the technical advisory system for irrigation scheduling at the plot scale and irrigation network management which should be put forward to local water manager base to achieve optimal results hence it is possible to go from an on demand irrigation management system to a restricted arranged operation carried out with centralized management where the manager of the irrigation network satisfies the demand of farmers within a short period of time hence it will have an impact on better management of water and energy in the irrigation networks with minimum energy costs at the pumping station and performance of irrigation scheduling to guarantee crop water requirements the gredrip tool has been developed for on demand irrigation networks whose management is more complex than rotational schedule networks this model allows some restrictions to be included such as limitations on schedules days of irrigation or number of open hydrants per day which can be similar to those limitations for rotational schedule in any event an on demand schedule used in gredrip may be adapted to crop distribution variability and water demand at each phenological stage of the crop even if the farmer wishes to apply a larger or smaller amount of water the proposed tool is considered useful for proper water and energy management in collective irrigation once the crop distribution during the irrigation season is known the main limitation in the developed tool is the need for technical personnel for its use but the personnel costs can be justified in a more global advisory service on crop management and not only in an irrigation network management the centralized management requires farmers to indicate they wish to irrigate and the technician will establish the adequate irrigation time during a 24 h period applying the water volume required by farmers this management allows the technician to carry out irrigation scheduling with mopeco which can help to improve water use efficiency by adapting the irrigation to the crop water requirements even permitting optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi it is highly recommended to monitor the improvements with the use of the proposed model as well as the problems detected during its application

11305,a tool implemented in matlab called gredrip has been developed to simulate the behavior of an on demand irrigation network taking into account crop distributions in an irrigable area it was applied during two complete irrigation seasons 2015 and 2016 for weekly irrigation scheduling this tool portends to be useful as a decision support system tool to manage on demand collective irrigable areas with minimum energy costs at the pumping station and by performing an irrigation schedule to guarantee crop water requirements hence it is possible to go from an on demand irrigation management system to a restricted arranged operation carried out with centralized management where the manager of the irrigation network satisfies the demand of farmers within a short period of time the main novelty of this paper is to show a simulation tool which integrate the energy efficiency of the pumping station taking into account irrigation events distribution according to the crop irrigation scheduling at each plot in this regard this tool respects the irrigation scheduling of farmers and it controls the starting time for each hydrant to minimize the energy cost it was applied considering two types of pressure regulations i e fixed and variable pressure heads the distribution of open hydrants and the starting times of the irrigation events at each case performed by this tool led to optimization of the flow discharge distribution in the irrigation network guaranteeing adequate flow discharge and pressure to all hydrants which affected the uniformity of irrigation in the plot although the regulation using fixed pressure management represented energy costs 10 higher than the regulation using the variable pressure head this difference would not compensate for the implementation of variable pressure management given the complexity of managing a variable pressure head in a pumping station the actual irrigation network management which does not consider the energy efficiency at the pumping station showed higher energy consumed and energy costs at the pumping system in comparison with the results using gredrip this fact suggest that it is necessary to improve the technical advisory system for irrigation scheduling at the plot scale and irrigation network management keywords irrigation network restricted arranged operation irrigation scheduling pumping station energy costss 1 introduction in recent years the modernization of irrigation systems from gravity systems to pressurized systems has led to increased water and land productivity but also to an increase in energy consumption fernández garcía et al 2014a tarjuelo et al 2015 in irrigation societies increased energy costs along with investment costs linked to modernization may put the economic viability of some modernized farms at risk the lack of knowledge on the relationship between water and energy use can lead to increases in energy costs this fact is especially relevant to on demand irrigation networks where inefficient water use as well as significant increases in energy consumption can result even when farmers do not schedule irrigation adequately in these types of irrigation networks typically farmers irrigate whenever they want and this is characterized by irrigation management flexibility lamaddalena and sagardoy 2000 this management is subjected to high variability of flow regimes because it depends on the number of hydrants simultaneously opened which can contribute to low energy efficiency in some of these irrigation networks because the pumping station is not working in designed conditions lamaddalena and pereira 2007 rodríguez díaz et al 2009 according to this it is necessary to use tools to improve the efficiency of these types of pressurized irrigation networks several strategies have been developed to improve water and energy use efficiency in on demand pressurized irrigation networks one of them consists of sectoring and grouping hydrants with similar energy demands jiménez bello et al 2011 carrillo cobo et al 2011 navarro navajas et al 2012 other methodologies are based on detecting and controlling critical points rodríguez díaz et al 2009 2012 which are defined as hydrants with special energy requirements depending on their distance to the pump station or their difference in elevation daccache et al 2010 developed a methodology combining network design and performance analysis of a sprinkler network simulating the interaction between on demand water distribution systems and on farm networks the variation in pumping station efficiency at each combination of flow discharge and pressure head is an important factor to consider in irrigation networks which was not always considered in previous operational studies in those cases a fixed efficiency was considered which might not be representative when the pumping station is working during an irrigation season it is related to the fact that when pumping stations are designed only high discharges are considered to determine the design flow but in most of the cases low and medium discharges are generated moreno et al 2010 and the required pumping head changes occur during the irrigation season pérez urrestarazu and burt 2012 in this regard moreno et al 2007b developed the maeeb model with the aim of analysing the energy efficiency of the pumping stations fernández garcía et al 2014a developed a pumping station model to analyse the performance of pumps for several activation sequences that were applied to study optimum pumping station management for irrigation network sectoring in spain córcoles et al 2016a considered the energy efficiency at each combination of flow discharge and pressure head to develop a methodology to determine the optimum pressure head that minimizes the power needed at the pumping station the aforementioned studies did not consider electricity tariffs and they used an average fixed cost for the energy consumed hence fernández garcía et al 2016 developed a decision making support system to analyse several network operation scenarios considering different energy prices according to the electricity tariff they applied this methodology in sectoring and critical points control in previous studies developed by the same authors fernández garcía et al 2013 fernández garcía et al 2014b córcoles et al 2015 took into account the energy costs for several energy rate periods when developing a methodology to minimize the energy cost of the pumping stations in on demand irrigation networks with the organization of the starting irrigation times for each hydrant khadra et al 2016 analysed energy and hydraulic performance based management of large scale pressurized irrigation systems which analysed the interaction between the irrigation system use and the energy consumption based on to generate demand scenarios according to a random selection of open hydrants few studies have considered the influence of irrigation scheduling at the plot scale on irrigation networks in this regard gonzález perea et al 2016 developed a tool based on optimizing irrigation scheduling using the soil water balance and a genetic algorithm they used a model that establishes the optimal sectoring operation during the irrigation season and focused on the simultaneous optimization of irrigation scheduling at the plot scale considering water demand at a hydrant level and energy consumption at the pumping station in southern spain they determined daily irrigation needs during the peak demand period most of these studies focused on analysing the performance of irrigation networks in a peak period with maximum crop water requirements likewise other studies are based on creating demand scenarios using methodologies to define the probability of open hydrants moreno et al 2007a and considering a random selection of open hydrants none of the above mentioned methodologies considered crop water requirements over a complete irrigation season the aim of this paper is to present a matlab tool called gredrip this tool can be useful to compare irrigation network behavior under several irrigation strategies which is analysed in the part ii of this work focused on the economic impact of regulated deficit irrigation in irrigation networks the main novelty of gredrip is that it considers several aspects in one tool it combines the hydraulic and energy behavior of the irrigation network considering the well known variability of the energy efficiency in a pumping station and the electricity tariffs depending on the period along with irrigation scheduling and crop water requirements in the plots during the whole irrigation season low and peak water demand this tool is not based on a probability of open hydrants and simulates the behavior of an on demand irrigation network taking into account the actual crop distribution in the irrigable area and the actual irrigation scheduling in the plots likewise gredrip respects the irrigation scheduling of farmers and it controls the starting time combinations at each plot which minimizes energy costs the main contribution of this research is to set up a model that enables a centralized management of the irrigation network minimizing the energy costs while considering the irrigation scheduling at farm level in this regard it is possible to go from an on demand irrigation management system to a restricted arranged operation 2 material and methods 2 1 irrigation network the gredrip model was applied to the irrigation network named soreta in the province of albacete in the castilla la mancha region spain fig 1 during two complete irrigation seasons 2015 and 2016 for weekly irrigation scheduling which is the common management of irrigation used by farmers this was an on demand irrigation network that covered an irrigable area of 550 ha with 323 hydrants it used ground water resources pumped from four boreholes to a reservoir 23 000 m3 using submerged pumps installed at 150 m in depth with absorbed power from 139 kw to 330 kw depending on the extracted flow discharge a pumping station composed of 9 pumps 140 hp one of them with variable frequency speed drive and the rest with soft starters delivered water to the irrigation network the pumping station was managed with a fixed pressure head of 52 m to guarantee 35 m at each open hydrant for a sprinkler and drip irrigation system at a plot scale which represented 65 and 35 of the irrigated area respectively the most common are permanent sprinkler irrigation systems with 17 m 17 m spacing two nozzles of 4 4 2 8 mm or one nozzle of 5 2 mm and a drip irrigation system with self compensating emitters of 4 l h 1 lateral spacing of 0 75 m and 3 m between laterals which is typical of the vineyard crop which is one of the most relevant crops in the irrigable area the crop distribution in both irrigation seasons is indicated in table 1 the irrigable area was distributed into several plots whose sizes ranged from 1 ha to 11 ha the number of sectors per plot depended on its size table 2 approximately 80 of the plots had an area lower than 2 ha each plot had a hydrant that allowed remote opening and closing of the valves controlled by an automation system from a central computer each hydrant of the irrigation network had a flow limiter to regulate the water discharge to a constant value for any pressure higher than 35 m thus in the modelling process a constant discharge was considered at each hydrant the contract with the electric company had six energy rate periods p1 to p6 with different electricity pricing table 3 soreta was managed under on demand operation where farmers could irrigate whatever they wanted however all the irrigation events were meant to be carried out only during the cheaper energy rate period p6 for the entire irrigation season this energy rate period was maintained at 24 h for the weekend and 8 h from 12 a m to 8 a m during the weekdays except for august in which all days were included in p6 2 2 data acquisition the irrigation network was implemented in epanet software rossman 2001 fig 2 information about pipe diameters and the network layout was obtained using the database of the irrigable area moreover the measured data were obtained to ensure that the information about the pumping station and the network model was accurate the roughness coefficients of the pipes were estimated based on the previous works performed by the authors in this network moreno et al 2008 córcoles et al 2016a and adjusted using epanet at each node of the irrigation network information about the crop distribution was obtained in the field hydraulic and electric data were also measured following the proposed methodology of córcoles et al 2010 hence an ultrasound flow meter was used to measure the flow discharge at each pump of the pumping station the pressure was monitored using pressure transducers collecting data at 1 minute time intervals one pressure transducer was installed at the exit of the pumping station and three additional pressure transducers were installed at specific points distributed along the irrigation network according to córcoles et al 2016b the electrical parameters of the pumps current voltage and absorbed power were measured with a portable electrical network analyser this information was used to check that the behavior of each pump of the pumping station was similar to the theoretical characteristic curves considering hydraulic power nh 9 81 q h in kw with q in m3 s 1 and h in m and the absorbed power nabs in kw measured with the electrical network analyser the global efficiency η in was computed using eq 1 this efficiency included pump efficiency motor efficiency electrical conductors electronic starter or variable speed drive efficiency and the performance of the wiring and possible volumetric losses in the connection of the pump with the discharge pipe 1 η n h n a b s 100 where η is the global efficiency nh is the hydraulic power kw and nab s is the absorbed power kw in both irrigation seasons 2015 and 2016 the previous information was completed with the actual energy consumed obtained from the invoices kw h of the pumping station provided by the managers of the irrigable area to control the quality of irrigation in some selected plots evaluations of the on farm irrigation system were carried out in both irrigation seasons plots irrigated with the sprinkler irrigation system were evaluated following the methodology of merriam and keller 1978 and iso standards 7749 2 1990 iso 15886 3 2012 and asae standard asae s330 1 1985 the coefficient of uniformity cu christiansen 1942 uniformity of distribution ud and the proportion of water reaching the surface soil pe were calculated in plots irrigated with the drip irrigation system evaluations were developed using keller and karmeli 1974 methodology in this case the emission uniformity eu the flow coefficient of variation cvq bralts and kesner 1983 the statistical emission uniformity uee and the pressure coefficient of variation cvp bralts et al 1987 were calculated in the plots indicated above crop monitoring was carried out once per week following the biologische bundesarstalt bundessoztenamt and chemical bbch scale bleiholder et al 2001 the dynamic water demand of different crops in different growth period has been considered in the irrigation scheduling calculated with mopeco model this model domínguez et al 2012 is based on the food and agriculture organization fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 using the simplified water balance in the root depth method it considers water inlets irrigation precipitation and root growth and outlets percolation and evapotranspiration rainfall was monitored using a rain gage located at the field site and effective rainfall was estimated with the usda methodology using curve number 2 scs 1972 nrcs 2004 for each crop daily maximum evapotranspiration etm was calculated as the product of the crop coefficient kc dimensionless and the reference evapotranspiration eto mm allen et al 1998 daily eto was calculated with the fao penman monteith equation and the climatic data were obtained daily from the la gineta albacete weather station utm coordinates x 585 237 y 432 8310 altitude 722 msnm above sea level installation date 9 29 2000 this is located 15 km from the irrigable area in a large level area with uniform vegetation finally according to the characteristics of the soil irrigation system and the irrigation management the days of the week with irrigation events and water irrigation applied at each one were determined to guarantee crop water requirements 2 3 model description the gredrip tool was developed in matlab pratap 2010 in combination with the epanet toolkit rossman 2001 the proposed tool allowed the distribution of open hydrants during each week of the complete irrigation season defining the starting time for irrigation daily at each open hydrant the flowchart of the proposed methodology is included in fig 3 2 3 1 weekly distribution of open hydrants the gredrip tool performs weekly simulations which is the most common management of irrigation by the farmers using on demand irrigation networks the simulations were based on determining the minimum energy costs at the pumping station for each irrigation day the first step is to compute the irrigation schedule and crop water requirements for each crop which allows determining the irrigation time required at each hydrant for each crop a weekly irrigation schedule was established from which the number of hydrants that were opened each week was known the next step is to distribute the open hydrants in the corresponding week for this all hydrants that needed to be used that week were open during the weekend and depending on the number of irrigation events that each hydrant must perform during the week they could be open during the rest of the days of the week thus if the corresponding plot only required one irrigation event per week irrigation interval ir 7 days it was established as a criterion that the plot was irrigated during the weekend in the case of crops requiring two weekly irrigation events ir 3 5 days one irrigation was applied during the weekend period and the other during one day of the rest of the week in plots with higher demand for which three irrigation events were performed during the week ir 2 3 days one was during the weekend and the other two during the week for this management and coinciding with what farmers do a maximum time of irrigation tr of 4 h was set which may be lowered to adapt to the needs of the crop at any time according to this it is important to take into account that soils of the irrigable area had a depth less than 0 5 m and there were only 8 h of operating time ot for a day of the week for the weekend the ot was 24 h most of the plots have several irrigation sectors which makes it necessary to satisfy the demand of each one of them in this study it has been considered that each sector is irrigated independently and consecutively never irrigating several sectors of one plot at the same time thus the duration of the irrigation event at each plot was calculated using eq 2 2 d r n s t r where dr is the duration of the irrigation event ns is the number of sectors of the plot and tr is the irrigation time of one sector in the case of plots with several sectors to be irrigated more than once a week when dr ot all the sectors are irrigated on the same day consecutively if dr ot the sectors were irrigated on consecutive days 2 3 2 daily distribution of open hydrants to distribute open hydrants on different days of the week monday to friday the starting time of irrigation at each plot during the weekend saturday and sunday was taken as a reference therefore considering the irrigation time required and the number of irrigations events per week the most adequate day to irrigate was established to determine the starting time at each plot during the weekend 5 000 randomized scenarios for the starting time of open hydrants were generated taking into account that the duration of the irrigation event tr could not exceed the time of completion of the operating time ot this number of scenarios was highly accurate obtaining similar results when a higher number of scenarios 10 000 20 000 50 000 and 100 000 were used hence if a plot needed 4 h of irrigation and the available ot was 8 h between 0 a m to 8 a m assuming a week day the time limit for starting irrigation was 4 a m the available interval of time was divided into 15 minute intervals to define the time when a hydrant could be operating at each generated simulation the flow discharge in the inlet of the irrigation network was calculated using epanet software which represents the flow discharge that must be supplied by the pumping station at each irrigation time interval to obtain this it is necessary to know the flow discharge at each hydrant assuming that all sectors in a plot have the same size the flow discharge at each hydrant is calculated by eq 3 3 q t a p m 3600 where qt is the flow discharge at the hydrant l s 1 a is the surface per sector m2 and pm is the average application rate l m 2 h 1 the pm values were obtained from the data measured during the evaluations of the irrigation systems obtaining average values of 6 3 l m 2 h 1 and 1 8 l m 2 h 1 for plots with sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation respectively in addition in each simulation the pressure head was determined depending on the pressure head management strategy considered in this paper two management strategies were analysed one strategy was similar to the current strategy followed by management of the irrigable area using a constant pressure of 52 m in the head of the network which coincided with the measured pressure by the pressure transducer installed at the pumping station 51 5 m in 2015 and 51 7 m in 2016 the second strategy considered variable pressure in the head of the network to guarantee a minimum pressure of 35 m at the most restrictive hydrant at each scenario the energy consumption and cost at the pumping station were calculated for this aim it was necessary to obtain the performance of the pumping station at each combination of flow discharge and pressure head it was obtained using a model implemented in matlab that considered the characteristic pressure head and efficiency curves of the pumps fernández garcía et al 2014a for pressure head intervals of 1 m and a flow discharge of 25 l min 1 hence those characteristics curves resulted in a matrix of three variables and the efficiency was obtained at each combination of pressure head and flow discharge the input data for this model were the number of fixed and variable speed pumps pump characteristic curves motor efficiency working range of the pressure heads and flow discharge thus by knowing the operating points of the fixed pumps and using the affinity laws for variable speed pumps it was possible to determine the pumping station efficiency at each flow discharge demanded by the irrigation network the next step was to calculate the energy consumption and its costs at each scenario at the weekend for each scenario with the flow discharge and the pressure head at the inlet of the irrigation network along with the pumping station efficiency the energy consumed was calculated for that scenario the energy costs were computed using the energy cost depending on the energy rate period table 3 finally after 5 000 randomized scenarios for the starting time of open hydrants the scenario that minimized the energy costs at the pumping station during the weekend was selected once it was determined the open hydrants distribution for the remaining days of the week was carried out determining the starting time that minimized the energy cost at the pumping station per day according to the open hydrants at each one following the aforementioned procedure the main parameters included in the gredrip model which determined the energy consumption and its cost are the following crop distribution and location which were set at each irrigation season by farmers this determined crop water demand and the irrigation scheduling pressure head which was calculated by the model to guarantee a minimum pressure at the most restrictive hydrant it may be defined as a fixed pressure head to simplify the irrigation network management equivalent roughness of the pipes which takes into account the local losses in the network this was fixed during the calibration of the irrigation network process efficiency of the pumping station at each operating point this depended on the measured data at the pumping system such as absorbed power pressure head and flow discharge electricity tariffs which depended on the energy prices regarding these parameters it was considered unnecessary to carry out a sensitivity analysis on the pumping station performance which will change with the aging of pumps or the electricity tariffs prices because the other parameters can be considered fixed such as the roughness coefficient or conditioned by the crop distribution although any change in the parameters mentioned would influence the energy cost of the pumping station the gredrip model is able to minimize the energy consumed and its cost for any given condition in this study the values of the measured parameters of the irrigable area were used to compare the simulated results with the actual energy consumption and its cost according to the management carried out by the farmers 3 results and discussion the obtained results were related to the corresponding scenario that minimized the energy costs at the pumping station several periods of time weekly monthly and annual were considered to analyse the most relevant variables such as flow discharge pressure head efficiency at the pumping system energy consumed and energy costs 3 1 flow discharge distribution in this section we analyse the flow discharge at the inlet of the irrigation network obtained with the gredrip model for 2015 and 2016 irrigation seasons for fixed and variable pressure heads and considering two demand periods low and high of the irrigation season fig 4 shows the flow discharge distribution for a low demand week march 2nd to 8th in 2015 and march 28th to april 3rd in 2016 fig 4a y c and another week with high demand fig 4b y d may 18th to 24th in 2015 and july 11th to 17th in 2016 considering fixed and variable pressure heads in 2015 the maximum flow discharges at the inlet of the irrigation network ranged from 381 l s 1 fig 4a and 1045 l s 1 fig 4b for low and high demand periods respectively and ranged from 274 l s 1 fig 4c and 657 l s 1 fig 4d in 2016 these differences can be explained by the greater proportion of spring crops barley wheat peas and garlic in 2015 which concentrated the irrigation events in may in none of the simulated scenarios was the maximum theoretical flow discharge that could be delivered by the pumping station exceeded in all cases it can be highlighted that for a weekend ot 48 h the flow discharge distribution was similar to a normal distribution because of the randomness of the starting time of open hydrants generated by the simulation tool for the high demand week fig 4b and d the peak flow discharge occurred for a weekday wednesday this fact is related to the limited ot 8 h per day which led to a higher concentration of open hydrants in a shorter period of time compared to the weekend ot 24 h per day 3 2 pressure head fig 5 shows the evolution of the simulated variable and fixed 52 m pressure heads during two times of peak demand periods corresponding to may 2015 fig 5a and june 2016 fig 5b along with the actual measured pressure heads in the 2015 irrigation season it was highlighted that for variable pressure head management the pressure requirements only exceeded the fixed pressure head value on some days in the 2016 irrigation season fig 5b the trend was very similar although with slightly lower values in comparison to 2015 the actual measured pressure was close to 52 m although it was decreased in some periods reaching values ranging from 39 m to 52 5 m regarding a low demand period in 2015 fig 5c and 2016 fig 5d the actual pressures measured showed similar values to the fixed pressure heads more differences were obtained for the variable pressure heads with average values approximately 20 lower than the fixed pressure heads for both irrigation seasons the pressure head behavior for the simulated cases was different to the actual irrigation network management in this case during the peak water demand period may in 2015 and july in 2016 high concentration of flow discharges were reached resulting in pressure head drops it was related to several factors detected such as high number of open hydrants simultaneously high presence of crops with high irrigation water requirements as well as failures detected in two pumps of the pumping station in this regard moreno et al 2008 in the same area in the year of 2004 had already detected eventual pressure drops in the system due to the period of high water demand and concentration of open hydrants the current fixed pressure head value used in the irrigable area 52 m may be adequate even in the peak demand period in other periods such as the low demand period the fixed pressure head value might be reduced although it would require direct action on the regulation depending on the expected flow demand which might significantly complicate the network management with regard to the pressure of the specific points distributed along the irrigation network both simulated and measured pressure values showed a similar behavior to the pressure in the head of the network although the pressure drop in the farthest hydrant from the pumping head was more relevant thus a pressure drop in the head of the network of approximately 5 could cause a pressure drop in the hydrant that is close to 14 3 3 efficiency of the pumping system fig 6 shows the daily average efficiency of the pumping station for simulations carried out in 2015 and 2016 for a low demand week fig 6a y c march 2nd to 8th in 2015 and march 28th to april 3rd in 2016 and high demand week fig 6b y d may 18th to 24th in 2015 and july 11th to 17th in 2016 in general in all cases it was observed that the pumping station efficiency was higher with the fixed pressure head fig 6b due to better adaptation of the operating point to the pump characteristics curves the trend indicated above can be shown when the average annual simulated efficiency is compared considering the two complete irrigation seasons with pumping station efficiency for the fixed pressure management higher approximately 8 than the variable pressure management in both irrigation seasons 3 4 energy consumed the results related to the energy consumed at the pumping station fig 7 showed a similar trend to the results obtained for the flow discharge in a low demand week fig 7a y c march 2nd to 8th in 2015 and march 28th to april 3rd in 2016 and high demand week fig 7b y d may 18th to 24th in 2015 and july 11th to 17th in 2016 the energy consumed was higher in 2015 than in 2016 due to the greater proportion of spring crops in 2015 and the higher rainfall volume registered in 2016 which reduced the total irrigation volume supplied by the pumping station for the high demand week it was also observed as occurred for the flow discharges that a high energy was consumed on wednesdays when analysing the distribution of monthly energy consumed in both irrigation seasons fig 8 the highest energy consumption was reached in 2015 fig 8a in this case it can be observed that the energy consumption was concentrated in may representing 38 of the total annual energy consumed in 2016 fig 8b the highest energy consumed was in june with 27 of the total energy consumed for the complete irrigation season for both irrigation seasons the results of the annual energy consumed obtained with the simulations carried out for the different pressure management strategies are shown in table 4 in addition some performance indicators related to the annual energy consumed per unit irrigated area kwh ha 1 and per irrigation water supplied kwh m 3 are shown table 4 also includes data obtained from the actual energy consumed in both irrigation seasons provided by the managers of the irrigable area related to fixed pressure head management regarding fixed pressure head management the simulated energy consumed was higher than for the variable pressure head approximately 9 5 in 2015 and 10 5 in 2016 when analysing the annual energy consumed per unit irrigated area it was highlighted that this indicator in 2016 was lower than in 2015 the higher energy consumption with the fixed pressure head management was related to the use of a constant pressure head of 52 m which in many cases was higher than for the variable pressure head fig 5 although the efficiency was slightly higher than that with variable pressure head fig 6 it is related to the fact that in those days during the irrigation season with low water demand a fixed pressure of 52 m might be too high which does not compensate the efficiency improvement of the pumping system in comparison with the variable pressure head this trend was similar when comparing the energy consumed per irrigation water supplied which was slightly higher for fixed pressure management than for the variable pressure head taking into account that in both simulated cases the annual irrigation water supplied was the same some differences can be highlighted when comparing the simulated results with those of actual energy consumed by the pumping station in both irrigation seasons the actual annual energy consumed was slightly higher than that simulated apart from the fixed pressure head in 2015 which was very similar moreover the actual annual irrigation water applied was approximately 35 and 22 lower than the simulated amounts in 2015 and 2016 respectively which contributed to the explanation that farmers tend to irrigate under the crop water requirements hence the actual energy consumed per unit irrigation water supplied was more than 50 higher than the simulated amount for both fixed and variable pressure heads regarding this indicator the actual annual energy results in 2015 and 2016 were similar to those obtained by moreno et al 2010 during the 2007 and 2008 irrigation seasons with values of 0 36 kw h m 3 and 0 37 kw h m 3 respectively when analysing the same irrigable area according to these results it can be highlighted that the ratio between energy consumed and irrigation water supplied for the actual management was high in comparison with the simulated cases table 4 it was related to the fact that in the simulated results irrigation events were distributed taking into account the energy efficiency at the pumping station reaching high values in most of cases fig 6 with regard to the actual management where farmers irrigated whenever they wanted there was no control about the energy efficiency at the pumping station resulting generally in low efficiency values which increased energy consumed 3 5 energy costs regarding the energy costs the trend was very similar to the energy consumed in this regard table 5 shows the results corresponding to the simulated and actual annual energy costs in the 2015 and 2016 irrigation seasons as well as the indicators related to the energy cost per unit irrigated area ha 1 and irrigation water supplied m 3 for management of both pressure heads in both irrigation seasons as in the case of energy consumption the total annual energy costs for the fixed pressure head was approximately 10 higher than those of the variable pressure head as indicated for the energy consumed the variable pressure head was lower than the fixed pressure head in some irrigation events of the irrigation season which contributed to reduce the energy consumed and its costs when comparing simulated energy costs with the actual costs provided by the managers of the irrigable area the actual energy costs per unit irrigation water supplied were approximately 50 higher than those simulated for the fixed pressure head according to this it can be highlighted that the actual irrigation water supplied was lower than the simulated ones table 4 note that the difference between irrigation water applied by simulation and actual is because of the different irrigation scheduling at each case regarding the actual management it is the actual water applied by the farmers for the simulated case water applied was obtained with the irrigation scheduling following fao methodology in spite of the low level of water actually consumed the actual energy consumed was very similar to the simulated cases this can be explained by the actual management of the irrigable area where farmers decided the irrigation time which can result in low efficiency of the pumping system and consequently of the energy consumed and hence the costs increase these differences show that the use of the simulation tool with a control in the irrigation scheduling on a plot scale where it attempts to distribute the starting times at the hydrant during each irrigation day to minimize energy costs can lead to a more efficient management of the network compared to the current situation in which the farmer establishes the starting irrigation time autonomously 4 conclusions in collective irrigable areas the control of irrigation scheduling on a plot scale along with an analysis of the network performance is necessary to improve the integral management of an irrigation network to perform more efficient management of water and energy use the gredrip tool that was developed portends to be useful as a decision support system tool to manage collective irrigable areas adapt the irrigation network management to the crop distribution and their irrigation water requirements and minimize the energy costs at the pumping station the distribution of open hydrants and starting times of the irrigation events for each case was determined using the gredrip tool which allowed optimization of the flow discharge distribution in the irrigation network guaranteeing adequate flow discharge and pressure to all hydrants which affected the uniformity of irrigation in the plots although regulation using fixed pressure management has energy costs that are 10 higher than the regulation using a variable pressure head this difference would not compensate for implementing variable pressure management given the complexity of managing a variable pressure head in the pumping station for this management it is necessary to determine the most restrictive hydrants at each moment as well as evolution of the real time pressure at each hydrant for which it is necessary to permanently manage the calibrated model of the network the actual irrigation network management which does not consider the energy efficiency at the pumping station showed higher energy consumed and energy costs at the pumping system in comparison with the results using gredrip this fact suggest that it is necessary to improve the technical advisory system for irrigation scheduling at the plot scale and irrigation network management which should be put forward to local water manager base to achieve optimal results hence it is possible to go from an on demand irrigation management system to a restricted arranged operation carried out with centralized management where the manager of the irrigation network satisfies the demand of farmers within a short period of time hence it will have an impact on better management of water and energy in the irrigation networks with minimum energy costs at the pumping station and performance of irrigation scheduling to guarantee crop water requirements the gredrip tool has been developed for on demand irrigation networks whose management is more complex than rotational schedule networks this model allows some restrictions to be included such as limitations on schedules days of irrigation or number of open hydrants per day which can be similar to those limitations for rotational schedule in any event an on demand schedule used in gredrip may be adapted to crop distribution variability and water demand at each phenological stage of the crop even if the farmer wishes to apply a larger or smaller amount of water the proposed tool is considered useful for proper water and energy management in collective irrigation once the crop distribution during the irrigation season is known the main limitation in the developed tool is the need for technical personnel for its use but the personnel costs can be justified in a more global advisory service on crop management and not only in an irrigation network management the centralized management requires farmers to indicate they wish to irrigate and the technician will establish the adequate irrigation time during a 24 h period applying the water volume required by farmers this management allows the technician to carry out irrigation scheduling with mopeco which can help to improve water use efficiency by adapting the irrigation to the crop water requirements even permitting optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi it is highly recommended to monitor the improvements with the use of the proposed model as well as the problems detected during its application

11306,estimating reference evapotranspiration et0 is a fundamental requirement of agricultural water management the fao penman monteith fao pm equation has been used as the standard for et0 estimation however the lack of necessary meteorological data makes it difficult to estimate spatially distributed et0 using the fao pm method in the wider ungauged areas in this study the aim is to explore the methodology for estimating reference evapotranspiration based on remote sensing data in this method remote sensing data are combined with machine learning algorithms to establish a model for spatially distributed et0 estimation three machine learning algorithms were tested including support vector machine svm back propagation neural network bp and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis results showed this method had good ability in estimating et0 application of the method in northwest china indicated that the land surface temperature lst can be used to accurately estimate et0 with high correlation coefficients r2 of 0 897 0 915 the surface reflectance has potential for estimating et0 with lst and can slightly improve model accuracy based on lst evaluation showed lst was more essential than surface reflectance and the model only based on lst had satisfactory performance this method could be applicability in worldwide with available remote sensing and meteorological data due to the relationship between lst and et0 keywords reference evapotranspiration modis machine learning northwest china 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration et0 is a major research area of both hydrology and water resources management valipour 2015 especially in irrigation agriculture et0 is defined as an evapotranspiration rate from a hypothetical reference surface that was specific characteristics the aim is to determine a specific evapotranspiration demand depending on the atmosphere instead of crop type development and management practices allen et al 1998 the most direct and important application of et0 is in the field of irrigation et0 is the key parameter used to calculate crop evapotranspiration under field conditions many studies have shown that a detailed and rational irrigation system can improve irrigation water efficiency kang et al 2002 cifre et al 2005 du et al 2010 the prerequisite for estimating the optimal water requirement of a crop is to establish a relationship between climatic conditions and evapotranspiration maeda et al 2011 it is generally achieved by multiplying the et0 with a crop coefficient kc which is specific to a particular crop during a certain growth period such as sowing mid season and harvest strong et al 2017 therefore the accuracy of evapotranspiration estimation is the basis of efficient irrigation systems in past decades a variety of approaches have been developed for calculating et0 based on simulating fundamental physical principles such as energy balance and mass transfer maeda et al 2011 since allen et al 1998 established the first version of fao 56 with the penman monteith equation fao pm fao pm became a standard for calculating reference evapotranspiration jabloun and sahli 2008 sentelhas et al 2010 djaman et al 2015 fao pm has also been widely used due to its satisfactory results under various climate conditions around the world garcia et al 2004 cai et al 2007 bodner et al 2007 liu and luo 2010 however application of fao pm remains inconvenient because it requires a large amount of meteorological data hobbins 2016 gavilán et al 2006 which originates from standard metrological observation stations reportedly the number and distribution of metrological stations depends on national or local economic development and the establishment of meteorological observation networks and national data access policies hijmans et al 2005 the fao pm method requires air temperature wind speed relative humidity solar radiation etc however observations of these parameters at meteorological stations are limited in developing countries droogers and allen 2002 even if there is a meteorological station in a specific area the data collected may be insufficient to represent the regional value of et0 due to terrain complexity as a result the optimal status of irrigation management in such areas is difficult to achieve increasing the risk of water shortages and water conflicts maeda et al 2011 to overcome the existing limits of the fao pm model various attempts aiming to estimate et0 with limited observed data have been conducted a large number of studies have focused on estimating et0 using limited ground data in those studies a number of methods such as the hargreaves and samani equation priestley taylor equation and thornthwaite equation were produced for estimating et0 jabloun and sahli 2008 sentelhas et al 2010 djaman et al 2015 tomas burguera et al 2017 the results of these studies showed that these equations which were based on limited meteorological data could be used for reference evapotranspiration estimation where reasonable correlation coefficient and root mean square error values could be obtained however the diversity of methods can achieve vastly different accuracies in specific regions djaman et al 2015 which results in a large basis for improper equations in addition simple equations are more likely to misestimate and thus adjustment of the method coefficient and selection must be carefully conducted before application in addition to the improvements in et0 equations based on reducing the dependency of climatic data artificial intelligence approaches were also introduced to develop et0 models in a new pattern shiri et al 2012 set up an et0 model with limited meteorological data through a genetic programming approach in the basque country and attained good model performance falamarzi et al 2014 proposed an et0 model based on only temperature and wind speed data using artificial and wavelet neural networks in australia which were successful in modelling et0 feng et al 2016 compared the extreme learning machine elm artificial neural networks optimized by genetic algorithm gann wavelet neural networks wnn and empirical models in et0 estimation using few meteorological data and the results showed that the elm and gann models achieved acceptable levels of accuracy furthermore efforts have been aimed at overcoming the shortcomings of a lack of meteorological stations and thus a number of valuable approaches use remote sensing data to estimate et0 rather than meteorological data maeda et al 2011 used modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer lst to replace the atmospheric temperature in temperature based et0 models and achieved a correlation coefficient of 0 67 alipour et al 2014 compared m5 model tree and artificial neural network ann for estimating et0 using modis products and the coefficient of determination values of the ann and m5 tree models were over 0 79 and 0 80 respectively based on remote sensing data several algorithms were also developed to estimate the actual evapotranspiration combined with meteorological data such as sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 s sebi roerink et al 2000 sebs su 2002 metric allen et al 2007 ttme long and singh 2012 and redraw feng and wang 2013 those studies also hint at the availability of remote sensing data in modelling et0 in this study we aimed to 1 use machine learning algorithms to establish a model for estimating spatially distributed reference evapotranspiration 2 study the ways in which accessible remote sensing data can be introduced into the et0 estimation model 3 evaluate the accuracy of proposed et0 estimation models based on different combinations of remote sensing data and 4 analyse model applicability and limitations remote sensing data were retrieved from modis which was validated over a large range of land surface conditions and satisfactorily used in scientific studies the meteorological data used were from nine sparsely distributed national meteorological stations and two eco hydrological monitoring stations in northwest china were used 2 materials and methodology 2 1 materials and availability fao pm based et0 estimation depends on the parameters of solar radiation minimum maximum and mean air temperature relative humidity and wind speed as shown in eq 1 these parameters originate from meteorological station observations which are equipped to measure these parameters meteorological station observed data has the advantages of long term and high time resolution however establishing and maintaining these stations is costly thus the station distribution depends on population and economic conditions which are usually inadequate satellite observations have been an essential method for monitoring land surface conditions these observations have the advantages of wide coverage and providing accessible data for the regions lacking land observations frequently used remote sensing products such as modis and landsat could be easily accessed on their respective websites although remote sensing data has the disadvantages of a lower temporal resolution than meteorological station data the daily datasets from modis could be applied for et0 estimations modis produced lst data and surface reflectance data are available daily and easy to access in this study limited meteorological data were used to calibrate and validate the new et0 estimation equation which is based on modis data 2 2 modeling structure and approach 2 2 1 modelling structure the remote sensing based et0 model is designed to select the possible accessible data from remote sensing datasets to determine a relationship between the remote sensing data and et0 calculated by fao pm using machine learning algorithms the structure of the model is shown in fig 1 remote sensing data is spatially distributed information which expresses land surface features in raster format remote sensing data is utilized as input in both training and validation sets several kinds of remote sensing data were selected from modis to establish the et0 estimation model similar to the studies by maeda et al 2011 and alipour et al 2014 in this study a wider variety of remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms were analysed to determine better relationships between remote sensing data and et0 normally the meteorological data are point based as the standard of meteorological data based et0 estimation the fao pm is expressed as follows and is used to train the remote sensing based et0 estimation models as output datasets of the training set 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 rn is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the ground heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es is the saturation vapour pressure kpa ea is the actual vapour pressure kpa δ is the slope vapour pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the remote sensing data in the training set includes accessible lst data and surface reflectance data which were retrieved from the point with the same geographical location as the ground meteorological station thus the remote sensing and meteorological data match each other and there is a one to one correspondence between the remote sensing and meteorological data the input and output datasets of the training set are prepared and machine learning is conducted to establish a remote sensing based et0 estimation model machine learning may be used to determine the relationship between the output and input data which can be implicitly illustrated as follows 2 e t 0 r s f x 1 x 2 x 3 x n where e t 0 r s is the output data representing the et0 calculated by remote sensing data and x1 x2 x3 xn are the input data representing different remote sensing data in the study region after training validation was conducted to verify the model accuracy in this study the input data in the validation are also from modis and are the same type as the training set but in a different location the output datasets of the validation set are obtained from two eco hydrological monitoring stations the eco hydrological monitoring stations were established and funded by the nsfc national natural science foundation of china and state key s t support programme project located in the study area the data observed at the eco hydrological monitoring stations were used to calculate the et0 with the fao pm formula the et0 calculated with the observed data from the eco hydrological monitoring stations and remote sensing data from modis are used as corresponding output and input data respectively in the validation if the validation verifies that the model is reliable then the model can be used to estimate the spatially distributed et0 with the remote sensing data 2 2 2 modeling approach three machine learning algorithms were introduced to train the et0 models including support vector machine svm back propagation neural network bp and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis svm was proposed by cortes and vapnik 1995 and has been effectively used for classification regression and other learning tasks cherkassky and ma 2004 shalev shwartz et al 2007 chang and lin 2011 svm is good at improving generalization ability svm has globally optimal solution and high training efficiency which makes the svm more robust efficient and reliable hipni et al 2013 libsvm a kind of svm software proposed in 2011 as a library for support vector machines is used in this study chang and lin 2011 and the flowchart is shown in fig 2 bp is a type of ann which is used to develop a map of the input and output variables to produce output as the input datasets are entered singh et al 2009 the bp neural network transmits information in a forward direction gong et al 2016 and uses the back propagation of the error gradient fig 3 shows the bp flowchart in this study two layer feed forward neural networks with back propagation learning were constructed anfis was first presented by jang 1993 anfis is a combination of adaptive networks and a fuzzy inference system since anfis integrates both adaptive networks and a fuzzy inference system obtaining the benefits of both in one single framework is possible anfis has been widely used in hydrology and water resource management including reservoir operations chang and chang 2001 valizadeh and el shafie 2013 groundwater level prediction shirmohammadi et al 2013 and daily pan evaporation estimation shiri et al 2011 the typical structure of anfis is shown in fig 4 this system has two inputs x1 and x2 and one output y the rules of anfis can be expressed as follows rule 1 if x 1 is a 1 and x 2 is b 1 then y p 1 x 1 q 1 x 2 r 1 rule 2 if x 1 is a 2 and x 2 is b 2 then y p 2 x 1 q 2 x 2 r 2 2 3 performance of evaluation indexes statistical indexes are usually used to quantitatively evaluate model performances the following statistical indexes are introduced in this study to evaluate the performance of the models established through machine learning these indexes are root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient cc relative bias bias mean absolute error mae and mean error me 3 r

the observed et0 3 study area and data sources 3 1 study area the study area is the shule river basin which is one of the three largest inland rivers in the hexi corridor in northwest china the range of geographical coordinates is between 38 2 42 8 n 93 4 99 0 e with elevations ranging from 935 m to 5615 m above sea level fig 5 the area includes oasis and desert and the primary land use types include barren sparse vegetation shrub crop urban built up etc the average annual air temperature varies from approximately 6 9 c to 9 3 c and the average annual precipitation varies from 36 mm to 62 mm with great seasonal differences this area is an ecologically fragile region which is characterized by low and irregular rainfall high temperatures and evaporation and notable drought periods ma et al 2005 water resources in the study area mainly come from mountain precipitation and glacial melt water and water resources were scarce due to rapid population development recently the lack of water resources in the study region highlighted the importance of the reasonable water consumption law with the rapid social and economic development and an increase in the human demand for water resources there is a series of ecological and environmental problems in the shule river basin such as the shortage of surface water resources and decline in the groundwater level due to overexploitation of groundwater resources however essential et0 estimation in irrigation is challenged by sparse meteorological stations which hardly provide adequate data for reference evapotranspiration calculation a lack of metrological data challenges the reliable estimation of cultivated land water demand and regional water consumption 3 2 data sources the data used in this study include modis remote sensing data meteorological station data from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn and eco hydrological monitoring station which were established by the state key lab of hydroscience and engineering of tsinghua university china eco hydrological monitoring stations used in this study observe all of the same items as standard meteorological stations as well as additional professional items meteorological data is used to calculate et0 with fao pm as the output data in the training dataset while et0 calculated from eco hydrological stations was used as output data in validation dataset it is also allowed to mix the data from meteorological stations and eco hydrological monitoring stations because the function of eco hydrological monitoring stations is to provide more meteorological data in study region however due to the special location of the eco hydrological monitoring stations we selected these stations for the validation dataset to enable a more comprehensive analysis remote sensing data from modis were used as input data in both training and validation datasets lst data and surface reflectance data are used to evaluated the applicability for estimating et0 based on machine learning models 3 2 1 remote sensing data the remote sensing data used in this study is lst and surface reflectance data from modis which was launched by nasa in 1998 and provides a new and improved capability for terrestrial satellite remote sensing aimed at land ocean and atmospheric research needs justice et al 1998 lst is one of the key parameters in land surface processes physics wan and li 1997 multiple daily lst products are generated by modis sensors onboard the nasa terra and aqua earth observation system satellites wang et al 2008 wan and dozier 1996 proposed a generalized split window method for retrieving lst from avhrr and modis data mod11a1 is a daily level 3 lst production at 1 km spatial resolution which is a tile of daily lst production gridded in the sinusoidal projection a tile contains 1200 1200 grids in 1200 rows and 1200 columns the exact grid size at 1 km spatial resolution is 0 928 km by 0 928 km the day temperature and night temperature of the study area are extracted using arcgis tools and the null value is interpolated according to the time series the surface reflectance production used in this study is mod09ga the mod09ga product is a seven band product computed from modis level 1b vermote et al 2011 and wavelengths of each surface reflectance band are shown in table 1 the spatial resolution is 500 m and the temporal sampling period is 1 day to meet the resolution of the surface temperature product the spatial resolution is resampled to 1 km to assess the remote sensing based et0 estimation model three alternatives were tested one model used daytime lst lstday and another used lst consisting of daytime lst and nighttime lst lstnight the other models used both lst lst without subscript represent the combination of lstday and lstnight and surface reflectance 3 2 2 meteorological station data to train the machine learning algorithms the standard series of et0 which is calculated with fao pm is used as the output dataset in the training set the calculation of et0 requires several types of meteorological data including air temperature humidity wind speed and hours of sunshine these data were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn the training set is collected during the period from 2010 to 2013 there are nine meteorological stations in and around the study region selected to provide daily meteorological data which are shown in fig 5 and table 2 the data shown in table 2 include air temperature t wind speed at 10 m height u10 relative humidity rh sunshine duration n and precipitation p 3 2 3 eco hydrology monitoring station data the model s validation also required meteorological data to calculate et0 as the output in the validation set output datasets in the validation set are calculated from eco hydrological monitoring stations established near yumen and dunhuang fig 6 eco hydrological monitoring stations record all of the same meteorological data as a meteorological station and enrich the meteorological data in the study region the meteorological datasets recorded from eco hydrological monitoring stations and meteorological stations are the same the locations of eco hydrological monitoring stations are shown in fig 5 instruments for eco hydrological observations are mostly equipped on a tower and include meteorological eddy covariance and data acquisition systems the observations in a meteorological system cover wind speed wind direction air temperature air humidity air pressure precipitation and radiation solar radiation was measured with a solar radiation sensor air temperature and relative humidity were measured at 2 4 6 10 16 24 32 40 and 50 m with thermometers and a hygrometer model hmp155 a vaisala finland wind speeds were measured with cup anemometers at 2 4 6 10 16 24 32 40 and 50 m model 010c 1 metone usa and wind direction was measured with a wind vane model 020c 1 metone usa precipitation was measured with a rain gauge model te525mm campbell scientific usa and atmospheric pressure with a barometer model cs106 campbell scientific usa the data acquisition system is housed on a tower platform at a height of 2 m and can be remotely controlled via network transmission the observed data was the same as meteorological station used in this study the yumen tower was established in september 2013 and the dunhuang tower was established in september 2014 the validation set from the dunhuang tower is collected during the period from 5 9 2014 5 9 2014 represents 5 september 2014 to 31 12 2016 which is 849 days in total in yumen the tower observation period covered 1 1 2014 to 29 9 2014 and 14 7 2015 to 31 12 2016 which is 809 days in total due to some reason part of the data in yumen was lost during july 2014 to august 2015 4 results and discussion 4 1 results 4 1 1 daily et0 estimation using lstday after training models were generated using svm bp and anfis then the validation was conducted to evaluate the permanence of the trained models first we used the lstday to compare the estimated et0 and observed et0 using fao pm and ground observed data models generated with svm bp and anfis using lstday are hereafter known as svmd bpd and anfisd respectively table 3 shows that svmd and bpd have high ccs over 0 85 while anfisd has a lower cc of approximately 0 78 the rmse of the dunhuang station varied from 1 6 to 2 2 which is higher than the rmse of the yumen station 1 1 1 4 the difference between the two stations was due to the higher et0 value at the dunhuang station anfisd had the lowest bias mae and me in both dunhuang and yumen showing a lower error level than the svmd and bpd fig 7 shows the estimated daily et0 of svmd bpd anfisd and observed et0 for the dunhuang fig 7a c and yumen fig 7d f towers fig 7 illustrates that the estimated values have the same variation trend as the observed et0 calculated using the fao pm and ground meteorological observations at the dunhuang station underestimation occurred during the period of 5 3 2015 to 5 9 2015 and 5 3 2016 to 5 9 2016 in addition at the yumen station models also underestimated et0 during some of the periods the observed and estimated values showed a disparity especially at the dunhuang station thus the estimated et0 using only lstday is inadequate and multivariable estimations are required to achieve a better performance 4 1 2 daily et0 estimation using lstday and lstnight table 4 lists the statistical evaluation indexes of the results generated by the trained model for the three machine learning in the cases using daytime and nighttime lst models generated by svm bp and anfis using lstday and lstnight are hereafter denominated as svml bpl and anfisl respectively as seen in table 4 svml bpl and anfisl all have a high level of accuracy in both dunhuang and yumen in dunhuang svml had the highest cc of 0 914 the cc of anfisl was slightly lower than the other two with a value of 0 897 the rmses of all three models were approximately 1 4 the relative bias bias in dunhuang varied from 3 24 to 4 42 svml had the lowest bias and bpl had the highest mean absolute errors mae were all lower than 1 in all three models this means that the absolute error between the observed et0 calculated by fao pm and estimated et0 conducted by remote sensing data was less than 1 mm on average mean errors me had a range of 0 139 0 189 illustrating a low mean error me level in yumen svml had the highest cc of 0 915 while bpl and anfisl had close cc values of 0 914 three machine learning models showed similar performances according to the statistical indexes svml had a slightly better cc and lower bias and me but the higher rmse and mae showed the svml could not achieve the best results of all indexes the smv bp and anfis methods have different advantages in modelling the cc bias rmse mae and me indexes showed that all three model types perform well for the dunhuang and yumen data the fig 8 shows the estimated daily et0 of svml bpl anfisl and the observed et0 at the dunhuang fig 8a c and yumen fig 8d f towers fig 8 a shows a comparison of the svml estimated value and observed value in dunhuang during the period of 5 9 2014 to 5 3 2015 5 9 2015 to 5 3 2016 and 5 9 2016 to 31 12 2016 the estimated et0 generally fit the observed et0 well however from 5 3 2015 to 5 9 2015 and 5 3 2016 to 5 9 2016 the observed and estimated values showed a disparity on some days while on other days the values were close when the values of the observed et0 were high the model tended to underestimate the et0 especially on the day of 31 7 2016 the observed et0 was 16 9 mm and the estimated et0 was 10 8 mm it seems that the estimated et0 was difficult to fit when the et0 peak appeared suddenly the possible reason for this problem was the cloudy weather from march to august which influenced the satellite observed land surface features cloudy weather can result in a lower estimated et0 during the period when a high observed et0 occurs on a cloudy day due to shelter from the clouds fig 8 b and fig 8 c show similar features to those seen in fig 8 a during the period of 5 9 2014 to 5 3 2015 5 9 2015 to 5 3 2016 and 5 9 2016 to 31 12 2016 the observed and estimated et0 of bpl and anfisl performed better than svml due to an overestimation by svml at low values regrading the peak value that occurred on 31 7 2016 bpl performed better than svml and anfisl with an observed et0 of 16 9 mm and bpl svml anfisl estimated et0 at 14 0 mm 10 8 mm and 11 8 mm respectively in addition anfisl highly overestimated the et0 on 30 8 2015 which is the period when underestimations appeared fig 8 d f shows the estimated and observed daily et0 from 1 1 2014 to 29 9 2014 and 14 7 2015 to 31 12 2016 in yumen at the yumen monitoring station estimated values generally correspond with observed values svml still overestimated et0 at low values while bpl and anfisl fit well at low values underestimation during some periods from march to august still existed such underestimation also occurred in dunhuang but the difference between the observed and estimated values in yumen was smaller notably all svml bpl and anfisl models grossly underestimated the value grossl on 27 6 2014 the reason was that the results were influenced by atmospheric conditions these results indicate that the machine learning methods using lst data have a high level of accuracy in estimating et0 the cc was approximately 0 9 and the rmse was approximately 1 4 in dunhuang and 0 85 in yumen estimation in yumen seemed to be better than in dunhuang there were lower values of rmse bias me and mae at the yumen station which was due to the extreme meteorological condition at the dunhuang station from march to august the model underestimated the et0 especially at the dunhuang station the reason was that the satellite observation bias was influenced by cloudy weather 4 1 3 daily et0 estimation using lst and reflectance to evaluate whether surface reflectance data is effective in et0 estimation several models using lst and surface reflectance were trained in this study the lst and surface reflectance were selected to form combinations to determine satisfactory models based on as few parameters as possible every two and three parameters among the lst and surface reflectance formed one kind of combination models were established based on three machine learning models and the 6 best combinations of machine learning models are showed in table 5 surface reflectance bands 1 7 are hereafter abbreviated as ref1 to ref7 respectively the six best combinations of svm and bp models in table 5 all contain lstday and lstnight which illustrates the importance of the lstday and lstnight data the lstday and lstnight from remote sensing played an important role in this method the models using only lstday and lstnight had high levels of accuracy compared with the models using three parameters which showed that satisfactory results were achievable based on lstday and lstnight table 5 indicated that the surface reflectance could slightly improve the model accuracy in dunhuang the best model used lstday lstnight and ref3 data based on svm with a cc of 0 916 which is approximately the same as the model using lstday and lstnight with a cc of 0 916 meanwhile the model in yumen achieved a cc of 0 917 with the combination of lstday lstnight and ref7 using the bp and svm models and the accuracy of this combination was slightly higher than the model using lstday and lstnight the join of surface reflectance in model used lstday and lstnight improved the accuracy slightly however the minor improvement indicated that lst was more essential in estimating et0 and the model based on lstday and lstnight was a satisfactory model with fewer data and satisfactory performance notably the models using lstnight and surface reflectance achieved good accuracy levels cc higher than 0 87 based on the anfis model this result showed the ability of the surface reflectance to estimate et0 however the models that use only surface reflectance failed to achieve the accuracy of the six best combinations which indicates that thelst played an essential role in the et0 estimation model between the svm bp and anfis models the svm model achieved the best performance in dunhuang while the bp model had the highest accuracy in yumen at the yumen station the svm and bp models had similar performances with a small difference and at the dunhuang station the svm had a higher accuracy than bp these results indicated that the svm and bp models could both produce satisfactory results and svm performed slightly better than bp anfis showed a lower accuracy than svm and bp but still showed a good performance with a cc higher than 0 87 4 2 discussion 4 2 1 applicability of remote sensing data based model the evaluation showed that models based on remote sensing data had high levels of accuracy in estimating et0 indicating the applicability of remote sensing data in modelling et0 maeda et al 2011 introduced modis lst data into temperature based models and the highest correlation coefficient achieved was 0 67 the method replaced the air temperature with remotely sensed lst and is an effective method for estimating et0 without meteorological data however the simple method ignored the complex relationship between the lst and air temperature and even the et0 the use of machine learning method in this study can better simulate the relationship which succeeds in estimating the regional et0 in the study region machine learning algorithms such as svm and bp can well simulate the complex relationship between remotely sensed data and et0 based on numerous trainings in addition the models need to be recalibrated only when the relationship between remotely sensed data and et0 are altered due to severe changes in climate and land surfaces in this study lst has a close connection with et0 and estimations using lst showed a good performance compared to the et0 calculated by fao pm the reason is that lst has a relationship with air temperature and air temperature is correlative with et0 on the one hand it has been found that modis lstnight provided a good estimation of minimum air temperature over different ecosystems while the difference between lstday data and maximum air temperature was varied according to seasonality ecosystems solar radiation and cloud cover vancutsem et al 2010 the use of machine learning algorithms further strengthened the relationship between lst and air temperature and weakened the influence from seasonal variations and the ecosystems on the other hand air temperature is closely related to the reference et0 air temperature has been used for estimating et0 in hargreaves equation and blaney criddle equation maeda et al 2011 there is a high correlation between the air temperature and et0 thus the relationship between lst and et0 could be used for the et0 estimation model in terms of energy balance the et0 and lst also have a close enough relationship that they could be considered as the results of energy distribution et0 indicates the amount of energy used for evapotranspiration under adequate water supply conditions the net radiant energy from solar radiation is equal to the sum of sensible heat flux soil heat flux latent heat flux and all these terms are related to lst kalma et al 2008 et0 can be assumed as a useable energy that can be consumed by the evapotranspiration under sufficient water supply conditions while lst can be regarded as the result of the energy distribution therefore both et0 and lst can be considered the result of surface energy distribution and a relationship between et0 and lst can be assumed due to the above reasons the method in this study could be used in any other region with available remote sensing and meteorological data 4 2 2 analysis of influencing factors the error in this method depends on the number and distribution of meteorological stations and remote sensing data quality clouds can influence the quality of remote sensing imagery and thus clear skies can result in a better model performance the number and distribution of meteorological stations also makes a difference which affects the training process and consequently influences the models a reasonable training dataset should include the most arid and humid conditions and cover all kinds of land use types in the target area however a lack of meteorological stations always limits the number and distribution therefore more meteorological stations could result in the better estimations notably in this study we achieved good accuracy based on nine metrological stations indicating that machine learning can make the utmost of the data from available metrological stations a comparison between the yumen and dunhuang stations also proved the importance of meteorological station distribution the yumen station performed better than the dunhuang station because the meteorological stations in the training dataset have similar surface conditions with the yumen station and the dunhuang station is different from other stations due to the extremely arid climate in general the good performance in yumen and dunhuang demonstrated the satisfactory capability of this method 4 2 3 comparison between svm bp and anfis models a comparison in this study showed that svm and bp have satisfactory abilitities for estimating et0 and perform better than anfis in the models based on lstday and lstnight svm has the highest cc in dunhuang and a similar performance with bp in yumen the svm and bp models also performed well and had high levels of accuracy in estimations using lst and surface reflectance as the dunhuang station has an extreme arid climate which differed from stations used in the training data sets the higher accuracy of the svm model in dunhuang was more applicable svm was shown to be more robust and avoided overfitting which indicates that the svm model is more suitable for modelling based on limited data the results show that both svm and bp have satisfactory abilities in relating remote sensing data and et0 and svm could perform slightly better than bp furthermore the svm cost the least amount of time in training and estimation which showed the high efficiency of the estimation model comparisons between models were also conducted in recent studies svm and ann were found to perform better than anfis moghaddamnia et al 2009 hipni et al 2013 researchers also used the svm ann and anfis methods to forecast river flow in semiarid mountain regions he et al 2014 and the validation indicated that the svm model performed better than ann and anfis the results of the comparison between models in our study were reasonable and similar to those of the above studies 5 conclusions in this study a remote sensing based model aiming to estimate spatially distributed et0 was established using machine learning methods in this model the dependence on meteorological data was alleviated as meteorological data was required only in the model training process and not in the model application the following conclusions were obtained 1 evaluations in dunhuang and yumen showed that the model using lst achieved satisfactory results in et0 estimation in dunhuang the svm model had the highest correlation coefficient of 0 914 in yumen three machine learning models showed similar performances with the highest correlation coefficient of 0 915 achieved by svm 2 surface reflectance could improve the accuracy of lst model slightly in dunhuang the best model used lstday lstnight and ref3 data based on svm with a correlation coefficient of 0 916 while the model in yumen achieved a correlation coefficient of 0 917 with the bp and svm models using lstday lstnight and ref7 however the minor improvement showed that lst was more essential than surface reflectance et0 estimation model based on lstday lstnight can be applied effectively with fewer data and satisfactory performance 3 the results in anfis model indicated that the combination of surface reflectance and lstnight could achieved a good performance with the correlation coefficient higher than 0 87 surface reflectance had potential for estimating et0 although played a weaker role compared with lst 4 machine learning methods performed well and showed good applicability in estimating et0 according to the comparisons svm showed more robust and suitable in estimating et0 the method used in this study can successfully relate the remote sensing data and et0 based on machine learning and has worldwide applicability due to the relationship between lst and et0 acknowledgements this manuscript was supported by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc grant no 41671020 national key r d program of china grant

11306,estimating reference evapotranspiration et0 is a fundamental requirement of agricultural water management the fao penman monteith fao pm equation has been used as the standard for et0 estimation however the lack of necessary meteorological data makes it difficult to estimate spatially distributed et0 using the fao pm method in the wider ungauged areas in this study the aim is to explore the methodology for estimating reference evapotranspiration based on remote sensing data in this method remote sensing data are combined with machine learning algorithms to establish a model for spatially distributed et0 estimation three machine learning algorithms were tested including support vector machine svm back propagation neural network bp and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis results showed this method had good ability in estimating et0 application of the method in northwest china indicated that the land surface temperature lst can be used to accurately estimate et0 with high correlation coefficients r2 of 0 897 0 915 the surface reflectance has potential for estimating et0 with lst and can slightly improve model accuracy based on lst evaluation showed lst was more essential than surface reflectance and the model only based on lst had satisfactory performance this method could be applicability in worldwide with available remote sensing and meteorological data due to the relationship between lst and et0 keywords reference evapotranspiration modis machine learning northwest china 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration et0 is a major research area of both hydrology and water resources management valipour 2015 especially in irrigation agriculture et0 is defined as an evapotranspiration rate from a hypothetical reference surface that was specific characteristics the aim is to determine a specific evapotranspiration demand depending on the atmosphere instead of crop type development and management practices allen et al 1998 the most direct and important application of et0 is in the field of irrigation et0 is the key parameter used to calculate crop evapotranspiration under field conditions many studies have shown that a detailed and rational irrigation system can improve irrigation water efficiency kang et al 2002 cifre et al 2005 du et al 2010 the prerequisite for estimating the optimal water requirement of a crop is to establish a relationship between climatic conditions and evapotranspiration maeda et al 2011 it is generally achieved by multiplying the et0 with a crop coefficient kc which is specific to a particular crop during a certain growth period such as sowing mid season and harvest strong et al 2017 therefore the accuracy of evapotranspiration estimation is the basis of efficient irrigation systems in past decades a variety of approaches have been developed for calculating et0 based on simulating fundamental physical principles such as energy balance and mass transfer maeda et al 2011 since allen et al 1998 established the first version of fao 56 with the penman monteith equation fao pm fao pm became a standard for calculating reference evapotranspiration jabloun and sahli 2008 sentelhas et al 2010 djaman et al 2015 fao pm has also been widely used due to its satisfactory results under various climate conditions around the world garcia et al 2004 cai et al 2007 bodner et al 2007 liu and luo 2010 however application of fao pm remains inconvenient because it requires a large amount of meteorological data hobbins 2016 gavilán et al 2006 which originates from standard metrological observation stations reportedly the number and distribution of metrological stations depends on national or local economic development and the establishment of meteorological observation networks and national data access policies hijmans et al 2005 the fao pm method requires air temperature wind speed relative humidity solar radiation etc however observations of these parameters at meteorological stations are limited in developing countries droogers and allen 2002 even if there is a meteorological station in a specific area the data collected may be insufficient to represent the regional value of et0 due to terrain complexity as a result the optimal status of irrigation management in such areas is difficult to achieve increasing the risk of water shortages and water conflicts maeda et al 2011 to overcome the existing limits of the fao pm model various attempts aiming to estimate et0 with limited observed data have been conducted a large number of studies have focused on estimating et0 using limited ground data in those studies a number of methods such as the hargreaves and samani equation priestley taylor equation and thornthwaite equation were produced for estimating et0 jabloun and sahli 2008 sentelhas et al 2010 djaman et al 2015 tomas burguera et al 2017 the results of these studies showed that these equations which were based on limited meteorological data could be used for reference evapotranspiration estimation where reasonable correlation coefficient and root mean square error values could be obtained however the diversity of methods can achieve vastly different accuracies in specific regions djaman et al 2015 which results in a large basis for improper equations in addition simple equations are more likely to misestimate and thus adjustment of the method coefficient and selection must be carefully conducted before application in addition to the improvements in et0 equations based on reducing the dependency of climatic data artificial intelligence approaches were also introduced to develop et0 models in a new pattern shiri et al 2012 set up an et0 model with limited meteorological data through a genetic programming approach in the basque country and attained good model performance falamarzi et al 2014 proposed an et0 model based on only temperature and wind speed data using artificial and wavelet neural networks in australia which were successful in modelling et0 feng et al 2016 compared the extreme learning machine elm artificial neural networks optimized by genetic algorithm gann wavelet neural networks wnn and empirical models in et0 estimation using few meteorological data and the results showed that the elm and gann models achieved acceptable levels of accuracy furthermore efforts have been aimed at overcoming the shortcomings of a lack of meteorological stations and thus a number of valuable approaches use remote sensing data to estimate et0 rather than meteorological data maeda et al 2011 used modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer lst to replace the atmospheric temperature in temperature based et0 models and achieved a correlation coefficient of 0 67 alipour et al 2014 compared m5 model tree and artificial neural network ann for estimating et0 using modis products and the coefficient of determination values of the ann and m5 tree models were over 0 79 and 0 80 respectively based on remote sensing data several algorithms were also developed to estimate the actual evapotranspiration combined with meteorological data such as sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 s sebi roerink et al 2000 sebs su 2002 metric allen et al 2007 ttme long and singh 2012 and redraw feng and wang 2013 those studies also hint at the availability of remote sensing data in modelling et0 in this study we aimed to 1 use machine learning algorithms to establish a model for estimating spatially distributed reference evapotranspiration 2 study the ways in which accessible remote sensing data can be introduced into the et0 estimation model 3 evaluate the accuracy of proposed et0 estimation models based on different combinations of remote sensing data and 4 analyse model applicability and limitations remote sensing data were retrieved from modis which was validated over a large range of land surface conditions and satisfactorily used in scientific studies the meteorological data used were from nine sparsely distributed national meteorological stations and two eco hydrological monitoring stations in northwest china were used 2 materials and methodology 2 1 materials and availability fao pm based et0 estimation depends on the parameters of solar radiation minimum maximum and mean air temperature relative humidity and wind speed as shown in eq 1 these parameters originate from meteorological station observations which are equipped to measure these parameters meteorological station observed data has the advantages of long term and high time resolution however establishing and maintaining these stations is costly thus the station distribution depends on population and economic conditions which are usually inadequate satellite observations have been an essential method for monitoring land surface conditions these observations have the advantages of wide coverage and providing accessible data for the regions lacking land observations frequently used remote sensing products such as modis and landsat could be easily accessed on their respective websites although remote sensing data has the disadvantages of a lower temporal resolution than meteorological station data the daily datasets from modis could be applied for et0 estimations modis produced lst data and surface reflectance data are available daily and easy to access in this study limited meteorological data were used to calibrate and validate the new et0 estimation equation which is based on modis data 2 2 modeling structure and approach 2 2 1 modelling structure the remote sensing based et0 model is designed to select the possible accessible data from remote sensing datasets to determine a relationship between the remote sensing data and et0 calculated by fao pm using machine learning algorithms the structure of the model is shown in fig 1 remote sensing data is spatially distributed information which expresses land surface features in raster format remote sensing data is utilized as input in both training and validation sets several kinds of remote sensing data were selected from modis to establish the et0 estimation model similar to the studies by maeda et al 2011 and alipour et al 2014 in this study a wider variety of remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms were analysed to determine better relationships between remote sensing data and et0 normally the meteorological data are point based as the standard of meteorological data based et0 estimation the fao pm is expressed as follows and is used to train the remote sensing based et0 estimation models as output datasets of the training set 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 rn is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the ground heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es is the saturation vapour pressure kpa ea is the actual vapour pressure kpa δ is the slope vapour pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the remote sensing data in the training set includes accessible lst data and surface reflectance data which were retrieved from the point with the same geographical location as the ground meteorological station thus the remote sensing and meteorological data match each other and there is a one to one correspondence between the remote sensing and meteorological data the input and output datasets of the training set are prepared and machine learning is conducted to establish a remote sensing based et0 estimation model machine learning may be used to determine the relationship between the output and input data which can be implicitly illustrated as follows 2 e t 0 r s f x 1 x 2 x 3 x n where e t 0 r s is the output data representing the et0 calculated by remote sensing data and x1 x2 x3 xn are the input data representing different remote sensing data in the study region after training validation was conducted to verify the model accuracy in this study the input data in the validation are also from modis and are the same type as the training set but in a different location the output datasets of the validation set are obtained from two eco hydrological monitoring stations the eco hydrological monitoring stations were established and funded by the nsfc national natural science foundation of china and state key s t support programme project located in the study area the data observed at the eco hydrological monitoring stations were used to calculate the et0 with the fao pm formula the et0 calculated with the observed data from the eco hydrological monitoring stations and remote sensing data from modis are used as corresponding output and input data respectively in the validation if the validation verifies that the model is reliable then the model can be used to estimate the spatially distributed et0 with the remote sensing data 2 2 2 modeling approach three machine learning algorithms were introduced to train the et0 models including support vector machine svm back propagation neural network bp and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis svm was proposed by cortes and vapnik 1995 and has been effectively used for classification regression and other learning tasks cherkassky and ma 2004 shalev shwartz et al 2007 chang and lin 2011 svm is good at improving generalization ability svm has globally optimal solution and high training efficiency which makes the svm more robust efficient and reliable hipni et al 2013 libsvm a kind of svm software proposed in 2011 as a library for support vector machines is used in this study chang and lin 2011 and the flowchart is shown in fig 2 bp is a type of ann which is used to develop a map of the input and output variables to produce output as the input datasets are entered singh et al 2009 the bp neural network transmits information in a forward direction gong et al 2016 and uses the back propagation of the error gradient fig 3 shows the bp flowchart in this study two layer feed forward neural networks with back propagation learning were constructed anfis was first presented by jang 1993 anfis is a combination of adaptive networks and a fuzzy inference system since anfis integrates both adaptive networks and a fuzzy inference system obtaining the benefits of both in one single framework is possible anfis has been widely used in hydrology and water resource management including reservoir operations chang and chang 2001 valizadeh and el shafie 2013 groundwater level prediction shirmohammadi et al 2013 and daily pan evaporation estimation shiri et al 2011 the typical structure of anfis is shown in fig 4 this system has two inputs x1 and x2 and one output y the rules of anfis can be expressed as follows rule 1 if x 1 is a 1 and x 2 is b 1 then y p 1 x 1 q 1 x 2 r 1 rule 2 if x 1 is a 2 and x 2 is b 2 then y p 2 x 1 q 2 x 2 r 2 2 3 performance of evaluation indexes statistical indexes are usually used to quantitatively evaluate model performances the following statistical indexes are introduced in this study to evaluate the performance of the models established through machine learning these indexes are root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient cc relative bias bias mean absolute error mae and mean error me 3 r

the observed et0 3 study area and data sources 3 1 study area the study area is the shule river basin which is one of the three largest inland rivers in the hexi corridor in northwest china the range of geographical coordinates is between 38 2 42 8 n 93 4 99 0 e with elevations ranging from 935 m to 5615 m above sea level fig 5 the area includes oasis and desert and the primary land use types include barren sparse vegetation shrub crop urban built up etc the average annual air temperature varies from approximately 6 9 c to 9 3 c and the average annual precipitation varies from 36 mm to 62 mm with great seasonal differences this area is an ecologically fragile region which is characterized by low and irregular rainfall high temperatures and evaporation and notable drought periods ma et al 2005 water resources in the study area mainly come from mountain precipitation and glacial melt water and water resources were scarce due to rapid population development recently the lack of water resources in the study region highlighted the importance of the reasonable water consumption law with the rapid social and economic development and an increase in the human demand for water resources there is a series of ecological and environmental problems in the shule river basin such as the shortage of surface water resources and decline in the groundwater level due to overexploitation of groundwater resources however essential et0 estimation in irrigation is challenged by sparse meteorological stations which hardly provide adequate data for reference evapotranspiration calculation a lack of metrological data challenges the reliable estimation of cultivated land water demand and regional water consumption 3 2 data sources the data used in this study include modis remote sensing data meteorological station data from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn and eco hydrological monitoring station which were established by the state key lab of hydroscience and engineering of tsinghua university china eco hydrological monitoring stations used in this study observe all of the same items as standard meteorological stations as well as additional professional items meteorological data is used to calculate et0 with fao pm as the output data in the training dataset while et0 calculated from eco hydrological stations was used as output data in validation dataset it is also allowed to mix the data from meteorological stations and eco hydrological monitoring stations because the function of eco hydrological monitoring stations is to provide more meteorological data in study region however due to the special location of the eco hydrological monitoring stations we selected these stations for the validation dataset to enable a more comprehensive analysis remote sensing data from modis were used as input data in both training and validation datasets lst data and surface reflectance data are used to evaluated the applicability for estimating et0 based on machine learning models 3 2 1 remote sensing data the remote sensing data used in this study is lst and surface reflectance data from modis which was launched by nasa in 1998 and provides a new and improved capability for terrestrial satellite remote sensing aimed at land ocean and atmospheric research needs justice et al 1998 lst is one of the key parameters in land surface processes physics wan and li 1997 multiple daily lst products are generated by modis sensors onboard the nasa terra and aqua earth observation system satellites wang et al 2008 wan and dozier 1996 proposed a generalized split window method for retrieving lst from avhrr and modis data mod11a1 is a daily level 3 lst production at 1 km spatial resolution which is a tile of daily lst production gridded in the sinusoidal projection a tile contains 1200 1200 grids in 1200 rows and 1200 columns the exact grid size at 1 km spatial resolution is 0 928 km by 0 928 km the day temperature and night temperature of the study area are extracted using arcgis tools and the null value is interpolated according to the time series the surface reflectance production used in this study is mod09ga the mod09ga product is a seven band product computed from modis level 1b vermote et al 2011 and wavelengths of each surface reflectance band are shown in table 1 the spatial resolution is 500 m and the temporal sampling period is 1 day to meet the resolution of the surface temperature product the spatial resolution is resampled to 1 km to assess the remote sensing based et0 estimation model three alternatives were tested one model used daytime lst lstday and another used lst consisting of daytime lst and nighttime lst lstnight the other models used both lst lst without subscript represent the combination of lstday and lstnight and surface reflectance 3 2 2 meteorological station data to train the machine learning algorithms the standard series of et0 which is calculated with fao pm is used as the output dataset in the training set the calculation of et0 requires several types of meteorological data including air temperature humidity wind speed and hours of sunshine these data were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn the training set is collected during the period from 2010 to 2013 there are nine meteorological stations in and around the study region selected to provide daily meteorological data which are shown in fig 5 and table 2 the data shown in table 2 include air temperature t wind speed at 10 m height u10 relative humidity rh sunshine duration n and precipitation p 3 2 3 eco hydrology monitoring station data the model s validation also required meteorological data to calculate et0 as the output in the validation set output datasets in the validation set are calculated from eco hydrological monitoring stations established near yumen and dunhuang fig 6 eco hydrological monitoring stations record all of the same meteorological data as a meteorological station and enrich the meteorological data in the study region the meteorological datasets recorded from eco hydrological monitoring stations and meteorological stations are the same the locations of eco hydrological monitoring stations are shown in fig 5 instruments for eco hydrological observations are mostly equipped on a tower and include meteorological eddy covariance and data acquisition systems the observations in a meteorological system cover wind speed wind direction air temperature air humidity air pressure precipitation and radiation solar radiation was measured with a solar radiation sensor air temperature and relative humidity were measured at 2 4 6 10 16 24 32 40 and 50 m with thermometers and a hygrometer model hmp155 a vaisala finland wind speeds were measured with cup anemometers at 2 4 6 10 16 24 32 40 and 50 m model 010c 1 metone usa and wind direction was measured with a wind vane model 020c 1 metone usa precipitation was measured with a rain gauge model te525mm campbell scientific usa and atmospheric pressure with a barometer model cs106 campbell scientific usa the data acquisition system is housed on a tower platform at a height of 2 m and can be remotely controlled via network transmission the observed data was the same as meteorological station used in this study the yumen tower was established in september 2013 and the dunhuang tower was established in september 2014 the validation set from the dunhuang tower is collected during the period from 5 9 2014 5 9 2014 represents 5 september 2014 to 31 12 2016 which is 849 days in total in yumen the tower observation period covered 1 1 2014 to 29 9 2014 and 14 7 2015 to 31 12 2016 which is 809 days in total due to some reason part of the data in yumen was lost during july 2014 to august 2015 4 results and discussion 4 1 results 4 1 1 daily et0 estimation using lstday after training models were generated using svm bp and anfis then the validation was conducted to evaluate the permanence of the trained models first we used the lstday to compare the estimated et0 and observed et0 using fao pm and ground observed data models generated with svm bp and anfis using lstday are hereafter known as svmd bpd and anfisd respectively table 3 shows that svmd and bpd have high ccs over 0 85 while anfisd has a lower cc of approximately 0 78 the rmse of the dunhuang station varied from 1 6 to 2 2 which is higher than the rmse of the yumen station 1 1 1 4 the difference between the two stations was due to the higher et0 value at the dunhuang station anfisd had the lowest bias mae and me in both dunhuang and yumen showing a lower error level than the svmd and bpd fig 7 shows the estimated daily et0 of svmd bpd anfisd and observed et0 for the dunhuang fig 7a c and yumen fig 7d f towers fig 7 illustrates that the estimated values have the same variation trend as the observed et0 calculated using the fao pm and ground meteorological observations at the dunhuang station underestimation occurred during the period of 5 3 2015 to 5 9 2015 and 5 3 2016 to 5 9 2016 in addition at the yumen station models also underestimated et0 during some of the periods the observed and estimated values showed a disparity especially at the dunhuang station thus the estimated et0 using only lstday is inadequate and multivariable estimations are required to achieve a better performance 4 1 2 daily et0 estimation using lstday and lstnight table 4 lists the statistical evaluation indexes of the results generated by the trained model for the three machine learning in the cases using daytime and nighttime lst models generated by svm bp and anfis using lstday and lstnight are hereafter denominated as svml bpl and anfisl respectively as seen in table 4 svml bpl and anfisl all have a high level of accuracy in both dunhuang and yumen in dunhuang svml had the highest cc of 0 914 the cc of anfisl was slightly lower than the other two with a value of 0 897 the rmses of all three models were approximately 1 4 the relative bias bias in dunhuang varied from 3 24 to 4 42 svml had the lowest bias and bpl had the highest mean absolute errors mae were all lower than 1 in all three models this means that the absolute error between the observed et0 calculated by fao pm and estimated et0 conducted by remote sensing data was less than 1 mm on average mean errors me had a range of 0 139 0 189 illustrating a low mean error me level in yumen svml had the highest cc of 0 915 while bpl and anfisl had close cc values of 0 914 three machine learning models showed similar performances according to the statistical indexes svml had a slightly better cc and lower bias and me but the higher rmse and mae showed the svml could not achieve the best results of all indexes the smv bp and anfis methods have different advantages in modelling the cc bias rmse mae and me indexes showed that all three model types perform well for the dunhuang and yumen data the fig 8 shows the estimated daily et0 of svml bpl anfisl and the observed et0 at the dunhuang fig 8a c and yumen fig 8d f towers fig 8 a shows a comparison of the svml estimated value and observed value in dunhuang during the period of 5 9 2014 to 5 3 2015 5 9 2015 to 5 3 2016 and 5 9 2016 to 31 12 2016 the estimated et0 generally fit the observed et0 well however from 5 3 2015 to 5 9 2015 and 5 3 2016 to 5 9 2016 the observed and estimated values showed a disparity on some days while on other days the values were close when the values of the observed et0 were high the model tended to underestimate the et0 especially on the day of 31 7 2016 the observed et0 was 16 9 mm and the estimated et0 was 10 8 mm it seems that the estimated et0 was difficult to fit when the et0 peak appeared suddenly the possible reason for this problem was the cloudy weather from march to august which influenced the satellite observed land surface features cloudy weather can result in a lower estimated et0 during the period when a high observed et0 occurs on a cloudy day due to shelter from the clouds fig 8 b and fig 8 c show similar features to those seen in fig 8 a during the period of 5 9 2014 to 5 3 2015 5 9 2015 to 5 3 2016 and 5 9 2016 to 31 12 2016 the observed and estimated et0 of bpl and anfisl performed better than svml due to an overestimation by svml at low values regrading the peak value that occurred on 31 7 2016 bpl performed better than svml and anfisl with an observed et0 of 16 9 mm and bpl svml anfisl estimated et0 at 14 0 mm 10 8 mm and 11 8 mm respectively in addition anfisl highly overestimated the et0 on 30 8 2015 which is the period when underestimations appeared fig 8 d f shows the estimated and observed daily et0 from 1 1 2014 to 29 9 2014 and 14 7 2015 to 31 12 2016 in yumen at the yumen monitoring station estimated values generally correspond with observed values svml still overestimated et0 at low values while bpl and anfisl fit well at low values underestimation during some periods from march to august still existed such underestimation also occurred in dunhuang but the difference between the observed and estimated values in yumen was smaller notably all svml bpl and anfisl models grossly underestimated the value grossl on 27 6 2014 the reason was that the results were influenced by atmospheric conditions these results indicate that the machine learning methods using lst data have a high level of accuracy in estimating et0 the cc was approximately 0 9 and the rmse was approximately 1 4 in dunhuang and 0 85 in yumen estimation in yumen seemed to be better than in dunhuang there were lower values of rmse bias me and mae at the yumen station which was due to the extreme meteorological condition at the dunhuang station from march to august the model underestimated the et0 especially at the dunhuang station the reason was that the satellite observation bias was influenced by cloudy weather 4 1 3 daily et0 estimation using lst and reflectance to evaluate whether surface reflectance data is effective in et0 estimation several models using lst and surface reflectance were trained in this study the lst and surface reflectance were selected to form combinations to determine satisfactory models based on as few parameters as possible every two and three parameters among the lst and surface reflectance formed one kind of combination models were established based on three machine learning models and the 6 best combinations of machine learning models are showed in table 5 surface reflectance bands 1 7 are hereafter abbreviated as ref1 to ref7 respectively the six best combinations of svm and bp models in table 5 all contain lstday and lstnight which illustrates the importance of the lstday and lstnight data the lstday and lstnight from remote sensing played an important role in this method the models using only lstday and lstnight had high levels of accuracy compared with the models using three parameters which showed that satisfactory results were achievable based on lstday and lstnight table 5 indicated that the surface reflectance could slightly improve the model accuracy in dunhuang the best model used lstday lstnight and ref3 data based on svm with a cc of 0 916 which is approximately the same as the model using lstday and lstnight with a cc of 0 916 meanwhile the model in yumen achieved a cc of 0 917 with the combination of lstday lstnight and ref7 using the bp and svm models and the accuracy of this combination was slightly higher than the model using lstday and lstnight the join of surface reflectance in model used lstday and lstnight improved the accuracy slightly however the minor improvement indicated that lst was more essential in estimating et0 and the model based on lstday and lstnight was a satisfactory model with fewer data and satisfactory performance notably the models using lstnight and surface reflectance achieved good accuracy levels cc higher than 0 87 based on the anfis model this result showed the ability of the surface reflectance to estimate et0 however the models that use only surface reflectance failed to achieve the accuracy of the six best combinations which indicates that thelst played an essential role in the et0 estimation model between the svm bp and anfis models the svm model achieved the best performance in dunhuang while the bp model had the highest accuracy in yumen at the yumen station the svm and bp models had similar performances with a small difference and at the dunhuang station the svm had a higher accuracy than bp these results indicated that the svm and bp models could both produce satisfactory results and svm performed slightly better than bp anfis showed a lower accuracy than svm and bp but still showed a good performance with a cc higher than 0 87 4 2 discussion 4 2 1 applicability of remote sensing data based model the evaluation showed that models based on remote sensing data had high levels of accuracy in estimating et0 indicating the applicability of remote sensing data in modelling et0 maeda et al 2011 introduced modis lst data into temperature based models and the highest correlation coefficient achieved was 0 67 the method replaced the air temperature with remotely sensed lst and is an effective method for estimating et0 without meteorological data however the simple method ignored the complex relationship between the lst and air temperature and even the et0 the use of machine learning method in this study can better simulate the relationship which succeeds in estimating the regional et0 in the study region machine learning algorithms such as svm and bp can well simulate the complex relationship between remotely sensed data and et0 based on numerous trainings in addition the models need to be recalibrated only when the relationship between remotely sensed data and et0 are altered due to severe changes in climate and land surfaces in this study lst has a close connection with et0 and estimations using lst showed a good performance compared to the et0 calculated by fao pm the reason is that lst has a relationship with air temperature and air temperature is correlative with et0 on the one hand it has been found that modis lstnight provided a good estimation of minimum air temperature over different ecosystems while the difference between lstday data and maximum air temperature was varied according to seasonality ecosystems solar radiation and cloud cover vancutsem et al 2010 the use of machine learning algorithms further strengthened the relationship between lst and air temperature and weakened the influence from seasonal variations and the ecosystems on the other hand air temperature is closely related to the reference et0 air temperature has been used for estimating et0 in hargreaves equation and blaney criddle equation maeda et al 2011 there is a high correlation between the air temperature and et0 thus the relationship between lst and et0 could be used for the et0 estimation model in terms of energy balance the et0 and lst also have a close enough relationship that they could be considered as the results of energy distribution et0 indicates the amount of energy used for evapotranspiration under adequate water supply conditions the net radiant energy from solar radiation is equal to the sum of sensible heat flux soil heat flux latent heat flux and all these terms are related to lst kalma et al 2008 et0 can be assumed as a useable energy that can be consumed by the evapotranspiration under sufficient water supply conditions while lst can be regarded as the result of the energy distribution therefore both et0 and lst can be considered the result of surface energy distribution and a relationship between et0 and lst can be assumed due to the above reasons the method in this study could be used in any other region with available remote sensing and meteorological data 4 2 2 analysis of influencing factors the error in this method depends on the number and distribution of meteorological stations and remote sensing data quality clouds can influence the quality of remote sensing imagery and thus clear skies can result in a better model performance the number and distribution of meteorological stations also makes a difference which affects the training process and consequently influences the models a reasonable training dataset should include the most arid and humid conditions and cover all kinds of land use types in the target area however a lack of meteorological stations always limits the number and distribution therefore more meteorological stations could result in the better estimations notably in this study we achieved good accuracy based on nine metrological stations indicating that machine learning can make the utmost of the data from available metrological stations a comparison between the yumen and dunhuang stations also proved the importance of meteorological station distribution the yumen station performed better than the dunhuang station because the meteorological stations in the training dataset have similar surface conditions with the yumen station and the dunhuang station is different from other stations due to the extremely arid climate in general the good performance in yumen and dunhuang demonstrated the satisfactory capability of this method 4 2 3 comparison between svm bp and anfis models a comparison in this study showed that svm and bp have satisfactory abilitities for estimating et0 and perform better than anfis in the models based on lstday and lstnight svm has the highest cc in dunhuang and a similar performance with bp in yumen the svm and bp models also performed well and had high levels of accuracy in estimations using lst and surface reflectance as the dunhuang station has an extreme arid climate which differed from stations used in the training data sets the higher accuracy of the svm model in dunhuang was more applicable svm was shown to be more robust and avoided overfitting which indicates that the svm model is more suitable for modelling based on limited data the results show that both svm and bp have satisfactory abilities in relating remote sensing data and et0 and svm could perform slightly better than bp furthermore the svm cost the least amount of time in training and estimation which showed the high efficiency of the estimation model comparisons between models were also conducted in recent studies svm and ann were found to perform better than anfis moghaddamnia et al 2009 hipni et al 2013 researchers also used the svm ann and anfis methods to forecast river flow in semiarid mountain regions he et al 2014 and the validation indicated that the svm model performed better than ann and anfis the results of the comparison between models in our study were reasonable and similar to those of the above studies 5 conclusions in this study a remote sensing based model aiming to estimate spatially distributed et0 was established using machine learning methods in this model the dependence on meteorological data was alleviated as meteorological data was required only in the model training process and not in the model application the following conclusions were obtained 1 evaluations in dunhuang and yumen showed that the model using lst achieved satisfactory results in et0 estimation in dunhuang the svm model had the highest correlation coefficient of 0 914 in yumen three machine learning models showed similar performances with the highest correlation coefficient of 0 915 achieved by svm 2 surface reflectance could improve the accuracy of lst model slightly in dunhuang the best model used lstday lstnight and ref3 data based on svm with a correlation coefficient of 0 916 while the model in yumen achieved a correlation coefficient of 0 917 with the bp and svm models using lstday lstnight and ref7 however the minor improvement showed that lst was more essential than surface reflectance et0 estimation model based on lstday lstnight can be applied effectively with fewer data and satisfactory performance 3 the results in anfis model indicated that the combination of surface reflectance and lstnight could achieved a good performance with the correlation coefficient higher than 0 87 surface reflectance had potential for estimating et0 although played a weaker role compared with lst 4 machine learning methods performed well and showed good applicability in estimating et0 according to the comparisons svm showed more robust and suitable in estimating et0 the method used in this study can successfully relate the remote sensing data and et0 based on machine learning and has worldwide applicability due to the relationship between lst and et0 acknowledgements this manuscript was supported by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc grant no 41671020 national key r d program of china grant

11307,global warming and associated decrease of summer precipitation will intensify the limitation of crop growth through water unavailability in europe concomitantly the rise of atmospheric co2 concentration co2 decreases stomatal conductance and thus transpiration as evident at the leaf level however knowledge about the effect of elevated co2 eco2 on seasonal water use of crops is rather poor in a two year field study winter wheat was grown under ambient co2 393 ppm and eco2 600 ppm using free air co2 enrichment face in addition subplots were established with three levels of nitrogen n supply 35 190 320 kg n ha 1 soil moisture was continuously measured and wheat was irrigated when necessary to keep field capacity at between 50 to 90 evapotranspiration et from stem elongation until maturity was calculated using a soil water balance approach water use efficiency wue was determined from the ratio of aboveground biomass production and et during this period increasing n supply increased canopy size and decreased radiation transmission to the soil surface moreover increasing n supply enhanced biomass production from 771 1569 g m 2 et from 227 to 336 mm and wue from 4 07 to 6 20 g kg 1 biomass was increased under eco2 by 17 among all n levels eco2 increased soil moisture especially in the upper soil layer 0 20 cm and thus irrigation was reduced under eco2 compared to aco2 this effect was intensified by rising n supply leading to a significant co2 n interaction on et and wue thus the eco2 effect was for et 2 9 and 10 and for wue 20 30 and 29 under 35 190 320 kg n ha 1 respectively simultaneously there seems to be a greater increase of evaporation by eco2 under low than high n supply keywords climate change evaporation evapotranspiration free air co2 enrichment face nitrogen fertilization soil water content 1 introduction the anthropogenic rise of the atmospheric co2 level and the related consequences for regional changes in temperature and annual precipitation pattern might intensify the water limitation of crop growth during the vegetation period porter et al 2014 concomitantly the rising atmospheric co2 concentration co2 increases photosynthesis of c3 crops and reduce stomatal conductance and thus transpiration at the leaf level of c3 and c4 crops ainsworth and rogers 2007 however for reliable estimations of the consequences of water shortage on crop growth in future the effect of elevated co2 eco2 on crop water use under field conditions has to be quantified previous co2 enrichment studies with wheat indicated that a rise of co2 of approximately 200 ppm above the ambient co2 decreases stomatal conductance by 30 40 bunce 2004 wall et al 2000 li et al 2004 tausz posch et al 2013 also stomatal response to eco2 was found to be stronger under low than high nitrogen n fertilization li et al 2004 wall et al 2000 the reduction of stomatal conductance and transpiration at the leaf level can be counterbalanced by an increase of leaf area under eco2 this has been observed in controlled environment studies under high but not under low n supply li et al 2004 seneweera and conroy 2005 however if plants were grown in the field under adequate n fertilization effects of eco2 on leaf area index were small brooks et al 2000 weigel and manderscheid 2012 water loss from the canopy is strongly influenced by atmospheric conditions including radiation air humidity and wind speed therefore reliable estimation of the effect of eco2 on canopy transpiration and seasonal water use are ideally possibly if plants are grown under free air co2 enrichment face long et al 2004 in face studies with wheat eco2 decreased canopy transpiration by 15 to 22 senock et al 1996 tausz posch et al 2013 and evapotranspiration et by 4 to 20 burkart et al 2011 kimball et al 1995 hunsaker et al 2000 o leary et al 2015 wang et al 2018 results for water savings by eco2 under n deficiency are variable indicating et reductions of 20 and 2 when estimated from an energy balance approach kimball et al 1999 and from a soil water balance hunsaker et al 2000 respectively water use efficiency of biomass production of wheat was clearly stimulated under face kimball 2016 the size of the effect of eco2 was almost 20 under optimum growth conditions hunsaker et al 2000 however results obtained under limited n supply showed either an enlargement or a mitigation of the co2 effect as compared to the ample n treatment depending on the method used for measuring et hunsaker et al 2000 kimball et al 1999 in a wheat field water flux to the atmosphere includes mainly evaporation from the soil and transpiration through the stomata of the plants and less importantly evaporation of water intercepted by the canopy only transpiration is associated with plant productivity whereas evaporation is considered as an undesired component of et evaporation can contribute 10 to 40 to et in a wheat field caviglia and sadras 2001 chen et al 2010 kool et al 2014 and under normal growth conditions average seasonal evaporation amounts to about 30 of et liu et al 2002 evaporation is controlled by soil water content of the topsoil and the amount of radiation incident to the soil surface the latter depends on leaf area index which determines radiation transmitted to the soil surface the reduction of transpiration under eco2 can result in an increase of soil water content hunsaker et al 1996 burkart et al 2011 thus it is possible that water saved by transpiration under eco2 is wasted by an increase of evaporation since evaporation is much more facilitated under low than high n supply due to the associated changes in canopy size debaeke and aboudrare 2004 it is conceivable that an increase of evaporation as a result of a decrease of transpiration under eco2 is more important under low than under high n supply in a recent study with different wheat growth models the effect of global warming and eco2 on seasonal transpiration and evaporation was estimated cammarano et al 2016 according to this study a doubling of co2 hardly decreases seasonal water use and the effect on seasonal evaporation was even stronger 9 than on transpiration 2 however there was a great varibility among the models regarding the contribution of evaporation to total water use which points to the need of more reliable data for this interaction face experiments addressing et of wheat carried out so far were conducted in an arid hunsaker et al 1996 2000 or a semi arid environment o leary et al 2015 using a water balance or an energy balance approach kimball et al 1999 in the only large scale face study done in the temperate climate zone of central europe et was measured with a canopy chamber which however altered the aerial environment of the plant e g wind speed radiation environment influencing et burkart et al 2011 thus there is a lack of data and knowledge respectively with respect to the effect of eco2 on seasonal et of wheat which is especially true for the temperate climate zone the present paper describes the first study that addresses the effects of face on et and water use efficiency of winter wheat over the main growing seasons of two years under temperate climate conditions combined with three n fertilizer levels severe deficiency adequate and excess n supply the main objective was to quantify the effect of eco2 on et and on water use efficiency and to examine whether the response to eco2 is modified by n fertilization 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and face system the experiment was conducted on a field site 52 18 n 10 26 e 79 m a s l at the thünen institute in braunschweig germany in 2014 and 2015 the mean annual temperature is 9 1 c and the mean annual precipitation is 617 mm the soil is a luvisol of a loamy sand texture 69 sand 24 silt 7 clay in the plough horizon 0 40 cm the soil profile has a depth of about 60 cm 30 cm ap 15 cm al 15 cm bt 60 70 cm cii the lower layers are almost pure sand overall the soil is of low to intermediate fertility and provides a comparatively shallow rooting zone co2 enrichment was carried out by a face system constructed according to the brookhaven national laboratory design lewin et al 1992 three circular plots were equipped each with a free air co2 enrichment apparatus including vertical vent pipes and co2 injection driven by a blower and each with a diameter of 20 m this rings comprised what is termed eco2 treatment three further circular plots without the co2 enrichment apparatus were used as control treatment aco2 the face and ambient rings were set up after crop emergence and removed at grain maturity the target co2 concentration in the face rings was set to 600 ppm the co2 enrichment lasted from the three leaf stage in march until end of grain filling in july table 1 co2 enrichment took place during the daytime hours and was interrupted if wind speed exceeded 6 m s 1 or if air temperature fell below 5 c climate data hourly daily mean values of air temperature global radiation and precipitation measured at 2 m height close to the experimental field site 500 m were provided by the german weather service at braunschweig 2 2 crop management winter wheat triticum aestivum l variety batis was sown at the experimental field site in late autumn with a density of 380 kernels m 2 table 1 crop management measures were performed according to local farm practice with adequate nutrient supply and pesticide applications in each of the face and ambient rings three subplots 3 m 5 m with different n fertilization were randomly established the n treatments comprised three levels of calcium ammonium nitrate deficient n1 adequate n2 excessive n3 the total amount of n fertilizer applied in the two years were 40 35 kg n ha 1 n1 180 200 kg n ha 1 n2 and 320 kg n ha 1 n3 a detailed description of the different n treatments is described elsewhere dier et al 2018 2 3 measurement of soil water content and seasonal water use according to a previous study with the same wheat cultivar at this site the greatest part of roots is in the 0 30 cm topsoil layer pacholsky et al 2015 thus soil water content swc was measured in the 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m soil layer by time domain reflectometry tdr from imko ettlingen germany measurements were done approximately twice per week during the main growing period and in all 18 replicates of the different co2 and n treatments the drained upper and lower limits of plant available volumetric soil water content were 23 and 5 respectively the average of swc in the 0 0 4 m soil profile was used to control water availability and plant water use it was intended to keep the swc within the range of 50 and 90 of field capacity by irrigation to prevent drought and nitrate leaching this was achieved by modelling the soil water budget with the ambav model kersebaum et al 2005 which was done by the agrometerological research station of the german weather service at braunschweig the model runs were continuously controlled and re parameterized if necessary by the regular measurements of swc obtained by the tdr probes irrigation was done with a hand held shower according to the variable water demand of the treatment plots due to the different n and co2 supply it was assumed that the soil profile for plant water uptake was restricted to 0 0 4 m there was no capillary rise to the root zone since ground water level is about 10 m below surface furthermore it was assumed that drainage from the root zone and surface runoff were negligible thus plant water use was calculated using a simple soil water balance et r i dw where et is evapotranspiration r is rainfall i is irrigation and dw is water content change in the root zone 0 0 4 m from stem elongation to maturity this period lasted from 25th april to 17th july in 2014 and from 4th may to 20 july in 2015 respectively 2 4 measurement of light transmission by the green canopy crop growth and water use efficiency fraction of par transmitted by the green canopy ftrans was measured at noon 2 h approximately once per week starting few days before stem elongation the measurements were carried out with the sunscan system deltat devices cambridge uk and included the radiation incident to the canopy j0 and the radiation at the lower limit of the green canopy jc which was visually estimated jc was measured two to four times in each subplot of the different co2 and n treatments ftrans was determined as the ratio of jc to j0 plants were harvested from an area of 0 5 m2 and 1 8 m2 at the beginning of stem elongation and at grain maturity respectively table 1 plant material was dried at 105 c until constant weight and total plant dry weight per ground area was calculated water use efficiency was calculated from the ratio of water use between stem elongation and maturity and the production of above ground dry weight during this period 2 5 statistical analysis the experiment was analyzed as split plot design with the co2 treatment as main plot factor and the n treatment as sub plot factor and f tests were conducted with sas version 9 4 proc mixed if the year was included into the analysis then f tests were implemented as repeated measurements by using the un 1 model for the variance covariance between the years of the random main plot and residual error the un 1 model applies no covariance between the years but allows for different error variances in each year 3 results 3 1 performance of the face system and environmental conditions during the growing seasons co2 enrichment was interrupted for 1 0 of the operational time in 2014 and for 2 6 in 2015 due to high wind speeds the 1 min average co2 was within the range of 600 ppm 10 for 95 6 and 95 7 for the operation time in 2014 and 2015 respectively the average daytime co2 at the ambient air plots was 394 ppm in 2014 and 392 ppm in 2015 daily values of the weather conditions for the main growing season are shown in fig 1 overall the weather conditions were within the long term range of variation of this site with only minor deviations fig 2 in 2014 air temperature was higher in march and april as compared to the long term mean in 2015 rainfall from may to june was only half that of the long term mean 3 2 water supply soil water content and seasonal water use rainfall from stem elongation until maturity was 181 mm in 2014 and 122 mm in 2015 thus irrigation requirement was much greater in 2015 than 2014 table 2 soil water content swc fluctuated more strongly in 2014 than in 2015 due to the differences in precipitation fig 3 in 2015 more than half of the crop water requirement was met by irrigation that was adjusted on the basis of swc in 2014 swc exceeded field capacity several times in the top soil layer and once in the 0 2 0 4 m soil layer at the end of may during an intensive rainfall of 55 mm over three days fig 1 from mid of may to grain maturity swc in the topsoil layer was often significantly higher under eco2 although face plots received less irrigation than ambient plots table 2 there were significant differences in swc among the n levels in the topsoil layer whereby swc decreased with rising n supply in 2015 swc exceeded field capacity only at the end of the growing season in the top soil layer significant effects of the co2 and n treatments on swc occurred much more rarely in 2015 than in 2014 because of the high share of water supply coming from coordinated irrigation irrigation was increased with rising n supply and decreased in eco2 plots table 2 adjustment of irrigation to the n treatments was started from mid of may in both years and to eco2 at anthesis in 2014 and two weeks before anthesis in 2015 amounts of irrigation applied to the different n treatments under aco2 ranged from 21 mm to 111 mm in 2014 and from 121 mm to 208 mm in 2015 plots under eco2 received 15 mm less watering under n deficiency and 42 mm less watering under high n seasonal et increased with rising n supply from 225 mm at n1 to 309 mm at n3 when averaged over all years and co2 treatments table 3 the effect of n supply on seasonal et in the aco2 plots was almost similar between both years however in the n2 and n3 treatments the eco2 effect was much stronger in 2015 than in 2014 leading to a significant co2 x n interaction on et in 2015 but not in 2014 table 4 however if the year effect was included into the statistical analysis then there was a significant co2 x n interaction on et but no significant co2 x n x year interaction averaged over both years the eco2 treatment decreased et by 2 at low n and by 10 at excessive n table 5 and 6 3 3 radiation transmitted by the canopy rising n supply stimulated plant growth and thus gai development peak values of gai occurred in june and were similar between both years amounting to ca 2 0 4 5 and 5 5 m2 m 2 under n1 n2 and n3 respectively consequently the effect of n supply on gai influenced radiation transmission to the soil surface fig 4 it decreased until mid of june when light transmission was about 20 under n1 and only about 5 under n2 and n3 the eco2 effect on gai development was relative low and did not influence radiation transmission to the soil surface later in the season the gradual increase of radiation transmission that was observed resulted from the fact that transmission was measured from the green fraction of the canopy which decreased until grain maturity however transmission of the whole canopy rather may have remained unchanged from mid of june until maturity thus the seasonal mean of radiation incident to the soil surface between stem elongation and maturity amounted to ca 30 10 and 6 under n1 n2 and n3 respectively 3 4 above ground biomass production and water use efficiency n supply and co2 enrichment both significantly increased total above ground biomass produced from stem elongation until maturity table 4 and 5 biomass was very similar between both years in the n2 and n3 treatments fig 5 but was slightly higher in 2014 than in 2015 in the n1 treatment which corresponds to the slight differences in fertilizer quantities used in 2014 40 kg n ha 1 and 2015 35 kg n ha 1 eco2 significantly increased biomass production and across both years this effect was 17 under n1 18 under n2 and 15 under n3 table 6 water use efficiency wue was more varied among the different treatments in 2015 than in 2014 fig 6 wue strongly increased with n supply in the 1st year the eco2 effect on wue was slightly larger at the high n levels 24 than at n1 21 in the 2nd year the effect became even greater for the high n levels 34 while under n1 the eco2 effect remained at 21 thus there was a significant co2 x n interaction on wue only in 2015 but when data from both years were subjected to statistical analysis table 5 then there was still a significant co2 x n but not co2 x n x year interaction data averaged over both seasons indicate an increase of wue of 21 under n1 and of 30 under n2 or n3 table 6 4 discussion and conclusions the objective of the present study was to evaluate if and to what extent elevated co2 levels affect the water use of wheat plants under field conditions and whether this is influenced by the n nutrition it is the first study in which this question has been analysed for wheat grown under the temperate climate conditions of central europe the results obtained over two years indicate that eco2 decreased et significantly less under low n 2 than under high n 10 in addition there were clear differences in the co2 response between years regarding the effect of co2 under high n supply plants grown under eco2 and with high n 180 320 kg n ha 1 required up till 6 less water in the 1st year and 15 in the 2nd year our findings in 2014 correspond to the results of a previous two year face study with wheat under warm arid climate conditions in arizona hunsaker et al 2000 in this study the co2 response of et was quite similar between years and the decrease amounted to 1 and 4 under low and high n supply respectively however face studies with other c3 crops grown under high n supply revealed also interannual fluctuation of the effect of eco2 on et varying from 9 up to 16 bernacchi et al 2007 magliulo et al 2003 thus our multi year mean of the face effect on wheat grown under high n 10 is in agreement to the 12 decrease of et observed for potato and soybean bernacchi et al 2007 magliulo et al 2003 and also very close to the values found for c4 crops conley et al 2001 hussain et al 2013 manderscheid et al 2014 accordingly growth of c3 crops will benefit from rising co2 concentrations not only due to an increase of photosynthesis long et al 2004 kimball 2016 but also due to a reduced water demand however climate change will also increase temperature and ozone levels which are likely to have adverse effects on crop growth porter et al 2014 it is commonly agreed to that the decline of et under eco2 finally results from the decrease of stomatal conductance which was found to be slightly more affected under low than high n supply li et al 2004 wall et al 2000 while this effect reduces transpiration at the leaf level in the long term eco2 could increase leaf area resulting in an increase of transpiration at the whole plant level however leaf area index of wheat is only slightly affected by eco2 as observed in the present and also in previous face experiments brooks et al 2000 weigel and manderscheid 2012 measurements of sap flow of main stem tillers of wheat in the arizona face showed that under ample n and water supply face decreased canopy transpiration on average by 15 senock et al 1996 in our experiment this value should be about 18 because of the difference in co2 enrichment levels used in the arizona face and our face study given that under high n supply evaporation accounts for about 10 20 of et in the period from stem elongation until grain maturity chen et al 2010 a 18 decrease of whole plant transpiration without affecting evaporation would theoretically result in an et decrease of 15 this number corresponds to the maximum co2 response observed in the 2nd year of our study and also to the upper values found for soybean and potato bernacchi et al 2007 magliulo et al 2003 in the low n treatment of our study in which leaf area index did not exceed 2 m2 m 2 evaporation may account about 40 50 of et wang et al 2014 consequently et should have been decreased only by about 10 if face decreases canopy transpiration by 18 without affecting evaporation however in our and in the biennial study in arizona hunsaker et al 2000 the eco2 induced decrease of et under n deficiency was considerably lower 1 to 2 than 10 suggesting an increase of evaporation by eco2 under this n level evaporation depends on the fraction of soil surface exposed to sunlight and surface soil moisture the larger contribution of e to et under low than high n results from the less dense canopy and the greater amount of light transmitted to the soil surface in our study light transmission to the soil surface between stem elongation and maturity averaged 30 under low and 10 under high n supply this agrees to findings of a wheat study by chen et al 2010 where effects of row spacing on et were investigated eco2 increases soil moisture primarily in the upper layer as shown here and in previous face studies with wheat burkart et al 2011 hunsaker et al 2000 and other crop species gray et al 2016 magliulo et al 2003 manderscheid et al 2014 since e strongly depends on water content in the upper soil layer it seems obvious that e is increased by eco2 moreover it can be assumed that the stimulation of e under eco2 is greater under sparse canopies of wheat since more radiation energy is available at the soil surface for evaporation of the soil water slight increase of vapour pressure deficit of the canopy air under eco2 as found in a previous study burkart et al 2011 may have also increased evaporation the question remains of what are the reasons for the interannual variation of the co2 response of et under high n supply as found here with winter wheat and in other face studies with soybean and potato bernacchi et al 2007 magliulo et al 2003 bernacchi et al 2007 suggested that water availability over the season may have contributed to the variation between years however in our experiment water supply was strictly controlled and thus quite similar between both years one important difference was that the crop water demand was covered mainly by rainfall in 2014 and by irrigation in 2015 due to the differences in precipitation between the two years this involved that moisture content in the upper soil layer fluctuated stronger in the 1st as compared to the 2nd year because the eco2 effect on soil moisture occurred more frequently in 2014 compared to 2015 it can be assumed that evaporation was stronger increased by eco2 in 2014 than in 2015 and that this process may have contributed to the finding that the eco2 effect on et under high n supply was lower in 2014 6 than in 2015 15 in addition results of et in 2014 may have been confounded by deep drainage of water at the beginning of june when soil water content in 0 40 cm depth shortly exceeded field capacity a rough assessment with the ambav model by the german weather service kersebaum et al 2005 showed about 15 mm leachate for this time in the arizona face experiment hunsaker et al 2000 all different co2 x n treatments received the same irrigation amount until grain filling which occured in april the only exception was that irrigation to the low n treatment was curtailed in may in both years due to accelerated maturity hunsaker et al 2000 given the decrease of canopy transpiration under face based on sap flow measurements senock et al 1996 it is conceivable that this irrigation practice increased soil surface moisture and thus evaporation weakening the effect of eco2 on et this idea is supported by our results of 2015 that irrigation was reduced under eco2 from booting to grain filling while there were hardly any differences in soil water content between the aco2 and eco2 plots hunsaker et al 2000 found similar evaporation under aco2 and eco2 and only a slight difference of evaporation between n deficiency and high n supply however the evaporation rates calculated in their study were generally very low and thus also the percentage contribution of evaporation to et moreover our results are also in contrast to the outcome of a recent study with sixteen wheat simulation models cammarano et al 2016 in which et was predicted to be decreased only by 4 if co2 rises from 360 ppm to 720 ppm moreover it was found that transpiration was only slightly affected 2 and evaporation was not increased but rather decreased 9 under eco2 cammarano et al 2016 in our study water use efficieny wue was defined by biomass production per unit et whereas in the arizona face study wue was based on grain yield per unit et hunsaker et al 2000 both studies indicated that eco2 improved wue stronger under high n than low n supply however in the arizona face study the lower co2 response under n deficiency results from both a smaller effect on et and grain yield hunsaker et al 2000 whereas in our study the lower co2 effect under n deficiency was only from a smaller effect on et in conclusion our face study under temperate climate is consistent with the arizona face study conducted under warm and arid climate hunsaker et al 2000 that eco2 increases soil moisture especially in the upper layer and decreases et the et decrease however was only present for wheat with large canopies but vanished if canopies were sparse due to n deficiency we tried to identify the reasons for the co2 x n interaction on water use and for the interannual variability of the co2 response under high n for both cases we argue that the variation of the co2 response of et might be due to variation of the effect of eco2 not on transpiration but on evaporation it is argued that the increase of soil moisture in the upper layer under face can lead to an increase of evaporation moreover this effect will be stronger under low than under high n since sunlight at the soil surface needed for evaporation is much higher under sparse than under dense canopies these processes finally seem to be responsible for the clear interaction of co2 and n supply on water use efficiency of biomass production which can be increased up to 30 by 200 ppm overall the decrease of et suggests that seasonal water use of well fertilized wheat will improve under eco2 and this might be augmented by agricultural management reducing seasonal evaporation for example subsurface irrigation mulching or controlled deficit irrigation ali and talukder 2008 acknowledgements p braunisch a fuehrer a kremling a luig e schummer r staudte k trenkler

11307,global warming and associated decrease of summer precipitation will intensify the limitation of crop growth through water unavailability in europe concomitantly the rise of atmospheric co2 concentration co2 decreases stomatal conductance and thus transpiration as evident at the leaf level however knowledge about the effect of elevated co2 eco2 on seasonal water use of crops is rather poor in a two year field study winter wheat was grown under ambient co2 393 ppm and eco2 600 ppm using free air co2 enrichment face in addition subplots were established with three levels of nitrogen n supply 35 190 320 kg n ha 1 soil moisture was continuously measured and wheat was irrigated when necessary to keep field capacity at between 50 to 90 evapotranspiration et from stem elongation until maturity was calculated using a soil water balance approach water use efficiency wue was determined from the ratio of aboveground biomass production and et during this period increasing n supply increased canopy size and decreased radiation transmission to the soil surface moreover increasing n supply enhanced biomass production from 771 1569 g m 2 et from 227 to 336 mm and wue from 4 07 to 6 20 g kg 1 biomass was increased under eco2 by 17 among all n levels eco2 increased soil moisture especially in the upper soil layer 0 20 cm and thus irrigation was reduced under eco2 compared to aco2 this effect was intensified by rising n supply leading to a significant co2 n interaction on et and wue thus the eco2 effect was for et 2 9 and 10 and for wue 20 30 and 29 under 35 190 320 kg n ha 1 respectively simultaneously there seems to be a greater increase of evaporation by eco2 under low than high n supply keywords climate change evaporation evapotranspiration free air co2 enrichment face nitrogen fertilization soil water content 1 introduction the anthropogenic rise of the atmospheric co2 level and the related consequences for regional changes in temperature and annual precipitation pattern might intensify the water limitation of crop growth during the vegetation period porter et al 2014 concomitantly the rising atmospheric co2 concentration co2 increases photosynthesis of c3 crops and reduce stomatal conductance and thus transpiration at the leaf level of c3 and c4 crops ainsworth and rogers 2007 however for reliable estimations of the consequences of water shortage on crop growth in future the effect of elevated co2 eco2 on crop water use under field conditions has to be quantified previous co2 enrichment studies with wheat indicated that a rise of co2 of approximately 200 ppm above the ambient co2 decreases stomatal conductance by 30 40 bunce 2004 wall et al 2000 li et al 2004 tausz posch et al 2013 also stomatal response to eco2 was found to be stronger under low than high nitrogen n fertilization li et al 2004 wall et al 2000 the reduction of stomatal conductance and transpiration at the leaf level can be counterbalanced by an increase of leaf area under eco2 this has been observed in controlled environment studies under high but not under low n supply li et al 2004 seneweera and conroy 2005 however if plants were grown in the field under adequate n fertilization effects of eco2 on leaf area index were small brooks et al 2000 weigel and manderscheid 2012 water loss from the canopy is strongly influenced by atmospheric conditions including radiation air humidity and wind speed therefore reliable estimation of the effect of eco2 on canopy transpiration and seasonal water use are ideally possibly if plants are grown under free air co2 enrichment face long et al 2004 in face studies with wheat eco2 decreased canopy transpiration by 15 to 22 senock et al 1996 tausz posch et al 2013 and evapotranspiration et by 4 to 20 burkart et al 2011 kimball et al 1995 hunsaker et al 2000 o leary et al 2015 wang et al 2018 results for water savings by eco2 under n deficiency are variable indicating et reductions of 20 and 2 when estimated from an energy balance approach kimball et al 1999 and from a soil water balance hunsaker et al 2000 respectively water use efficiency of biomass production of wheat was clearly stimulated under face kimball 2016 the size of the effect of eco2 was almost 20 under optimum growth conditions hunsaker et al 2000 however results obtained under limited n supply showed either an enlargement or a mitigation of the co2 effect as compared to the ample n treatment depending on the method used for measuring et hunsaker et al 2000 kimball et al 1999 in a wheat field water flux to the atmosphere includes mainly evaporation from the soil and transpiration through the stomata of the plants and less importantly evaporation of water intercepted by the canopy only transpiration is associated with plant productivity whereas evaporation is considered as an undesired component of et evaporation can contribute 10 to 40 to et in a wheat field caviglia and sadras 2001 chen et al 2010 kool et al 2014 and under normal growth conditions average seasonal evaporation amounts to about 30 of et liu et al 2002 evaporation is controlled by soil water content of the topsoil and the amount of radiation incident to the soil surface the latter depends on leaf area index which determines radiation transmitted to the soil surface the reduction of transpiration under eco2 can result in an increase of soil water content hunsaker et al 1996 burkart et al 2011 thus it is possible that water saved by transpiration under eco2 is wasted by an increase of evaporation since evaporation is much more facilitated under low than high n supply due to the associated changes in canopy size debaeke and aboudrare 2004 it is conceivable that an increase of evaporation as a result of a decrease of transpiration under eco2 is more important under low than under high n supply in a recent study with different wheat growth models the effect of global warming and eco2 on seasonal transpiration and evaporation was estimated cammarano et al 2016 according to this study a doubling of co2 hardly decreases seasonal water use and the effect on seasonal evaporation was even stronger 9 than on transpiration 2 however there was a great varibility among the models regarding the contribution of evaporation to total water use which points to the need of more reliable data for this interaction face experiments addressing et of wheat carried out so far were conducted in an arid hunsaker et al 1996 2000 or a semi arid environment o leary et al 2015 using a water balance or an energy balance approach kimball et al 1999 in the only large scale face study done in the temperate climate zone of central europe et was measured with a canopy chamber which however altered the aerial environment of the plant e g wind speed radiation environment influencing et burkart et al 2011 thus there is a lack of data and knowledge respectively with respect to the effect of eco2 on seasonal et of wheat which is especially true for the temperate climate zone the present paper describes the first study that addresses the effects of face on et and water use efficiency of winter wheat over the main growing seasons of two years under temperate climate conditions combined with three n fertilizer levels severe deficiency adequate and excess n supply the main objective was to quantify the effect of eco2 on et and on water use efficiency and to examine whether the response to eco2 is modified by n fertilization 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and face system the experiment was conducted on a field site 52 18 n 10 26 e 79 m a s l at the thünen institute in braunschweig germany in 2014 and 2015 the mean annual temperature is 9 1 c and the mean annual precipitation is 617 mm the soil is a luvisol of a loamy sand texture 69 sand 24 silt 7 clay in the plough horizon 0 40 cm the soil profile has a depth of about 60 cm 30 cm ap 15 cm al 15 cm bt 60 70 cm cii the lower layers are almost pure sand overall the soil is of low to intermediate fertility and provides a comparatively shallow rooting zone co2 enrichment was carried out by a face system constructed according to the brookhaven national laboratory design lewin et al 1992 three circular plots were equipped each with a free air co2 enrichment apparatus including vertical vent pipes and co2 injection driven by a blower and each with a diameter of 20 m this rings comprised what is termed eco2 treatment three further circular plots without the co2 enrichment apparatus were used as control treatment aco2 the face and ambient rings were set up after crop emergence and removed at grain maturity the target co2 concentration in the face rings was set to 600 ppm the co2 enrichment lasted from the three leaf stage in march until end of grain filling in july table 1 co2 enrichment took place during the daytime hours and was interrupted if wind speed exceeded 6 m s 1 or if air temperature fell below 5 c climate data hourly daily mean values of air temperature global radiation and precipitation measured at 2 m height close to the experimental field site 500 m were provided by the german weather service at braunschweig 2 2 crop management winter wheat triticum aestivum l variety batis was sown at the experimental field site in late autumn with a density of 380 kernels m 2 table 1 crop management measures were performed according to local farm practice with adequate nutrient supply and pesticide applications in each of the face and ambient rings three subplots 3 m 5 m with different n fertilization were randomly established the n treatments comprised three levels of calcium ammonium nitrate deficient n1 adequate n2 excessive n3 the total amount of n fertilizer applied in the two years were 40 35 kg n ha 1 n1 180 200 kg n ha 1 n2 and 320 kg n ha 1 n3 a detailed description of the different n treatments is described elsewhere dier et al 2018 2 3 measurement of soil water content and seasonal water use according to a previous study with the same wheat cultivar at this site the greatest part of roots is in the 0 30 cm topsoil layer pacholsky et al 2015 thus soil water content swc was measured in the 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m soil layer by time domain reflectometry tdr from imko ettlingen germany measurements were done approximately twice per week during the main growing period and in all 18 replicates of the different co2 and n treatments the drained upper and lower limits of plant available volumetric soil water content were 23 and 5 respectively the average of swc in the 0 0 4 m soil profile was used to control water availability and plant water use it was intended to keep the swc within the range of 50 and 90 of field capacity by irrigation to prevent drought and nitrate leaching this was achieved by modelling the soil water budget with the ambav model kersebaum et al 2005 which was done by the agrometerological research station of the german weather service at braunschweig the model runs were continuously controlled and re parameterized if necessary by the regular measurements of swc obtained by the tdr probes irrigation was done with a hand held shower according to the variable water demand of the treatment plots due to the different n and co2 supply it was assumed that the soil profile for plant water uptake was restricted to 0 0 4 m there was no capillary rise to the root zone since ground water level is about 10 m below surface furthermore it was assumed that drainage from the root zone and surface runoff were negligible thus plant water use was calculated using a simple soil water balance et r i dw where et is evapotranspiration r is rainfall i is irrigation and dw is water content change in the root zone 0 0 4 m from stem elongation to maturity this period lasted from 25th april to 17th july in 2014 and from 4th may to 20 july in 2015 respectively 2 4 measurement of light transmission by the green canopy crop growth and water use efficiency fraction of par transmitted by the green canopy ftrans was measured at noon 2 h approximately once per week starting few days before stem elongation the measurements were carried out with the sunscan system deltat devices cambridge uk and included the radiation incident to the canopy j0 and the radiation at the lower limit of the green canopy jc which was visually estimated jc was measured two to four times in each subplot of the different co2 and n treatments ftrans was determined as the ratio of jc to j0 plants were harvested from an area of 0 5 m2 and 1 8 m2 at the beginning of stem elongation and at grain maturity respectively table 1 plant material was dried at 105 c until constant weight and total plant dry weight per ground area was calculated water use efficiency was calculated from the ratio of water use between stem elongation and maturity and the production of above ground dry weight during this period 2 5 statistical analysis the experiment was analyzed as split plot design with the co2 treatment as main plot factor and the n treatment as sub plot factor and f tests were conducted with sas version 9 4 proc mixed if the year was included into the analysis then f tests were implemented as repeated measurements by using the un 1 model for the variance covariance between the years of the random main plot and residual error the un 1 model applies no covariance between the years but allows for different error variances in each year 3 results 3 1 performance of the face system and environmental conditions during the growing seasons co2 enrichment was interrupted for 1 0 of the operational time in 2014 and for 2 6 in 2015 due to high wind speeds the 1 min average co2 was within the range of 600 ppm 10 for 95 6 and 95 7 for the operation time in 2014 and 2015 respectively the average daytime co2 at the ambient air plots was 394 ppm in 2014 and 392 ppm in 2015 daily values of the weather conditions for the main growing season are shown in fig 1 overall the weather conditions were within the long term range of variation of this site with only minor deviations fig 2 in 2014 air temperature was higher in march and april as compared to the long term mean in 2015 rainfall from may to june was only half that of the long term mean 3 2 water supply soil water content and seasonal water use rainfall from stem elongation until maturity was 181 mm in 2014 and 122 mm in 2015 thus irrigation requirement was much greater in 2015 than 2014 table 2 soil water content swc fluctuated more strongly in 2014 than in 2015 due to the differences in precipitation fig 3 in 2015 more than half of the crop water requirement was met by irrigation that was adjusted on the basis of swc in 2014 swc exceeded field capacity several times in the top soil layer and once in the 0 2 0 4 m soil layer at the end of may during an intensive rainfall of 55 mm over three days fig 1 from mid of may to grain maturity swc in the topsoil layer was often significantly higher under eco2 although face plots received less irrigation than ambient plots table 2 there were significant differences in swc among the n levels in the topsoil layer whereby swc decreased with rising n supply in 2015 swc exceeded field capacity only at the end of the growing season in the top soil layer significant effects of the co2 and n treatments on swc occurred much more rarely in 2015 than in 2014 because of the high share of water supply coming from coordinated irrigation irrigation was increased with rising n supply and decreased in eco2 plots table 2 adjustment of irrigation to the n treatments was started from mid of may in both years and to eco2 at anthesis in 2014 and two weeks before anthesis in 2015 amounts of irrigation applied to the different n treatments under aco2 ranged from 21 mm to 111 mm in 2014 and from 121 mm to 208 mm in 2015 plots under eco2 received 15 mm less watering under n deficiency and 42 mm less watering under high n seasonal et increased with rising n supply from 225 mm at n1 to 309 mm at n3 when averaged over all years and co2 treatments table 3 the effect of n supply on seasonal et in the aco2 plots was almost similar between both years however in the n2 and n3 treatments the eco2 effect was much stronger in 2015 than in 2014 leading to a significant co2 x n interaction on et in 2015 but not in 2014 table 4 however if the year effect was included into the statistical analysis then there was a significant co2 x n interaction on et but no significant co2 x n x year interaction averaged over both years the eco2 treatment decreased et by 2 at low n and by 10 at excessive n table 5 and 6 3 3 radiation transmitted by the canopy rising n supply stimulated plant growth and thus gai development peak values of gai occurred in june and were similar between both years amounting to ca 2 0 4 5 and 5 5 m2 m 2 under n1 n2 and n3 respectively consequently the effect of n supply on gai influenced radiation transmission to the soil surface fig 4 it decreased until mid of june when light transmission was about 20 under n1 and only about 5 under n2 and n3 the eco2 effect on gai development was relative low and did not influence radiation transmission to the soil surface later in the season the gradual increase of radiation transmission that was observed resulted from the fact that transmission was measured from the green fraction of the canopy which decreased until grain maturity however transmission of the whole canopy rather may have remained unchanged from mid of june until maturity thus the seasonal mean of radiation incident to the soil surface between stem elongation and maturity amounted to ca 30 10 and 6 under n1 n2 and n3 respectively 3 4 above ground biomass production and water use efficiency n supply and co2 enrichment both significantly increased total above ground biomass produced from stem elongation until maturity table 4 and 5 biomass was very similar between both years in the n2 and n3 treatments fig 5 but was slightly higher in 2014 than in 2015 in the n1 treatment which corresponds to the slight differences in fertilizer quantities used in 2014 40 kg n ha 1 and 2015 35 kg n ha 1 eco2 significantly increased biomass production and across both years this effect was 17 under n1 18 under n2 and 15 under n3 table 6 water use efficiency wue was more varied among the different treatments in 2015 than in 2014 fig 6 wue strongly increased with n supply in the 1st year the eco2 effect on wue was slightly larger at the high n levels 24 than at n1 21 in the 2nd year the effect became even greater for the high n levels 34 while under n1 the eco2 effect remained at 21 thus there was a significant co2 x n interaction on wue only in 2015 but when data from both years were subjected to statistical analysis table 5 then there was still a significant co2 x n but not co2 x n x year interaction data averaged over both seasons indicate an increase of wue of 21 under n1 and of 30 under n2 or n3 table 6 4 discussion and conclusions the objective of the present study was to evaluate if and to what extent elevated co2 levels affect the water use of wheat plants under field conditions and whether this is influenced by the n nutrition it is the first study in which this question has been analysed for wheat grown under the temperate climate conditions of central europe the results obtained over two years indicate that eco2 decreased et significantly less under low n 2 than under high n 10 in addition there were clear differences in the co2 response between years regarding the effect of co2 under high n supply plants grown under eco2 and with high n 180 320 kg n ha 1 required up till 6 less water in the 1st year and 15 in the 2nd year our findings in 2014 correspond to the results of a previous two year face study with wheat under warm arid climate conditions in arizona hunsaker et al 2000 in this study the co2 response of et was quite similar between years and the decrease amounted to 1 and 4 under low and high n supply respectively however face studies with other c3 crops grown under high n supply revealed also interannual fluctuation of the effect of eco2 on et varying from 9 up to 16 bernacchi et al 2007 magliulo et al 2003 thus our multi year mean of the face effect on wheat grown under high n 10 is in agreement to the 12 decrease of et observed for potato and soybean bernacchi et al 2007 magliulo et al 2003 and also very close to the values found for c4 crops conley et al 2001 hussain et al 2013 manderscheid et al 2014 accordingly growth of c3 crops will benefit from rising co2 concentrations not only due to an increase of photosynthesis long et al 2004 kimball 2016 but also due to a reduced water demand however climate change will also increase temperature and ozone levels which are likely to have adverse effects on crop growth porter et al 2014 it is commonly agreed to that the decline of et under eco2 finally results from the decrease of stomatal conductance which was found to be slightly more affected under low than high n supply li et al 2004 wall et al 2000 while this effect reduces transpiration at the leaf level in the long term eco2 could increase leaf area resulting in an increase of transpiration at the whole plant level however leaf area index of wheat is only slightly affected by eco2 as observed in the present and also in previous face experiments brooks et al 2000 weigel and manderscheid 2012 measurements of sap flow of main stem tillers of wheat in the arizona face showed that under ample n and water supply face decreased canopy transpiration on average by 15 senock et al 1996 in our experiment this value should be about 18 because of the difference in co2 enrichment levels used in the arizona face and our face study given that under high n supply evaporation accounts for about 10 20 of et in the period from stem elongation until grain maturity chen et al 2010 a 18 decrease of whole plant transpiration without affecting evaporation would theoretically result in an et decrease of 15 this number corresponds to the maximum co2 response observed in the 2nd year of our study and also to the upper values found for soybean and potato bernacchi et al 2007 magliulo et al 2003 in the low n treatment of our study in which leaf area index did not exceed 2 m2 m 2 evaporation may account about 40 50 of et wang et al 2014 consequently et should have been decreased only by about 10 if face decreases canopy transpiration by 18 without affecting evaporation however in our and in the biennial study in arizona hunsaker et al 2000 the eco2 induced decrease of et under n deficiency was considerably lower 1 to 2 than 10 suggesting an increase of evaporation by eco2 under this n level evaporation depends on the fraction of soil surface exposed to sunlight and surface soil moisture the larger contribution of e to et under low than high n results from the less dense canopy and the greater amount of light transmitted to the soil surface in our study light transmission to the soil surface between stem elongation and maturity averaged 30 under low and 10 under high n supply this agrees to findings of a wheat study by chen et al 2010 where effects of row spacing on et were investigated eco2 increases soil moisture primarily in the upper layer as shown here and in previous face studies with wheat burkart et al 2011 hunsaker et al 2000 and other crop species gray et al 2016 magliulo et al 2003 manderscheid et al 2014 since e strongly depends on water content in the upper soil layer it seems obvious that e is increased by eco2 moreover it can be assumed that the stimulation of e under eco2 is greater under sparse canopies of wheat since more radiation energy is available at the soil surface for evaporation of the soil water slight increase of vapour pressure deficit of the canopy air under eco2 as found in a previous study burkart et al 2011 may have also increased evaporation the question remains of what are the reasons for the interannual variation of the co2 response of et under high n supply as found here with winter wheat and in other face studies with soybean and potato bernacchi et al 2007 magliulo et al 2003 bernacchi et al 2007 suggested that water availability over the season may have contributed to the variation between years however in our experiment water supply was strictly controlled and thus quite similar between both years one important difference was that the crop water demand was covered mainly by rainfall in 2014 and by irrigation in 2015 due to the differences in precipitation between the two years this involved that moisture content in the upper soil layer fluctuated stronger in the 1st as compared to the 2nd year because the eco2 effect on soil moisture occurred more frequently in 2014 compared to 2015 it can be assumed that evaporation was stronger increased by eco2 in 2014 than in 2015 and that this process may have contributed to the finding that the eco2 effect on et under high n supply was lower in 2014 6 than in 2015 15 in addition results of et in 2014 may have been confounded by deep drainage of water at the beginning of june when soil water content in 0 40 cm depth shortly exceeded field capacity a rough assessment with the ambav model by the german weather service kersebaum et al 2005 showed about 15 mm leachate for this time in the arizona face experiment hunsaker et al 2000 all different co2 x n treatments received the same irrigation amount until grain filling which occured in april the only exception was that irrigation to the low n treatment was curtailed in may in both years due to accelerated maturity hunsaker et al 2000 given the decrease of canopy transpiration under face based on sap flow measurements senock et al 1996 it is conceivable that this irrigation practice increased soil surface moisture and thus evaporation weakening the effect of eco2 on et this idea is supported by our results of 2015 that irrigation was reduced under eco2 from booting to grain filling while there were hardly any differences in soil water content between the aco2 and eco2 plots hunsaker et al 2000 found similar evaporation under aco2 and eco2 and only a slight difference of evaporation between n deficiency and high n supply however the evaporation rates calculated in their study were generally very low and thus also the percentage contribution of evaporation to et moreover our results are also in contrast to the outcome of a recent study with sixteen wheat simulation models cammarano et al 2016 in which et was predicted to be decreased only by 4 if co2 rises from 360 ppm to 720 ppm moreover it was found that transpiration was only slightly affected 2 and evaporation was not increased but rather decreased 9 under eco2 cammarano et al 2016 in our study water use efficieny wue was defined by biomass production per unit et whereas in the arizona face study wue was based on grain yield per unit et hunsaker et al 2000 both studies indicated that eco2 improved wue stronger under high n than low n supply however in the arizona face study the lower co2 response under n deficiency results from both a smaller effect on et and grain yield hunsaker et al 2000 whereas in our study the lower co2 effect under n deficiency was only from a smaller effect on et in conclusion our face study under temperate climate is consistent with the arizona face study conducted under warm and arid climate hunsaker et al 2000 that eco2 increases soil moisture especially in the upper layer and decreases et the et decrease however was only present for wheat with large canopies but vanished if canopies were sparse due to n deficiency we tried to identify the reasons for the co2 x n interaction on water use and for the interannual variability of the co2 response under high n for both cases we argue that the variation of the co2 response of et might be due to variation of the effect of eco2 not on transpiration but on evaporation it is argued that the increase of soil moisture in the upper layer under face can lead to an increase of evaporation moreover this effect will be stronger under low than under high n since sunlight at the soil surface needed for evaporation is much higher under sparse than under dense canopies these processes finally seem to be responsible for the clear interaction of co2 and n supply on water use efficiency of biomass production which can be increased up to 30 by 200 ppm overall the decrease of et suggests that seasonal water use of well fertilized wheat will improve under eco2 and this might be augmented by agricultural management reducing seasonal evaporation for example subsurface irrigation mulching or controlled deficit irrigation ali and talukder 2008 acknowledgements p braunisch a fuehrer a kremling a luig e schummer r staudte k trenkler

11308,for an agricultural watershed best management practice bmp is a conservational way to prevent non point source pollution and soil and water loss three bmps including tail water recovery pond conservational tillage and crop rotation were evaluated in order to demonstrate the impacts of bmps on water quality and quantity satellite imagery was used to estimate potential tailwater recovery ponds in this study the soil and water assessment tool swat was applied to evaluate bmps results showed that the use of conservational tillage reduced cumulative sediment total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp yields in the crop rotation scenario analysis it was found that sediment and flow were not sensitive to crop rotation management the corn soybean rotation scenario had higher tn and lower tp yields than those of the continuous corn scenario continuous soybean scenario showed the lowest tn and low tp yields which may because of the higher nitrogen fertilization demands greater crop yield and greater residue of corn than soybean crop based on the swat model simulation results the tailwater ponds can reduce sediment yield and improve groundwater storage keywords best

sub basins were further divided into hydrologic response units hrus based on soil type land use and slope length to define hrus this study used a 5 threshold value for soil type 3 for land use and 5 for slope lengths the input data included the following digital elevation model usgs 1999 soil type from the soil survey geographic database usda 2005 land use and cover data from the united states geological survey usgs land cover institute usda nass 2009 climate information including precipitation temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity from the climate forecast system

annual report mafes 2000 2014mafes 2014mafes 2000 2014 the source of irrigation was the groundwater from each sub basin the total irrigation depth from the tailwater recovery pond was set as 8 89 cm other croplands were set as auto irrigated based on the default requirements for crop water in the swat model the tillage management setting was based on the study of parajuli et al 2013 for the swat hydrologic model calibration the auto calibration program swat cup sufi2 was used to determine the final fitted values of parameters that resulted in the high coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse this was accomplished by comparing the simulated monthly stream flow rate with that of the usgs gage station data manual calibration was applied based on the soil conservation service scs curve number method nrcs 1986 after the auto calibration table 1 summarizes the calibrated parameters and fitted values for the hydrologic model there were three usgs gage stations including merigold sunflower and leland fig 1 which were employed for model calibration in previous studies of bsrw jayakody et al 2014 parajuli et al 2016 in order to take advantage of the long term stream flow data the usgs gage station of big sunflower river near merigold and its corresponding sub basins fig 1 were calibrated from 1998 to 2015 the calibrated parameters were later applied to the model with the boundary of sub basins corresponding to the usgs gage station of bogue phalia near leland for validation fig 1 the model simulation was scaled up to the entire bsrw using all three usgs gage stations for revalidation from 1998 to 2015 the calibrated hydrologic parameters were later applied to the daily water quality model from 2013 to 2015 the calibrated pollutants included tss tn and tp the calibration water quality parameters are listed in table 2 previous studies suggested that some of these parameters can only affect a single pollutant during calibration whereas the other parameters can affect all three santhi et al 2001 white and chaubey 2005 shen et al 2008 therefore the auto calibration process using the swat cup program was repeated for each calibrated pollutant with unique calibration parameters daily observed pollutant data from three usgs gage stations obtained at two week time intervals were used for the model calibration in order to evaluate the impact of tailwater recovery ponds on groundwater level changes it was necessary to validate the simulated groundwater storage change during the irrigation season because the swat model does not simulate changes on the groundwater depth the simulated groundwater storage changes in the shallow aquifer were compared to groundwater level changes from monitoring wells dakhlalla et al 2016 indicated that the groundwater level change equals the ratio of change in the groundwater storage to the specific yield their study used this relationship to validate the groundwater storage simulation in the swat model the groundwater specific yield is not a parameter in swat the solver tool in microsoft excel was used to adjust the specific yield based on the performance of validation evaluated by r2 and nse in this study groundwater level data from 57 monitoring wells provided by yazoo mississippi delta joint water management district ymd measured before and after the irrigation season on april and october respectively were used to validate the model simulated groundwater storage changes from 1998 to 2012 the simulated groundwater storage difference between april and october was compared to the observed groundwater level change two areas one from sub basins 1 4 and another from sub basins 15 and 17 fig 1 in the watershed were selected to validate the model 2 2 estimation of potential tailwater pond as a relatively new bmp constructed in bsrw there is currently no available comprehensive watershed wide data for tailwater recovery ponds in this study the estimation process of the number and location of tailwater ponds consisted of two parts first a method that combined water body detection and spatial characteristics of tailwater recovery was used to estimate the pond a simplified digital density slicing method based on the near infrared nir band campbell and wynne 2011 was used to estimate the water body within bsrw in order to distinguish between cropland and wetland forest the national agriculture imagery program s naip 1 m resolution near infrared images during the crop growing season of 2015 acquired by the united states department of agriculture usda fsa 2015 were applied according to the basic spectral response of water vegetation and other features in the nir region water absorbs more nir energy than vegetation because images were obtained during the crop growing season vegetation had the most reflection of nir energy among water and other features the naip data of bsrw were divided into 278 blocks with grid dimensions of approximately 8 km by 8 km each block was the unit of the density slicing process the gray level divisions of different classes varied by blocks because of the variation of data quality and acquisition date of each block fig 2 shows the histogram of the nir image of one block from 0 90 nir indexes the pixels were assigned to the water body because of its low nir energy reflection from 90 120 the pixels were assigned to all other land uses from 120 255 the pixels were assigned to vegetation because of its high nir energy reflection fig 3 a shows the original naip satellite imagery data fig 3 b shows three classes of pixels including water body vegetation and all other land uses after density slicing the main task was to distinguish cropland and other vegetation land cover within the pixels of vegetation after density slicing for example wetland forest is one of the major land uses in bsrw the main difference between a cropland and wetland forest in level sliced images was that the raster values of cropland were relatively uniform across the farm whereas pixels were unevenly distributed in the wetland forest as a mixture of vegetation and water body pixels to resolve this arcgis was used to estimate croplands as the area with uniform vegetation pixels fig 3 c the estimated cropland layer would be used later for the filtration of potential tailwater pond the estimated water pixels included rivers natural and artificial ponds such as tailwater and catfish ponds and small water bodies in the wetland forest fig 3 d the filtration process was applied to the estimated water bodies to obtain potential tailwater recovery ponds the filtration process included three steps area filtration regular shape filtration and adjacent object filtration the tailwater recovery ponds in this area were mainly used by farmers for one farm or cropland irrigation in this study medium sized ponds from 0 4 to 16 ha were considered as potential tailwater recovery ponds this step was useful for filtering out river fishpond and water pixels in the wetland because of the procedure for the aggregation of water pixels to water bodies some of the water pixels within the wetland forest were falsely considered as water bodies however this type of water body usually had an irregular shape that differed from tailwater ponds in this study the index shown in eq 1 which is the ratio of the perimeter to the area of the estimated water body aided in identifying regular shaped ponds moreover the process of obtaining the index is shown in eqs 2 4 the index less of than 7 indicating a small ratio of the length to the width was summarized from existing tailwater ponds 1 p 2 a 8 4 7 where p and a are the perimeter and area of the water body respectively assuming that the tailwater recovery pond has rectangular shape 2 p 2 a 2 a b 2 a b 3 4 a 2 2 a b b 2 a b 4 4 a b b a 8 where a and b are the length and width of the rectangle respectively the third step in filtration was based the function of tailwater ponds captured tailwater in the pond is used during the irrigation season in order to reduce groundwater use therefore a potential tailwater pond has to be located adjacent to a cropland fig 3 c after the three filtration steps 134 regular shaped medium sized ponds were determined adjacent to the cropland fig 3 d shows the final tailwater ponds in this block a manual calibration of the method was also applied to verify the pond locations on the satellite map after all filtrations 2 3 scenarios setting 2 3 1 tailwater pond the water body in the baseline scenario was simulated as a full pond which indicated that the water body level was at a maximum and constant during the simulation in the tailwater recovery pond scenario the original land use and cover data were updated with tailwater pond locations and corresponding irrigated cropland the nrcs design guidelines on tailwater recovery and on farm storage nrcs usda 2011 require the stored water in the pond to supply a minimum of 8 89 cm deep irrigation for irrigated land based on this requirement and the area of each estimated tailwater pond based on satellite data the area of the irrigated cropland could be estimated the type of irrigated cropland was determined by the type of cropland adjacent to the tailwater pond in order to simulate the tailwater pond in the swat model on a watershed scale a reservoir of the aggregation of tailwater recovery ponds in each sub basin was applied on a sub basin wide scale the reservoir was located at the outlet of each sub basin nielsen et al 2013 used the swat model to simulate a drinking water reservoir in order to assess eutrophication including tn and tp tiessen et al 2011 indicated that the reservoir would averagely reduce tp tn and tss by 10 18 and 70 respectively at the outlet of the reservoir the universal settling rate in all reservoirs were adjusted to values that could result to averages of 10 18 and 70 sediment tn and tp reduction respectively at the outlet of every reservoir the final phosphorus and nitrogen settling rates were set at 0 05 and 0 2 m a respectively the area of each reservoir ranging from 2 5 to 89 ha was considered as the sum of the estimated area of potential tailwater recovery ponds 2 3 2 crop rotation and tillage management in addition to tailwater recovery ponds various tillage operations and crop rotation management practices were evaluated in this study kirsch et al 2002 described the different tillage operation scenario settings using the swat model they considered the scs curve number as the main parameter to represent different tillage scenarios according to arabi et al 2008 and feyereisen et al 2008 the curve number of the conventionally tilled land was set as 6 units lower than conservationally tilled land in this study tillage management and crop rotation scenarios were cross evaluated in eight scenarios as summarized in table 3 the original land use usda nass 2009 with continuous cropping was applied in the baseline scenario all croplands including soybean cotton and others were converted to continuous corn continuous soybean and corn soybean rotation respectively in corresponding scenarios crop rotation management practices were those considered by parajuli et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation 3 1 1 surface water model calibration and validation the percent bias pbias r2 and nse statistical parameters were used to evaluate the model performance table 4 summarizes the model evaluation of the monthly hydrologic model according to moriasi et al 2015 the hydrologic model shows satisfactory performance with r2 and nse up to 0 61 and 0 56 respectively the consistency of the statistical performance in a small area of the watershed indicated that calibration parameters could be used for the whole bsrw fig 4 shows stream flow calibrations from 1998 to 2015 table 5 summarizes the performance of daily water quality simulation for tss tn and tp although the statistics were slightly lower than stream flow calibrations these exhibited a similar trend as the observed data the model performance was acceptable according to other literature tuppad et al 2011 moriasi et al 2015 the aforementioned literature indicated that nse of tn could be as low as 0 2 for a satisfactory model performance moriasi et al 2015 indicated that the model could be considered as having satisfactory performance with a pbias of less than 55 for daily sediment simulation and tn and tp simulations of less than 70 the leland station exhibited the lowest performances for sediment and tn which could be because of the difference in the land use structure between calibration validation areas and bsrw the land use in the calibration sub basins was considerably similar to that in bsrw than in the corresponding validation sub basins with the leland gage usda nass 2009 the scenario analysis in this study was mainly conducted in bsrw 3 1 2 validation of groundwater level change during irrigation season fig 5 shows the validation results of groundwater level change during the irrigation season the values of r2 were 0 68 and 0 52 and those of nse were 0 44 and 0 43 respectively for the two regions shown in fig 1 the optimal specific yield value was estimated as 0 17 using the solver tool in microsoft excel brown 1947 indicated that the aquifer in the study area is mixed sand and gravel with a specific yield of 0 1 0 45 gupta 2008 3 2 tillage management and crop rotation fig 6 shows nutrient and sediment losses to the stream resulting from scenarios a and b at the outlet of bsrw for the stream flow comparison of scenarios a and b fig 6 a the monthly runoff was reduced from 5 to 53 in the conservational tillage scenario compared to that in the conventional tillage scenario from 2013 to 2015 in order to evaluate the long term difference between conventional and conservational tillage scenarios cumulative tn tp and sediment are shown in fig 6 c d and b respectively the results indicated that approximately 30 18 and 20 tn sediment and tp respectively were additionally lost to the stream because of scenario a as compared to those of scenario b kirsch et al 2002 indicated that there could be 14 less loss of phosphorus because of the tillage improvement with nutrient control compared to that of the baseline the higher reduction may be caused by differences among nutrient sources considered in the study this investigation considered nutrient loss from the non point source whereas kirsch et al 2002 considered nutrient loss from both point and non point sources comparisons of scenarios between c and d e and f and g and h indicated similar results as that obtained from the comparison between a and b fig 7 shows comparisons made between scenarios a c e and g the cumulative tn yield in the corn soybean rotation scenario was 40 lower than that in the continuous corn scenario fig 7 a the low tn loss to the stream from the continuous soybean scenario resulted from the lower amount of nitrogen fertilizer application rate to soybeans mafes 2000 2014mafes 2014mafes 2000 2014 the differences in sediment losses to the stream between scenarios a c e and g were not visually different as tn and tp there was an 11 higher cumulative tp yield in the corn soybean rotation scenario than there was in the continuous corn scenario fig 7 b the test of phosphorus extracted from the grain conducted by eghball et al 2003 suggested that corn would be the more effective crop in terms of reducing soil phosphorus than soybean because of differences among magnitudes of crop yields parajuli et al 2013 this indicated that the amount of phosphorus in the corn residue might be greater than that in the soybean residue the tillage operation was applied before crop planting instead of after harvesting the phosphorus in the residue can be returned to the soil via degradation the continuous soybean ss had a 31 lower phosphorus loss than that of continuous corn cc and 38 lower than that of corn soybean rotation cs fig 8 shows the temporal difference among the three crop rotation scenarios there was more phosphorus lost to the stream in the cs scenario compared to those of cc and ss during the soybean year this indicated that corn production affected the phosphorus yield in the cs scenario during that year the reason may be that there was a larger amount of corn residuals than soybean residuals left on the field during the simulation one of the phosphorus sources considered in the swat model was crop residual even though there was no phosphorus fertilizer during the corn year the phosphorus left from corn residuals resulted to a large amount of available phosphorus in the soil in the second year crop soybean had less phosphorus removal ability because of its lesser yield compared to corn the excess soil phosphorus may be lost to the stream through runoff thus the cumulative tp yield was simulated to be larger in the corn soybean rotation scenario compared with those of other scenarios 3 3 tailwater recovery pond the reservoir function in the swat model was used to simulate the impact of tailwater recovery ponds on the monthly average stream flow fig 9 the stream flow was slightly affected by reservoirs in 19 of 22 sub basins the results showed that reservoirs could reduce stream flow by 2 6 the summer season stream flow was affected more than that of other seasons with an average of 5 flow reduction fig 10 shows the monthly average sediment concentration at the watershed outlet the sediment concentration was slightly affected by reservoirs different from the stream flow there was more reduction in the sediment concentration during the fall season than during the other seasons the reduction rates were from 3 to 20 depending on reservoir size and season fig 11 shows the groundwater storage rate of increase in each sub basin in the tailwater pond scenario compared to that of the baseline scenario the increase rate ranged from 0 to 20 there was a greater increase in the groundwater storage in sub basins with larger reservoirs this indicated that the use of reservoirs for irrigation can potentially reduce groundwater use and mitigate the groundwater level depletion caused by irrigation at a certain amount 4 conclusion the model showed better performance in simulating the monthly stream flow in the hydrologic model compared with daily water quality indicators in the evaluation of bmps the use of conservational tillage operation reduced stream flow by up to 53 compared to that in the conventional tillage scenario from 2013 to 2015 the use of conservational tillage reduced cumulative sediment tn and tp yields similar to those reported by other studies kanwar et al 1988 sharpley et al 1994 tuppad et al 2010 in the crop rotation scenario analysis it was found that sediment and flow were not sensitive to crop rotation management the corn soybean rotation scenario had higher tn and lower tp yields than those of the continuous corn scenario the lower tn loss in the continuous soybean scenario was because of the application of lower amounts of nitrogen fertilizer during the growing season satellite imagery was a good source of data to estimate water bodies that could be used as tailwater recovery ponds the swat model simulation results determined that tailwater recovery ponds reduced sediment yields up to 20 and helped improve the groundwater storage acknowledgements we would like to acknowledge the partial financial support

11308,for an agricultural watershed best management practice bmp is a conservational way to prevent non point source pollution and soil and water loss three bmps including tail water recovery pond conservational tillage and crop rotation were evaluated in order to demonstrate the impacts of bmps on water quality and quantity satellite imagery was used to estimate potential tailwater recovery ponds in this study the soil and water assessment tool swat was applied to evaluate bmps results showed that the use of conservational tillage reduced cumulative sediment total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp yields in the crop rotation scenario analysis it was found that sediment and flow were not sensitive to crop rotation management the corn soybean rotation scenario had higher tn and lower tp yields than those of the continuous corn scenario continuous soybean scenario showed the lowest tn and low tp yields which may because of the higher nitrogen fertilization demands greater crop yield and greater residue of corn than soybean crop based on the swat model simulation results the tailwater ponds can reduce sediment yield and improve groundwater storage keywords best

simulation in the swat model the groundwater specific yield is not a parameter in swat the solver tool in microsoft excel was used to adjust the specific yield based on the performance of validation evaluated by r2 and nse in this study groundwater level data from 57 monitoring wells provided by yazoo mississippi delta joint water management district ymd measured before and after the irrigation season on april and october respectively were used to validate the model simulated groundwater storage changes from 1998 to 2012 the simulated groundwater storage difference between april and october was compared to the observed groundwater level change two areas one from sub basins 1 4 and another from sub basins 15 and 17 fig 1 in the watershed were selected to validate the model 2 2 estimation of potential tailwater pond as a relatively new bmp constructed in bsrw there is currently no available comprehensive watershed wide data for tailwater recovery ponds in this study the estimation process of the number and location of tailwater ponds consisted of two parts first a method that combined water body detection and spatial characteristics of tailwater recovery was used to estimate the pond a simplified digital density slicing method based on the near infrared nir band campbell and wynne 2011 was used to estimate the water body within bsrw in order to distinguish between cropland and wetland forest the national agriculture imagery program s naip 1 m resolution near infrared images during the crop growing season of 2015 acquired by the united states department of agriculture usda fsa 2015 were applied according to the basic spectral response of water vegetation and other features in the nir region water absorbs more nir energy than vegetation because images were obtained during the crop growing season vegetation had the most reflection of nir energy among water and other features the naip data of bsrw were divided into 278 blocks with grid dimensions of approximately 8 km by 8 km each block was the unit of the density slicing process the gray level divisions of different classes varied by blocks because of the variation of data quality and acquisition date of each block fig 2 shows the histogram of the nir image of one block from 0 90 nir indexes the pixels were assigned to the water body because of its low nir energy reflection from 90 120 the pixels were assigned to all other land uses from 120 255 the pixels were assigned to vegetation because of its high nir energy reflection fig 3 a shows the original naip satellite imagery data fig 3 b shows three classes of pixels including water body vegetation and all other land uses after density slicing the main task was to distinguish cropland and other vegetation land cover within the pixels of vegetation after density slicing for example wetland forest is one of the major land uses in bsrw the main difference between a cropland and wetland forest in level sliced images was that the raster values of cropland were relatively uniform across the farm whereas pixels were unevenly distributed in the wetland forest as a mixture of vegetation and water body pixels to resolve this arcgis was used to estimate croplands as the area with uniform vegetation pixels fig 3 c the estimated cropland layer would be used later for the filtration of potential tailwater pond the estimated water pixels included rivers natural and artificial ponds such as tailwater and catfish ponds and small water bodies in the wetland forest fig 3 d the filtration process was applied to the estimated water bodies to obtain potential tailwater recovery ponds the filtration process included three steps area filtration regular shape filtration and adjacent object filtration the tailwater recovery ponds in this area were mainly used by farmers for one farm or cropland irrigation in this study medium sized ponds from 0 4 to 16 ha were considered as potential tailwater recovery ponds this step was useful for filtering out river fishpond and water pixels in the wetland because of the procedure for the aggregation of water pixels to water bodies some of the water pixels within the wetland forest were falsely considered as water bodies however this type of water body usually had an irregular shape that differed from tailwater ponds in this study the index shown in eq 1 which is the ratio of the perimeter to the area of the estimated water body aided in identifying regular shaped ponds moreover the process of obtaining the index is shown in eqs 2 4 the index less of than 7 indicating a small ratio of the length to the width was summarized from existing tailwater ponds 1 p 2 a 8 4 7 where p and a are the perimeter and area of the water body respectively assuming that the tailwater recovery pond has rectangular shape 2 p 2 a 2 a b 2 a b 3 4 a 2 2 a b b 2 a b 4 4 a b b a 8 where a and b are the length and width of the rectangle respectively the third step in filtration was based the function of tailwater ponds captured tailwater in the pond is used during the irrigation season in order to reduce groundwater use therefore a potential tailwater pond has to be located adjacent to a cropland fig 3 c after the three filtration steps 134 regular shaped medium sized ponds were determined adjacent to the cropland fig 3 d shows the final tailwater ponds in this block a manual calibration of the method was also applied to verify the pond locations on the satellite map after all filtrations 2 3 scenarios setting 2 3 1 tailwater pond the water body in the baseline scenario was simulated as a full pond which indicated that the water body level was at a maximum and constant during the simulation in the tailwater recovery pond scenario the original land use and cover data were updated with tailwater pond locations and corresponding irrigated cropland the nrcs design guidelines on tailwater recovery and on farm storage nrcs usda 2011 require the stored water in the pond to supply a minimum of 8 89 cm deep irrigation for irrigated land based on this requirement and the area of each estimated tailwater pond based on satellite data the area of the irrigated cropland could be estimated the type of irrigated cropland was determined by the type of cropland adjacent to the tailwater pond in order to simulate the tailwater pond in the swat model on a watershed scale a reservoir of the aggregation of tailwater recovery ponds in each sub basin was applied on a sub basin wide scale the reservoir was located at the outlet of each sub basin nielsen et al 2013 used the swat model to simulate a drinking water reservoir in order to assess eutrophication including tn and tp tiessen et al 2011 indicated that the reservoir would averagely reduce tp tn and tss by 10 18 and 70 respectively at the outlet of the reservoir the universal settling rate in all reservoirs were adjusted to values that could result to averages of 10 18 and 70 sediment tn and tp reduction respectively at the outlet of every reservoir the final phosphorus and nitrogen settling rates were set at 0 05 and 0 2 m a respectively the area of each reservoir ranging from 2 5 to 89 ha was considered as the sum of the estimated area of potential tailwater recovery ponds 2 3 2 crop rotation and tillage management in addition to tailwater recovery ponds various tillage operations and crop rotation management practices were evaluated in this study kirsch et al 2002 described the different tillage operation scenario settings using the swat model they considered the scs curve number as the main parameter to represent different tillage scenarios according to arabi et al 2008 and feyereisen et al 2008 the curve number of the conventionally tilled land was set as 6 units lower than conservationally tilled land in this study tillage management and crop rotation scenarios were cross evaluated in eight scenarios as summarized in table 3 the original land use usda nass 2009 with continuous cropping was applied in the baseline scenario all croplands including soybean cotton and others were converted to continuous corn continuous soybean and corn soybean rotation respectively in corresponding scenarios crop rotation management practices were those considered by parajuli et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation 3 1 1 surface water model calibration and validation the percent bias pbias r2 and nse statistical parameters were used to evaluate the model performance table 4 summarizes the model evaluation of the monthly hydrologic model according to moriasi et al 2015 the hydrologic model shows satisfactory performance with r2 and nse up to 0 61 and 0 56 respectively the consistency of the statistical performance in a small area of the watershed indicated that calibration parameters could be used for the whole bsrw fig 4 shows stream flow calibrations from 1998 to 2015 table 5 summarizes the performance of daily water quality simulation for tss tn and tp although the statistics were slightly lower than stream flow calibrations these exhibited a similar trend as the observed data the model performance was acceptable according to other literature tuppad et al 2011 moriasi et al 2015 the aforementioned literature indicated that nse of tn could be as low as 0 2 for a satisfactory model performance moriasi et al 2015 indicated that the model could be considered as having satisfactory performance with a pbias of less than 55 for daily sediment simulation and tn and tp simulations of less than 70 the leland station exhibited the lowest performances for sediment and tn which could be because of the difference in the land use structure between calibration validation areas and bsrw the land use in the calibration sub basins was considerably similar to that in bsrw than in the corresponding validation sub basins with the leland gage usda nass 2009 the scenario analysis in this study was mainly conducted in bsrw 3 1 2 validation of groundwater level change during irrigation season fig 5 shows the validation results of groundwater level change during the irrigation season the values of r2 were 0 68 and 0 52 and those of nse were 0 44 and 0 43 respectively for the two regions shown in fig 1 the optimal specific yield value was estimated as 0 17 using the solver tool in microsoft excel brown 1947 indicated that the aquifer in the study area is mixed sand and gravel with a specific yield of 0 1 0 45 gupta 2008 3 2 tillage management and crop rotation fig 6 shows nutrient and sediment losses to the stream resulting from scenarios a and b at the outlet of bsrw for the stream flow comparison of scenarios a and b fig 6 a the monthly runoff was reduced from 5 to 53 in the conservational tillage scenario compared to that in the conventional tillage scenario from 2013 to 2015 in order to evaluate the long term difference between conventional and conservational tillage scenarios cumulative tn tp and sediment are shown in fig 6 c d and b respectively the results indicated that approximately 30 18 and 20 tn sediment and tp respectively were additionally lost to the stream because of scenario a as compared to those of scenario b kirsch et al 2002 indicated that there could be 14 less loss of phosphorus because of the tillage improvement with nutrient control compared to that of the baseline the higher reduction may be caused by differences among nutrient sources considered in the study this investigation considered nutrient loss from the non point source whereas kirsch et al 2002 considered nutrient loss from both point and non point sources comparisons of scenarios between c and d e and f and g and h indicated similar results as that obtained from the comparison between a and b fig 7 shows comparisons made between scenarios a c e and g the cumulative tn yield in the corn soybean rotation scenario was 40 lower than that in the continuous corn scenario fig 7 a the low tn loss to the stream from the continuous soybean scenario resulted from the lower amount of nitrogen fertilizer application rate to soybeans mafes 2000 2014mafes 2014mafes 2000 2014 the differences in sediment losses to the stream between scenarios a c e and g were not visually different as tn and tp there was an 11 higher cumulative tp yield in the corn soybean rotation scenario than there was in the continuous corn scenario fig 7 b the test of phosphorus extracted from the grain conducted by eghball et al 2003 suggested that corn would be the more effective crop in terms of reducing soil phosphorus than soybean because of differences among magnitudes of crop yields parajuli et al 2013 this indicated that the amount of phosphorus in the corn residue might be greater than that in the soybean residue the tillage operation was applied before crop planting instead of after harvesting the phosphorus in the residue can be returned to the soil via degradation the continuous soybean ss had a 31 lower phosphorus loss than that of continuous corn cc and 38 lower than that of corn soybean rotation cs fig 8 shows the temporal difference among the three crop rotation scenarios there was more phosphorus lost to the stream in the cs scenario compared to those of cc and ss during the soybean year this indicated that corn production affected the phosphorus yield in the cs scenario during that year the reason may be that there was a larger amount of corn residuals than soybean residuals left on the field during the simulation one of the phosphorus sources considered in the swat model was crop residual even though there was no phosphorus fertilizer during the corn year the phosphorus left from corn residuals resulted to a large amount of available phosphorus in the soil in the second year crop soybean had less phosphorus removal ability because of its lesser yield compared to corn the excess soil phosphorus may be lost to the stream through runoff thus the cumulative tp yield was simulated to be larger in the corn soybean rotation scenario compared with those of other scenarios 3 3 tailwater recovery pond the reservoir function in the swat model was used to simulate the impact of tailwater recovery ponds on the monthly average stream flow fig 9 the stream flow was slightly affected by reservoirs in 19 of 22 sub basins the results showed that reservoirs could reduce stream flow by 2 6 the summer season stream flow was affected more than that of other seasons with an average of 5 flow reduction fig 10 shows the monthly average sediment concentration at the watershed outlet the sediment concentration was slightly affected by reservoirs different from the stream flow there was more reduction in the sediment concentration during the fall season than during the other seasons the reduction rates were from 3 to 20 depending on reservoir size and season fig 11 shows the groundwater storage rate of increase in each sub basin in the tailwater pond scenario compared to that of the baseline scenario the increase rate ranged from 0 to 20 there was a greater increase in the groundwater storage in sub basins with larger reservoirs this indicated that the use of reservoirs for irrigation can potentially reduce groundwater use and mitigate the groundwater level depletion caused by irrigation at a certain amount 4 conclusion the model showed better performance in simulating the monthly stream flow in the hydrologic model compared with daily water quality indicators in the evaluation of bmps the use of conservational tillage operation reduced stream flow by up to 53 compared to that in the conventional tillage scenario from 2013 to 2015 the use of conservational tillage reduced cumulative sediment tn and tp yields similar to those reported by other studies kanwar et al 1988 sharpley et al 1994 tuppad et al 2010 in the crop rotation scenario analysis it was found that sediment and flow were not sensitive to crop rotation management the corn soybean rotation scenario had higher tn and lower tp yields than those of the continuous corn scenario the lower tn loss in the continuous soybean scenario was because of the application of lower amounts of nitrogen fertilizer during the growing season satellite imagery was a good source of data to estimate water bodies that could be used as tailwater recovery ponds the swat model simulation results determined that tailwater recovery ponds reduced sediment yields up to 20 and helped improve the groundwater storage acknowledgements we would like to acknowledge the partial financial support

11309,the insufficiency water for irrigation is becoming the most vital problem for corn productivity in semi arid areas thus the improvement of water saving farming strategies is important to work out the water deficiency problem that affects maize productivity in semi arid regions a field research work was conducted during 2011 12 in a semi arid area of pakistan to clarify the interactive effects of soil amendments and irrigation levels on the maize yields water use efficiency evapotranspiration and total dry matter accumulations we tested the following five soil amendments farm yard manure at 5 t ha 1 wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 gypsum at 1 t ha 1 qemyisol at 10 kg ha 1 humic acid at 20 kg ha 1 with two irrigation levels 350 mm and 175 mm and traditional planting with no irrigation ck respectively the results clearly indicated that soil amendment such as wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 with irrigation 350 mm could enhance the soil water availability in 0 100 cm during the key growth stages as well as grain yields significant increased by 62 water use efficiency wue and rainfall use efficiency rue were improved by 35 and 50 as compared with ck1 respectively as the amount of irrigation increased the irrigation water use efficiency iwue irrigation water productivity iwp decreased but the maize yields and net economic benefit tended to increase the economic analysis also suggested that higher 45 of net economic benefits could be obtained by using wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 as soil amendment with irrigation 350 mm as compared with ck1 treatment therefore our research work recommended that wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 with 350 mm irrigation level is a suitable treatment for efficient consumption of local rainfall and increase maize productivity in semi arid regions because it improves the wue rue and reduces et levels thereby enhancing the grain yield net profit and to reduce the risk of maize productivity in semi arid regions keywords soil amendments irrigation water use efficiency biomass evapotranspiration economic benefit 1 introduction the mismanagement of irrigation water thought out the world in general and pakistan in particular at a farm level has caused a potential threat to the crop production because of its limited availability baozhen et al 2015 wakchaure et al 2016 due to water shortage or drought winter wheat yield was decrease 10 29 as compared with no water stress jianguo et al 2014 higher soil moisture depletion and highest wue 18 9 kg mm 1 ha 1 were recorded under limited irrigation as compared with rain fed conditions giri et al 2009 luis et al 2012 corn yields losses due to water scarcity stress ranges from 20 to 85 which indicated that water scarcity is one of the key concerns that affecting maize production in semi arid regions fang et al 2010 water conservation within a field has been recognized one of the most important concerns throughout the world chris 2011 it includes the incorporation of crop residues or farm yard manure and the recent introduction of qemisoyl humic acid gypsum and other organic and inorganic sources that help in improving of soil moisture retentive capacity and consequently increase crop yield wallace and nelson 1986 soil amendments both synthetic and natural greatly contribute to provide a reservoir of soil water to plants on demand in the upper layers within the soil where the root systems normally develop johnson and leah 1990 qemisoyl served as buffers against temporary water stress and decrease of evaporation through limited movement of water from the sub surface to the surface layer de boodt 1990 qemisoyl is highly cross linked polyacrylamides with 40 of the amides hydrolyzed to carboxylic groups azzam 1980 qemisoyl did not interact directly with the soil matrices but formed aqueous gels and act as water reservoirs for the root zone of plants azzam 1980 wallace and nelson 1986 the roots to the plant grow through the matrix of these hydro gelled particles and draw water from them when required ouchi et al 1989 and bouranis et al 1995 have shown that water held by qemisoyl is completely available to plants crop residues can improve soil physical properties conserving soil moisture and controlling weeds baozhen et al 2015 guangshuai et al 2016 revealed that wheat residues increased soil humus content increased rainfall infiltration conserve moisture water holding capacity and cation exchange capacity wheat residues supply plant nutrients to the subsequent crops due to decomposition shuo et al 2016 huang et al 2005 reported that wheat crop straw with 3 75 4 5 t ha 1 are an effective measure to reduce evaporation and water consumption farm yard manure is another cheap and organic source of plant nutrient which increased water holding capacity of soil rasool et al 2005 therefore the use of fym with limited irrigation could slowly increase soil water content and crop production mwangi 2010 gypsum used a worldwide soil amendment wallace and nelson 1986 can decrease soil crusting develop rainfall permeation water transmission conductivity increased water absorption improved n recovery from subsoil farina et al 2000 gypsum increases water infiltration as compared to the control plot as a result improves water retention in soil and enhances water use efficiency yangyuoru et al 2006

out during 2011 12 at new developmental farm of the university of agriculture peshawar pakistan the trial site was located at a longitude of 71 30 e and latitude of 34 00 n at an elevation of 510 m above sea level the climatic conditions of the study station were illustrated as a semi arid area with a warm temperate climate and an annual mean evaporation rate of 1844 mm the annual mean rainfall 460 mm year 1 where over 60 of the precipitation occurred in july september the amounts of precipitation during june september were 335 mm in 2011 and 362 mm in 2012 the monthly rainfall distributions during the two year of maize growing seasons are shown in fig 1 in the 2012 growing season the rainfall was well distributed with 52 mm in june 100 mm in july 120 mm in august and 90 mm in september while in 2011 the levels were 61 73 143 and 58 mm in the same months respectively fig 1 the field experimental was conducted on a flat field according to the fao unesco soil classification fao unesco 1993 the soil at the experimental site was a calcic cambisol sand 14 silt 26 and clay 60 with relatively low fertility selected physics chemical properties of the experimental site are shown in table

stage of maize is listed in table 2 the irrigation volumes of 350 and 175 mm were measured according to the irrigation area all the farm yard manure and wheat crop residue were applied before planting while gypsum qemyisol and humic acid were applied at the time of planting respectively nitrogen was applied at 120 kg ha 1 at the same time in all experimental treatments p and k fertilizers were applied at 90 and 40 kg ha 1 maize genotype azam was planted at a rate of 66 666 plants ha 1 seeds were sown on june 10 for the 2011 planting year and june 9 for 2012 with the seed rate of 30 kg ha 1

tended of sws gradually improved 3 2 et and wue the seasonal maize et was directly and positively related to the seasonal rainfall distribution soil amendments and irrigation levels there were obvious differences in et among the treatments table 3 the soil amendments with different irrigation levels led to higher et rates as compared with the conventional planting with 0 mm irrigation due to

cr350 treatment produced a significantly higher 61 leaf area 3482 cm 2 plant 1 than those with ck1 treatment during both maize growing seasons the leaf area plant 1 was affected significantly by the soil amendment such as wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 with 350 mm irrigation moreover the data indicated that the soil amendments had a significant effect on the leaf area plant 1 under both irrigation levels the aboveground dry matter g plant 1 was affected significantly p 0 05 fig 3 by the different soil amendments with irrigation with cr350 treatment had a significantly maximum dry matter g plant 1 during the different maize growth stages except 30 60 dap compared with the traditional planting with 0 mm irrigation ck during the early maize growth stages 30 60 dap there were no significant differences were observed between different soil amendments and irrigation levels however the maize grew faster in the middle growth stage 60 120 dap and gradually in the late growth stage 120 140 dap with the cr350 treatment thus the cr350 treatment produced a significantly maximum total dry matters plant 1 at 140 dap respectively compared with all other treatments in 2011 12 the mean maize biomass yield with the cr350 ha350 fym350 qem350 and gyp350 significantly increased by 4 76 t ha 1 46 4 57 t ha 1 44 4 50 t ha 1 44 3 80 t ha 1 37 and 3 66 t ha 1 36 compared with ck1 treatments

treatments cr350 treatment had the highest rate 45 of income return as compared with ck 1 2 treatment 4 discussion the semi arid areas of northwest in pakistan are highly affected by seasonal variations in the amount of rainfall and its distribution during various maize growth stages the average annual precipitation over 40 years is about 342 mm but water evaporation exceeds 950 mm and thus overcoming this problem and provide water for agricultural production is a very important issue according to grassini et al 2009 luis et al 2012 in this research work we found that different soil amendments with irrigation levels significantly improved growth yields and wue in the semi arid regions thus we confirmed that different soil amendments with irrigation levels had significant effects on the soil water storage iwue iwp net profit and maize yields previous studies have suggested that using wheat crop residue as soil amendment suppresses the evaporation of rainfall and irrigation water which can be used to improve the crop water usage in a quantitative manner thereby improving the maize yields wue and rue chris 2011 zhang et al 2015 yonggan et al 2014 found that the using wheat crop residue as soil amendment improved the soil moisture contents of the topsoil as compared with traditional planting with no irrigation with an increased soil moisture content of 10 4 19 7 the crop et rate increased with plant growth and development but the moderate water stress with the soil amendments treated plots ensured the successful vegetative growth of maize crop deng et al 2006 and luis et al 2012 confirmed that using wheat straw as a mulch obtained a higher water storage capacity than that no mulch plots i e an improvement of 33 7 39 7 mm where the yield increased by up to 63 and the wue by 5 3 12 5 kg mm 1 ha 1 lenka et al 2009 revealed that the maize yields were positively correlated to the et rate zizhong and zenghui 2016 also reported a significant increase in et due to the increasing irrigation amount frosm 375 m3 ha 1 to 750 m3 ha 1 the higher daily transpiration rates during the silking stage may be attributable to the greater soil water extraction capacity of the roots under the soil amendments treatments and the maximum evaporation capacity of the crop canopy under traditional planting with no irrigation zengjiang et al 2015 we also found that the corn biomass grain yield and et were affected significantly by the different soil amendments with irrigations tables 2 and 3 the soil amendments with different irrigation levels obtained higher maize biomass and grain yields compared with traditional planting with no irrigation the seasonal et of maize was directly and positively correlated with the seasonal rainfall distribution and irrigation levels there were obvious differences in et among the different treatments table 3 shuo et al 2016 showed that using of wheat straw as mulch can normalize the rate of water usage during different growth stages in maize thereby improving the maize yield and et wheat straw use as a mulching should decrease evaporation from the topsoil layer as well as decreasing the total water consumption thereby positively affecting the maize yield and wue chen et al 2012 it has been reported that the moisture contents are higher under soil amendments treatments as compared with control treatment cai 2011 zhang et al 2015 thereby enhancing the total green leaf area and dry matter per plant huang et al 2005 wang et al 2009 wu et al 2015 and luis et al 2012 also confirm that supply 450 mm irrigation with 8 t fym ha 1 could increase the total green leaf area and dry matter per plant during the dry and rainy seasons respectively in the present study we found that using of soil amendment such as wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 with 350 mm irrigation significantly increased the leaf area and total dry matter plant 1 under both irrigation levels the wue characterized the association between the grain yield and total et increased irrigation level increases the maize yield but there was no significant increase in et which indicated that irrigation could effectively increase the crop water consumption relative to the total proportion of farmland water thereby improving the agricultural wue and rue luis et al 2012 and zhang et al 2015 showed that grain yield significantly increased with increasing wheat crop residue from 2 to 3 5 t ha 1 wheat straw mulching could improve soil fertility status which improves soil water content and nutrient holding capacity as a result biomass and grain yields increased this development maybe occurred because crop straw can reduce the evaporation from a subsoil surface thus significantly reduce soil water evaporation which considerably increase the sws chris 2011 huang et al 2005 shuo et al 2016 indicated that the applied wheat straw as a mulch improved the wue rue and obtained a high yield soil moisture mainly improves the soil nutrient availability which promotes crop nutrient absorption and utilization ren et al 2008 demonstrated that irrigation amount of 440 340 and 230 mm increased the wue by 77 4 43 1 and 9 5 respectively compared with control plots the growth of maize in furrows and covered with fym or wheat crop residues clearly reduced the et rate and enhanced the wue according to mina et al 2011 mulching of wheat straw is the most excellent ways of increasing water preservation in the soil and reducing evaporation cai 2011 luis et al 2012 maize crop grew under rain fid condition could reduce biomass and grain yield up to 30 it may be due to insufficiency water at various growth stages and improve inter plant competition as a result decrease maize yields peake et al 2016 the use of irrigation in semi arid areas can improve the crop growth conditions and increase the productivity and wue chris 2011 luis et al 2012 wu et al 2015 but the iwue and iwp are affected by the irrigation amounts whereas a low irrigation amount tends to obtain a high iwue and iwp whereas a high irrigation amount leads to a lower iwue and iwp as the amount of irrigation increased the iwue iwp decreased but the maize yields and net economic benefit tended to increase the mean results also confirmed that as the amount of irrigation increased the iwue iwp decreased but the maize yields and net economic benefit tended to increase the net economic profit is the most useful indicators for evaluating crop management strategies in semi arid regions our economic analysis also suggested that there was highest rate 45 of income return by using wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 as soil amendment with irrigation 350 mm therefore our results suggest that the cr350 treatment is the best option amongst those examined treatments for maize productivity in the semi arid region due to the enhancements of the wue rue and total dry matter accumulation plant 1 thereby obtaining higher grain yield more profit and reducing the risk of maize production in semi arid regions future study is needed to investigate the economic trade off between different levels of wheat residue and how much extra livestock feed the farmer has to buy under different irrigation levels 5 conclusions production of maize crop in semiarid regions of pakistan depends on rainwater and water saving strategy is essential for crop productivity thus the improvement of water saving farming strategies is important to solve the deficiency of water that affects maize productivity in semi arid regions soil amendments in combination of irrigation could have a significant effect on soil water content retention corn yields as well as the growth wue rue and et levels the result of present research work clearly indicated that soil amendment such as wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 with irrigation 350 mm could enhance the soil water availability during the vital growth stages as well as maize yields significant increased by 62 wue and rue were improved by 35 and 50 as compared with ck1 treatment farmers who access to sufficient irrigation water by applying a wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 can enhance the maize yields and can get adequate profit from their investment however irrigation water is often limited and not available at entire growth stages the same quantity of wheat crop straw at 5 t ha 1 must be used to maximize the yields and economic profit as the amount of irrigation increased the iwue iwp decreased but the yield and net economic benefit tended to increase the economic analysis also suggested that greater 45 net economic benefits could be obtained by using soil amendment such as wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 with irrigation 350 mm therefore our research work recommended that cr350 is best of the examined options for maize production in semi arid regions because it improves the wue rue and reduces et levels thereby enhancing the grain yield profit and to reduce the risk of maize production in semi arid regions future study is needed to investigate the economic trade off between different levels of wheat residue and how much extra livestock feed the farmer has to buy under different irrigation levels

11309,the insufficiency water for irrigation is becoming the most vital problem for corn productivity in semi arid areas thus the improvement of water saving farming strategies is important to work out the water deficiency problem that affects maize productivity in semi arid regions a field research work was conducted during 2011 12 in a semi arid area of pakistan to clarify the interactive effects of soil amendments and irrigation levels on the maize yields water use efficiency evapotranspiration and total dry matter accumulations we tested the following five soil amendments farm yard manure at 5 t ha 1 wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 gypsum at 1 t ha 1 qemyisol at 10 kg ha 1 humic acid at 20 kg ha 1 with two irrigation levels 350 mm and 175 mm and traditional planting with no irrigation ck respectively the results clearly indicated that soil amendment such as wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 with irrigation 350 mm could enhance the soil water availability in 0 100 cm during the key growth stages as well as grain yields significant increased by 62 water use efficiency wue and rainfall use efficiency rue were improved by 35 and 50 as compared with ck1 respectively as the amount of irrigation increased the irrigation water use efficiency iwue irrigation water productivity iwp decreased but the maize yields and net economic benefit tended to increase the economic analysis also suggested that higher 45 of net economic benefits could be obtained by using wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 as soil amendment with irrigation 350 mm as compared with ck1 treatment therefore our research work recommended that wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 with 350 mm irrigation level is a suitable treatment for efficient consumption of local rainfall and increase maize productivity in semi arid regions because it improves the wue rue and reduces et levels thereby enhancing the grain yield net profit and to reduce the risk of maize productivity in semi arid regions keywords soil amendments irrigation water use efficiency biomass evapotranspiration economic benefit 1 introduction the mismanagement of irrigation water thought out the world in general and pakistan in particular at a farm level has caused a potential threat to the crop production because of its limited availability baozhen et al 2015 wakchaure et al 2016 due to water shortage or drought winter wheat yield was decrease 10 29 as compared with no water stress jianguo et al 2014 higher soil moisture depletion and highest wue 18 9 kg mm 1 ha 1 were recorded under limited irrigation as compared with rain fed conditions giri et al 2009 luis et al 2012 corn yields losses due to water scarcity stress ranges from 20 to 85 which indicated that water scarcity is one of the key concerns that affecting maize production in semi arid regions fang et al 2010 water conservation within a field has been recognized one of the most important concerns throughout the world chris 2011 it includes the incorporation of crop residues or farm yard manure and the recent introduction of qemisoyl humic acid gypsum and other organic and inorganic sources that help in improving of soil moisture retentive capacity and consequently increase crop yield wallace and nelson 1986 soil amendments both synthetic and natural greatly contribute to provide a reservoir of soil water to plants on demand in the upper layers within the soil where the root systems normally develop johnson and leah 1990 qemisoyl served as buffers against temporary water stress and decrease of evaporation through limited movement of water from the sub surface to the surface layer de boodt 1990 qemisoyl is highly cross linked polyacrylamides with 40 of the amides hydrolyzed to carboxylic groups azzam 1980 qemisoyl did not interact directly with the soil matrices but formed aqueous gels and act as water reservoirs for the root zone of plants azzam 1980 wallace and nelson 1986 the roots to the plant grow through the matrix of these hydro gelled particles and draw water from them when required ouchi et al 1989 and bouranis et al 1995 have shown that water held by qemisoyl is completely available to plants crop residues can improve soil physical properties conserving soil moisture and controlling weeds baozhen et al 2015 guangshuai et al 2016 revealed that wheat residues increased soil humus content increased rainfall infiltration conserve moisture water holding capacity and cation exchange capacity wheat residues supply plant nutrients to the subsequent crops due to decomposition shuo et al 2016 huang et al 2005 reported that wheat crop straw with 3 75 4 5 t ha 1 are an effective measure to reduce evaporation and water consumption farm yard manure is another cheap and organic source of plant nutrient which increased water holding capacity of soil rasool et al 2005 therefore the use of fym with limited irrigation could slowly increase soil water content and crop production mwangi 2010 gypsum used a worldwide soil amendment wallace and nelson 1986 can decrease soil crusting develop rainfall permeation water transmission conductivity increased water absorption improved n recovery

treatments cr350 treatment had the highest rate 45 of income return as compared with ck 1 2 treatment 4 discussion the semi arid areas of northwest in pakistan are highly affected by seasonal variations in the amount of rainfall and its distribution during various maize growth stages the average annual precipitation over 40 years is about 342 mm but water evaporation exceeds 950 mm and thus overcoming this problem and provide water for agricultural production is a very important issue according to grassini et al 2009 luis et al 2012 in this research work we found that different soil amendments with irrigation levels significantly improved growth yields and wue in the semi arid regions thus we confirmed that different soil amendments with irrigation levels had significant effects on the soil water storage iwue iwp net profit and maize yields previous studies have suggested that using wheat crop residue as soil amendment suppresses the evaporation of rainfall and irrigation water which can be used to improve the crop water usage in a quantitative manner thereby improving the maize yields wue and rue chris 2011 zhang et al 2015 yonggan et al 2014 found that the using wheat crop residue as soil amendment improved the soil moisture contents of the topsoil as compared with traditional planting with no irrigation with an increased soil moisture content of 10 4 19 7 the crop et rate increased with plant growth and development but the moderate water stress with the soil amendments treated plots ensured the successful vegetative growth of maize crop deng et al 2006 and luis et al 2012 confirmed that using wheat straw as a mulch obtained a higher water storage capacity than that no mulch plots i e an improvement of 33 7 39 7 mm where the yield increased by up to 63 and the wue by 5 3 12 5 kg mm 1 ha 1 lenka et al 2009 revealed that the maize yields were positively correlated to the et rate zizhong and zenghui 2016 also reported a significant increase in et due to the increasing irrigation amount frosm 375 m3 ha 1 to 750 m3 ha 1 the higher daily transpiration rates during the silking stage may be attributable to the greater soil water extraction capacity of the roots under the soil amendments treatments and the maximum evaporation capacity of the crop canopy under traditional planting with no irrigation zengjiang et al 2015 we also found that the corn biomass grain yield and et were affected significantly by the different soil amendments with irrigations tables 2 and 3 the soil amendments with different irrigation levels obtained higher maize biomass and grain yields compared with traditional planting with no irrigation the seasonal et of maize was directly and positively correlated with the seasonal rainfall distribution and irrigation levels there were obvious differences in et among the different treatments table 3 shuo et al 2016 showed that using of wheat straw as mulch can normalize the rate of water usage during different growth stages in maize thereby improving the maize yield and et wheat straw use as a mulching should decrease evaporation from the topsoil layer as well as decreasing the total water consumption thereby positively affecting the maize yield and wue chen et al 2012 it has been reported that the moisture contents are higher under soil amendments treatments as compared with control treatment cai 2011 zhang et al 2015 thereby enhancing the total green leaf area and dry matter per plant huang et al 2005 wang et al 2009 wu et al 2015 and luis et al 2012 also confirm that supply 450 mm irrigation with 8 t fym ha 1 could increase the total green leaf area and dry matter per plant during the dry and rainy seasons respectively in the present study we found that using of soil amendment such as wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 with 350 mm irrigation significantly increased the leaf area and total dry matter plant 1 under both irrigation levels the wue characterized the association between the grain yield and total et increased irrigation level increases the maize yield but there was no significant increase in et which indicated that irrigation could effectively increase the crop water consumption relative to the total proportion of farmland water thereby improving the agricultural wue and rue luis et al 2012 and zhang et al 2015 showed that grain yield significantly increased with increasing wheat crop residue from 2 to 3 5 t ha 1 wheat straw mulching could improve soil fertility status which improves soil water content and nutrient holding capacity as a result biomass and grain yields increased this development maybe occurred because crop straw can reduce the evaporation from a subsoil surface thus significantly reduce soil water evaporation which considerably increase the sws chris 2011 huang et al 2005 shuo et al 2016 indicated that the applied wheat straw as a mulch improved the wue rue and obtained a high yield soil moisture mainly improves the soil nutrient availability which promotes crop nutrient absorption and utilization ren et al 2008 demonstrated that irrigation amount of 440 340 and 230 mm increased the wue by 77 4 43 1 and 9 5 respectively compared with control plots the growth of maize in furrows and covered with fym or wheat crop residues clearly reduced the et rate and enhanced the wue according to mina et al 2011 mulching of wheat straw is the most excellent ways of increasing water preservation in the soil and reducing evaporation cai 2011 luis et al 2012 maize crop grew under rain fid condition could reduce biomass and grain yield up to 30 it may be due to insufficiency water at various growth stages and improve inter plant competition as a result decrease maize yields peake et al 2016 the use of irrigation in semi arid areas can improve the crop growth conditions and increase the productivity and wue chris 2011 luis et al 2012 wu et al 2015 but the iwue and iwp are affected by the irrigation amounts whereas a low irrigation amount tends to obtain a high iwue and iwp whereas a high irrigation amount leads to a lower iwue and iwp as the amount of irrigation increased the iwue iwp decreased but the maize yields and net economic benefit tended to increase the mean results also confirmed that as the amount of irrigation increased the iwue iwp decreased but the maize yields and net economic benefit tended to increase the net economic profit is the most useful indicators for evaluating crop management strategies in semi arid regions our economic analysis also suggested that there was highest rate 45 of income return by using wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 as soil amendment with irrigation 350 mm therefore our results suggest that the cr350 treatment is the best option amongst those examined treatments for maize productivity in the semi arid region due to the enhancements of the wue rue and total dry matter accumulation plant 1 thereby obtaining higher grain yield more profit and reducing the risk of maize production in semi arid regions future study is needed to investigate the economic trade off between different levels of wheat residue and how much extra livestock feed the farmer has to buy under different irrigation levels 5 conclusions production of maize crop in semiarid regions of pakistan depends on rainwater and water saving strategy is essential for crop productivity thus the improvement of water saving farming strategies is important to solve the deficiency of water that affects maize productivity in semi arid regions soil amendments in combination of irrigation could have a significant effect on soil water content retention corn yields as well as the growth wue rue and et levels the result of present research work clearly indicated that soil amendment such as wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 with irrigation 350 mm could enhance the soil water availability during the vital growth stages as well as maize yields significant increased by 62 wue and rue were improved by 35 and 50 as compared with ck1 treatment farmers who access to sufficient irrigation water by applying a wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 can enhance the maize yields and can get adequate profit from their investment however irrigation water is often limited and not available at entire growth stages the same quantity of wheat crop straw at 5 t ha 1 must be used to maximize the yields and economic profit as the amount of irrigation increased the iwue iwp decreased but the yield and net economic benefit tended to increase the economic analysis also suggested that greater 45 net economic benefits could be obtained by using soil amendment such as wheat crop residue at 5 t ha 1 with irrigation 350 mm therefore our research work recommended that cr350 is best of the examined options for maize production in semi arid regions because it improves the wue rue and reduces et levels thereby enhancing the grain yield profit and to reduce the risk of maize production in semi arid regions future study is needed to investigate the economic trade off between different levels of wheat residue and how much extra livestock feed the farmer has to buy under different irrigation levels
