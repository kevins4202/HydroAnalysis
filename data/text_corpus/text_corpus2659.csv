tannery industry wastewater we synthesized tio2 modified poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene pvdf hfp nanocomposite flat sheet membranes to treat tannery industry wastewater by mdcr the influence of tio2 nanoparticles morphologies on membrane performance salt rejection and water flux was investigated the nanocomposite membranes were analyzed for surface morphology thermal stability porosity water flux and salt rejection it was demonstrated that the tio2 modified pvdf hfp nanocomposite membrane showed improved hydrophobicity porosity and number of pores thus water flux significantly increased without any deterioration in salt rejection among different membranes decanoic acid modified tio2 nanoparticles bipyramidal morphology nanocomposite membrane m 1b showed 6 1 kg

99 97 salt rejection the crystallization of salts revealed cubic nacl crystals and monoclinic na2so4 crystals in the wastewater the xrd spectra revealed a high purity of salts and ruled out any co

used in the tannery industry keywords membrane distillation crystallization tio2 nanoparticles nanocomposite membrane pvdf hfp tannery industry wastewater 1 introduction tanneries are typically identified as pollution intensive industries which generate widely variable and high strength wastewater the composition of tannery wastewater depends upon tanning processes such as hide preparation tanning and finishing about 300 kg of chemicals are added per ton of hides in tannery 1 tannery industry wastewater contains heavy metals toxic chemicals and high dissolved and suspended solids 2 in india tannery industries use two major salts during their process chlorides and sulphates nacl is used to preserve hide and skin and sulphates are used in deliming bating and the pickling tanning 3 furthermore the tannery industry has high levels of water consumption 30 40 l per kg hide production although efforts in the recent past have brought down water consumption substantially 4 traditional wastewater treatment systems have been modified due to a standard shift in terms of solids and water recovery as well as strict environmental regulations such as zero liquid discharge zld as a result there is a need for a technology that can extract water and crystallized salts simultaneously while leaving no untreated residue thereby meeting stringent environmental regulations for industrial wastewater treatment and management for the reclamation of salt and water from tannery wastewater zld is a potential future option conventional treatment for tannery wastewater includes aerobic anaerobic chemical precipitation chemical oxidation electrochemical and mechanical technologies 5 reverse osmosis ro is the principal membrane based technology for the treatment of tannery industry wastewater owing to its universality while salts are recovered using thermal technologies such as multi effect distillation med or multi stage flash msf desalination 6 7 on the other hand the ro technology has shortcomings such as high operating pressure and lesser water recovery 8 moreover the ro technology has the limitation of disposal of brine reject resulting in a waste of precious resources in reject brine 9 10 similarly conventional mineral extraction thermal technologies such as msf and med have significant drawbacks including high operating costs and high corrosion and scaling 11 membrane distillation crystallization mdcr is a promising technology for simultaneous water recovery and salt crystallization from tannery wastewater 12 14 generally mdcr is operated in four different configurations namely direct contact mdcr dcmdcr air gap mdcr agmdcr sweeping gas mdcr sgmdcr and vacuum mdcr vmdcr due to its simple design and easy operation the vmdcr arrangement delivers a high driving force with low heat loss through conduction 15 hence the vmdcr process is suitable for high water recovery from tannery wastewater 16 in the vmdcr process the membrane s physico chemical properties such as porosity hydrophobicity and pore size influence water flux and salt rejection 17 19 advanced nanomaterials can also be used to fabricate efficient membranes for the vmdcr process with improved water flux salt rejection hydrophobicity and stability numerous nanocomposite membranes have been reported for the application of different fillers such as graphene 20 metal organic frameworks 21 cnts 22 zif 8 23 sio2 24 al2o3 25 and tio2 26 27 to achieve high performance md membranes tio2 nanoparticles nps have lately been proposed as a long term solution to environmental problems such as water air purification because of their low cost abundance and exceptional antibacterial and antifouling properties 28 30 hydrophobicity of membrane is a crucial factor for improved vmdcr efficiency literature reports reveal that hydrophobicity is enhanced by incorporating tio2 in the membrane via surface deformation 31 32 the extent of hydrophobicity is also dependent on morphology surface energy and surface properties of the tio2 nps themselves to improve hydrophobicity in situ surface functionalization was attempted chen and his group 33 34 synthesized superhydrophobic poly vinylidene fluoride tio2 membrane through surface modification by octadecyl trichlorosilane having ling hydrophobic aliphatic chain lee et al 30 and prabhakaran et al 35 separately reported silane modified tio2 based membrane thus there is a huge chance to improve vmdcr efficiency by developing tio2 based nanocomposite membrane using tio2 nps with hydrophobic surface or varying morphology unfortunately to date no such systematic literature report is available inappropriate crystallization in the module poor water flux contaminants and blockage of pores in the connecting tubes between the md module and crystallizer are the main obstacles in developing an efficient vmdcr membrane high water flux promotes supersaturation secondary nucleation and nucleation rate during the vmdcr process all these facts mentioned above prompted us to design a tio2 modified poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene pvdf hfp nanocomposite membrane using bare and decanoic acid modified tio2 nps and 2d titanate sheet with large pore size shortened nucleation time and increased crystal growth rate thus the current work aims to evaluate the effect of surface modified tio2 and the morphology of tio2 on the hydrophobicity of the membrane in turn on the vmdcr performance another target is evaluating the concurrent recovery of freshwater and salt nacl and na2so4 from synthetic and real tannery industry wastewater to the best of our knowledge no study on vmdcr has been reported which deals with simultaneous recovery of water and salt from real tannery industry wastewater moreover the effect of surface modification of tio2 and the morphologies on membrane performance in the vmdcr process is not yet studied we synthesized tio2 modified pvdf hfp nanocomposite membrane with high water flux and salt separation rejection for the vmdcr process the effect of tio2 modified pvdf hfp nanocomposite membrane morphologies on the performance of vmdcr technology was systematically investigated the efficiency and rate of water and salt recovery were also evaluated for the optimized membranes the characteristics and purity of salts recovered from tannery wastewater were verified using microscopy and xrd techniques 2 experiments 2 1 materials the titanium isopropoxide and pvdf hfp mw 400 000 g mol 1 were procured from sigma aldrich ethanol

dmac of ar grade were procured from srl chemicals all investigations were conducted with ultrapure water supplied from the millipore q biocel unit the untreated raw tannery industry wastewater was collected from an industry located in kanpur up india the characteristics of the untreated raw tannery industry wastewater are included in table 1 2 2 synthesis of tio2 nanoparticles 2 2 1 preparation of ti nh4 2co3 solution to synthesize ti nh4 2co3 solution aq a required amount of titanium v isopropoxide was added to 17 0 ml methanol followed by an excess of dsi water and constantly stirred at

thoroughly with deionized water several times using the centrifugation technique the precipitate was added under stirring conditions to the1 6 m aqueous nh4 2co3 solution 25 ml 30 h2o2 3 0 ml was

anatase tio2 is included in scheme s1 esi the titanium ammonium carbonate complex solution 33 ml was transferred to a 100 ml teflon walled stainless steel autoclave and where it was hydrothermally treated for 6 h at 180 c after cooling the obtained precipitate was collected and washed by centrifugation using di water and methanol the precipitate was dried overnight in ambient conditions 2 2 3 preparation of tio2 decanoic acid to prepare tio2 decanoic acid nps c9h19cooh 1 9 g was added to di water 40 0 ml under constant stirring and the solution was heated at 100 c then titanium ammonium carbonate complex solution was added slowly while stirring which resulted in a milky solution this solution 33 0 ml was transferred for hydrothermally treatment in teflon walled steel autoclave for 6 h and at 180 c after cooling the resultant precipitate was collected washed by centrifugation technique using di water followed by methanol and dried overnight in ambient conditions the reaction scheme for the preparation mechanism of anatase tio2 is included in scheme s2 esi 2 2 4 preparation of layered titanate for preparing layered titanate titanium ammonium carbonate complex solution 30

microscopy sem thermogravimetric analysis tga porosity measurement liquid entry pressure measurement ft ir spectroscopy powder xrd analysis and water contact angle wca measurement 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of nps and membranes 3 1 1 morphology and surface analysis the microstructure of synthesized tio2 was evaluated using tem and hrtem the nps synthesized in the absence of decanoic acid were elongated in nature with about 10 nm width and 30 50 nm long fig 1a b whereas presence of square rhombus and hexagon shaped nps was identified in the image synthesized in the presence of decanoic acid this indicated the formation of highly truncated octahedral bi pyramidal particles viewed through varying zone axes fig 1c d hrtem images of both the samples showed distinct lattice fringes and indicated the formation of highly crystalline particles the respective interplanar planer distance in elongated and truncated octahedral nps of 0 35 nm and 0 19 nm can be ascribed to the 101 and 200 planes of anatase tio2 respectively tem image of titanate indicates the presence sheets hr tem images depict overlapped sheets with an inter sheet distance of 0 8 nm fig 1e f membrane morphology depends on the composition of cast solution and rate of precipitation rate after coagulation in non solvent sem analysis was used to study the effect of additives on the surface matrix cross sectional and top surface sem images of pristine pvdf hfp m 0 and tio2 modified nanocomposite membranes m 1a m 1b m 1c are shown in fig 2 the pristine m 0 membrane exhibited a sponge like cross section by addingtio2 the number of skin layer pores increased confirming that the morphology of nanocomposite membranes also depends on inorganic fillers the bottom layer of all membranes investigated had a sponge like structure whereas the top layer had a finger like structure 36 tio2 in the membrane matrix improved interfacial stresses between inorganic filers and polymer responsible for pore creation in the membrane due to shrinkage of polymer phase during solvent exchange 37 the nanostructures trap air in the membrane which lowers water penetration into the membrane pores 38 this phenomenon also improved the hydrophobic nature of membranes further tio2 of different morphologies also affected the pore structure in the membrane matrix from fig 2 it is evident that the addition of bipyramidal tio2 generated a large number of micro pores compared with elongated spherical tio2 the addition of layered titanate increased the macro voids increasing the water flux with reduced salt rejection due to mixed morphology containing inter connected macro voids over the sublayer the membrane surface roughness also affects vapour transmission fig 3 shows 3d afm images and average roughness ra and root mean square roughness rq for various membranes the m 0 membrane was quite smooth with ra 174 nm and rq 209 nm the membrane containing tio2 decanoic acid showed the highest surface roughness in comparison with other studied nanocomposite membranes the increased membrane hydrophobicity can be attributed to a surge in surface roughness resulting in a high salt rejection ratio 39 the inclusion of tio2 nps in the matrix reduced the surface energy thus contributing to pore wetting resistance 40 3 1 2 xrd and ft ir spectral and stability analysis the powder xrd patterns of synthesized all tio2 samples showed well resolved x ray diffraction peaks and indicate all the materials are highly crystalline fig 4 the xrd peaks of bare and decanoic acid modified tio2 nps can be indexed to 101 004 200 105 211 213 and 113 crystal planes of anatase tio2 the xrd peaks of layered titanate can be ascribed as 200 400 310 501 and 020 planes of protonated di titanate h2ti2o5 h2o the pristine pvdf hfp membrane s xrd showed diffraction peaks at 2θ 13 8 16 6 18 2 and 25 3 corresponding to the reflections of 100 020 110 and 021 miller indices respectively 41 in the xrd pattern tio2 incorporated pvdf hfp membrane presence of all the intense peak of bare pvdf hfp membrane indicate no such structural change of polymer on the incorporation of tio2 however the intensity of the peak for tio2 decreased reasonably due to the presence of the very low amount of tio2 fig 5a the ir absorption bands at 1401 1280 844 975 765 471 and 511 cm 1 in the ftir spectra of pristine m 0 and m 1b membranes reveal the characteristic peaks of vinyl sub units fig 5b 42 the α phase of pvdf hfp polymer is responsible for the peaks at 975 765 and 511 cm 1 whereas the peaks at 844 cm 1 were due to the ch2 rocking vibrations of the β phase of the polymer subunits the absorption peak indicated cf wagging vibrations of crystals at 471 cm 1 pvdf hfp the ir bands at 511 and 1280 cm 1 were attributed to bending and asymmetric stretching vibrations of cf2 43 when tio2 was added to the pvdf hfp matrix the ir peaks at 975 765 and 511 cm 1 correspond to the α phase weakened indicating the interaction between the tio2 nps and the polymer stretching vibrations of tio in the m 1b membrane produced a discrete band at 600 450 cm 1 which was due to the anatase crystalline phase 44 ftir spectra of bare tio2 layered titanate decanoic acid modified free tio2 and pure decanoic acid was recorded figs 6 and s1 esi in the decanoic acid modified tio2 and pure decanoic acid spectra the bands at around 2850 and 2935 cm 1 ascribed to ch stretching of ch2 and terminal ch3 groups of decanoic acid appeared in almost identical positions however a reasonable change was observed for the band of acid group of decanoic acid at 1715 cm 1 the carboxylate group s symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations coo at 1528 and 1408 cm 1 replaced a strong band as singlet about 1715 cm 1 of the localized carbonyl group in decanoic acid in nps giving a splitting of γ γas γs 120 cm 1 carline 45 reported that if the coordination is monodentate the ν as coo and ν s coo will be shifted to higher and lower frequencies respectively both ν as coo and ν s coo frequencies will change in the same direction if the coordination is chelating bidentate or bridging bidentate this occurs because the bond orders changed by the same amount of both bonds of the co based on these facts and comparing the ν as coo and ν s coo frequencies of the metal decanoate complex we can say that the carboxylate group coordinate in a bidentate fashion ftir spectra of non modified tio2 and layered titanate evidenced the presence of a broad signal in the range 3500 3300 cm 1 due to oh stretching indicate the presence of surface hydroxyl group and or adsorbed water whereas the extent of the surface hydroxyl group in decanoic acid modified tio2 is nominal the surface is mainly covered by decanoic acid the acid groups are coordinate with the tio2 surface in a bidentate fashion keeping the hydrophobic aliphatic chain outside and make the tio2 nps surface hydrophobic fig s1 esi the thermal stability of different membranes was studied by tga curves fig s2 esi single step weight loss between 390 and 460 c was attributed to the thermal degradation of pvdf hfp the cf2 cf2 repeating units are responsible for the excellent thermal stability of pvdf hfp 46 further the thermal stability of these membranes up to 400 c confirmed the suitability for the long run non isothermal membrane vmdcr process 3 1 3 bet surface area analysis the specific surface area of the synthesized nps was obtained from n2 adsorption desorption isotherms as shown in fig s3 esi the isotherms were found to be of type iv bddt classification with two capillary condensation steps it suggested bimodal pore size distributions regions with an h3 type hysteresis loop the total surface area of layered titanate and elongated tio2 nps were calculated to be 93 m2 g 1 and 78 m2 g 1 respectively due to the presence of decanoic acid on the surface of surface modified tio2 nps it was impossible to get proper surface area thus the surface area measurement was not performed for decanoic acid modified tio2 nps 3 1 4 membrane structural attributes the liquid entry pressure lepw depends on the membrane pore size and hydrophobicity the lepw should be high enough to avoid pore wetting issues the lepw of the pristine pvdf hfp membrane m 0 was 43 psi which increased after tio2 nps incorporation into the membrane matrix fig 7a the increase in lepw may be attributed to increased membrane hydrophobicity 47 such membranes can support pressure due to water avoid wetting and thus be suitable for the vmd process the synthesized membranes showed the lepw above the 40 psi greater than the vacuum pressure applied 14 5 psi therefore in the synthesized membranes the pore wetting issue was avoided an increase in pores was observed from sem images of the synthesized membrane and thus increased membrane porosity was observed after tio2 nps addition further the wca values were increased when tio2 nps were added to the pvdf hfp matrix due to the surface deformation 31 32 fig 7b however a maximum wca value 130 was obtained for the tio2 decanoic acid incorporated membrane this is due to the superior interaction between the hydrophobic polymeric chain and tio2 having a hydrophobic surface these phenomena were responsible for significant improvement in water flux increased porosity without significant salt rejection deterioration increased hydrophobicity 3 2 md performance of synthesized membranes the vmdcr experiments were performed to assess the effect of tio2 incorporation in the pvdf hfp matrix on membrane permeability and salt rejection these nanocomposite membranes m 1a m 1b and m 1c showed high water flux and salt rejection compared to pristine pvdf hfp membrane m 0 it was observed that membrane porosity was increased by incorporating tio2 nps in the pvdf hfp matrix and provided a large membrane surface area for water evaporation fast diffusion water vapour molecules across the membrane may be explained by a suitable transport pathway in the membrane matrix for selective separation of water molecules from the feed solution the water flux and salt rejection values recorded during vmd experiments under different experimental conditions are included in fig s3 esi m 1b membrane showed high water flux and salt rejection among the studied membranes due to its hydrophobicity the improved hydrophobicity can be attributed to the grafted long alkyl chain with tio2 scheme s2 esi these observations support the suitability of the m 1b nanocomposite membrane for vmd application fig 8 shows a decline in water flux with time for pristine m 0 and tio2 modified membranes but simultaneously good water vapour permeability was observed at the initial stage of the experiment due to continuous water withdrawal from the feed solution its concentration increased simultaneously heterogeneous crystallization took place on the surface of the membrane a steady decrease in the water flux may be attributed to the crystal deposition and thus clogging of pores as a result concentration polarisation occurs on the feed side 48 fouling and reduced water vapour penetration across the membrane pores were also produced by crystal formation on the membrane surface caused by hydrodynamic flow 49 50 the nanocomposite membrane m 1b showed a negligible reduction in salt rejection 0 8 and water flux 9 8 compared to other studied membranes due to high porosity and hydrophobicity over the entire experimental cycle long run vmd experiment was also performed using nanocomposite membrane m 1b and real tannery wastewater to assess the variation in water flux and salt rejection responsible for membrane stability fig 9 the feed solution was substituted every 6 h to have the same concentration at the feed side due to the high rejection capabilities of vmd the collected permeate was added to the feed so as the feed did not lose its initial characteristics initial water flux 5 9 kg m 2 h 1 of tannery wastewater decreased about 20 during the first 18 h and obtained a limiting value with further progress of the experiment this observation also supports previous studies 51 52 initially water flux declined due to salt deposition on the membrane surface from the tannery wastewater the increased resistance to water vapour transport was caused by the deposition of salt particles on the membrane s surface pore blocking initial salt rejection 99 9 was reduced to 99 7 after 5 days of the experiment fig 9 little penetration of feed solution contamination to the permeate side across the membrane due to membrane wetting and fouling was responsible for the insignificant reduction in rejection efficiency these observations demonstrate that tio2 modified membrane has consistent water and salt recovery for the long run operation of vmdcr 3 3 nacl and na2so4 crystallization studies for the crystallization of salts the content in water of the salt s must be lower than its solubility there are two ways to reduce the salt content in the water one it extracts salts and another to extract water from mixture solution the md membranes allowed passage only for water through membranes thus the water content in the feed solution is reduced resulting in increased salt concentration in the feed and consequently crystallization occurs in the membrane matrix the nanostructures trapped air is responsible for reducing water entry into the membrane pores it also enhanced the hydrophobicity of the membrane the addition of nps increases the porosity and pore size of the membranes which allows more water vapour to pass through pores and thus the feed solution becomes saturated at a faster rate compared to the pristine membrane the crystallization studies with the well optimized m 1b nanocomposite membrane at 60 c feed temperature was were performed the salts were crystallized using vmdcr from the feed tank and kept for drying after the feed solution reached supersaturation when the feed solution is concentrated to a point where nacl na2so4 exceeds its solubility crystallization occurs 53 fig 10 a c show the morphologies of nacl feed 1 nacl na2so4 feed 1 na2so4 nacl na2so4 feed 1 nacl 1 na2so4 respectively cubic morphology for nacl crystals was observed while na2so4 crystal showed monoclinic morphology which agrees with previous reports 54 57 in the case of real tannery wastewater obtained from the tannery industry kanpur india the vmdcr process with the same operating parameters were applied after solution saturation of the feed tank salts were crystallized the agglomeration of the salt crystals was observed due to the slow cooling rate of the supersaturated solution fig 11 this was attributed to enough time to grow the nuclei and attached them to neighbouring nuclei 58 59 the xrd showed in fig 12 also confirmed the crystallized salts the xrd spectra of salt crystals obtained from real tannery wastewater were compared with those obtained from synthetic wastewater the peaks observed in real tannery wastewater fitted well with the reference case which revealed the absence of co crystallization of the impurities thus the vmdcr technology can produce pure crystals due to low evaporation rates and low temperatures 12 60 4 conclusions we synthesized tio2 modified pvdf hfp nanocomposite membranes by phase inversion technique for the vmdcr process the tio2 nps with diverse morphologies and shapes were incorporated in the membrane to explore the effect of different nanocomposite membranes on salt rejection and water flux the efficiency and rate of freshwater production were also evaluated for the optimized membranes the bottom layer of architected membranes had a sponge like structure while the upper layer had a finger like structure tio2 decanoic acid was highly hydrophobic and thus reported membranes desired performance compared to nps with other morphologies the addition of layered titanate in the membrane phase increased the microvoids responsible for reduced water flux and salt rejection the wca values of the membranes revealed that with the incorporation of hydrophobic tio2 in the pvdf hfp matrix the contact angle values increased the synthesized membranes were found to be thermally stable till 400 c all the results as mentioned earlier suggested that pvdf hfp based nanocomposite membranes using hydrophobic tio2 as inorganic fillers are suitable for vmd applications further the membrane containing tio2 decanoic acid showed high surface roughness compared with other nanocomposite membranes which ensured relatively high salt rejection the m 1b membrane was suitably optimized vmd with high permeate water flux and salt rejection among differently prepared membrane samples further the ratio of tio2 and pvdf hfp in the membrane matrix also can be optimized to achieve improved porosity and number of pores responsible for increased water flux without any deterioration in salt rejection lowering in lepw value also improved water flux without any alteration in salt rejection which was attributed to an increase in the surface pore size due to the incorporation of tio2 even in the presence of contaminants in the crystallizing solution the xrd peaks of salts confirmed their high purity thus the vmdcr process produced pure crystals due to the slow rate of evaporation at low temperatures these information endorsed the scalable nature and promising candidature of the reported m 1b membrane for tannery wastewater treatment the recovered salt and water can be re used in the tannery industry declaration of competing interest there is no conflict acknowledgements the csir csmcri pris number for this manuscript is 152 2021 the authors are

dependent on morphology surface energy and surface properties of the tio2 nps themselves to improve hydrophobicity in situ surface functionalization was attempted chen and his group 33 34 synthesized superhydrophobic poly vinylidene fluoride tio2 membrane through surface modification by octadecyl trichlorosilane having ling hydrophobic aliphatic chain lee et al 30 and prabhakaran et al 35 separately reported silane modified tio2 based membrane thus there is a huge chance to improve vmdcr efficiency by developing tio2 based nanocomposite membrane using tio2 nps with hydrophobic surface or varying morphology unfortunately to date no such systematic literature report is available inappropriate crystallization in the module poor water flux contaminants and blockage of pores in the connecting tubes between the md module and crystallizer are the main obstacles in developing an efficient vmdcr membrane high water flux promotes supersaturation secondary nucleation and nucleation rate during the vmdcr process all these facts mentioned above prompted us to design a tio2 modified poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene pvdf hfp nanocomposite membrane using bare and decanoic acid modified tio2 nps and 2d titanate sheet with large pore size shortened nucleation time and increased crystal growth rate thus the current work aims to evaluate the effect of surface modified tio2 and the morphology of tio2 on the hydrophobicity of the membrane in turn on the vmdcr performance another target is evaluating the concurrent recovery of freshwater and salt nacl and na2so4 from synthetic and real tannery industry wastewater to the best of our knowledge no study on vmdcr has been reported which deals with simultaneous recovery of water and salt from real tannery industry wastewater moreover the effect of surface modification of tio2 and the morphologies on membrane performance in the vmdcr process is not yet studied we synthesized tio2 modified pvdf hfp nanocomposite membrane with high water flux and salt separation rejection for the vmdcr process the effect of tio2 modified pvdf hfp nanocomposite membrane morphologies on the performance of vmdcr technology was systematically investigated the efficiency and rate of water and salt recovery were also evaluated for the optimized membranes the characteristics and purity of salts recovered from tannery wastewater were verified using microscopy and xrd techniques 2 experiments 2 1 materials the titanium isopropoxide and pvdf hfp mw 400 000 g mol 1 were procured from sigma aldrich ethanol

discussions 3 1 characterization of nps and membranes 3 1 1 morphology and surface analysis the microstructure of synthesized tio2 was evaluated using tem and hrtem the nps synthesized in the absence of decanoic acid were elongated in nature with about 10 nm width and 30 50 nm long fig 1a b whereas presence of square rhombus and hexagon shaped nps was identified in the image synthesized in the presence of decanoic acid this indicated the formation of highly truncated octahedral bi pyramidal particles viewed through varying zone axes fig 1c d hrtem images of both the samples showed distinct lattice fringes and indicated the formation of highly crystalline particles the respective interplanar planer distance in elongated and truncated octahedral nps of 0 35 nm and 0 19 nm can be ascribed to the 101 and 200 planes of anatase tio2 respectively tem image of titanate indicates the presence sheets hr tem images depict overlapped sheets with an inter sheet distance of 0 8 nm fig 1e f membrane morphology depends on the composition of cast solution and rate of precipitation rate after coagulation in non solvent sem analysis was used to study the effect of additives on the surface matrix cross sectional and top surface sem images of pristine pvdf hfp m 0 and tio2 modified nanocomposite membranes m 1a m 1b m 1c are shown in fig 2 the pristine m 0 membrane exhibited a sponge like cross section by addingtio2 the number of skin layer pores increased confirming that the morphology of nanocomposite membranes also depends on inorganic fillers the bottom layer of all membranes investigated had a sponge like structure whereas the top layer had a finger like structure 36 tio2 in the membrane matrix improved interfacial stresses between inorganic filers and polymer responsible for pore creation in the membrane due to shrinkage of polymer phase during solvent exchange 37 the nanostructures trap air in the membrane which lowers water penetration into the membrane pores 38 this phenomenon also improved the hydrophobic nature of membranes further tio2 of different morphologies also affected the pore structure in the membrane matrix from fig 2 it is evident that the addition of bipyramidal tio2 generated a large number of micro pores compared with elongated spherical tio2 the addition of layered titanate increased the macro voids increasing the water flux with reduced salt rejection due to mixed morphology containing inter connected macro voids over the sublayer the membrane surface roughness also affects vapour transmission fig 3 shows 3d afm images and average roughness ra and root mean square roughness rq for various membranes the m 0 membrane was quite smooth with ra 174 nm and rq 209 nm the membrane containing tio2 decanoic acid showed the highest surface roughness in comparison with other studied nanocomposite membranes the increased membrane hydrophobicity can be attributed to a surge in surface roughness resulting in a high salt rejection ratio 39 the inclusion of tio2 nps in the matrix reduced the surface energy thus contributing to pore wetting resistance 40 3 1 2 xrd and ft ir spectral and stability analysis the powder xrd patterns of synthesized all tio2 samples showed well resolved x ray diffraction peaks and indicate all the materials are highly crystalline fig 4 the xrd peaks of bare and decanoic acid modified tio2 nps can be indexed to 101 004 200 105 211 213 and 113 crystal planes of anatase tio2 the xrd peaks of layered titanate can be ascribed as 200 400 310 501 and 020 planes of protonated di titanate h2ti2o5 h2o the pristine pvdf hfp membrane s xrd showed diffraction peaks at 2θ 13 8 16 6 18 2 and 25 3 corresponding to the reflections of 100 020 110 and 021 miller indices respectively 41 in the xrd pattern tio2 incorporated pvdf hfp membrane presence of all the intense peak of bare pvdf hfp membrane indicate no such structural change of polymer on the incorporation of tio2 however the intensity of the peak for tio2 decreased reasonably due to the presence of the very low amount of tio2 fig 5a the ir absorption bands at 1401 1280 844 975 765 471 and 511 cm 1 in the ftir spectra of pristine m 0 and m 1b membranes reveal the characteristic peaks of vinyl sub units fig 5b 42 the α phase of pvdf hfp polymer is responsible for the peaks at 975 765 and 511 cm 1 whereas the peaks at 844 cm 1 were due to the ch2 rocking vibrations of the β phase of the polymer subunits the absorption peak indicated cf wagging vibrations of crystals at 471 cm 1 pvdf hfp the ir bands at 511 and 1280 cm 1 were attributed to bending and asymmetric stretching vibrations of cf2 43 when tio2 was added to the pvdf hfp matrix the ir peaks at 975 765 and 511 cm 1 correspond to the α phase weakened indicating the interaction between the tio2 nps and the polymer stretching vibrations of tio in the m 1b membrane produced a discrete band at 600 450 cm 1 which was due to the anatase crystalline phase 44 ftir spectra of bare tio2 layered titanate decanoic acid modified free tio2 and pure decanoic acid was recorded figs 6 and s1 esi in the decanoic acid modified tio2 and pure decanoic acid spectra the bands at around 2850 and 2935 cm 1 ascribed to ch stretching of ch2 and terminal ch3 groups of decanoic acid appeared in almost identical positions however a reasonable change was observed for the band of acid group of decanoic acid at 1715 cm 1 the carboxylate group s symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations coo at 1528 and 1408 cm 1 replaced a strong band as singlet about 1715 cm 1 of the localized carbonyl group in decanoic acid in nps giving a splitting of γ γas γs 120 cm 1 carline 45 reported that if the coordination is monodentate the ν as coo and ν s coo will be shifted to higher and lower frequencies respectively both ν as coo and ν s coo frequencies will change in the same direction if the coordination is chelating bidentate or bridging bidentate this occurs because the bond orders changed by the same amount of both bonds of the co based on these facts and comparing the ν as coo and ν s coo frequencies of the metal decanoate complex we can say that the carboxylate group coordinate in a bidentate fashion ftir spectra of non modified tio2 and layered titanate evidenced the presence of a broad signal in the range 3500 3300 cm 1 due to oh stretching indicate the presence of surface hydroxyl group and or adsorbed water whereas the extent of the surface hydroxyl group in decanoic acid modified tio2 is nominal the surface is mainly covered by decanoic acid the acid groups are coordinate with the tio2 surface in a bidentate fashion keeping the hydrophobic aliphatic chain outside and make the tio2 nps surface hydrophobic fig s1 esi the thermal stability of different membranes was studied by tga curves fig s2 esi single step weight loss between 390 and 460 c was attributed to the thermal degradation of pvdf hfp the cf2 cf2 repeating units are responsible for the excellent thermal stability of pvdf hfp 46 further the thermal stability of these membranes up to 400 c confirmed the suitability for the long run non isothermal membrane vmdcr process 3 1 3 bet surface area analysis the specific surface area of the synthesized nps was obtained from n2 adsorption desorption isotherms as shown in fig s3 esi the isotherms were found to be of type iv bddt classification with two capillary condensation steps it suggested bimodal pore size distributions regions with an h3 type hysteresis loop the total surface area of layered titanate and elongated tio2 nps were calculated to be 93 m2 g 1 and 78 m2 g 1 respectively due to the presence of decanoic acid on the surface of surface modified tio2 nps it was impossible to get proper surface area thus the surface area measurement was not performed for decanoic acid modified tio2 nps 3 1 4 membrane structural attributes the liquid entry pressure lepw depends on the membrane pore size and hydrophobicity the lepw should be high enough to avoid pore wetting issues the lepw of the pristine pvdf hfp membrane m 0 was 43 psi which increased after tio2 nps incorporation into the membrane matrix fig 7a the increase in lepw may be attributed to increased membrane hydrophobicity 47 such membranes can support pressure due to water avoid wetting and thus be suitable for the vmd process the synthesized membranes showed the lepw above the 40 psi greater than the vacuum pressure applied 14 5 psi therefore in the synthesized membranes the pore wetting issue was avoided an increase in pores was observed from sem images of the synthesized membrane and thus increased membrane porosity was observed after tio2 nps addition further the wca values were increased when tio2 nps were added to the pvdf hfp matrix due to the surface deformation 31 32 fig 7b however a maximum wca value 130 was obtained for the tio2 decanoic acid incorporated membrane this is due to the superior interaction between the hydrophobic polymeric chain and tio2 having a hydrophobic surface these phenomena were responsible for significant improvement in water flux increased porosity without significant salt rejection deterioration increased hydrophobicity 3 2 md performance of synthesized membranes the vmdcr experiments were performed to assess the effect of tio2 incorporation in the pvdf hfp matrix on membrane permeability and salt rejection these nanocomposite membranes m 1a m 1b and m 1c showed high water flux and salt rejection compared to pristine pvdf hfp membrane m 0 it was observed that membrane porosity was increased by incorporating tio2 nps in the pvdf hfp matrix and provided a large membrane surface area for water evaporation fast diffusion water vapour molecules across the membrane may be explained by a suitable transport pathway in the membrane matrix for selective separation of water molecules from the feed solution the water flux and salt rejection values recorded during vmd experiments under different experimental conditions are included in fig s3 esi m 1b membrane showed high water flux and salt rejection among the studied membranes due to its hydrophobicity the improved hydrophobicity can be attributed to the grafted long alkyl chain with tio2 scheme s2 esi these observations support the suitability of the m 1b nanocomposite membrane for vmd application fig 8 shows a decline in water flux with time for pristine m 0 and tio2 modified membranes but simultaneously good water vapour permeability was observed at the initial stage of the experiment due to continuous water withdrawal from the feed solution its concentration increased simultaneously heterogeneous crystallization took place on the surface of the membrane a steady decrease in the water flux may be attributed to the crystal deposition and thus clogging of pores as a result concentration polarisation occurs on the feed side 48 fouling and reduced water vapour penetration across the membrane pores were also produced by crystal formation on the membrane surface caused by hydrodynamic flow 49 50 the nanocomposite membrane m 1b showed a negligible reduction in salt rejection 0 8 and water flux 9 8 compared to other studied membranes due to high porosity and hydrophobicity over the entire experimental cycle long run vmd experiment was also performed using nanocomposite membrane m 1b and real tannery wastewater to assess the variation in water flux and salt rejection responsible for membrane stability fig 9 the feed solution was substituted every 6 h to have the same concentration at the feed side due to the high rejection capabilities of vmd the collected permeate was added to the feed so as the feed did not lose its initial characteristics initial water flux 5 9 kg m 2 h 1 of tannery wastewater decreased about 20 during the first 18 h and obtained a limiting value with further progress of the experiment this observation also supports previous studies 51 52 initially water flux declined due to salt deposition on the membrane surface from the tannery wastewater the increased resistance to water vapour transport was caused by the deposition of salt particles on the membrane s surface pore blocking initial salt rejection 99 9 was reduced to 99 7 after 5 days of the experiment fig 9 little penetration of feed solution contamination to the permeate side across the membrane due to membrane wetting and fouling was responsible for the insignificant reduction in rejection efficiency these observations demonstrate that tio2 modified membrane has consistent water and salt recovery for the long run operation of vmdcr 3 3 nacl and na2so4 crystallization studies for the crystallization of salts the content in water of the salt s must be lower than its solubility there are two ways to reduce the salt content in the water one it extracts salts and another to extract water from mixture solution the md membranes allowed passage only for water through membranes thus the water content in the feed solution is reduced resulting in increased salt concentration in the feed and consequently crystallization occurs in the membrane matrix the nanostructures trapped air is responsible for reducing water entry into the membrane pores it also enhanced the hydrophobicity of the membrane the addition of nps increases the porosity and pore size of the membranes which allows more water vapour to pass through pores and thus the feed solution becomes saturated at a faster rate compared to the pristine membrane the crystallization studies with the well optimized m 1b nanocomposite membrane at 60 c feed temperature was were performed the salts were crystallized using vmdcr from the feed tank and kept for drying after the feed solution reached supersaturation when the feed solution is concentrated to a point where nacl na2so4 exceeds its solubility crystallization occurs 53 fig 10 a c show the morphologies of nacl feed 1 nacl na2so4 feed 1 na2so4 nacl na2so4 feed 1 nacl 1 na2so4 respectively cubic morphology for nacl crystals was observed while na2so4 crystal showed monoclinic morphology which agrees with previous reports 54 57 in the case of real tannery wastewater obtained from the tannery industry kanpur india the vmdcr process with the same operating parameters were applied after solution saturation of the feed tank salts were crystallized the agglomeration of the salt crystals was observed due to the slow cooling rate of the supersaturated solution fig 11 this was attributed to enough time to grow the nuclei and attached them to neighbouring nuclei 58 59 the xrd showed in fig 12 also confirmed the crystallized salts the xrd spectra of salt crystals obtained from real tannery wastewater were compared with those obtained from synthetic wastewater the peaks observed in real tannery wastewater fitted well with the reference case which revealed the absence of co crystallization of the impurities thus the vmdcr technology can produce pure crystals due to low evaporation rates and low temperatures 12 60 4 conclusions we synthesized tio2 modified pvdf hfp nanocomposite membranes by phase inversion technique for the vmdcr process the tio2 nps with diverse morphologies and shapes were incorporated in the membrane to explore the effect of different nanocomposite membranes on salt rejection and water flux the efficiency and rate of freshwater production were also evaluated for the optimized membranes the bottom layer of architected membranes had a sponge like structure while the upper layer had a finger like structure tio2 decanoic acid was highly hydrophobic and thus reported membranes desired performance compared to nps with other morphologies the addition of layered titanate in the membrane phase increased the microvoids responsible for reduced water flux and salt rejection the wca values of the membranes revealed that with the incorporation of hydrophobic tio2 in the pvdf hfp matrix the contact angle values increased the synthesized membranes were found to be thermally stable till 400 c all the results as mentioned earlier suggested that pvdf hfp based nanocomposite membranes using hydrophobic tio2 as inorganic fillers are suitable for vmd applications further the membrane containing tio2 decanoic acid showed high surface roughness compared with other nanocomposite membranes which ensured relatively high salt rejection the m 1b membrane was suitably optimized vmd with high permeate water flux and salt rejection among differently prepared membrane samples further the ratio of tio2 and pvdf hfp in the membrane matrix also can be optimized to achieve improved porosity and number of pores responsible for increased water flux without any deterioration in salt rejection lowering in lepw value also improved water flux without any alteration in salt rejection which was attributed to an increase in the surface pore size due to the incorporation of tio2 even in the presence of contaminants in the crystallizing solution the xrd peaks of salts confirmed their high purity thus the vmdcr process produced pure crystals due to the slow rate of evaporation at low temperatures these information endorsed the scalable nature and promising candidature of the reported m 1b membrane for tannery wastewater treatment the recovered salt and water can be re used in the tannery industry declaration of competing interest there is no conflict acknowledgements the csir csmcri pris number for this manuscript is 152 2021 the authors are

13296,in the present study the potential of activated carbon ac supported copper catalyst was investigated during catalytic wet oxidation cwo of pretreated high strength biomethanated spent wash bmsw stream which is originated from alcohol distillery prior to wet oxidation wo treatment the bmsw was centrifuged to remove suspended solids during cwo treatment at 220 c temperature the chemical oxygen demand and color removals of 72 and 97 respectively were observed from the centrifuged bmsw catalyst dose 3 4 g l 1 reaction time 3 h the analysis of treated liquid samples confirmed the formation of acetic acid in large concentrations which is one of the major precursors of methane during post anaerobic treatment the kinetic expressions for wo and cwo processes were also developed using initial rate method however the recovered and regenerated catalyst could only be reused twice in cwo runs the biochemical methane potential bmp test results showed significant production of biogas from the treated bmsw based on the findings it can be inferred that the cwo of bmsw can be a potential treatment method before its disposal in the environment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biomethanated spent wash biochemical methane potential vfa analysis catalytic wet oxidation catalyst deactivation and stability 1 introduction spent wash sw is a dark brown aqueous stream and it originates from the alcohol distilleries after fermentation of molasses which is a side stream generated in sugar industries the hot sw is acidic in nature ph 3 4 5 and temperature 70 80 c and contains high organic load with 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and chemical oxygen demand cod of 40 60 g l 1 and 80 190 g l 1 respectively 1 2 biomethanation or anaerobic treatment is conventional method which results in 50 60 cod reduction with biogas production 3 the residual stream i e biomethanated spent wash bmsw still has high levels of cod 40 95 g l 1 dark color offensive odour and poor biodegradability index bi i e bod5 to cod ratio 0 2 0 3 the recalcitrant nature of bmsw is attributed to the presence of brown polymers such as melanoidins caramels and alkaline degradation products 1 wet oxidation wo and catalytic wo cwo processes are acknowledged as potential treatment alternative for the high strength waste streams containing recalcitrant pollutants 4 however the process is not employed in distilleries due to the requirements for severe oxidation conditions moreover there is lack of information available on the suitable heterogeneous wo catalyst hence the present study investigated the performance of a transition metal based activated carbon ac supported heterogeneous catalyst for the real aqueous stream emerging from biomethanation plant of an alcohol distillery the wo process is performed in the presence of oxygen or air at elevated temperature t 125 320 c and pressure conditions 0 5 20 mpa 5 6 the addition of catalyst may significantly reduce the desired temperature and pressure for efficient removal of organics in this field the current research is focused on the supported transition metal based catalysts which are less expensive compared to the noble metal based catalysts in several studies ac has been reported as support material due to favourable surface properties such as high surface area microporous structure and presence of desired functional groups on its surface 7 9 moreover ac inherits catalytic properties and may promote oxidative degradation of organics 10 11 the ac supported transition metal based catalysts have been used for various model compounds e g phenol and ferulic acid as well as industrial effluents 12 18 in some studies the reusability potential of the catalyst is also discussed for instance alvarez et al 12 used 5 cu ac catalyst for 6 cycles during cwo process however the authors reported deterioration in the stability of catalyst after each cycle mohite and garg 17 studied the performance of two heterogeneous catalysts 5 cu ac and 5 cu al2o3 for cwo of phenolic wastewater phenols 10 g l 1 cod 26 g l 1 total organic carbon toc 7 9 g l 1 the cod and toc removals of 88 and 90 respectively were observed at the optimized reaction conditions during cwo with 5 cu ac catalyst catalyst dose 3 4 g l 1 t 148 c po2 0 61 mpa ph 7 4 and t 4 h further the ac supported catalyst could be reused twice in cwo process without considerable reduction in its performance for phenol oxidation however limited studies are available in open literature on cwo treatment of bmsw in one of the studies padoley et al 19 carried out wo treatment of bmsw cod 40 g l 1 at moderate conditions t 150 200 c and air pressure pair 0 6 1 2 mpa for 15 120 min duration after wo treatment at the optimum conditions i e t 175 c pair 0 6 mpa and reaction time t 30 min 40 cod reduction from the wastewater was recorded whereas bi enhanced from 0 17 to 0 4 in the follow up studies from the same research group the effect of wo on the color and toxicity of bmsw 14 performance of post aerobic treatment 20 and wo reaction kinetics 21 were reported in our preliminary study the effect of temperature 160 220 c on wo of bmsw cod 65 g l 1 was investigated 22 at 220 c temperature and 1 1 mpa oxygen pressure po2 the cod and color removals were 59 and 90 respectively after 3 h of reaction with bi enhancement from 0 27 to 0 81 bhoite and vaidya 23 reported the efficacy of cwo for bmsw cod 40 g l 1 in presence of homogeneous feso4 catalyst dose 16 48 mg l 1 at moderate conditions t 150 225 c and po2 0 69 2 07 mpa after cwo treatment cod reduction from the wastewater was 54 whereas the bi improved to 0 39 from an initial value of 0 2 the treated wastewater was further subjected to ac adsorption adsorbent dose 5 w v to remove the residual recalcitrant compounds the biochemical methane potential bmp test on the treated bmsw showed a total biogas generation of 1 1 m3 per m3 of wastewater equivalent to 98 ml biogas per g cod methane content 69 in 25 days the authors also examined the performance of heterogeneous iron catalysts fe supported on ac and fe2o3 during oxidative treatment of bmsw at 150 225 c temperatures and 0 69 2 07 mpa oxygen pressures 18 after the cwo treatment marginal improvement in biogas generation was observed 1 2 m3 biogas per m3 of wastewater with methane content 72 to summarize the ac supported catalysts have shown good activity during cwo of model organic pollutants however further investigations are required to examine the performance of non noble metal based ac supported catalysts during cwo process for real waste streams therefore the present study was aimed to determine efficacy of the ac supported copper catalyst i e 5 cu ac for cwo of the pretreated bmsw subsequently the catalyst stability was also studied under the hydrothermal reaction conditions based on the experimental data the kinetic rate equations for wo and cwo reactions were developed moreover the carbon balance calculations were carried out to predict the contribution of oxidation to overall removal of organics from the wastewater and possible reasons for deactivation of the catalyst using the experimental data the catalyst deactivation kinetics was also studied apart from this the biogas generation from the treated bmsw was also predicted using bmp test assay 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals catalyst and wastewater the chemicals such as h2so4 ag2so4 nh4 2fe so4 2 6h2o hgso4 k2cr2o7 cuso4 5h2o k2so4 naoh hcl h3bo3 kh2po4 k2hpo4 na2hpo4 7h2o nh4cl mgso4 7h2o cacl2 and fecl3 6h2o were used for the determination of cod bod5 and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn in aqueous samples all these chemicals were purchased from merck chemicals mumbai india the standard ph buffer solutions were used for the calibration of ph meter these solutions were also supplied by the same vendor during oxidative degradation oxygen was supplied from an oxygen cylinder which was procured from alchemie gases chemicals pvt ltd mumbai india the catalyst 5 cu ac used for the cwo runs was prepared using impregnation method which has been discussed elsewhere 16 17 the major characteristics of the catalyst were as follows surface area 924 m2 g 1 pore volume 0 22 cm3 g 1 and pore diameter 3 98 nm the detailed characterization including morphology and elemental analysis have also been reported in the earlier publication the bmsw effluent was collected from a distillery unit which is situated near pune city in the state of maharashtra india the collected effluent was stored in refrigerator at 4 c temperature to prevent any changes in its properties before each wo and cwo run the bmsw was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min duration to remove suspended solids the resulting wastewater is abbreviated as centrifuged bmsw cbmsw 2 2 wet oxidation setup and operation the laboratory scale batch wo cwo experiments on cbmsw were performed in a 0 7 l stainless steel ss 316 high pressure reactor in an experimental run 150 ml of cbmsw was added with 1 7 5 1 g l 1 of 5 cu ac catalyst for cwo runs only in the reactor vessel the reactor was then sealed and heated for raising its temperature to the set value under slow agitation stirring speed 200 rpm it required 40 min to achieve the desired temperature and this instant is labeled as zero time at this point a sample was withdrawn before purging oxygen into the reactor in concentrations 30 90 of the stoichiometric during the oxidation phase i e after introducing oxygen the agitation speed was increased to 1000 rpm to eliminate any mass transfer limitations the duration of runs was varied from 15 to 180 min all the runs were conducted in duplicates 2 3 catalyst stability tests the catalyst stability was measured in both dry and wet conditions in dry conditions the isothermal thermo gravimetric analysis differential thermal analysis tga dta was performed on a catalyst sample mass 12 15 mg in tga analyser shimadzu tga dtg 60 germany for each run the catalyst was heated from ambient temperature to 200 c in oxidative environment oxygen flow rate 100 ml min 1 the hold time at 200 c temperature was 3 h during the entire run the change in catalyst mass was recorded to predict thermal stability of the catalyst in order to determine stability of the catalyst under wet conditions the experiments were carried out at different temperatures 160 220 c for 3 h duration in the same high pressure reactor which was used for wo and cwo runs for these runs the catalyst 5 cu ac dose of 3 4 g l 1 was added to 150 ml of distilled water after completion of the experiment the distilled water was filtered using 0 45 μm nylon filter to separate out the catalyst the recovered catalyst was oven dried at 103 c and weighted to determine any loss in mass the oven dried catalyst was then subjected to chn analysis the filtered distilled water was also analysed for toc and copper concentration an additional experiment was also carried out without supplying oxygen at 220 c labeled as cth 220 in order to examine the effect of oxygen on the catalyst stability 2 4 biochemical methane potential test after wo and cwo the bmp test was performed on the pretreated cbmsw in 125 ml serum bottles having a fixed substrate to inoculum ratio sir 1 24 for the test the inoculum was collected from an operational anaerobic digester treating food waste the cwo treated wastewater and inoculum were mixed in the serum bottles subsequently the mixture was flushed with nitrogen gas for 5 min to ensure the prevalence of inert conditions the bmp test was performed for 50 days and the biogas generation was recorded on alternate days the volume of biogas was measured by means of a glass syringe and the methane content was predicted using gas density biomethanation potential method 25 according to this method the loss in mass of bottle and the extracted biogas volume were measured during each

method and macro kjeldahl methods respectively 26 the actual copper cu content in the fresh catalyst was measured by dissolving a known sample concentration 1 g l 1 in reverse aqua regia hno3 hcl 3 1 by volume after appropriate dilution of the samples copper concentration was estimated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes horiba jobin yvon ultima 2000 france elemental

detector for the analysis synergi hydro rp column 250 mm 4 6 mm particle size 4 μm pore size 80ǻ was used prior to the hplc analysis for unknown samples the diluted samples of pure as well as the

japan and the absorbance of a liquid sample were measured at three different wavelengths i e 436 525 and 620 nm with reference to distilled water 27 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characteristics the bmsw has high concentration of ts organic compounds and tkn table 1 the biomethanated wastewater was acidic in nature and its biodegradability was very low 0 3 after centrifugation of bmsw the reduction in ts toc and cod were found to be 14 5 7 4 and 11 8 respectively since the methanogens are highly ph sensitive their activity is adversely affected below wastewater ph of 6 8 28 further the presence of toxic and persistent organics also inhibits performance of anaerobic treatment hence there is possibility of further biogas production after appropriate treatment of the wastewater 3 2 preliminary wo and cwo batch runs the initial oxidation batch runs were performed for 3 h duration at temperatures 160 220 c with oxygen pressure po2 and catalyst dose of 1 1 mpa and 3 4 g l 1 respectively in addition the control experimental runs both non catalytic and catalytic were performed by heating cbmsw at 220 c temperature without supplying oxygen to the reactor denoted as th 220 and cth 220 respectively no intermediate sample was collected during these runs during the runs performed without oxygen supply up to only 7 toc and 22 cod reductions were observed fig 1a c the changes in cn and bi were also very low fig 1b d however the addition of oxygen seems to have caused significant destruction of the organics present in wastewater the maximum cod and toc reductions were obtained during the catalytic process performed at the highest reaction temperature of 220 c 72 and 52 respectively whereas the corresponding removals during non catalytic oxidation were 61 and 33 moreover the cn was reduced to 0 1 cm 1 after cwo reaction from an initial value of 4 cm 1 i e 97 5 color reduction while the bi was increased to 0 9 fig 1b d in comparison a cn removal of 90 observed whereas bi of the treated wastewater increased to 0 8 when the cwo reaction was performed at 200 c fig 1d at these conditions the corresponding cod and toc removals were 59 and 32 5 the ph of wo and cwo treated cbmsw was reduced to 4 8 5 2 possibly due to the formation of low molecular organic acids in wo reaction the free radicals play vital role in the degradation of organics in the initial phase of reaction high oxygen concentration sufficient surface area of the fresh catalyst and presence of high molecular weight organic molecules in wastewater initiate rapid generation of free radicals during catalytic oxidation the free radicals may be generated via combination of the following compounds elements i metal and oxidant adsorbed on active sites and ii organic pollutant and oxidant 29 as shown in eqs 4 6 the free radicals such as ho ho2 roo and ro are likely to be produced during wo and cwo processes 30 the active catalyst specie e g cu2 may produce free radicals after combining with organics eq 7 the reduced copper i e cu may then react with o2 to produce o2 radicals and regenerate cu2 ions eq 8 the o2 radicals can further react with h ions to form ho2 radicals eq 9 alternatively h2o2 generation can also take place as the o2 radicals may combine with h and h2o according to eq 10 31 4 h 2 o o 2 ho 2 ho 5 roh o 2 roo ho 6 roh o 2 ro ho 2 7 cu 2 roh ro cu h 8 cu o 2 cu 2 o 2 9 o 2 h ho 2 10 o 2 h h 2 o h 2 o 2 the radical formation is rate determining step in cwo reaction higher cu concentration can accelerate generation of cu2 ions which helps in production of free radicals 32 however limited oxygen availability and formation of recalcitrant low molecular weight carboxylic acids may retard the rate of reaction acetic acid is considered the most persistent acid among various low molecular weight organic acids which are produced during wo cwo process 33 34 shende and levec 35 have reported that the degradation of acetic acid occurs at relatively high temperature 300 c and requires high activation energy however the presence of acetic acid may accelerate the oxidation of formic acid whereas oxalic acid is likely to be oxidized at considerably higher rates in the presence of glyoxalic acid 5 36 the activation energies required for oxidation of formic acid acetic acid and oxalic acid were reported as 149 2 kj mol 1 178 kj mol 1 and 137 kj mol 1 respectively the oxidation of oxalic acid can occur directly or via formation of formic acid eqs 11 13 whereas some fraction of acetic acid may directly oxidize into carbon dioxide and water eq 14 11 hooccooh ½ o 2 2co 2 h 2 o 12 hooccooh hcooh co 2 13 hcooh ½ o 2 co 2 h 2 o 14 ch 3 cooh 2o 2 2co 2 2h 2 o the oxygen limitation may be compensated by h2o2 generation as reported in previous works 32 37 as the reaction progresses the availability of active sites on the catalyst surface is reduced eventually the reaction ceases once the active sites are exhausted the wastewater samples were analysed for the presence of various carboxylic acids such as oxalic malonic acetic and maleic using hplc technique which have been reported as the major by products during the oxidative degradation 38 initially the concentrations of oxalic malonic and acetic acids in the untreated wastewater were 1 54 g l 1 1 3 g l 1 and 1 5 g l 1 respectively whereas maleic acid was not detected after 3 h of cwo treatment the concentrations of acetic and malonic acids were significantly increased 13 g l 1 and 3 5 g l 1 respectively in comparison to the other carboxylic acids for instance oxalic acid concentration was 1 62 g l 1 in the treated wastewater after the oxidative reaction at the highest temperature i e 220 c significant reduction in the concentrations of oxalic and acetic acids was observed final concentrations 0 9 g l 1 and 7 4 g l 1 respectively while malonic acid was increased to 7 4 g l 1 3 3 effect of operating parameters on oxidative degradation and reaction kinetics since there was significant improvement in the color and bi index of wastewater after cwo at 200 c temperature further runs were performed at this temperature to study the effect of the other operating parameters such as reaction time oxygen pressure and catalyst concentration subsequently the effect of temperature was also investigated to predict kinetic parameters 3 3 1 effect of reaction time to examine the effect of reaction duration the experimental runs were carried out for 15 180 min duration at 200 c temperature while the oxygen partial pressure and catalyst dose were 1 1 mpa 60 of the stoichiometric requirement and 3 4 g l 1 respectively the cod and toc removals were found to increase with reaction time up to 1 h fig 2 beyond which no considerable increase in the organics removal was obtained the low or insignificant removal of organics after 1 h of reaction may be attributed to the presence of carboxylic acids the low molecular weight organic acids particularly acetic acid are difficult to oxidize at the reaction conditions used in the present study another reason for lower oxidation may be the presence of sub stoichiometric oxygen level in the reactor based on the results further runs were performed for 1 h duration to determine the effect of following operating parameters catalyst dose 1 7 5 1 g l 1 oxygen partial pressure 0 55 1 65 mpa and temperature 180 220 c 3 3 2 effect of temperature the performance of wo and cwo was observed in temperature range of 160 220 c while the catalyst dose and oxygen partial pressure were 3 4 g l 1 and 1 1 mpa respectively the toc and cod removals were found in the range of 15 37 and 41 61 during the wo runs in the above range whereas the corresponding removals were 21 49 and 48 68 during cwo runs fig 3 a b with increase in temperature the reaction rate is expected to increase however the initiation of chain reaction i e production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals may be rate limiting for non catalytic oxidation process during the catalytic oxidation an improvement in the destruction of organics was observed due to the involvement of catalyst for the production of free radicals as discussed in section 3 2 increase in the reaction temperature may reduce physical adsorption of reactants on the catalyst surface the higher removal of organics despite lower adsorption may be attributed to the presence of higher concentration of free radicals which react with the pollutants adsorbed on the catalyst surface as well as those present in the bulk liquid phase 3 3 3 effect of oxygen pressure the oxygen concentration may also play an important role in wo cwo process lin et al 39 have reported higher generation of ho radicals with increasing oxygen partial pressure to examine the effect of oxygen pressure the cwo runs were performed at oxygen partial pressures of 0 55 mpa 1 1 mpa and 1 65 mpa which corresponds to 30 60 and 90 of the stoichiometric 1 92 mpa oxygen pressure respectively the reaction temperature and catalyst dose were 200 c and 3 4 g l 1 respectively in the absence of catalyst the toc and cod removals were 14 25 and 29 48 respectively which enhanced to 27 38 and 34 62 during cwo runs fig 4 at higher oxygen pressure improvement in organics removal was observed 3 3 4 effect of catalyst dose the catalyst dose was varied from 1 7 to 5 1 g l 1 during cwo runs performed at 200 c temperature and oxygen pressure of 1 1 mpa with 1 7 g l 1 catalyst dose the toc and cod removals were 20 4 and 44 4 respectively after 1 h reaction which enhanced to 31 and 56 respectively at higher catalyst dose of 3 4 g l 1 further increase in catalyst dose to 5 1 g l 1 showed only marginal increment in the removal of organics fig 5 hence a catalyst dose of 3 4 g l 1 may be suggested as the optimum under the present reaction conditions 3 3 5 reaction kinetics the wo and cwo reaction kinetic data were analysed to determine the order of reaction with respect to various operating parameters such as toc oxygen pressure and catalyst concentration for cwo only dependency of the reaction on temperature was assessed by estimating its activation energy using toc as lumped parameter the expressions for rate of toc reduction during wo and cwo can be expressed as eqs 15 16 respectively 33 36 15 d toc dt r k 0 exp e rt toc m p o 2 n 16 d toc dt r k 0 exp e rt toc m p o 2 n c cat p where r reaction rate k0 specific rate constant e activation energy r universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 t temperature toc toc at time t po2 oxygen pressure ccat catalyst concentration and m n and p order of reaction with respect to toc oxygen pressure and catalyst concentration respectively at a given temperature and pressure the pseudo mth order expression for wo process can be written as follows 17 d toc dt r k toc m 18 k k 0 exp e rt p o 2 n assuming the second order rate equation with respect to toc eq 17 can be expressed as follows i e eq 19 19 d toc dt r k toc 2 upon integration the following expression is obtained 20 1 toc t kt 1 toc 0 for determination of the activation energies for wo and cwo reactions the arrhenius equation was used eq 21 21 k k 0 e e rt where k rate constant e activation energy and r universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 the kinetic data obtained for both wo and cwo reactions at different operating conditions were fitted in second order model fig 6 for wo runs the order of reaction with respect to oxygen pressure was 0 85 fig 6c the activation energy of non catalytic oxidation was found to be 41 kj mol 1 fig 6e whereas the specific rate constant i e k0 for wo reaction was found to be 0 009 l mg 1 min 1 mpa 0 85 similarly cwo kinetic data was also fitted in the second order rate equation i e eq 16 the order of reaction with respect to oxygen pressure and catalyst dose were 0 85 and 1 34 fig 6c d the activation energy for cwo was slightly lower i e 39 2 kj mol 1 than that obtained for non catalytic oxidation reaction thus the use of catalyst for oxidative degradation of organics reduced reaction dependency on temperature up to an extent the specific rate constant k0 for cwo reaction was calculated as 0 01 l mg 1 min 1 mpa 0 85 based on the above findings the global rate equations for wo and cwo of cbmsw were written as follows for wo 22 d toc dt r 1 0 009 exp 4903 9 t toc 2 p o 2 0 85 for cwo 23 d toc dt r 2 0 01 exp 4714 8 t toc 2 p o 2 0 85 c cat 1 2 3 4 characterization of the solids catalyst recovered after wo cwo of cbmsw the filterability of the untreated and treated cbmsw wastewater was measured by passing a known volume of sample through 0 45 μm pore size filter paper a significant improvement in the filterability was observed after preliminary wo and cwo runs performed for 3 h discussed in section 3 2 the solids retained on the filter were subjected to ftir and chn analyses to understand the nature of solids and main participating reactions respectively 3 4 1 ftir analysis to predict the nature of solid residue ftir analysis for the fresh catalyst and recovered solids was performed fig 7 the results were compared with those reported in the literature 40 41 in ftir spectrum the peaks at 3200 3500 cm 1 wavelength show the presence of oh group generally present in alcohols phenols and nh of amines whereas the peak between 2850 and 3000 cm 1 could be assigned to oh stretch of carboxylic acids furthermore the peaks at 1640 1700 cm 1 indicate to co group in carboxylic acids the band due to c n bond was appeared at a wavelength of 1322 cm 1 41 the sharp spectra at 1133 cm 1 could be attributed to ch bond in alcohols acids and esters 40 whereas the peaks between 670 and 900 cm 1 show the presence of ch bond in aromatic compounds the ftir results indicated the presence of carbonyl co group nitrogen compounds cn and nh bonds and aromatic compounds in the solids recovered after non catalytic as well as catalytic reactions 3 4 2 chn analysis the chn analysis results for the solid residues catalyst recovered after oxidation process are presented in table 2 during wo runs 3 4 g l 1 of solids were generated which was almost half of the mass of solids recovered after cwo runs 7 8 g l 1 the enhanced mass of solids may be attributed to the additional catalyst mass and removal of organics by precipitation as well as adsorption on the surface of catalyst during wo process at higher temperatures the generation of solids was observed to increase possibly due to the precipitation of polymerized compounds 42 however the carbon content in the solids recovered after wo treatment was decreased with increase in reaction temperature which could be due to improvement in oxidation of organic solids at elevated temperatures the catalytic oxidation caused lowering of solids generation with increase in the reaction temperature since higher oxidative degradation of organics as well as carbon support is possible at high reaction temperatures 43 to validate the above hypothesis some control runs were carried out with distilled water containing only catalyst under similar operating conditions t 160 220 c po2 1 1 mpa catalyst concentration 3 4 g l 1 and t 3 h one catalytic run was also performed at 220 c without addition of oxygen i e cth the purpose of these runs was to determine effect of temperature on the stability of ac based catalyst in non oxidative and oxidative environments the detailed explanation is presented in the supplementary information section s1 a loss in catalyst mass and carbon content was observed during the control runs table s1 at reaction temperatures of 160 200 c the final catalyst mass was reduced by 23 54 from an initial mass of 510 mg volume of distilled water 150 ml while carbon percent in the residual catalyst was reduced to 63 53 initial carbon content in the catalyst 75 further increase in reaction temperature to 220 c in oxidative environment the catalyst mass was drastically reduced to 71 mg i e 86 reduction with only 22 carbon content in comparison the mass reduction of catalyst was only 10 and the carbon content in the solids was 69 when the reaction was carried out in the absence of oxygen hence it can be inferred that the presence of oxygen in aqueous solution resulted in oxidation of ac which had adverse impact on the stability of catalyst in the heated environment moreover the results from thermo gravimetric analysis tga of the dried catalyst showed much lesser mass reduction 22 at 200 c compared to 54 in wet conditions in the oxidative environment the loss in mass up to 100 c temperature was 15 which was attributed to the evaporation of bound water the tga was performed for 220 min duration including initial 40 min for heating phase with an oxygen flow rate of 100 ml min 1 the thermal behavior of the catalyst is shown in fig s1 supplementary information 3 5 carbon balance the carbon balance was performed for the cwo cth runs performed with cbmsw for 1 h duration the control runs were also performed with distilled water under same temperature conditions the results are presented in table 3 it can be seen that an increase in the reaction temperature resulted in higher contribution of oxidation reaction to the overall toc removal the reduction in toc from the wastewater due to oxidation reaction was increased from 62 to 75 while the remaining toc removal could be attributed to precipitation or adsorption reaction in comparison only 22 of the total toc removal was due to oxidation of organics during hydrothermal treatment without oxygen supply one of the possible reasons for oxidation may be the presence of air in the headspace of reactor 3 6 catalyst reusability study the catalyst recovered after cwo treatment performed at 200 c temperature was regenerated by calcination at 550 c the purpose of catalyst regeneration is to remove volatile organics from its surface so that its reusability potential could be increased 43 the catalyst was subjected to chn and ftir analyses before and after thermal regeneration subsequently the regenerated catalyst was used in cwo of cbmsw for two more times under similar operating conditions i e t 200 c po2 1 1 mpa catalyst dose 3 4 g l 1 and t 1 h after each regeneration the carbon content in catalyst was decreased while the nitrogen content was increased table 4 the ftir analysis results for the fresh recovered and regenerated for first cycle catalyst solids indicated incomplete regeneration of the catalyst even after calcination fig 8 the spectrum for regenerated catalyst showed the peaks for alcohols and carboxylic acids moreover copper leaching was also observed during cwo runs the leaching of copper was 3 4 3 and 1 5 of the initial copper concentration 50 mg cu per g of catalyst during the successive 3 cycles the results were found in agreement with the earlier work performed in our research group 15 16 the toc removal with fresh catalyst was 32 5 i e first cycle whereas it was slightly reduced with the regenerated catalysts 30 2 and 29 second and third cycle respectively hence the catalyst could be effectively used up to two regeneration cycles 3 7 catalyst deactivation kinetics deactivation or loss of activity of a heterogeneous catalyst can be divided into the following three categories sintering or aging fouling or coking and poisoning 44 in the present study coking fouling was considered as the main reason for catalyst deactivation sintering aging and poisoning mechanisms are not likely to contribute significantly to the catalyst deactivation due to low copper loading 5 on the support material i e ac to study catalyst deactivation during cwo process the time based experimental data obtained during batch experiments on wastewater as well as distilled water controls was used table 5 these runs were performed at 200 c temperature and 1 1 mpa oxygen pressure the solids catalyst recovered after the experiments were subjected to chn analysis for determining the amount of additional carbon deposited on the surface of catalyst as well as precipitated out with the catalyst the mobility of carbon to and from wastewater will depend upon the nature of organics catalyst stability and reaction conditions it was observed that the precipitation or deposition of carbon on catalyst surface enhanced with reaction time the percent carbon transfer in solid phase was 11 65 calculated as a fraction of carbon mass in the catalyst after 5 min to 60 min reaction the amount of coke on the surface with time θ was correlated using the following empirical relationship developed by voorhies 45 24 c c a θ n where cc the percentage additional weight of carbon deposited on catalyst surface or precipitated with respect to the initial weight of catalyst after θ min and a n fouling parameters the values of a and n were found to be 5 5 and 0 5 respectively from the linearized form of eq 24 fig 9 one possible way to avoid the transfer of organics on solid phase may be supply of sufficient oxygen though this may result in higher oxidation of the carbon present in the ac based catalyst 4 biochemical methane potential the untreated and treated cbmsw samples t 200 c po2 1 1 mpa catalyst dose 3 4 g l 1 and t 1 h were subjected to bmp test which was performed for 50 days in batch mode in order to maintain sir of 1 the fixed amount of inoculum and cod were added in the serum bottles to achieve the same cod levels the wastewater samples were diluted appropriately the cumulative volumes of biogas and methane produced during anaerobic treatment are illustrated in fig 10a b the biogas production rates for the untreated and treated wastewater samples by cwo were comparable during initial 20 days beyond this the rate of biogas production was much higher for the treated wastewater and it kept on increasing till 30th day the maximum biogas productions from the cwo treated and untreated cbmsw were 0 74 l per g of cod consumed 70 ch4 and 0 43 l per g of cod consumed 59 ch4 respectively hence around 1 7 times higher biogas yield was observed from the cwo treated wastewater the wo treated cbmsw showed biogas generation of 0 6 l g cod consumed 70 ch4 with a long lag phase of 20 days the accumulation of propionic and butyric acids during non catalytic oxidation may be one of the possible reasons for delaying the biogas production 46 after cth the biogas production was inhibited which may be attributed to the formation of toxic intermediates in the oxygen deficient environment our results showed higher biogas generation than that reported by bhoite and vaidya 18 23 possibly due to higher biodegradability of the treated cbmsw used in the present study in order to confirm the results the anaerobic treatment should be performed at larger scale the digestate remaining after 50 days of anaerobic digestion was analysed for cod bod5 ts and tvs table 6 as expected the maximum cod and bi reductions were obtained for the cwo treated wastewater nevertheless the tvs reduction was lower for the wastewater which may be attributed to comparatively higher biomass growth during anaerobic treatment 5 conclusions the disposal of bmsw is a major problem faced by distilleries because of its dark color bad odour poor biodegradability and high organic load centrifugation of bmsw results in removal of few suspended impurities which may improve the performance of wo and cwo processes the maximum toc and cod removals of 51 6 and 72 respectively were observed during cwo reaction period 3 h with 5 cu ac catalyst at 220 c 1 1 mpa oxygen pressure and 3 4 g l 1 catalyst loading however the majority of removal occurred within an hour only there was significant enhancement in color removal and improvement in bi for the runs carried out at elevated temperatures the toc balance showed that the oxidation reaction contributed to 62 75 toc reduction from the wastewater the wo and cwo reaction kinetics followed second order reaction with respect to toc and the corresponding activation energies were 40 8 kj mol 1 and 39 2 kj mol 1 respectively the catalyst deactivation is major issue with ac based catalyst during cwo as evidenced from the significant coke deposition and carbon precipitation the improved biogas generation and further cod reduction of 50 can be suggested as the major benefits of wo and cwo pretreatment of cbmsw it can be concluded that cwo has great potential for improvement in biogas recovery potential from cbmsw however there is need to develop a stable heterogeneous catalyst hence the other catalyst supports such as ceo2 zro2 and zeolites should be explored in combination to copper or mixed metals like mn cu in future studies declaration of

13296,in the present study the potential of activated carbon ac supported copper catalyst was investigated during catalytic wet oxidation cwo of pretreated high strength biomethanated spent wash bmsw stream which is originated from alcohol distillery prior to wet oxidation wo treatment the bmsw was centrifuged to remove suspended solids during cwo treatment at 220 c temperature the chemical oxygen demand and color removals of 72 and 97 respectively were observed from the centrifuged bmsw catalyst dose 3 4 g l 1 reaction time 3 h the analysis of treated liquid samples confirmed the formation of acetic acid in large concentrations which is one of the major precursors of methane during post anaerobic treatment the kinetic expressions for wo and cwo processes were also developed using initial rate method however the recovered and regenerated catalyst could only be reused twice in cwo runs the biochemical methane potential bmp test results showed significant production of biogas from the treated bmsw based on the findings it can be inferred that the cwo of bmsw can be a potential treatment method before its disposal in the environment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biomethanated spent wash biochemical methane potential vfa analysis catalytic wet oxidation catalyst deactivation and stability 1 introduction spent wash sw is a dark brown aqueous stream and it originates from the alcohol distilleries after fermentation of molasses which is a side stream generated in sugar industries the hot sw is acidic in nature ph 3 4 5 and temperature 70 80 c and contains high organic load with 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and chemical oxygen demand cod of 40 60 g l 1 and 80 190 g l 1 respectively 1 2 biomethanation or anaerobic treatment is conventional method which results in 50 60 cod reduction with biogas production 3 the residual stream i e biomethanated spent wash bmsw still has high levels of cod 40 95 g l 1 dark color offensive odour and poor biodegradability index bi i e bod5 to cod ratio 0 2 0 3 the recalcitrant nature of bmsw is attributed to the presence of brown polymers such as melanoidins caramels and alkaline degradation products 1 wet oxidation wo and catalytic wo cwo processes are acknowledged as potential treatment alternative for the high strength waste streams containing recalcitrant pollutants 4 however the process is not employed in distilleries due to the requirements for severe oxidation conditions moreover there is lack of information available on the suitable heterogeneous wo catalyst hence the present study investigated the performance of a transition metal based activated carbon ac supported heterogeneous catalyst for the real aqueous stream emerging from biomethanation plant of an alcohol distillery the wo process is performed in the presence of oxygen or air at elevated temperature t 125 320 c and pressure conditions 0 5 20 mpa 5 6 the addition of catalyst may significantly reduce the desired temperature and pressure for efficient removal of organics in this field the current research is focused on the supported transition metal based catalysts which are less expensive compared to the noble metal based catalysts in several studies ac has been reported as support material due to favourable surface properties such as high surface area microporous structure and presence of desired functional groups on its surface 7 9 moreover ac inherits catalytic properties and may promote oxidative degradation of organics 10 11 the ac supported transition metal based catalysts have been used for various model compounds e g phenol and ferulic acid as well as industrial effluents 12 18 in some studies the reusability potential of the catalyst is also discussed for instance alvarez et al 12 used 5 cu ac catalyst for 6 cycles during cwo process however the authors reported deterioration in the stability of catalyst after each cycle mohite and garg 17 studied the performance of two heterogeneous catalysts 5 cu ac and 5 cu al2o3 for cwo of phenolic wastewater phenols 10 g l 1 cod 26 g l 1 total organic carbon toc 7 9 g l 1 the cod and toc removals of 88 and 90 respectively were observed at the optimized reaction conditions during cwo with 5 cu ac catalyst catalyst dose 3 4 g l 1 t 148 c po2 0 61 mpa ph 7 4 and t 4 h further the ac supported catalyst could be reused twice in cwo process without considerable reduction in its performance for phenol oxidation however limited studies are available in open literature on cwo treatment of bmsw in one of the studies padoley et al 19 carried out wo treatment of bmsw cod 40 g l 1 at moderate conditions t 150 200 c and air pressure pair 0 6 1 2 mpa for 15 120 min duration after wo treatment at the optimum conditions i e t 175 c pair 0 6 mpa and reaction time t 30 min 40 cod reduction from the wastewater was recorded whereas bi enhanced from 0 17 to 0 4 in the follow up studies from the same research group the effect of wo on the color and toxicity of bmsw 14 performance of post aerobic treatment 20 and wo reaction kinetics 21 were reported in our preliminary study the effect of temperature 160 220 c on wo of bmsw cod 65 g l 1 was investigated 22 at 220 c temperature and 1 1 mpa oxygen pressure po2 the cod and color removals were 59 and 90 respectively after 3 h of reaction with bi enhancement from 0 27 to 0 81 bhoite and vaidya 23 reported the efficacy of cwo for bmsw cod 40 g l 1 in presence of homogeneous feso4 catalyst dose 16 48 mg l 1 at moderate conditions t 150 225 c and po2 0 69 2 07 mpa after cwo treatment cod reduction from the wastewater was 54 whereas the bi improved to 0 39 from an initial value of 0 2 the treated wastewater was further subjected to ac adsorption adsorbent dose 5 w v to remove the residual recalcitrant compounds the biochemical methane potential bmp test on the treated bmsw showed a total biogas generation of 1 1 m3 per m3 of wastewater equivalent to 98 ml biogas per g cod methane content 69 in 25 days the authors also examined the performance of heterogeneous iron catalysts fe supported on ac and fe2o3 during oxidative treatment of bmsw at 150 225 c temperatures and 0 69 2 07 mpa oxygen pressures 18 after the cwo treatment marginal improvement in biogas generation was observed 1 2 m3 biogas per m3 of wastewater with methane content 72 to summarize the ac supported catalysts have shown good activity during cwo of model organic pollutants however further investigations are required to examine the performance of non noble metal based ac supported catalysts during cwo process for real waste streams therefore the present study was aimed to determine efficacy of the ac supported copper catalyst i e 5 cu ac for cwo of the pretreated bmsw subsequently the catalyst stability was also studied under the hydrothermal reaction conditions based on the experimental data the kinetic rate equations for wo and cwo reactions were developed moreover the carbon balance calculations were carried out to predict the contribution of oxidation to overall removal of organics from the wastewater and possible reasons for deactivation of the catalyst using the experimental data the catalyst deactivation kinetics was also studied apart from this the biogas generation from the treated bmsw was also predicted using bmp test assay 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals catalyst and wastewater the chemicals such as h2so4 ag2so4 nh4 2fe so4 2 6h2o hgso4 k2cr2o7 cuso4 5h2o k2so4 naoh hcl h3bo3 kh2po4 k2hpo4 na2hpo4 7h2o

india the standard ph buffer solutions were used for the calibration of ph meter these solutions were also supplied by the same vendor during oxidative degradation oxygen was supplied from an oxygen cylinder which was procured from alchemie gases chemicals pvt ltd mumbai india the catalyst 5 cu ac used for the cwo runs was prepared using impregnation method which has been discussed elsewhere 16 17 the major characteristics of the catalyst were as follows surface area 924 m2 g 1 pore volume 0 22 cm3 g 1 and pore diameter 3 98 nm the detailed characterization including morphology and elemental analysis have also been reported in the earlier publication the bmsw effluent was collected from a distillery unit which is situated near pune city in the state of maharashtra india the collected effluent was stored in refrigerator at 4 c temperature to prevent any changes in its properties before each wo and cwo run the bmsw was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min duration to remove suspended solids the resulting wastewater is abbreviated as centrifuged bmsw cbmsw 2 2 wet oxidation setup and operation the laboratory scale batch wo cwo experiments on cbmsw were performed in a 0 7 l stainless steel ss 316 high pressure reactor in an experimental run 150 ml of cbmsw was added with 1 7 5 1 g l 1 of 5 cu ac catalyst for cwo runs only in the reactor vessel the reactor was then sealed and heated for raising its temperature to the set value under slow agitation stirring speed 200 rpm it required 40 min to achieve the desired temperature and this instant is labeled as zero time at this point a sample was withdrawn before purging oxygen into the reactor in concentrations 30 90 of the stoichiometric during the oxidation phase i e after introducing oxygen the agitation speed was increased to 1000 rpm to eliminate any mass transfer limitations the duration of runs was varied from 15 to 180 min all the runs were conducted in duplicates 2 3 catalyst stability tests the catalyst stability was measured in both dry and wet conditions in dry conditions the isothermal thermo gravimetric analysis differential thermal analysis tga dta was performed on a catalyst sample mass 12 15

temperature was 3 h during the entire run the change in catalyst mass was recorded to predict thermal stability of the catalyst in order to determine stability of the catalyst under wet conditions the experiments were carried out at different temperatures 160 220 c for 3 h duration in the same high pressure reactor which was used for wo and cwo runs for these runs the catalyst 5 cu ac dose of 3 4 g l 1 was added to 150 ml of distilled water after completion of the experiment the distilled water was filtered using 0 45 μm nylon filter to separate out the catalyst the recovered catalyst was oven dried at 103 c and weighted to determine any loss in mass the oven dried catalyst was then subjected to chn analysis the filtered distilled water was also analysed for toc and copper concentration an additional experiment was also carried out without supplying oxygen at 220 c labeled as cth 220 in order to examine the effect of oxygen on the catalyst stability 2 4 biochemical methane potential test after wo and cwo the bmp test was performed on the pretreated cbmsw in 125 ml serum bottles having a fixed substrate to inoculum ratio sir 1 24 for the test the inoculum was collected from an operational anaerobic digester treating food waste the cwo treated wastewater and inoculum were mixed in the serum bottles subsequently the mixture was flushed with nitrogen gas for 5 min to ensure the prevalence of inert conditions the bmp test was performed for 50 days and the biogas generation was recorded on alternate days the volume of biogas was measured by means of a glass syringe and the methane content was predicted using gas density biomethanation potential method 25 according to this method the loss in mass of bottle and the extracted biogas volume were measured during each sampling event over a period of time using this data the density of biogas was predicted assuming that the it contains only ch4 and co2 to determine the ch4 content in biogas following eqs 1 3 were

cod and ts concentrations were determined using standard methods described in american public health association apha handbook 26 to estimate tvs in a sample the oven dried solids were ignited at 550 c for 10 min in a weighed crucible alkalinity of the wastewater was determined using potentiometric titration to the end point ph of 4 3 while chlorides and tkn were measured by standard argentometric method and macro kjeldahl methods respectively 26 the actual copper cu content in the fresh catalyst was measured by dissolving a known sample concentration 1 g l 1 in reverse aqua regia hno3 hcl 3 1 by volume after appropriate dilution of the samples copper concentration was estimated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes horiba jobin yvon ultima 2000 france elemental analysis of the catalyst before and after cwo process was performed on chns analyser flash ea1112 series therma finnigan italy to determine the presence of functional groups on the fresh and used catalyst samples fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was performed with ftir machine burker 3000 hyperion microscope vertex 80 germany during the analysis the resolution and spectral range were 0 2 cm 1 and 4000 400 cm 1 respectively carboxylic acids in the treated wastewater samples were detected by high performance liquid chromatography hplc infinity 1200 agilent equipped with uv detector for the analysis synergi hydro rp column 250 mm 4 6 mm particle size 4 μm pore size 80ǻ was used prior to the hplc analysis for unknown samples the diluted samples of pure as well as the mixture of organic acids were injected in the system to determine their retention time color of the wastewater sample was determined as color number cn using uv spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan and the absorbance of a liquid sample were measured at three different wavelengths i e 436 525 and 620 nm with reference to distilled water 27 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characteristics the bmsw has high concentration of ts organic compounds and tkn table 1 the biomethanated wastewater was acidic in nature and its biodegradability was very low 0 3 after centrifugation of bmsw the reduction in ts toc and cod were found to be 14 5 7 4 and 11 8 respectively since the methanogens are highly ph sensitive their activity is adversely affected below wastewater ph of 6 8 28 further the presence of toxic and persistent organics also inhibits performance of anaerobic treatment hence there is possibility of further biogas production after appropriate treatment of the wastewater 3 2 preliminary wo and cwo batch runs the initial oxidation batch runs were performed for 3 h duration at temperatures 160 220 c with oxygen pressure po2 and catalyst dose of 1 1 mpa and 3 4 g l 1 respectively in addition the control experimental runs both non catalytic and catalytic were performed by heating cbmsw at 220 c temperature without supplying oxygen to the reactor denoted as th 220 and cth 220 respectively no intermediate sample was collected during these runs during the runs performed without oxygen supply up to only 7 toc and 22 cod reductions were observed fig 1a c the changes in cn and bi were also very low fig 1b d however the addition of oxygen seems to have caused significant destruction of the organics present in wastewater the maximum cod and toc reductions were obtained during the catalytic process performed at the highest reaction temperature of 220 c 72 and 52 respectively whereas the corresponding removals during non catalytic oxidation were 61 and 33 moreover the cn was reduced to 0 1 cm 1 after cwo reaction from an initial value of 4 cm 1 i e 97 5 color reduction while the bi was increased to 0 9 fig 1b d in comparison a cn removal of 90 observed whereas bi of the treated wastewater increased to 0 8 when the cwo reaction was performed at 200 c fig 1d at these conditions the corresponding cod and toc removals were 59 and 32 5 the ph of wo and cwo treated cbmsw was reduced to 4 8 5 2 possibly due to the formation of low molecular organic acids in wo reaction the free radicals play vital role in the degradation of organics in the initial phase of reaction high oxygen concentration sufficient surface area of the fresh catalyst and presence of high molecular weight organic molecules in wastewater initiate rapid generation of free radicals during catalytic oxidation the free radicals may be generated via combination of the following compounds elements i metal and oxidant adsorbed on active sites and ii organic pollutant and oxidant 29 as shown in eqs 4 6 the free radicals such as ho ho2 roo and ro are likely to be produced during wo and cwo processes 30 the active catalyst specie e g cu2 may produce free radicals after combining with organics eq 7 the reduced copper i e cu may then react with o2 to produce o2 radicals and regenerate cu2 ions eq 8 the o2 radicals can further react with h ions to form ho2 radicals eq 9 alternatively h2o2 generation can also take place as the o2 radicals may combine with h and h2o according to eq 10 31 4 h 2 o o 2 ho 2 ho 5 roh o 2 roo ho 6 roh o 2 ro ho 2 7 cu 2 roh ro cu h 8 cu o 2 cu 2 o 2 9 o 2 h ho 2 10 o 2 h h 2 o h 2 o 2 the radical formation is rate determining step in cwo reaction higher cu concentration can accelerate generation of cu2 ions which helps in production of free radicals 32 however limited oxygen availability and formation of recalcitrant low molecular weight carboxylic acids may retard the rate of reaction acetic acid is considered the most persistent acid among various low molecular weight organic acids which are produced during wo cwo process 33 34 shende and levec 35 have reported that the degradation of acetic acid occurs at relatively high temperature 300 c and requires high activation energy however the presence of acetic acid may accelerate the oxidation of formic acid whereas oxalic acid is likely to be oxidized at considerably higher rates in the presence of glyoxalic acid 5 36 the activation energies required for oxidation of formic acid acetic acid and oxalic acid were reported as 149 2 kj mol 1 178 kj mol 1 and 137 kj mol 1 respectively the oxidation of oxalic acid can occur directly or via formation of formic acid eqs 11 13 whereas some fraction of acetic acid may directly oxidize into carbon dioxide and water eq 14 11 hooccooh ½ o 2 2co 2 h 2 o 12 hooccooh hcooh co 2 13 hcooh ½ o 2 co 2 h 2 o 14 ch 3 cooh 2o 2 2co 2 2h 2 o the oxygen limitation may be compensated by h2o2 generation as reported in previous works 32 37 as the reaction progresses the availability of active sites on the catalyst surface is reduced eventually the reaction ceases once the active sites are exhausted the wastewater samples were analysed for the presence of various carboxylic acids such as oxalic malonic acetic and maleic using hplc technique which have been reported as the major by products during the oxidative degradation 38 initially the concentrations of oxalic malonic and acetic acids in the untreated wastewater were 1 54 g l 1 1 3 g l 1 and 1 5 g l 1 respectively whereas maleic acid was not detected after 3 h of cwo treatment the concentrations of acetic and malonic acids were significantly increased 13 g l 1 and 3 5 g l 1 respectively in comparison to the other carboxylic acids for instance oxalic acid concentration was 1 62 g l 1 in the treated wastewater after the oxidative reaction at the highest temperature i e 220 c significant reduction in the concentrations of oxalic and acetic acids was observed final concentrations 0 9 g l 1 and 7 4 g l 1 respectively while malonic acid was increased to 7 4 g l 1 3 3 effect of operating parameters on oxidative degradation and reaction kinetics since there was significant improvement in the color and bi index of wastewater after cwo at 200 c temperature further runs were performed at this temperature to study the effect of the other operating parameters such as reaction time oxygen pressure and catalyst concentration subsequently the effect of temperature was also investigated to predict kinetic parameters 3 3 1 effect of reaction time to examine the effect of reaction duration the experimental runs were carried out for 15 180 min duration at 200 c temperature while the oxygen partial pressure and catalyst dose were 1 1 mpa 60 of the stoichiometric requirement and 3 4 g l 1 respectively the cod and toc removals were found to increase with reaction time up to 1 h fig 2 beyond which no considerable increase in the organics removal was obtained the low or insignificant removal of organics after 1 h of reaction may be attributed to the presence of carboxylic acids the low molecular weight organic acids particularly acetic acid are difficult to oxidize at the reaction conditions used in the present study another reason for lower oxidation may be the presence of sub stoichiometric oxygen level in the reactor based on the results further runs were performed for 1 h duration to determine the effect of following operating parameters catalyst dose 1 7 5 1 g l 1 oxygen partial pressure 0 55 1 65 mpa and temperature 180 220 c 3 3 2 effect of temperature the performance of wo and cwo was observed in temperature range of 160 220 c while the catalyst dose and oxygen partial pressure were 3 4 g l 1 and 1 1 mpa respectively the toc and cod removals were found in the range of 15 37 and 41 61 during the wo runs in the above range whereas the corresponding removals were 21 49 and 48 68 during cwo runs fig 3 a b with increase in temperature the reaction rate is expected to increase however the initiation of chain reaction i e production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals may be rate limiting for non catalytic oxidation process during the catalytic oxidation an improvement in the destruction of organics was observed due to the involvement of catalyst for the production of free radicals as discussed in section 3 2 increase in the reaction temperature may reduce physical adsorption of reactants on the catalyst surface the higher removal of organics despite lower adsorption may be attributed to the presence of higher concentration of free radicals which react with the pollutants adsorbed on the catalyst surface as well as those present in the bulk liquid phase 3 3 3 effect of oxygen pressure the oxygen concentration may also play an important role in wo cwo process lin et al 39 have reported higher generation of ho radicals with increasing oxygen partial pressure to examine the effect of oxygen pressure the cwo runs were performed at oxygen partial pressures of 0 55 mpa 1 1 mpa and 1 65 mpa which corresponds to 30 60 and 90 of the stoichiometric 1 92 mpa oxygen pressure respectively the reaction temperature and catalyst dose were 200 c and 3 4 g l 1 respectively in the absence of catalyst the toc and cod removals were 14 25 and 29 48 respectively which enhanced to 27 38 and 34 62 during cwo runs fig 4 at higher oxygen pressure improvement in organics removal was observed 3 3 4 effect of catalyst dose the catalyst dose was varied from 1 7 to 5 1 g l 1 during cwo runs performed at 200 c temperature and oxygen pressure of 1 1 mpa with 1 7 g l 1 catalyst dose the toc and cod removals were 20 4 and 44 4 respectively after 1 h reaction which enhanced to 31 and 56 respectively at higher catalyst dose of 3 4 g l 1 further increase in catalyst dose to 5 1 g l 1 showed only marginal increment in the removal of organics fig 5 hence a catalyst dose of 3 4 g l 1 may be suggested as the optimum under the present reaction conditions 3 3 5 reaction kinetics the wo and cwo reaction kinetic data were analysed to determine the order of reaction with respect to various operating parameters such as toc oxygen pressure and catalyst concentration for cwo only dependency of the reaction on temperature was assessed by estimating its activation energy using toc as lumped parameter the expressions for rate of toc reduction during wo and cwo can be expressed as eqs 15 16 respectively 33 36 15 d toc dt r k 0 exp e rt toc m p o 2 n 16 d toc dt r k 0 exp e rt toc m p o 2 n c cat p where r reaction rate k0 specific rate constant e activation energy r universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 t temperature toc toc at time t po2 oxygen pressure ccat catalyst concentration and m n and p order of reaction with respect to toc oxygen pressure and catalyst concentration respectively at a given temperature and pressure the pseudo mth order expression for wo process can be written as follows 17 d toc dt r k toc m 18 k k 0 exp e rt p o 2 n assuming the second order rate equation with respect to toc eq 17 can be expressed as follows i e eq 19 19 d toc dt r k toc 2 upon integration the following expression is obtained 20 1 toc t kt 1 toc 0 for determination of the activation energies for wo and cwo reactions the arrhenius equation was used eq 21 21 k k 0 e e rt where k rate constant e activation energy and r universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 the kinetic data obtained for both wo and cwo reactions at different operating conditions were fitted in second order model fig 6 for wo runs the order of reaction with respect to oxygen pressure was 0 85 fig 6c the activation energy of non catalytic oxidation was found to be 41 kj mol 1 fig 6e whereas the specific rate constant i e k0 for wo reaction was found to be 0 009 l mg 1 min 1 mpa 0 85 similarly cwo kinetic data was also fitted in the second order rate equation i e eq 16 the order of reaction with respect to oxygen pressure and catalyst dose were 0 85 and 1 34 fig 6c d the activation energy for cwo was slightly lower i e 39 2 kj mol 1 than that obtained for non catalytic oxidation reaction thus the use of catalyst for oxidative degradation of organics reduced reaction dependency on temperature up to an extent the specific rate constant k0 for cwo reaction was calculated as 0 01 l mg 1 min 1 mpa 0 85 based on the above findings the global rate equations for wo and cwo of cbmsw were written as follows for wo 22 d toc dt r 1 0 009 exp 4903 9 t toc 2 p o 2 0 85 for cwo 23 d toc dt r 2 0 01 exp 4714 8 t toc 2 p o 2 0 85 c cat 1 2 3 4 characterization of the solids catalyst recovered after wo cwo of cbmsw the filterability of the untreated and treated cbmsw wastewater was measured by passing a known volume of sample through 0 45 μm pore size filter paper a significant improvement in the filterability was observed after preliminary wo and cwo runs performed for 3 h discussed in section 3 2 the solids retained on the filter were subjected to ftir and chn analyses to understand the nature of solids and main participating reactions respectively 3 4 1 ftir analysis to predict the nature of solid residue ftir analysis for the fresh catalyst and recovered solids was performed fig 7 the results were compared with those reported in the literature 40 41 in ftir spectrum the peaks at 3200 3500 cm 1 wavelength show the presence of oh group generally present in alcohols phenols and nh of amines whereas the peak between 2850 and 3000 cm 1 could be assigned to oh stretch of carboxylic acids furthermore the peaks at 1640 1700 cm 1 indicate to co group in carboxylic acids the band due to c n bond was appeared at a wavelength of 1322 cm 1 41 the sharp spectra at 1133 cm 1 could be attributed to ch bond in alcohols acids and esters 40 whereas the peaks between 670 and 900 cm 1 show the presence of ch bond in aromatic compounds the ftir results indicated the presence of carbonyl co group nitrogen compounds cn and nh bonds and aromatic compounds in the solids recovered after non catalytic as well as catalytic reactions 3 4 2 chn analysis the chn analysis results for the solid residues catalyst recovered after oxidation process are presented in table 2 during wo runs 3 4 g l 1 of solids were generated which was almost half of the mass of solids recovered after cwo runs 7 8 g l 1 the enhanced mass of solids may be attributed to the additional catalyst mass and removal of organics by precipitation as well as adsorption on the surface of catalyst during wo process at higher temperatures the generation of solids was observed to increase possibly due to the precipitation of polymerized compounds 42 however the carbon content in the solids recovered after wo treatment was decreased with increase in reaction temperature which could be due to improvement in oxidation of organic solids at elevated temperatures the catalytic oxidation caused lowering of solids generation with increase in the reaction temperature since higher oxidative degradation of organics as well as carbon support is possible at high reaction temperatures 43 to validate the above hypothesis some control runs were carried out with distilled water containing only catalyst under similar operating conditions t 160 220 c po2 1 1 mpa catalyst concentration 3 4 g l 1 and t 3 h one catalytic run was also performed at 220 c without addition of oxygen i e cth the purpose of these runs was to determine effect of temperature on the stability of ac based catalyst in non oxidative and oxidative environments the detailed explanation is presented in the supplementary information section s1 a loss in catalyst mass and carbon content was observed during the control runs table s1 at reaction temperatures of 160 200 c the final catalyst mass was reduced by 23 54 from an initial mass of 510 mg volume of distilled water 150 ml while carbon percent in the residual catalyst was reduced to 63 53 initial carbon content in the catalyst 75 further increase in reaction temperature to 220 c in oxidative environment the catalyst mass was drastically reduced to 71 mg i e 86 reduction with only 22 carbon content in comparison the mass reduction of catalyst was only 10 and the carbon content in the solids was 69 when the reaction was carried out in the absence of oxygen hence it can be inferred that the presence of oxygen in aqueous solution resulted in oxidation of ac which had adverse impact on the stability of catalyst in the heated environment moreover the results from thermo gravimetric analysis tga of the dried catalyst showed much lesser mass reduction 22 at 200 c compared to 54 in wet conditions in the oxidative environment the loss in mass up to 100 c temperature was 15 which was attributed to the evaporation of bound water the tga was performed for 220 min duration including initial 40 min for heating phase with an oxygen flow rate of 100 ml min 1 the thermal behavior of the catalyst is shown in fig s1 supplementary information 3 5 carbon balance the carbon balance was performed for the cwo cth runs performed with cbmsw for 1 h duration the control runs were also performed with distilled water under same temperature conditions the results are presented in table 3 it can be seen that an increase in the reaction temperature resulted in higher contribution of oxidation reaction to the overall toc removal the reduction in toc from the wastewater due to oxidation reaction was increased from 62 to 75 while the remaining toc removal could be attributed to precipitation or adsorption reaction in comparison only 22 of the total toc removal was due to oxidation of organics during hydrothermal treatment without oxygen supply one of the possible reasons for oxidation may be the presence of air in the headspace of reactor 3 6 catalyst reusability study the catalyst recovered after cwo treatment performed at 200 c temperature was regenerated by calcination at 550 c the purpose of catalyst regeneration is to remove volatile organics from its surface so that its reusability potential could be increased 43 the catalyst was subjected to chn and ftir analyses before and after thermal regeneration subsequently the regenerated catalyst was used in cwo of cbmsw for two more times under similar operating conditions i e t 200 c po2 1 1 mpa catalyst dose 3 4 g l 1 and t 1 h after each regeneration the carbon content in catalyst was decreased while the nitrogen content was increased table 4 the ftir analysis results for the fresh recovered and regenerated for first cycle catalyst solids indicated incomplete regeneration of the catalyst even after calcination fig 8 the spectrum for regenerated catalyst showed the peaks for alcohols and carboxylic acids moreover copper leaching was also observed during cwo runs the leaching of copper was 3 4 3 and 1 5 of the initial copper concentration 50 mg cu per g of catalyst during the successive 3 cycles the results were found in agreement with the earlier work performed in our research group 15 16 the toc removal with fresh catalyst was 32 5 i e first cycle whereas it was slightly reduced with the regenerated catalysts 30 2 and 29 second and third cycle respectively hence the catalyst could be effectively used up to two regeneration cycles 3 7 catalyst deactivation kinetics deactivation or loss of activity of a heterogeneous catalyst can be divided into the following three categories sintering or aging fouling or coking and poisoning 44 in the present study coking fouling was considered as the main reason for catalyst deactivation sintering aging and poisoning mechanisms are not likely to contribute significantly to the catalyst deactivation due to low copper loading 5 on the support material i e ac to study catalyst deactivation during cwo process the time based experimental data obtained during batch experiments on wastewater as well as distilled water controls was used table 5 these runs were performed at 200 c temperature and 1 1 mpa oxygen pressure the solids catalyst recovered after the experiments were subjected to chn analysis for determining the amount of additional carbon deposited on the surface of catalyst as well as precipitated out with the catalyst the mobility of carbon to and from wastewater will depend upon the nature of organics catalyst stability and reaction conditions it was observed that the precipitation or deposition of carbon on catalyst surface enhanced with reaction time the percent carbon transfer in solid phase was 11 65 calculated as a fraction of carbon mass in the catalyst after 5 min to 60 min reaction the amount of coke on the surface with time θ was correlated using the following empirical relationship developed by voorhies 45 24 c c a θ n where cc the percentage additional weight of carbon deposited on catalyst surface or precipitated with respect to the initial weight of catalyst after θ min and a n fouling parameters the values of a and n were found to be 5 5 and 0 5 respectively from the linearized form of eq 24 fig 9 one possible way to avoid the transfer of organics on solid phase may be supply of sufficient oxygen though this may result in higher oxidation of the carbon present in the ac based catalyst 4 biochemical methane potential the untreated and treated cbmsw samples t 200 c po2 1 1 mpa catalyst dose 3 4 g l 1 and t 1 h were subjected to bmp test which was performed for 50 days in batch mode in order to maintain sir of 1 the fixed amount of inoculum and cod were added in the serum bottles to achieve the same cod levels the wastewater samples were diluted appropriately the cumulative volumes of biogas and methane produced during anaerobic treatment are illustrated in fig 10a b the biogas production rates for the untreated and treated wastewater samples by cwo were comparable during initial 20 days beyond this the rate of biogas production was much higher for the treated wastewater and it kept on increasing till 30th day the maximum biogas productions from the cwo treated and untreated cbmsw were 0 74 l per g of cod consumed 70 ch4 and 0 43 l per g of cod consumed 59 ch4 respectively hence around 1 7 times higher biogas yield was observed from the cwo treated wastewater the wo treated cbmsw showed biogas generation of 0 6 l g cod consumed 70 ch4 with a long lag phase of 20 days the accumulation of propionic and butyric acids during non catalytic oxidation may be one of the possible reasons for delaying the biogas production 46 after cth the biogas production was inhibited which may be attributed to the formation of toxic intermediates in the oxygen deficient environment our results showed higher biogas generation than that reported by bhoite and vaidya 18 23 possibly due to higher biodegradability of the treated cbmsw used in the present study in order to confirm the results the anaerobic treatment should be performed at larger scale the digestate remaining after 50 days of anaerobic digestion was analysed for cod bod5 ts and tvs table 6 as expected the maximum cod and bi reductions were obtained for the cwo treated wastewater nevertheless the tvs reduction was lower for the wastewater which may be attributed to comparatively higher biomass growth during anaerobic treatment 5 conclusions the disposal of bmsw is a major problem faced by distilleries because of its dark color bad odour poor biodegradability and high organic load centrifugation of bmsw results in removal of few suspended impurities which may improve the performance of wo and cwo processes the maximum toc and cod removals of 51 6 and 72 respectively were observed during cwo reaction period 3 h with 5 cu ac catalyst at 220 c 1 1 mpa oxygen pressure and 3 4 g l 1 catalyst loading however the majority of removal occurred within an hour only there was significant enhancement in color removal and improvement in bi for the runs carried out at elevated temperatures the toc balance showed that the oxidation reaction contributed to 62 75 toc reduction from the wastewater the wo and cwo reaction kinetics followed second order reaction with respect to toc and the corresponding activation energies were 40 8 kj mol 1 and 39 2 kj mol 1 respectively the catalyst deactivation is major issue with ac based catalyst during cwo as evidenced from the significant coke deposition and carbon precipitation the improved biogas generation and further cod reduction of 50 can be suggested as the major benefits of wo and cwo pretreatment of cbmsw it can be concluded that cwo has great potential for improvement in biogas recovery potential from cbmsw however there is need to develop a stable heterogeneous catalyst hence the other catalyst supports such as ceo2 zro2 and zeolites should be explored in combination to copper or mixed metals like mn cu in future studies declaration of

growth and indiscriminate economic development freshwater shortage has emerged as a pressing challenge to overcome 1 5 consequently the recycling of wastewater has emerged as the most widely used

recycling during ro processes contribute to the fouling of ro membranes 15 16 dom can be found everywhere in aquatic environments and is composed of humic substances proteins carbohydrates and other components with a continuous molecular weight from 1 nm to 0 45 μm 17 20 dom is generally sufficiently small to pass through the pores of pretreatment membranes such as microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membranes 13 21 therefore it is important to develop methods to minimize the fouling of membranes previous studies have evaluated the cleaning efficiency of flux recovery and resistance removal methods for the reduction of the organic fouling of ro membranes 22 24 furthermore the surface modification of membranes is a common method used to reduce organic fouling 25 26 in addition various techniques have been developed to monitor fouling on ro membrane by estimating the fouling potential of feed using a fouling index 27 28 several indices have been developed to predict the fouling potentials of ro membranes and assess the effectiveness of the pretreatment process 29 among various indices silt density index sdi was the first fouling index standardized by the american society for testing and materials astm and has emerged as the most widely used index for the estimation of the fouling potential of ro influents 30 31 because results can be obtained in a short time using simple equipment 32 33 the sdi estimates the filterability of influents based on the flux decline measurement 34 35 and can be generally applied to water with low fouling potential such as pretreated water used for ro or nanofiltration nf 36 based on ro membrane manufacturers or the instruction of ro membrane the sdi value limits for the influents are different 37 however sdi uses a nominal mf membrane size of 0 45 μm thus limiting its effective utilization as an index for foulants smaller than 0 45 μm 16 moreover foulants that are not retained on the membrane for sdi measurement have been found to cause fouling on the ro membrane 38 therefore efforts have been devoted to develop improved sdi metrics such as modified fouling index mfi cross flow sampler modified fouling index cfs mfi combined fouling index cfi and multiple membrane array system mmas 38 42 the mfi was derived based on a membrane filtration model 16 such as blocking cake and depth filtration 38 the cfs mfi was developed using an mfi operating under comparable hydrodynamic conditions as the ro module to simulate particle deposition before the mfi measurement 43 44 nevertheless the uncertain retention of the foulants less than 0 45 μm has limited the further application of these indices 36 alternatively indices based on membranes with smaller pore size such as uf or nf membranes have been developed 45 47 for example the cfi was developed based on a combination of three different membranes hydrophilic mf hydrophobic mf and hydrophilic uf membranes for the accurate prediction of the fouling of various size of foulants during the ro process 48 in addition the mmas is based on a combination of three different membranes i e mf uf and nf membranes in series in a single process 49 these two indices have attracted attention owing to their ability to simultaneously estimate the fouling potential of particles colloids and organic matters during nf or ro processes 50 51 however despite these efforts the complicated operation procedures and equipment involved in applying these indices have limited the further application of these indices 16 therefore sdi has remained the most frequently applied fouling parameter in the field 52 53 the properties of membrane material are important factors which can affect fouling formation in terms of hydrophilicity 54 55 in previous studies mosset et al 56 compared the sdi values with measuring using hydrophobic and hydrophilic membranes alhadidi et al 37 linked the sdi results to the membrane properties the membrane properties affect the sdi results by influencing the fouling adsorption therefore the membranes with different characteristics show the different sdi values in the measurement of the same feed water in addition according to astm american society for testing and materials standards the sdi developed in 1995 was used without a membrane material standard in 2007 the mce membrane was set as astm standard which is a mixture of cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate 57 it was selected because the mce membrane is more susceptible to fouling by colloidal materials than hard particles such as sands therefore it can predict the ro membrane fouling well however this is the reason for the selection without taking into account the characteristics of the influent for example although the sdi value is measured using a same material membrane for seawater desalination and municipal wastewater reuse for predicting fouling potential of feed water its effectiveness has been questioned as it is used as an absolute index regardless of the characteristics of raw water accordingly it is necessary to study the reaction characteristics between the sdi and organic fouling the membrane materials that can predict organic fouling most reliably in this study we investigated organic fouling properties of various types of membranes that can be applied for sdi test furthermore the properties of the investigated membranes were investigated organic fouling experiments were conducted using a model water sample composed of representative organic matters ro processes were performed to compare the sdi results of these membranes with the actual fouling profile the objective of this study was to discern the best membrane for municipal wastewater reuse 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation 2 1 1 mf pretreatment representative substances such as glucose peptone and humic acid that cause organic fouling were selected as the target organic matter and the model water was set at a concentration where the sdi value of each organic substance was similar to ensure that the organic substances had similar effects on the sdi the fouling potential of the organic substances was in the order of humic acid protein glucose 58 the model water was prepared using the following components 50 mg l of glucose sigma aldrich st louis mo usa 1 mg l of humic acid sigma aldrich and 2 mg l of peptone duksan company ansan south korea and deionized di water human power i human corporation seoul south korea table 1 shows the characteristics of the model water fig 1a shows the flowchart of the mf pretreatment process the apparatus used for this process consisted of a single mf hollow fiber membrane module average pore size 0 05 μm outer diameter 1 4 mm internal diameter 0 8 mm length 30 cm toray tokyo japan the size of the feed tank was approximately 10 l and the feed tank was filled continuously with the model water through the circulation pump cole parmer vernon hills il usa the flux was maintained at 42 l m2h polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane was cleaned using 1 sodium hypochlorite duksan company 59 2 2 sdi 2 2 1 sdi setup fig 1b shows the apparatus used for the sdi process and the sdi test was performed based on the astm procedure d4189 07 the sdi equipment consisted of a feed tank filtration pump valve pressure regulator pressure gauge membrane holder electronic balance and data logger the pressure was set at 207 kpa 30 psi using a pressure regulator 16 58 the entire apparatus was flushed with di water to remove contaminants before starting the test a membrane with a diameter of 47 mm was placed on the membrane holder and an o ring was placed on the membrane the holder was closed and the trapped air was removed using a ball valve to save data the setup was connected to a computer all tests were repeated to ensure reproducibility the sdi was calculated using the following formula eq 1 1 sd i t 100 1 t i t f t where t is the total elapsed filtration time min ti s is the time taken to collect an initial sample of 500 ml and tf s is the time taken to collect a final sample of 500 ml after time t 15 min 60 61 2 2 2 membrane materials several factors such as pore size hydrophilicity permeability roughness and surface charge affect the sdi value 16 in this study to identify the most effective membrane material for estimating ro organic fouling potential five different membrane materials from different suppliers were used first a mixed cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate mce membrane millipore burlington ma usa was used according to the astm procedure d4189 07 mce is a biologically inert mixture of cellulose nitrate cn and cellulose acetate 62 whose combination results in a membrane with a smoother and more uniform surface than pure nitrocellulose cn membrane whatman little chalfont england is the most commonly used material for the filtration of aqueous solutions 63 and its performance was compared to that of mce pvdf membrane millipore burlington ma usa is very susceptible to fouling by proteins which easily block the pores of the membrane and adhere to the membrane surface 64 polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe millipore burlington ma usa membrane was selected owing to its hydrophobicity and the effect of the hydrophobicity of the membrane on the sdi value and the effect of the hydrophilic membrane were compared the ptfe membrane was pretreated with methanol tokyo chemical industry tokyo japan for 2 h before the experiment owing to the nonwettability of the hydrophobic membrane lastly a polycarbonate pc membrane millipore burlington ma usa was selected to enhance the diversity of the investigated materials because it has a smooth glass like surface and a relatively constant pore size 2 3 ro process the ro experiment was conducted to compare the organic fouling potential results of the sdi of various membranes with the actual fouling of the ro fig 1c shows the flowchart of the ro process the simulator module contained a human machine interface hmi and a cell was connected to the feed tank the pressure and temperature were maintained within a range of 5 6 mpa and 77 f 25 c respectively the effluent that permeated through the cell was collected in a permeate tank and the flux was calculated and visualized through the hmi setup a polyamide thin film composite pa tfc which is the most popular membrane used for ro processes 65 66 was used as the ro membrane the effective area of the membrane was 136 75 cm2 the experiment was performed for a period of 20 h and the membrane was rinsed with di water before the foulants were extracted 2 4 membrane property analytical methods the contact angle which was used to analyze the hydrophobicity of the membrane surface 67 was evaluated using the sessile drop technique k100 kruss hamburg german for this analysis 40 mm 40 mm pieces of the virgin membranes were prepared after which 2 ml of distilled water was dropped onto the membrane surface using a micro syringe at 68 f 20 c the roughness of the membranes 60 μm 60 μm surface area was measured using atomic force microscopy afm xe 100 psia suwon south korea afm was performed using the root mean square rms as the best indicator of the surface roughness 68 the rsm was calculated using eq 2 2 rsm 1 v npnts y i 2 2 where vnpnts is the number of height events and yi is the peak height 68 the zeta potential of the membranes was analyzed using els 1000zs otsuka electronics osaka japan for this analysis 40 mm 15 mm pieces of cleaned virgin membranes were prepared the zeta potential measurements of the membranes were performed at ph 7 and the value was determined in mv all the membrane samples used for each analysis were dried at room temperature 68 f 20 c for 24 h before the measurements the permeate flux j analysis of each membrane was performed by measuring the pure water flux the pure water flux was tested using a dead end experimental device the effective filtration area of the membrane was 0 0069 m2 and j was calculated using eq 3 3 j q a t where q is the total permeation l s is the area of permeation m2 and t is the total time of permeation h 69 2 5 organic fouling characterization the morphology of the foulant layer was investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem verios g4 uc thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa 70 71 for this analysis a membrane surface area of 20 mm 20 mm was investigated at a magnification of 5000 the total organic carbon toc of the membranes was investigated to determine the quantity of organic fouling accumulated on each membrane using a toc l shumadzu corporation kyoto japan foulants were extracted from the fouled membranes by agitating the membranes in 0 01 n of sodium hydroxide 72 73 the agitation was conducted using a shaker at 150 rpm for 24 h at 77 f 25 c 74 75 the classes of organic fouling that had occurred on the membranes were identified using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd analysis the foulants were extracted using the same method as that used in the toc experiment and all samples were investigated after filtration through a 0 45 μm ca membrane sartorius stedim biotech goettingen germany prior to analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 analytical measurements 3 1 1 membrane characterization fig 2 shows the microstructures of the membranes investigated using fe sem to verify the fouling formation on the membranes fe sem images of each membrane were obtained before and after the sdi test as shown in fig 2a c and e the virgin mce cn and pvdf membranes exhibit sponge like structures with numerous interconnected and tortuous pores 76 in addition the virgin pc membrane exhibited uniform straight through circular pores 76 and the pore diameters were almost equal fig 2g furthermore the virgin ptfe membrane consisted of a ribbon shaped crystalline structure that was compactly folded into a globular shape fig 2i 77 after treatment with the model water the open pores in all the membranes became blocked furthermore the mce cn and pvdf membranes seemed to be more fouled than the pc and ptfe membranes in addition the blocked pores of the fouled mce cn and pvdf membranes were clearly visible with no noticeable differences among these membranes fig 2b d and f in contrast the pc membrane seemed to have relatively thin and homogeneous fouling layer fig 2h additionally the pore blocking and changes in pore structure of the ptfe membrane appeared less significant compared to the other membranes fig 2j these phenomena can be explained through the afm relative flux reduction rfd and toc analyses the afm results of the membranes which show the varying degrees of rsm roughness rq and average roughness ra of the membranes are shown in fig 3 78 79 the morphological characteristics of afm are described using x y and z coordinates the z coordinate corresponds to the relative height of the cantilever tip on the x and y location 80 ra corresponds to the average deviation of the z values from the mean plane 81 and can be considered as half of the average of peak to valley depth the rq values correspond to the standard deviation of z values 82 and they increase with an increase in the ra values and are generally larger than the ra values 80 the afm results can be clarified based on the fact that the darker part corresponds to the deeper bottom of the layer 83 84 as shown in fig 4a c the rq values of the mce cn and pvdf membranes are 525 802 and 939 nm respectively and are higher than those of the other membranes these values are consistent with those of previous studies wherein the fouling degree increased with an increase in the roughness value 85 87 roughness reduces the repulsive energy barrier height of membrane surface and makes membrane surface suitable for foulant deposition 88 consequently it enables the easy trapping of the foulants in the valleys of the rough membrane 80 therefore the fouling degree increased with an increase in the roughness value 80 88 89 the rq values of the pc and ptfe membrane were 67 and 367 nm respectively which were significantly lower than those of the other membranes fig 3d and e fig 4 shows the zeta potential results of the five virgin membranes used for the sdi test the pvdf membrane exhibited the highest surface charge 25 79 0 86 mv whereas the pc membrane was the most negatively charged membrane 37 98 0 3 mv charge attraction and repulsion occurs in opposite and similar charges respectively 90 accordingly fouling degree on the highly negatively charged membrane diminished owing to electrostatic repulsion thus reducing the fouling generation 52 these results indicate that the pvdf membrane exhibited a high fouling degree whereas the pc membrane exhibited less fouling owing to its charge repulsion mechanism fig 5 shows the contact angle and the pure water flux results of the five membranes the contact angle can be used to characterize the hydrophilicity of a membrane and the pure water flux reflects the permeability of a membrane the mce cn pvdf and pc membranes were hydrophilic in contrast the ptfe membrane with the highest contact angle was hydrophobic the hydrophilic membranes exhibited high and comparable water fluxes in contrast the ptfe membrane exhibited the lowest pure water flux which could be attributed to its hydrophobicity fig 6 shows the rfr ratio of the five membranes used in this study a high rfr ratio indicates that the membrane was susceptible to organic fouling which led to significant flux decline during the fouling test as shown in fig 6 the rfr ratios of the mce cn and pvdf membranes are higher than those of the pc and ptfe membranes in addition the pvdf membrane exhibited the highest rfr ratio indicating that it was most severely affected by organic foulants among the membranes this could be attributed to the characteristics of the membranes which is consistent with the sem results the sdi test was conducted using an influent with relatively high concentration levels compared to real municipal wastewater effluent which is used for recycling the sdi values of each membrane were very similar i e the sdi values of the mce cn pvdf ptfe and pc membranes were 6 58 0 02 6 52 0 04 6 58 0 14 6 61 0 01 and 6 38 0 16 respectively fig 7 however there was a significant difference in the quantity of organic foulants on the membranes and the properties of the foulants the toc values of the organic foulants of each membrane are shown in fig 8 the mce and cn membranes exhibited similar toc values i e 6 01 0 06 and 6 30 0 08 mg l respectively this could be attributed to the fact that these two membranes were composed of cn 62 91 the pvdf membrane exhibited the highest toc value 10 27 0 10 mg l which could be attributed to the susceptibility of the pvdf membrane to fouling caused by proteins 64 92 the toc value of the ptfe membrane was 3 08 0 12 mg l and the pc membrane exhibited the lowest toc value among the membranes 2 26 0 09 mg l these results are consistent with the surface roughness fig 3 and the fe sem results fig 2 in which roughness value of the ptfe membrane was lower and the fouling was less significant than on other membranes in addition the components of the organic substances adsorbed on the membranes were extensively investigated using lc ocd peptone corresponds to proteins and glucose corresponds to polysaccharides and aldehydes 93 the lc ocd profiles of the samples are shown in fig 8 the first peak observed in the lc ocd chromatograms was the biopolymers peak which corresponds to the presence of organics substances with high molecular weights 20 000 g mol and hydrophilicity such as polysaccharides proteins and amino sugars 16 94 95 fig 8 reveals that the pvdf membrane was the most effective membrane in predicting the presence of high molecular weight polysaccharides and proteins whereas the cn membrane could not sufficiently predict organic fouling by biopolymers these results are consistent with those of previous studies which revealed that pvdf material is susceptible to protein adsorption 64 92 the mce membrane exhibited the second highest biopolymer peak however the peak intensity was significantly lower than that of the pvdf membrane the biopolymer induced organic fouling of the ptfe and pc membranes was similar to that of the ro membrane the biopolymer induced organic fouling of the ro membrane was not severe the second peak observed in the lc ocd chromatograms was the peak related to humic substances which are composed of humic and fulvic acids molecular weight of approximately 1000 g mol 96 97 the mce membrane exhibited the highest humic percentage among the membranes the percentage of humic substances formed on the membranes were in the order of ptfe cn pc pvdf membranes no prominent peak relating to humic and fulvic acid approximately 1000 g mol was observed in the chromatogram of the ro pvdf and pc membranes peaks related to the presence of building blocks 300 500 g mol which are degradation products of humic substances 98 99 in the lc ocd chromatograms of the membranes are shown in fig 8 the fouling of the mce membrane by building blocks was significantly high the cn ptfe and pc membranes exhibited similar building blocks configurations peaks most of the organic foulants observed on the ro membrane were the degradation products from humic substances i e building blocks and the quantity was comparable to the quantity of those observed on the cn ptfe and pc membranes the pvdf membrane exhibited the lowest absorption of building blocks low molecular weight lmw neutrals 350 g mol correspond to the final degradation products of organic foulants 100 101 among the five fractions i e foulants fouling by lmw neutrals had the least effect on all the membranes similarly the lmw neutrals had no significant effect on the ro membrane additionally the lmw acid fraction which eludes from the size exclusion column after the lmw neutrals consisted of alcohols aldehydes sugars amino acids and ketones with a molecular weight range of less than 350 g mol 102 the lc ocd results indicate that the pvdf and cn membranes which exhibited the highest fouling degrees were most affected by the lmw neutrals which was followed by the mce and ptfe membranes in contrast the pc and ro membranes exhibited comparable tendency with almost no marked peaks in summary these results revealed that organic foulants were less deposited on the ptfe and pc membranes than on the mce cn and pvdf membranes this indicates that organic matters had no significant effect on the ptfe and pc membranes resulting in no significant peaks during chromatography in addition the building blocks accounted for the largest proportion of organic foulants on the ro membrane and fouling by lmw acids and biopolymers was observed 4 conclusions in this study sdi test was performed on five different membranes to compare the efficiency of their ability to predict the fouling of ro membranes caused by organic matters 0 45 μm which are the major cause of ro fouling the organic fouling potential of the membranes was investigated by evaluating the membrane properties such as zeta potential hydrophobicity and roughness although the sdi values of the five membranes were similar the characteristics of the foulants exhibited a completely different trend the mce membrane predicted the fouling of ro membranes with various kinds of organic pollutants particularly building blocks that had no significant effect on other membranes this indicates that it can be considered as an appropriate membrane for municipal wastewater containing a large amount of building blocks in addition the cn membrane was mostly affected by lmw acids and barely detected organic fouling by lmw neutrals among the membranes the pvdf membrane was most severely affected by organic foulants which were confirmed to be proteins and lmw acids this indicates that this membrane can be used to predict the fouling of ro membranes by effluent containing a large amount of proteins and lmw acids although the ptfe and pc membranes exhibited similar configuration peaks the quantity of humic substances and lmw organic matters observed on the ptfe membrane was higher than that on the pc membrane in addition the membrane fouling of the pc membrane was similar to that of ro membrane and a comparison of the potential of the five membranes revealed that the pc membrane is the most suitable material for predicting the organic fouling of ro membranes used for municipal wastewater reuse when predicting the organic fouling potential the pc membrane exhibited more reliable results than the mce membrane which is an astm standard membrane this indicates that it is essential to standardize the sdi value for pc membrane we

membranes with the actual fouling profile the objective of this study was to discern the best membrane for municipal wastewater reuse 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation 2 1 1 mf pretreatment representative substances such as glucose peptone and humic acid that cause organic fouling were selected as the target organic matter and the model water was set at a concentration where the sdi value of each organic substance was similar to ensure that the organic substances had similar effects on the sdi the fouling potential of the organic substances was in the order of humic acid protein glucose 58 the model water was prepared using the following components 50 mg l of glucose sigma aldrich st louis mo usa 1 mg l of humic acid sigma aldrich and 2 mg l of peptone duksan company ansan south korea and deionized di water human power i human corporation seoul south korea table 1 shows the characteristics of the model water fig 1a shows the flowchart of the mf pretreatment process the apparatus used for this process consisted of a single mf hollow fiber membrane module average pore size 0 05 μm outer diameter 1 4 mm internal diameter 0 8 mm length 30 cm toray tokyo japan the size of the feed tank was approximately 10 l and the feed tank was filled continuously with the model water through the circulation pump cole parmer vernon hills il usa the flux was maintained at 42 l m2h polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane was cleaned using 1 sodium hypochlorite duksan company 59 2 2 sdi 2 2 1 sdi setup fig 1b shows the apparatus used for the sdi process and the sdi test was performed based on the astm procedure d4189 07 the sdi equipment consisted of a feed tank filtration pump valve pressure regulator pressure gauge membrane holder electronic balance and data logger the pressure was set at 207 kpa 30 psi using a pressure regulator 16 58 the entire apparatus was flushed with di water to remove contaminants before starting the test a membrane with a diameter of 47 mm was placed on the membrane holder and an o ring was placed on the membrane the holder was closed and the trapped air was removed using a ball valve to save data the setup was connected to a computer all tests were repeated to ensure reproducibility the sdi was calculated using the following formula eq 1 1 sd i t 100 1 t i t f t where t is the total elapsed filtration time min ti s is the time taken to collect an initial sample of 500 ml and tf s is the time taken to collect a final sample of 500 ml after time t 15 min 60 61 2 2 2 membrane materials several factors such as pore size hydrophilicity permeability roughness and surface charge affect the sdi value 16 in this study to identify the most effective membrane material for estimating ro organic fouling potential five different membrane materials from different suppliers were used first a mixed cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate mce membrane millipore burlington ma usa was used according to the astm procedure d4189 07 mce is a biologically inert mixture of cellulose nitrate cn and cellulose acetate 62 whose combination results in a membrane with a smoother and more uniform surface than pure nitrocellulose cn membrane whatman little chalfont england is the most commonly used material for the filtration of aqueous solutions 63 and its performance was compared to that of mce pvdf membrane millipore burlington ma usa is very susceptible to fouling by proteins which easily block the pores of the membrane and adhere to the membrane surface 64 polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe millipore burlington ma usa membrane was selected owing to its hydrophobicity and the effect of the hydrophobicity of the membrane on the sdi value and the effect of the hydrophilic membrane were compared the ptfe membrane was pretreated with methanol tokyo chemical industry tokyo japan for 2 h before the experiment owing to the nonwettability of the hydrophobic membrane lastly a polycarbonate pc membrane millipore burlington ma usa was selected to enhance the diversity of the investigated materials because it has a smooth glass like surface and a relatively constant pore size 2 3 ro process the ro experiment was conducted to compare the organic fouling potential results of the sdi of various membranes with the actual fouling of the ro fig 1c shows the flowchart of the ro process the simulator module contained a human machine interface hmi and a cell was connected to the feed tank the pressure and temperature were maintained within a range of 5 6 mpa and 77 f 25 c respectively the effluent that permeated through the cell was collected in a permeate tank and the flux was calculated and visualized through the hmi setup a polyamide thin film composite pa tfc which is the most popular membrane used for ro processes 65 66 was used as the ro membrane the effective area of the membrane was 136 75 cm2 the experiment was performed for a period of 20 h and the membrane was rinsed with di water before the foulants were extracted 2 4 membrane property analytical methods the contact angle which was used to analyze the hydrophobicity of the membrane surface 67 was evaluated using the sessile drop technique k100 kruss hamburg german for this analysis 40 mm 40 mm pieces of the virgin membranes were prepared after which 2 ml of distilled water was dropped onto the membrane surface using a micro syringe at 68 f 20 c the roughness of the membranes 60 μm 60 μm surface area was measured using atomic force microscopy afm xe 100 psia suwon south korea afm was performed using the root mean square rms as the best indicator of the surface roughness 68 the rsm was calculated using eq 2 2 rsm 1 v npnts y i 2 2 where vnpnts is the number of height events and yi is the peak height 68 the zeta potential of the membranes was analyzed using els 1000zs otsuka electronics osaka japan for this analysis 40 mm 15 mm pieces of cleaned virgin membranes were prepared the zeta potential measurements of the membranes were performed at ph 7 and the value was determined in mv all the membrane samples used for each analysis were dried at room temperature 68 f 20 c for 24 h before the measurements the permeate flux j analysis of each membrane was performed by measuring the pure water flux the pure water flux was tested using a dead end experimental device the effective filtration area of the membrane was 0 0069 m2 and j was calculated using eq 3 3 j q a t where q is the total permeation l s is the area of permeation m2 and t is the total time of permeation h 69 2 5 organic fouling characterization the morphology of the foulant layer was investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem verios g4 uc thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa 70 71 for this analysis a membrane surface area of 20 mm 20 mm was investigated at a magnification of 5000 the total organic carbon toc of the membranes was investigated to determine the quantity of organic fouling accumulated on each membrane using a toc l shumadzu corporation kyoto japan foulants were extracted from the fouled membranes by agitating the membranes in 0 01 n of sodium hydroxide 72 73 the agitation was conducted using a shaker at 150 rpm for 24 h at 77 f 25 c 74 75 the classes of organic fouling that had occurred on the membranes were identified using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd analysis the foulants were extracted using the same method as that used in the toc experiment and all samples were investigated after filtration through a 0 45 μm ca membrane sartorius stedim biotech goettingen germany prior to analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 analytical measurements 3 1 1 membrane characterization fig 2 shows the microstructures of the membranes investigated using fe sem to verify the fouling formation on the membranes fe sem images of each membrane were obtained before and after the sdi test as shown in fig 2a c and e the virgin mce cn and pvdf membranes exhibit sponge like structures with numerous interconnected and tortuous pores 76 in addition the virgin pc membrane exhibited uniform straight through circular pores 76 and the pore diameters were almost equal fig 2g furthermore the virgin ptfe membrane consisted of a ribbon shaped crystalline structure that was compactly folded into a globular shape fig 2i 77 after treatment with the model water the open pores in all the membranes became blocked furthermore the mce cn and pvdf membranes seemed to be more fouled than the pc and ptfe membranes in addition the blocked pores of the fouled mce cn and pvdf membranes were clearly visible with no noticeable differences among these membranes fig 2b d and f in contrast the pc membrane seemed to have relatively thin and homogeneous fouling layer fig 2h additionally the pore blocking and changes in pore structure of the ptfe membrane appeared less significant compared to the other membranes fig 2j these phenomena can be explained through the afm relative flux reduction rfd and toc analyses the afm results of the membranes which show the varying degrees of rsm roughness rq and average roughness ra of the membranes are shown in fig 3 78 79 the morphological characteristics of afm are described using x y and z coordinates the z coordinate corresponds to the relative height of the cantilever tip on the x and y location 80 ra corresponds to the average deviation of the z values from the mean plane 81 and can be considered as half of the average of peak to valley depth the rq values correspond to the standard deviation of z values 82 and they increase with an increase in the ra values and are generally larger than the ra values 80 the afm results can be clarified based on the fact that the darker part corresponds to the deeper bottom of the layer 83 84 as shown in fig 4a c the rq values of the mce cn and pvdf membranes are 525 802 and 939 nm respectively and are higher than those of the other membranes these values are consistent with those of previous studies wherein the fouling degree increased with an increase in the roughness value 85 87 roughness reduces the repulsive energy barrier height of membrane surface and makes membrane surface suitable for foulant deposition 88 consequently it enables the easy trapping of the foulants in the valleys of the rough membrane 80 therefore the fouling degree increased with an increase in the roughness value 80 88 89 the rq values of the pc and ptfe membrane were 67 and 367 nm respectively which were significantly lower than those of the other membranes fig 3d and e fig 4 shows the zeta potential results of the five virgin membranes used for the sdi test the pvdf membrane exhibited the highest surface charge 25 79 0 86 mv whereas the pc membrane was the most negatively charged membrane 37 98 0 3 mv charge attraction and repulsion occurs in opposite and similar charges respectively 90 accordingly fouling degree on the highly negatively charged membrane diminished owing to electrostatic repulsion thus reducing the fouling generation 52 these results indicate that the pvdf membrane exhibited a high fouling degree whereas the pc membrane exhibited less fouling owing to its charge repulsion mechanism fig 5 shows the contact angle and the pure water flux results of the five membranes the contact angle can be used to characterize the hydrophilicity of a membrane and the pure water flux reflects the permeability of a membrane the mce cn pvdf and pc membranes were hydrophilic in contrast the ptfe membrane with the highest contact angle was hydrophobic the hydrophilic membranes exhibited high and comparable water fluxes in contrast the ptfe membrane exhibited the lowest pure water flux which could be attributed to its hydrophobicity fig 6 shows the rfr ratio of the five membranes used in this study a high rfr ratio indicates that the membrane was susceptible to organic fouling which led to significant flux decline during the fouling test as shown in fig 6 the rfr ratios of the mce cn and pvdf membranes are higher than those of the pc and ptfe membranes in addition the pvdf membrane exhibited the highest rfr ratio indicating that it was most severely affected by organic foulants among the membranes this could be attributed to the characteristics of the membranes which is consistent with the sem results the sdi test was conducted using an influent with relatively high concentration levels compared to real municipal wastewater effluent which is used for recycling the sdi values of each membrane were very similar i e the sdi values of the mce cn pvdf ptfe and pc membranes were 6 58 0 02 6 52 0 04 6 58 0 14 6 61 0 01 and 6 38 0 16 respectively fig 7 however there was a significant difference in the quantity of organic foulants on the membranes and the properties of the foulants the toc values of the organic foulants of each membrane are shown in fig 8 the mce and cn membranes exhibited similar toc values i e 6 01 0 06 and 6 30 0 08 mg l respectively this could be attributed to the fact that these two membranes were composed of cn 62 91 the pvdf membrane exhibited the highest toc value 10 27 0 10 mg l which could be attributed to the susceptibility of the pvdf membrane to fouling caused by proteins 64 92 the toc value of the ptfe membrane was 3 08 0 12 mg l and the pc membrane exhibited the lowest toc value among the membranes 2 26 0 09 mg l these results are consistent with the surface roughness fig 3 and the fe sem results fig 2 in which roughness value of the ptfe membrane was lower and the fouling was less significant than on other membranes in addition the components of the organic substances adsorbed on the membranes were extensively investigated using lc ocd peptone corresponds to proteins and glucose corresponds to polysaccharides and aldehydes 93 the lc ocd profiles of the samples are shown in fig 8 the first peak observed in the lc ocd chromatograms was the biopolymers peak which corresponds to the presence of organics substances with high molecular weights 20 000 g mol and hydrophilicity such as polysaccharides proteins and amino sugars 16 94 95 fig 8 reveals that the pvdf membrane was the most effective membrane in predicting the presence of high molecular weight polysaccharides and proteins whereas the cn membrane could not sufficiently predict organic fouling by biopolymers these results are consistent with those of previous studies which revealed that pvdf material is susceptible to protein adsorption 64 92 the mce membrane exhibited the second highest biopolymer peak however the peak intensity was significantly lower than that of the pvdf membrane the biopolymer induced organic fouling of the ptfe and pc membranes was similar to that of the ro membrane the biopolymer induced organic fouling of the ro membrane was not severe the second peak observed in the lc ocd chromatograms was the peak related to humic substances which are composed of humic and fulvic acids molecular weight of approximately 1000 g mol 96 97 the mce membrane exhibited the highest humic percentage among the membranes the percentage of humic substances formed on the membranes were in the order of ptfe cn pc pvdf membranes no prominent peak relating to humic and fulvic acid approximately 1000 g mol was observed in the chromatogram of the ro pvdf and pc membranes peaks related to the presence of building blocks 300 500 g mol which are degradation products of humic substances 98 99 in the lc ocd chromatograms of the membranes are shown in fig 8 the fouling of the mce membrane by building blocks was significantly high the cn ptfe and pc membranes exhibited similar building blocks configurations peaks most of the organic foulants observed on the ro membrane were the degradation products from humic substances i e building blocks and the quantity was comparable to the quantity of those observed on the cn ptfe and pc membranes the pvdf membrane exhibited the lowest absorption of building blocks low molecular weight lmw neutrals 350 g mol correspond to the final degradation products of organic foulants 100 101 among the five fractions i e foulants fouling by lmw neutrals had the least effect on all the membranes similarly the lmw neutrals had no significant effect on the ro membrane additionally the lmw acid fraction which eludes from the size exclusion column after the lmw neutrals consisted of alcohols aldehydes sugars amino acids and ketones with a molecular weight range of less than 350 g mol 102 the lc ocd results indicate that the pvdf and cn membranes which exhibited the highest fouling degrees were most affected by the lmw neutrals which was followed by the mce and ptfe membranes in contrast the pc and ro membranes exhibited comparable tendency with almost no marked peaks in summary these results revealed that organic foulants were less deposited on the ptfe and pc membranes than on the mce cn and pvdf membranes this indicates that organic matters had no significant effect on the ptfe and pc membranes resulting in no significant peaks during chromatography in addition the building blocks accounted for the largest proportion of organic foulants on the ro membrane and fouling by lmw acids and biopolymers was observed 4 conclusions in this study sdi test was performed on five different membranes to compare the efficiency of their ability to predict the fouling of ro membranes caused by organic matters 0 45 μm which are the major cause of ro fouling the organic fouling potential of the membranes was investigated by evaluating the membrane properties such as zeta potential hydrophobicity and roughness although the sdi values of the five membranes were similar the characteristics of the foulants exhibited a completely different trend the mce membrane predicted the fouling of ro membranes with various kinds of organic pollutants particularly building blocks that had no significant effect on other membranes this indicates that it can be considered as an appropriate membrane for municipal wastewater containing a large amount of building blocks in addition the cn membrane was mostly affected by lmw acids and barely detected organic fouling by lmw neutrals among the membranes the pvdf membrane was most severely affected by organic foulants which were confirmed to be proteins and lmw acids this indicates that this membrane can be used to predict the fouling of ro membranes by effluent containing a large amount of proteins and lmw acids although the ptfe and pc membranes exhibited similar configuration peaks the quantity of humic substances and lmw organic matters observed on the ptfe membrane was higher than that on the pc membrane in addition the membrane fouling of the pc membrane was similar to that of ro membrane and a comparison of the potential of the five membranes revealed that the pc membrane is the most suitable material for predicting the organic fouling of ro membranes used for municipal wastewater reuse when predicting the organic fouling potential the pc membrane exhibited more reliable results than the mce membrane which is an astm standard membrane this indicates that it is essential to standardize the sdi value for pc membrane we believe that the findings of this study will provide useful insights for future studies on the prediction of the organic fouling of the ro process declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13298,the data on the environmental concentration of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps is hardly investigated for major cities of the upper ganges basin india in this study fifteen ppcps were analyzed in four sewage treatment plants stps of haridwar and rishikesh cities located at the bank of river ganges india eleven ppcps were detected with an average total concentration of 147 20 ng l 1 in influent 105 06 ng l 1 in the effluent and 87 75 ng kg 1 in sludge from stps the average concentration ng l 1 of individual ppcps was recorded highest for caffeine 695 86 followed by ibuprofen 387 53 acetaminophen 152 81 triclosan 98 93 tetracycline 75 39 ketoprofen 69 47 deet 46 59 salicylic acid 45 02 erythromycin 32 98 ciprofloxacin 20 16 and metoprolol 13 61 at stps inlets results suggested a spatial and seasonal variation in ppcps loads in influent effluent and sludge in stps studied the overall ppcps removal efficiencies of stps were recorded in the ranges of 154 63 the total mass load of ppcps studied ranged between 0 02 and 448 64 mg d 1000 population this study concluded that stps are an active source of ppcps in the river ganges which may pose a grave threat to the health of the river ecosystem and human population graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps wastewater treatment plants anthropogenic pollution sludge disposals 1 introduction ppcps pesticides synthetic hormones and home care compounds are collectively termed as emerging contaminations ecs 1 in recent years the concentrations of ppcps in the global environment have increased substantially 2 3 ppcps are released as parental compounds their metabolites and modified products mainly through industrial and stps as well as surface discharges from disposed of contaminated sludges 4 8 however ubiquitously stps are considered a leading cause of ppcps in the urban water systems when flushed drains open into water bodies 4 9 10 the occurrence of ppcps in the ecosystem has a severe ecological concern because of their potential adversative impact on the overall aquatic environment 3 10 11 the pharmaceutical compounds which constitute the significant fractions of ppcps are partially metabolized within the human and animal body and up to 30 90 of their doses are discharged to domestic sewage via urine and feces 12 thus through a down the drain approach these chemicals pose severe environmental contamination and health risks 5 13 over the past years the presence of ppcps has been reported in multiple environmental matrices like surface water 3 14 15 rivers 10 16 17 groundwater 15 18 soils and sludges 19 20 the load of ppcps in stps as reported in different parts of india and the world is described briefly in table 1s supplementary section stps receive an enormous amount of ppcps in urban centers and thus have become the prime source of these chemicals in the environment 8 21 most of these compounds are present in the active forms in the sewage water and their removal and degradation mainly depend on the inlet load of such ppcps wastewater treatment mechanisms and environmental factors 3 10 22 23 in the recent past ppcps have been reported as common chemicals in untreated and treated urban wastewater in indian cities 5 24 27 the majority of stps in indian urban centers are based on the conventional mode of operation and thus not efficient to remove ppcps 24 according to a published report by the central pollution control board cpcb india only 38 23 280 million liters per day mld of the total sewage produced 61 950 mld is treated and the remaining untreated sewage is disposed to local freshwater bodies in urban centers 28 similarly in uttarakhand the sewage generation by metropolitan cities was reported 495 mld and installed treatment capacity is only for 152 9 mld 30 and rest of sewage 70 is being dumped river ganges and its tributaries thus the role of stps in ppcps mass load distribution in the indian river system needs to be explored extensively to assign the point and non point sources of ppcps in indian major cities the fate mass load and removal of ppcps in existing wastewater treatment facilities are not well documented for indian cities 9 however few previous reports revealed the load of ppcps at stps for few sites of india subedi et al 25 under a pilot survey reported concentration removal and the mass load of antipsychotics illicit drugs and related compounds in ng l 1 to μg l 1 in influent effluent and sludges in stps situated at bihar saidpur and beur tamil nadu coimbatore and karnataka udupi and manipal another study by mutiyar and mittal 24 revealed the load and removal rates of antibiotics in okhla stp and river yamuna in delhi during different seasons subedi et al 5 investigated the mass load and displacement of ppcps in two stps located in india s southern part mangalore and udupi their study indicated the presence of a total of 29 original compounds and 6 derivatives in influent samples and a mass load of 4 97 g d 1000 population was also recorded in this study prabhasankar et al 26 found a significant load of pharmaceutical compounds in stps from southern india and the removal rate varied from 60 to 100 for different pcs in this study after reviewing the available published literature it has been realized that northern indian cities are less explored regarding the concentration of ppcps in stps influents and their fate in the surrounding environment therefore this study was designed to examine the occurrence removal and mass load of ppcps in four stps located in the cities of rishikesh and haridwar at the bank of river ganges uttarakhand india this is the first study of two major cities in northern india to assess the concentration of ppcps in the stps results of this study could be used as chemical footprints of ppcps in the ganges which is considered as most important river system in asia supporting 400 million people for drinking and irrigation practices in indo gangetic plain furthermore the river ganges has significant cultural ecological and economic values as well and rishikesh and haridwar cities are also considered holy cities for hindu pilgrims more than 20 million people visit every year in these two cities to take a holy dip in the ganges and to achieve salvation as per hindu mythology 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents high purity grade analytical standards of all studied ppcps ibuprofen diclofenac ketoprofen acetaminophen

tourists visit these cities each year fig 1 according to the uttarakhand tourism development board utdb more than 20 million pilgrims tourists visited uttarakhand in 2016 17 29 without proper infrastructure to support this massive load of sewage caused by the floating population the existing stps could not handle this load and underperformed eventually leading to discharge their effluent directly into the river ganges causing additional ppcps contamination to see the load of ppcps and the removal efficiency of the existing stps table 1 a total of 108 samples from influent n 36 effluent n 36 and sludge samples n 36 including replicates were collected on single day 24 h sampling during monsoon august winter december 2016 and summer may 2017 24 h composite sampling methods

ketoprofen 91 66 metoprolol 91 66 triclosan 91 66 ciprofloxacin 66 66 erythromycin 50 00 and ibuprofen 33 33 again the mean concentration of caffeine 487 86 ng l 1 and ibuprofen 230 54 ng l 1 were recorded higher followed by acetaminophen 121 42 ng l 1 triclosan 62 01 ng l 1 tetracycline 51 18 ng l 1 deet 50 67 ng l 1 salicylic acid 36 93 ng l 1 erythromycin 21 82 ng l 1 ketoprofen 14 62 ng l 1 ciprofloxacin 12 18 ng l 1 and metoprolol 11 42 ng l 1 questioning the efficiency of the stps the concentration of individual ppcps was similar to the reported concentrations in stps in india and different parts of the world 35 37 38 the data for triclosan in the effluent 66 37 487 86 ng l 1 was significantly higher than those reported in switzerland 3 10 ng l 1 39 saidpur bihar bdl 25 united

3086 ng l 1 38 canada 1 μg l 1 42 and taiwan 552 1600 ng l 1 36 similarly the concentration of caffeine 66 37 1104 84 ng l 1 as observed was significantly higher than the previous report from bihar in india 19 0 ng l 1 25 the trend of ppcps in sludge samples was similar to the concentration found in effluent at stps with slight changes in the detection frequencies of few ppcps reported including triclosan 83 33 ciprofloxacin 50 00 erythromycin 41 66 and ibuprofen 41 66 the concentration of total ppcps in sewage sludge varied significantly among the different stps the total ppcp load in sludge was found in the ranges of 1 06 82 86 ng kg 1 stp 1 0 9 597 54 ng kg 1 stp 2 2 73 1148 8 ng kg 1 stp 3 and 2 1 1023 08 ng kg 1 stp 4 the mean concentration was again recorded highest for caffeine 522

212 ng g 1 dw and triclosan 255 m 4230 ng g 1 dw in sewage sludge from france yuan et al 44 had reported a greater level of caffeine 15 26 63 10 μg kg 1 and ciprofloxacin 230 93 355 40 μg kg 1 in sewage sludge samples collected from stps in beijing city china the stps wise relative distribution of individual ppcps in stps setups influent effluent and sludge are presented in fig 2 3 2 spatial variation of individual ppcps in influent effluent and sludge samples there was an apparent spatial variation for most ppcps observed in the influent and effluent samples in rishikesh and haridwar however in the stps the city wise concentration of ppcps differed significantly the concentrations of selected ppcps were reported higher in the stps of haridwar bdl to 1361 87 ng l 1 than the rishikesh bdl to 973 97 ng l 1 specifically in haridwar the concentration of nsaids antibiotics anti bacterial insect repellent and human indicator group of compounds was 1 1 5 times greater than the recorded concentration of ppcps in rishikesh s stps the high magnitude of ppcps in haridwar could be attributed to a variety of factors that affect the concentration in influent like climatic conditions a high population served by stps better sewerage connectivity than rishikesh a high number of dispensaries and hospitals being major tourist destinations and so on another important factor for the higher ppcps load in haridwar s stps could be the high domestic water load 70 since after consumption nearly all ppcps were discharged into the domestic wastewater the caffeine and nsaid s group combined constituted more than 80 of the total concentration of the studies ppcps in the influent of rishikesh and haridwar stps caffeine is the most widely consumed drug globally primarily used in beverages foods cough syrups and as a combination with some antipyretic medicines 1 45 it has high water solubility 21 600 mg l 1 at 25 c with a pka value of 10 4 showing a low accumulative tendency it is also the most commonly found chemical marker on the surface and groundwater indicating anthropogenic pollution the high per cent of caffeine at rishikesh 57 and haridwar 53 could be attributed to the high floating pilgrim population throughout the year similarly nsaids are frequently prescribed in modern medicines indicating their higher consumption rate in the rishikesh 16 65 and haridwar 28 0 ibuprofen acetaminophen and ketoprofen showed a concentration similar to earlier reported data on the indian wastewater 5 25 33 46 the high concentration of these compounds in the wastewater system is probably due to the area s high disease load to cure them a variety of nsaid combinations are available often as over counter products it is also found in combination with drugs for muscular pain inflammatory disorders and fever few early studies reported ibuprofen in the ranges of 12 1 373 1 μg l 1 in spain 47 26 45 μg l 1 in ghaziabad india 46 9 5 14 7 μg l 1 in the u s a 48 1 4 6 μg l 1 in switzerland 49 whereas for acetaminophen the concentration ranges from 6 80 μg l 1 in korea 50 1 6 μg l 1 and up to 10 μg l 1 in the effluent of stps at europe and natural water source in the usa respectively 51 the suggested therapeutic dose of ibuprofen for humans and veterinary animals ranges from 600 to 1200 mg d and the majority 70 80 of it gets excreted through urine and feces due to its low absorbance in the body 52 the remaining pharmaceutical compounds showed significant variation in the overall per cent load a higher load of antibiotics 8 67 beta blockers 1 14 metabolite 5 47 and insect repellent 6 05 were reported in the stps of rishikesh on the contrary a load of antibacterial compound triclosan 6 69 was found higher in haridwar s stps 3 3 seasonal variation in stps many researchers have suggested that the concentrations of ppcps in the influents and the effluents of the stps are influenced by seasonal variations 53 54 for instance sui et al 54 found higher concentrations of bezafibrate and chloramphenicol in winter than in summer pereira et al 55 measured the concentration of ppcps in the influent effluents and sludge samples from different stps showed discrepant seasonal variation they reported high concentrations of pharmaceuticals in summer than those found in spring in this study the ppcps concentrations were detected higher in influent water during the summer season may followed by winter december and monsoon august table 3 a similar result was also observed for the ppcps in the effluent water ppcps demonstrated seasonal fluctuations in the stps many of which can be described by the specific use of ppcps belonging to various therapeutic classes 54 in influent samples nsaids detected highest during the winter season 194 46 ng l 1 trailed by the summer 181 97 ng l 1 and monsoon 96 41 ng l 1 yu et al 53 reported the highest nsaids concentrations during the winter season at five stps in southern california usa supporting the findings the concentrations of antibiotics in influent samples were found to be higher in summer 57 75 ng l 1 and winter 54 67 ng l 1 season and the similar result were also found in the effluent samples the antibiotic concentration in influent was recorded highest for tetracycline 88 59 ng l 1 followed by erythromycin 41 72 ng l 1 ciprofloxacin 29 56 ng l 1 in the winter and summer season antibiotics are typically used to treat respiratory infections which are more common during the winter months 56 however owing to their importance as religious and tourist destinations the enormous number of tourists who visit these locations throughout the summer perhaps increases the antibiotic concentration in the stps all the antibiotics showed low concentration in the monsoon season due to an increase in rainfall causing dilution which might lead to low detection of ppcps 57 the relative seasonal distribution of individual ppcp compounds in influent effluent and sludge in studied stps are presented in fig 3 beta blockers metoprolol are commonly prescribed medications that have long been used to treat hypertension and heart dysfunction 58 in comparison to the winter load 13 76 ng l 1 the concentration was reported marginal high in the summer season 17 27 ng l 1 interestingly the metoprolol load in the effluents and sludge did not differ much from those found in the influents a higher concentration of metoprolol during the winter season is acceptable since blood pressure remains elevated due to cold temperatures causing blood vessels to shrink leading blood pressure to rise similarly the summer concentration could be high due to the body s efforts to emit heat as high temperatures and humidity promote increased blood flow to the skin resulting in higher metoprolol consumption 59 61 triclosan is a bactericide often found in cosmetics toothpaste shampoos soap sanitiser detergent deodorants and mouth rinses with concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 0 3 w w 48 moreover their higher consumption rate has been identified as the primary source of ecs to wastewater treatment facilities 62 63 in this study the triclosan concentration was testified highest in the influent of stps during summer 142 57 ng l 1 followed by winter 77 76 ng l 1 and monsoon 68 95 ng l 1 also observed similar seasonal variation for the samples collected from the effluents however in sludge samples exhibited the maximum concentration 59 1 ng kg 1 in the winter season than in monsoon 47 22 ng kg 1 and summer 40 71 ng kg 1 with a half life of less than 1 h dissociated triclosan is readily destroyed in sunlight through photodegradation during the summer season however non dissociated triclosan and methyl triclosan which make up the majority portion of triclosan are highly resistant to photodegradation and thus the concentration was found to be higher in the summer and winter seasons triclosan is converted by biological methylation into unknown metabolites and transformation products which are ultimately discharged into aquatic ecosystems via effluent discharge 39 64 salicylic acid followed a reverse trend than the previously mentioned ppcps the concentration of salicylic acid in influent samples was recorded highest during the winter 57 45 ng l 1 followed by summer 50 05 ng l 1 and monsoon 27 56 ng l 1 the same trend was also noticed in the effluent sample deet is primarily a vital ingredient used in insect repellent products worldwide 65 the principal route of deet entry into the aquatic environment is through domestic use 66 showering washing and flushing unwanted goods down the drain cause deet to enter the sewer system deet can also be introduced to the aquatic environment during recreational water activities 67 in this study the concentration in influent was reported highest during the summer season 65 96 ng l 1 followed by monsoon 49 14 ng l 1 and winter 24 66 ng l 1 deet showed similar seasonal variation patterns in the effluent and sludge samples with the highest concentration in summer which could be attributed to higher use of repellents due to increased insects and mosquitos during summer and monsoon seasons 68 69 because deet is mainly utilized as an insect repellent during the summer and in mosquito infested areas seasonal and regional variability in deet concentrations is expected 68 69 several studies have looked at the incidence of deet in temperate regions during the summer and winter finding lower quantities during the winter months 70 72 earlier studies also mentioned that deet based consumer products are the primary source of deet in the environment thus mainly occurs in a high range during the summer months in tropical parts of the world in wastewater samples 69 73 caffeine human indicator was found to be in the highest concentration among studied ppcps in stps in the summer season the concentration was reported highest in influent 895 06 ng l 1 effluent 685 16 ng l 1 and sludge sample 707 90 ng kg 1 followed by winter and monsoon caffeine is used in many processed foods chocolate pastries dairy desserts and beverages coffee tea energy drinks caffeinated soft drinks and medicines worldwide and the consumption of these caffeinated products in india is significantly higher 100 200 mg person day than the global average consumption approx 70 mg person day and increases further during hot summer condition thus found to be commonly in indian stp effluent 45 74 75 3 4 mass load of ppcps in stps ppcps mass load entering through influent into the wastewater treatment facilities was estimated in unit mg d 1000 population using the standard method which includes values of concentration of ppcps in influent the total population covered by the stp and the capacity of the stp in terms of inflow volume of wastewater table 4 the stps located in haridwar showed a more significant mass load of ppcps than in rishikesh the maximum mass load in stps was observed for ibuprofen 448 64 mg d 1000 population in winter followed by acetaminophen 229 mg d 1000 population and ibuprofen 622 16 mg d 1000 population this study s mass load was comparatively lower than those reported by subedi et al 5 in the stps of udupi and mangalore 4 97 g d 1000 population considering the mass load of all ppcps in the stps as 100 the ppcp percentage loads for each class of ppcps were also calculated the mean percentage mass loading of the human indicator caffeine in the stps was 53 17 followed by nsaid 23 77 antibiotics 7 16 antibacterial 6 22 insect repellent 5 03 metabolite 3 58 and β blockers 1 05 according to subedi et al 5 the calculation of the mass load of ppcps in stps is based on the individual compound per cent concentration the mass load in general depends on the working capacity of individual stp however most of the stps in this study have been working under capacity mode except stp 3 and stp 4 located at haridwar these stps have been working about 1 5 times higher than their installed capacity resulting in low removal efficiencies as per regular per capita water usage 250 l by the indian municipal community water usage by the people of rishikesh 13 mld and haridwar 104 mld was intended as 2 times higher than the working capacity of existing stps indicating the disparities in the predicted demand and supply 9 3 5 removal efficiency of stps the ppcps removal efficiency of individual stps varied significantly fig 4 the average total removal of ppcps occurred highest at stp 3 27 01 followed by stp 3 23 52 stp 4 22 18 and stp 1 8 39 among all the stps the removal of individual ppcps was recorded in the ranges of 22 99 54 34 triclosan 25 43 64 70 ciprofloxacin 21 52 50 36 erythromycin 11 50 62 87 ibuprofen 16 00 63 60 caffeine 183 17 42 34 ketoprofen 32 58 37 21 acetaminophen 16 66 54 63 tetracycline 40 39 54 63 metoprolol 49 65 35 25 deet and 46 11 40 70 salicylic acid the ve value is suggesting an increased level of ppcps concentration in the effluent than in influents similar incidences were also reported by earlier studies 59 76 77 ciprofloxacin had the highest average removal rate followed by caffeine ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin among the different stps stp 2 rishikesh had the highest overall ppcp removal and all stps can be ranked in the following order based on removal efficiencies stp 2 stp 3 stp 4 stp 1 the results suggested different removal efficiencies at various stps and it could be attributed to the load of ppcps in influent hydraulic retention time hrt rate daily wastewater load rate of adsorption and biological degradation of ppcps power failure the difference in the population served chemical nature of individual ppcps meteorological parameters rainfall and temperature etc 3 22 23 35 78 therefore individual ppcps have distinctive chemical properties and may have different mechanisms for removing degradation in stp 22 23 79 in this study all the stps are based on a conventional sequential batch reactor sbr except for stp 4 which works on the activated sludge process asp technique the sbr is a biological degradation technique that involves a series of processes including primary settling and equalization aerobic degradation and final settling or sedimentation 23 the asp is different from srb and it does not have primary settlements and is mainly based upon a continuous aeration process individual ppcps were removed at a lower concentration rate in this study than in reports from other parts of india the ppcps removal was comparable to reports by golet et al 80 49 60 anumol et al 9 10 and mohapatra et al 81 10 30 but slightly or significantly lower than others mutiyar and mittal 82 had reported the removal of antibiotics in the ranges of 55 99 in an stp in new delhi india subedi et al 5 in their study discovered that about 80 99 removal of caffeine triclocarban verapamil norverapamil diltiazem miconazole and oxybenzone from stp located at udupi and mangalore india in a few stps in michigan gao et al 83 reported removing broad spectrum antibiotics in the range of 2 99 during primary secondary and tertiary treatment procedures other reports suggested significant removal of triclosan from agrinio greece 18 77 84 canberra australia 42 97 85 and ulsan korea 20 75 86 stamatis and konstantinou 84 have reported removing ibuprofen in the ranges of 25 90 from stp located in greece individual ppcps are removed from stps through mechanisms such as sorption on organic particles flocculation and biological degradation during the treatment process the concentration of ppcps distributes between the solid and aqueous forms conditional to their hydrophobicity 87 due to a high kow log kd value sometimes ppcps show a greater affinity to get sorbed on the solid suspended particles in waste and then settle down in the form of the sewage sludge the ppcps with low kow values become resilient to microbial degradation and thus flushed with the effluent from the stp 79 this chemometric attribute further decides the fate of ppcps in effluent and sludge the conventional wastewater treatment process especially the activated sludge system cannot effectively remove the ppcps that are frequently detected in the effluents however these stps can remove the ppcps from wastewater although the effectiveness of removal varied substantially depending on the many factors that could contribute to the difference in removal effectiveness including the properties of activated sludge mixed liquid suspended solids and microbial community the content of wastewater physicochemical characteristics of compounds as well as environmental factors such as biological reactor arrangement and operational conditions sludge retention time hydraulic retention time and ph 85 88 in addition seasonal variations have been shown to impact the removal of some ppcps from stps for example an stp in greece showed slightly higher removal efficiency for paracetamol bezafibrate and ibuprofen in summer than in winter 89 which could be attributed to seasonal differences in ppcp consumption an increase in water consumption or rainfall dilution effects 90 91 to summarize conventional treatment processes are unable to eliminate ppcps from wastewater entirely instead advanced treatment techniques such as ozonation and uv oxidation break down ppcps in wastewater to protect the surface water sources physical biological and chemical approaches are the three types of advanced treatment processes for removing ppcps adsorption is the most common physical mechanism for removing trace organic pollutants from water and is also one of the primary procedures for eliminating ppcps from the environment 92 different adsorbents have been explored and developed to adsorption ppcps from aqueous solutions including activated carbon graphene and carbon nanotubes to improve the adsorption capacity for ppcps 93 96 membrane based separation methods have recently experienced unprecedented advancement and earned a respectable reputation because of the advantages of ease of operation low energy consumption easy scalability and a smaller footprint than traditional procedures 97 98 in biological degradation processes microbial degradation is the essential removal method for organic contaminants in the environment with various benefits such as low cost and easy operation microorganisms can remove pollutants by using them in their metabolic operations and in rare circumstances many microorganisms can work together to remove contaminants pure culture and mixed culture modes of microbial degradation are also possible many investigations have shown pure cultures isolated from activated sludge wastewater or sediment to eliminate the most often identified ppcps 99 on the other hand mixed cultures are easier to degrade the ppcps because obtaining a pure culture is difficult in some situations 100 apart from microorganisms the constructed wetland treatment system cwts is a nature based treatment approach based on shallow ponds beds or ditches with floating or emergent rooted wetland plants 101 photodegradation sorption aerobic anaerobic degradation and phytoremediation are some of the removal processes used in a cwts to treat wastewater efficiently 102 104 some of the advantages of cwts include that they can be used as a post treatment approach or even the only treatment method in regions where land availability is not a problem 73 105 this technology has been widely reported as a promising alternative to conventional wastewater treatment since it is a solar power driven ecologically friendly cost effective and sustainable reclamation strategy chemical oxidation technologies like ozonation and other advanced oxidation processes aops like uv h2o2 and electrochemical oxidation successfully broke down hazardous or resistant organic contaminants in an aqueous solution 106 107 the most common oxidation method for removing ppcps is ozone to remove ppcps ozone relies mainly on hydroxyl radicals potent non selective oxidizing activity 108 apart from ozone uv disinfection is also used after biological treatment and sand filtering in wastewater treatment to remove ppcps 109 3 6 general water quality parameters important wastewater ww parameters ph tss tds bod5 cod no3 and po4 2 were analyzed in influent and effluent of studied stps to see removal efficiency the variation in removing numerous water quality parameters is described in table 5 the ph in influent ranged between 6 11 and 7 49 among stps studied in most of the samples influent ph was in the acidic scale indicating the formation of organic acids during sewer transportation to stps or mixing of ww of acidic nature the high nutrient load especially no3 and po4 2 and oxygen demand bod3 and cod in influent suggest the high load of organic pollutants in these stps the bod3 at the inlet ranged between 104 and 195 mg l 1 among different stps the average bod removal was recorded as 54 29 55 12 53 22 and 55 73 in stp 1 stp 2 stp 3 and stp 4 respectively in india discharge standards for surface disposal of treated water are 30 250 10 and 5 mg l 1 for bod3 cod no3 and po4 2 respectively the bod3 in effluent ranged between 21 and 81 mg l 1 greater than the bod3 27 c limit decided by central pollution control board cpcb india for discharge into inland water bodies the variation in bod3 among stps could be due to factors like stps working loads the difference in population load served by stp connectivity of sewage system septage water and hydraulic retention time hrt the cod no3 and po4 2 among stps varied from 378 to 626 mg l 1 6 54 13 54 mg l 1 and 7 03 14 68 mg l 1 in influent and 148 301 mg l 1 4 98 9 01 mg l 1 and 5 02 11 25 mg l 1 in effluent respectively average no3 removal 22 34 stp 1 26 94 stp 2 35 95 stp 3 and 31 56 stp 4 were recorded among stps which could be attributed to the low nitrification process in the stps it is to be noted here that stp 3 stp 4 at haridwar receive a higher amount of wastewater 30 40 mld than its treatment capacity 18 27 mld respectively which could be responsible for lower removal of nutrients and biological oxygen load the nutrient load in influent meets with the indian regulatory standards for inland surface disposal it is suggested that a very high bod load 60 70 mg l in discharged effluent of a few stps especially stp 3 hrd and stp 4 hrd need to be reduced to avoid pollution in the river ganges as these stps are located nearby 100 200 m to the major stretch of river ganges and that may cause serious pollution level in river ganges 4 conclusions this study provides an opportunity to estimate the total load of ppcps in four stps located in two major cities of upper ganges bank india the significant concentration in influent of all stps suggests the excess use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in this region a spatial variation in ppcps concentration among cities was observed results suggested significant differences among all the four stps for the load of individual ppcps in influent effluent and settled sludges the average total removal of ppcps ranged from 183 17 to 64 70 with a mean value of 21 06 the maximum removal was observed in ciprofloxacin followed by caffeine ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin among different stps the removal efficiency was comparatively higher in stp 2 followed by stp 3 stp 4 and stp 1 this study suggests that the stps located at the upper ganges stretch are directly contributing to a load of emerging pollutants in the local environment which can cause severe threats to the ecosystem of the holy river ganges declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13298,the data on the environmental concentration of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps is hardly investigated for major cities of the upper ganges basin india in this study fifteen ppcps were analyzed in four sewage treatment plants stps of haridwar and rishikesh cities located at the bank of river ganges india eleven ppcps were detected with an average total concentration of 147 20 ng l 1 in influent 105 06 ng l 1 in the effluent and 87 75 ng kg 1 in sludge from stps the average concentration ng l 1 of individual ppcps was recorded highest for caffeine 695 86 followed by ibuprofen 387 53 acetaminophen 152 81 triclosan 98 93 tetracycline 75 39 ketoprofen 69 47 deet 46 59 salicylic acid 45 02 erythromycin 32 98 ciprofloxacin 20 16 and metoprolol 13 61 at stps inlets results suggested a spatial and seasonal variation in ppcps loads in influent effluent and sludge in stps studied the overall ppcps removal efficiencies of stps were recorded in the ranges of 154 63 the total mass load of ppcps studied ranged between 0 02 and 448 64 mg d 1000 population this study concluded that stps are an active source of ppcps in the river ganges which may pose a grave threat to the health of the river ecosystem and human population graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps wastewater treatment plants anthropogenic pollution sludge disposals 1 introduction ppcps pesticides synthetic hormones and home care compounds are collectively termed as emerging contaminations ecs 1 in recent years the concentrations of ppcps in the global environment have increased substantially 2 3 ppcps are released as parental compounds their metabolites and modified products mainly through industrial and stps as well as surface discharges from disposed of contaminated sludges 4 8 however ubiquitously stps are considered a leading cause of ppcps in the urban water systems when flushed drains open into water bodies 4 9 10 the occurrence of ppcps in the ecosystem has a severe ecological concern because of their potential adversative impact on the overall aquatic environment 3 10 11 the pharmaceutical compounds which constitute the significant fractions of ppcps are partially metabolized within the human and animal body and up to 30 90 of their doses are discharged to domestic sewage via urine and feces 12 thus through a down the drain approach these chemicals pose severe environmental contamination and health risks 5 13 over the past years the presence of ppcps has been reported in multiple environmental matrices like surface water 3 14 15 rivers 10 16 17 groundwater 15 18 soils and sludges 19 20 the load of ppcps in stps as reported in different parts of india and the world is described briefly in table 1s supplementary section stps receive an enormous amount of ppcps in urban centers and thus have become the prime source of these chemicals in the environment 8 21 most of these compounds are present in the active forms in the sewage water and their removal and degradation mainly depend on the inlet load of such ppcps wastewater treatment mechanisms and environmental factors 3 10 22 23 in the recent past ppcps have been reported as common chemicals in untreated and treated urban wastewater in indian cities 5 24 27 the majority of stps in indian urban centers are based on the conventional mode of operation and thus not efficient to remove ppcps 24 according to a published report by the central pollution control board cpcb india only 38 23 280 million liters per day mld of the total sewage produced 61 950 mld is treated and the remaining untreated sewage is disposed to local freshwater bodies in urban centers 28 similarly in uttarakhand the sewage generation by metropolitan cities was reported 495 mld and installed treatment capacity is only for 152 9 mld 30 and rest of sewage 70 is being dumped river ganges and its tributaries thus the role of stps in ppcps mass load distribution in the indian river system needs to be explored extensively to assign the point and non point sources of ppcps in indian major cities the fate mass load and removal of ppcps in existing wastewater treatment facilities are not well documented for indian cities 9 however few previous reports revealed the load of ppcps at stps for few sites of india subedi et al 25 under a pilot survey reported concentration removal and the mass load of antipsychotics illicit drugs and related compounds in ng l 1 to μg l 1 in influent effluent and sludges in stps situated at bihar saidpur and beur tamil nadu coimbatore and karnataka udupi and manipal another study by mutiyar and mittal 24 revealed the load and removal rates of antibiotics in okhla stp and river yamuna in delhi during different seasons subedi et al 5 investigated the mass load and displacement of ppcps in two stps located in india s southern part mangalore and udupi their study indicated the presence of a total of 29 original compounds and 6 derivatives in influent samples and a mass load of 4 97 g d 1000 population was also recorded in this study prabhasankar et al 26 found a significant load of pharmaceutical compounds in stps from southern india and the removal rate varied from 60 to 100 for different pcs in this study after reviewing the available published literature it has been realized that northern indian cities are less explored regarding the concentration of ppcps in stps influents and their fate in the surrounding environment therefore this study was designed to examine the occurrence removal and mass load of ppcps in four stps located in the cities of rishikesh and haridwar at the bank of river ganges uttarakhand india this is the first study of two major cities in northern india to assess the concentration of ppcps in the stps results of this study could be used as chemical footprints of ppcps in the ganges which is considered as most important river system in asia supporting 400 million people for drinking and irrigation practices in indo gangetic plain furthermore the river ganges has significant cultural ecological and economic values as well and rishikesh and haridwar cities are also considered holy cities for hindu pilgrims more than 20 million people visit every year in these two cities to take a holy dip in the ganges and to achieve salvation as per hindu mythology 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents high purity grade analytical standards of all studied ppcps ibuprofen diclofenac ketoprofen acetaminophen

haridwar are the two most significant cities of uttarakhand with a combined population of 0 3 million census 2011 and with their spiritual tourism and industrial significance millions of pilgrims tourists visit these cities each year fig 1 according to the uttarakhand tourism development board utdb more than 20 million pilgrims tourists visited uttarakhand in 2016 17 29 without proper infrastructure to support this massive load of sewage caused by the floating population the existing stps could not handle this load and underperformed eventually leading to discharge their effluent directly into the river ganges causing additional ppcps contamination to see the load of ppcps and the removal efficiency of the existing stps table 1 a total of 108 samples from influent n 36

results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of ppcps in stps the descriptive statistical results of the ppcps concentration and their detection frequencies in the influent effluent and sludge samples at different stps located in the upper ganges bank are presented in table 2 a total of eleven ppcps ketoprofen ibuprofen ciprofloxacin acetaminophen tetracycline metoprolol erythromycin triclosan deet salicylic acid and caffeine were recorded from the inlet of stps in this study in contrast ofloxacin diclofenac β estradiol and amoxicillin were not detected nd in any samples the concentration of ppcps in stps influent varied significantly among different locations the average total ppcps concentrations in influent ranged from 0 95 to 127 62 ng l 1 in stp 1 3 22 to 973 97 ng l 1 in stp 2 10 78 to 1361 87 ng l 1 in stp 3 and 8 64 to 1138 48 ng l 1 in stp 4 the compounds with highest detection frequency were acetaminophen 100 tetracycline 100 salicylic acid 100 deet 100 and caffeine 100 followed by ketoprofen 91 66 metoprolol 91 66 triclosan 91 66 ciprofloxacin 66 66 erythromycin 50 00 and ibuprofen 41 66 the mean concentration was recorded highest for the caffeine with a concentration of 695 86 ng l 1 followed by ibuprofen 387 53 ng l 1 acetaminophen 152 ng l 1 triclosan 98 92 ng l 1 tetracycline 75 39 ng l 1 ketoprofen 69 47 ng l 1 deet 46 59 ng l 1 salicylic acid 45 02 ng l 1 erythromycin 32 98 ng l 1 ciprofloxacin 20 16 ng l 1 and metoprolol 13 61 ng l 1 the concentration of recorded ppcps was in correspondence to earlier reports from india china u s as well as europe 24 26 33 36 in the effluents the main detected compounds with the highest detection frequency were acetaminophen 100 tetracycline 100 salicylic acid 100 deet 100 and caffeine 100 followed by ketoprofen 91 66 metoprolol 91 66 triclosan 91 66 ciprofloxacin 66 66 erythromycin 50 00 and ibuprofen 33 33 again the mean concentration of caffeine 487 86 ng l 1 and ibuprofen 230 54 ng l 1 were recorded higher followed by acetaminophen 121 42 ng l 1 triclosan 62 01 ng l 1 tetracycline 51 18 ng l 1 deet 50 67 ng l 1 salicylic acid 36 93 ng l 1 erythromycin 21 82 ng l 1 ketoprofen 14 62 ng l 1 ciprofloxacin 12 18 ng l 1 and metoprolol 11 42 ng l 1 questioning the efficiency of the stps the concentration of individual ppcps was similar to the reported concentrations in stps in india and different parts of the world 35 37 38 the data for triclosan in the effluent 66 37 487 86 ng l 1 was significantly higher than those reported in switzerland 3 10 ng l 1 39 saidpur bihar bdl 25 united kingdom 25 200 ng l 1 34 35 australia 23 434 ng l 1 40 udupi karnataka bdl 25 manipal karnataka bdl 25 and lower than from nagpur 3500 ng l 1 33 antibiotics load ciprofloxacin and erythromycin in this study was also reported comparatively higher than the reported concentration in stp at delhi 8 ng l 1 24 southern india 2 ng l 1 26 and uk 10 ng l 1 38 and lower than china 510 850 ng l 1 14 hyderabad 31 000 000 ng l 1 37 and uk 109 1385 ng l 1 34 35 41 nsaids ibuprofen and ketoprofen concentration bdl 372 11 ng l 1 was also found lower than that of reported results for bihar india 980 ng l 1 5 uk 3086 ng l 1 38 canada 1 μg l 1 42 and taiwan 552 1600 ng l 1 36 similarly the concentration of caffeine 66 37 1104 84 ng l 1 as observed was significantly higher than the previous report from bihar in india 19 0 ng l 1 25 the trend of ppcps in sludge samples was similar to the concentration found in effluent at stps with slight changes in the detection frequencies of few ppcps reported including triclosan 83 33 ciprofloxacin 50 00 erythromycin 41 66 and ibuprofen 41 66 the concentration of total ppcps in sewage sludge varied significantly among the different stps the total ppcp load in sludge was found in the ranges of 1 06 82 86 ng kg 1 stp 1 0 9 597 54 ng kg 1 stp 2 2 73 1148 8 ng kg 1 stp 3 and 2 1 1023 08 ng kg 1 stp 4 the mean concentration was again recorded highest for caffeine 522 38 ng kg 1 followed by ibuprofen 201 13 ng kg 1 triclosan 49 37 ng kg 1 acetaminophen 43 16 ng kg 1 deet 27 00 ng kg 1 erythromycin 21 96 ng kg 1 tetracycline 19 08 ng kg 1 ketoprofen 18 14 ng kg 1 ciprofloxacin 14 77 ng kg 1 salicylic acid 14 52 ng kg 1 and metoprolol 21 96 ng kg 1 subedi et al 25 reported significant concentration dry weight dw of triclosan 645 1470 ng g 1 dw ibuprofen nd 145 ng g 1 dw and caffeine 1 53 371 ng g 1 dw in sludge samples collected from stps at bihar karnataka and tamil nadu state in india peysson and vulliet 43 have also revealed the concentration of caffeine 212 ng g 1 dw and triclosan 255 m 4230 ng g 1 dw in sewage sludge from france yuan et al 44 had reported a greater level of caffeine 15 26 63 10 μg kg 1 and ciprofloxacin 230 93 355 40 μg kg 1 in sewage sludge samples collected from stps in beijing city china the stps wise relative distribution of individual ppcps in stps setups influent effluent and sludge are presented in fig 2 3 2 spatial variation of individual ppcps in influent effluent and sludge samples there was an apparent spatial variation for most ppcps observed in the influent and effluent samples in rishikesh and haridwar however in the stps the city wise concentration of ppcps differed significantly the concentrations of selected ppcps were reported higher in the stps of haridwar bdl to 1361 87 ng l 1 than the rishikesh bdl to 973 97 ng l 1 specifically in haridwar the concentration of nsaids antibiotics anti bacterial insect repellent and human indicator group of compounds was 1 1 5 times greater than the recorded concentration of ppcps in rishikesh s stps the high magnitude of ppcps in haridwar could be attributed to a variety of factors that affect the concentration in influent like climatic conditions a high population served by stps better sewerage connectivity than rishikesh a high number of dispensaries and hospitals being major tourist destinations and so on another important factor for the higher ppcps load in haridwar s stps could be the high domestic water load 70 since after consumption nearly all ppcps were discharged into the domestic wastewater the caffeine and nsaid s group combined constituted more than 80 of the total concentration of the studies ppcps in the influent of rishikesh and haridwar stps caffeine is the most widely consumed drug globally primarily used in beverages foods cough syrups and as a combination with some antipyretic medicines 1 45 it has high water solubility 21 600 mg l 1 at 25 c with a pka value of 10 4 showing a low accumulative tendency it is also the most commonly found chemical marker on the surface and groundwater indicating anthropogenic pollution the high per cent of caffeine at rishikesh 57 and haridwar 53 could be attributed to the high floating pilgrim population throughout the year similarly nsaids are frequently prescribed in modern medicines indicating their higher consumption rate in the rishikesh 16 65 and haridwar 28 0 ibuprofen acetaminophen and ketoprofen showed a concentration similar to earlier reported data on the indian wastewater 5 25 33 46 the high concentration of these compounds in the wastewater system is probably due to the area s high disease load to cure them a variety of nsaid combinations are available often as over counter products it is also found in combination with drugs for muscular pain inflammatory disorders and fever few early studies reported ibuprofen in the ranges of 12 1 373 1 μg l 1 in spain 47 26 45 μg l 1 in ghaziabad india 46 9 5 14 7 μg l 1 in the u s a 48 1 4 6 μg l 1 in switzerland 49 whereas for acetaminophen the concentration ranges from 6 80 μg l 1 in korea 50 1 6 μg l 1 and up to 10 μg l 1 in the effluent of stps at europe and natural water source in the usa respectively 51 the suggested therapeutic dose of ibuprofen for humans and veterinary animals ranges from 600 to 1200 mg d and the majority 70 80 of it gets excreted through urine and feces due to its low absorbance in the body 52 the remaining pharmaceutical compounds showed significant variation in the overall per cent load a higher load of antibiotics 8 67 beta blockers 1 14 metabolite 5 47 and insect repellent 6 05 were reported in the stps of rishikesh on the contrary a load of antibacterial compound triclosan 6 69 was found higher in haridwar s stps 3 3 seasonal variation in stps many researchers have suggested that the concentrations of ppcps in the influents and the effluents of the stps are influenced by seasonal variations 53 54 for instance sui et al 54 found higher concentrations of bezafibrate and chloramphenicol in winter than in summer pereira et al 55 measured the concentration of ppcps in the influent effluents and sludge samples from different stps showed discrepant seasonal variation they reported high concentrations of pharmaceuticals in summer than those found in spring in this study the ppcps concentrations were detected higher in influent water during the summer season may followed by winter december and monsoon august table 3 a similar result was also observed for the ppcps in the effluent water ppcps demonstrated seasonal fluctuations in the stps many of which can be described by the specific use of ppcps belonging to various therapeutic classes 54 in influent samples nsaids detected highest during the winter season 194 46 ng l 1 trailed by the summer 181 97 ng l 1 and monsoon 96 41 ng l 1 yu et al 53 reported the highest nsaids concentrations during the winter season at five stps in southern california usa supporting the findings the concentrations of antibiotics in influent samples were found to be higher in summer 57 75 ng l 1 and winter 54 67 ng l 1 season and the similar result were also found in the effluent samples the antibiotic concentration in influent was recorded highest for tetracycline 88 59 ng l 1 followed by erythromycin 41 72 ng l 1 ciprofloxacin 29 56 ng l 1 in the winter and summer season antibiotics are typically used to treat respiratory infections which are more common during the winter months 56 however owing to their importance as religious and tourist destinations the enormous number of tourists who visit these locations throughout the summer perhaps increases the antibiotic concentration in the stps all the antibiotics showed low concentration in the monsoon season due to an increase in rainfall causing dilution which might lead to low detection of ppcps 57 the relative seasonal distribution of individual ppcp compounds in influent effluent and sludge in studied stps are presented in fig 3 beta blockers metoprolol are commonly prescribed medications that have long been used to treat hypertension and heart dysfunction 58 in comparison to the winter load 13 76 ng l 1 the concentration was reported marginal high in the summer season 17 27 ng l 1 interestingly the metoprolol load in the effluents and sludge did not differ much from those found in the influents a higher concentration of metoprolol during the winter season is acceptable since blood pressure remains elevated due to cold temperatures causing blood vessels to shrink leading blood pressure to rise similarly the summer concentration could be high due to the body s efforts to emit heat as high temperatures and humidity promote increased blood flow to the skin resulting in higher metoprolol consumption 59 61 triclosan is a bactericide often found in cosmetics toothpaste shampoos soap sanitiser detergent deodorants and mouth rinses with concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 0 3 w w 48 moreover their higher consumption rate has been identified as the primary source of ecs to wastewater treatment facilities 62 63 in this study the triclosan concentration was testified highest in the influent of stps during summer 142 57 ng l 1 followed by winter 77 76 ng l 1 and monsoon 68 95 ng l 1 also observed similar seasonal variation for the samples collected from the effluents however in sludge samples exhibited the maximum concentration 59 1 ng kg 1 in the winter season than in monsoon 47 22 ng kg 1 and summer 40 71 ng kg 1 with a half life of less than 1 h dissociated triclosan is readily destroyed in sunlight through photodegradation during the summer season however non dissociated triclosan and methyl triclosan which make up the majority portion of triclosan are highly resistant to photodegradation and thus the concentration was found to be higher in the summer and winter seasons triclosan is converted by biological methylation into unknown metabolites and transformation products which are ultimately discharged into aquatic ecosystems via effluent discharge 39 64 salicylic acid followed a reverse trend than the previously mentioned ppcps the concentration of salicylic acid in influent samples was recorded highest during the winter 57 45 ng l 1 followed by summer 50 05 ng l 1 and monsoon 27 56 ng l 1 the same trend was also noticed in the effluent sample deet is primarily a vital ingredient used in insect repellent products worldwide 65 the principal route of deet entry into the aquatic environment is through domestic use 66 showering washing and flushing unwanted goods down the drain cause deet to enter the sewer system deet can also be introduced to the aquatic environment during recreational water activities 67 in this study the concentration in influent was reported highest during the summer season 65 96 ng l 1 followed by monsoon 49 14 ng l 1 and winter 24 66 ng l 1 deet showed similar seasonal variation patterns in the effluent and sludge samples with the highest concentration in summer which could be attributed to higher use of repellents due to increased insects and mosquitos during summer and monsoon seasons 68 69 because deet is mainly utilized as an insect repellent during the summer and in mosquito infested areas seasonal and regional variability in deet concentrations is expected 68 69 several studies have looked at the incidence of deet in temperate regions during the summer and winter finding lower quantities during the winter months 70 72 earlier studies also mentioned that deet based consumer products are the primary source of deet in the environment thus mainly occurs in a high range during the summer months in tropical parts of the world in wastewater samples 69 73 caffeine human indicator was found to be in the highest concentration among studied ppcps in stps in the summer season the concentration was reported highest in influent 895 06 ng l 1 effluent 685 16 ng l 1 and sludge sample 707 90 ng kg 1 followed by winter and monsoon caffeine is used in many processed foods chocolate pastries dairy desserts and beverages coffee tea energy drinks caffeinated soft drinks and medicines worldwide and the consumption of these caffeinated products in india is significantly higher 100 200 mg person day than the global average consumption approx 70 mg person day and increases further during hot summer condition thus found to be commonly in indian stp effluent 45 74 75 3 4 mass load of ppcps in stps ppcps mass load entering through influent into the wastewater treatment facilities was estimated in unit mg d 1000 population using the standard method which includes values of concentration of ppcps in influent the total population covered by the stp and the capacity of the stp in terms of inflow volume of wastewater table 4 the stps located in haridwar showed a more significant mass load of ppcps than in rishikesh the maximum mass load in stps was observed for ibuprofen 448 64 mg d 1000 population in winter followed by acetaminophen 229 mg d 1000 population and ibuprofen 622 16 mg d 1000 population this study s mass load was comparatively lower than those reported by subedi et al 5 in the stps of udupi and mangalore 4 97 g d 1000 population considering the mass load of all ppcps in the stps as 100 the ppcp percentage loads for each class of ppcps were also calculated the mean percentage mass loading of the human indicator caffeine in the stps was 53 17 followed by nsaid 23 77 antibiotics 7 16 antibacterial 6 22 insect repellent 5 03 metabolite 3 58 and β blockers 1 05 according to subedi et al 5 the calculation of the mass load of ppcps in stps is based on the individual compound per cent concentration the mass load in general depends on the working capacity of individual stp however most of the stps in this study have been working under capacity mode except stp 3 and stp 4 located at haridwar these stps have been working about 1 5 times higher than their installed capacity resulting in low removal efficiencies as per regular per capita water usage 250 l by the indian municipal community water usage by the people of rishikesh 13 mld and haridwar 104 mld was intended as 2 times higher than the working capacity of existing stps indicating the disparities in the predicted demand and supply 9 3 5 removal efficiency of stps the ppcps removal efficiency of individual stps varied significantly fig 4 the average total removal of ppcps occurred highest at stp 3 27 01 followed by stp 3 23 52 stp 4 22 18 and stp 1 8 39 among all the stps the removal of individual ppcps was recorded in the ranges of 22 99 54 34 triclosan 25 43 64 70 ciprofloxacin 21 52 50 36 erythromycin 11 50 62 87 ibuprofen 16 00 63 60 caffeine 183 17 42 34 ketoprofen 32 58 37 21 acetaminophen 16 66 54 63 tetracycline 40 39 54 63 metoprolol 49 65 35 25 deet and 46 11 40 70 salicylic acid the ve value is suggesting an increased level of ppcps concentration in the effluent than in influents similar incidences were also reported by earlier studies 59 76 77 ciprofloxacin had the highest average removal rate followed by caffeine ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin among the different stps stp 2 rishikesh had the highest overall ppcp removal and all stps can be ranked in the following order based on removal efficiencies stp 2 stp 3 stp 4 stp 1 the results suggested different removal efficiencies at various stps and it could be attributed to the load of ppcps in influent hydraulic retention time hrt rate daily wastewater load rate of adsorption and biological degradation of ppcps power failure the difference in the population served chemical nature of individual ppcps meteorological parameters rainfall and temperature etc 3 22 23 35 78 therefore individual ppcps have distinctive chemical properties and may have different mechanisms for removing degradation in stp 22 23 79 in this study all the stps are based on a conventional sequential batch reactor sbr except for stp 4 which works on the activated sludge process asp technique the sbr is a biological degradation technique that involves a series of processes including primary settling and equalization aerobic degradation and final settling or sedimentation 23 the asp is different from srb and it does not have primary settlements and is mainly based upon a continuous aeration process individual ppcps were removed at a lower concentration rate in this study than in reports from other parts of india the ppcps removal was comparable to reports by golet et al 80 49 60 anumol et al 9 10 and mohapatra et al 81 10 30 but slightly or significantly lower than others mutiyar and mittal 82 had reported the removal of antibiotics in the ranges of 55 99 in an stp in new delhi india subedi et al 5 in their study discovered that about 80 99 removal of caffeine triclocarban verapamil norverapamil diltiazem miconazole and oxybenzone from stp located at udupi and mangalore india in a few stps in michigan gao et al 83 reported removing broad spectrum antibiotics in the range of 2 99 during primary secondary and tertiary treatment procedures other reports suggested significant removal of triclosan from agrinio greece 18 77 84 canberra australia 42 97 85 and ulsan korea 20 75 86 stamatis and konstantinou 84 have reported removing ibuprofen in the ranges of 25 90 from stp located in greece individual ppcps are removed from stps through mechanisms such as sorption on organic particles flocculation and biological degradation during the treatment process the concentration of ppcps distributes between the solid and aqueous forms conditional to their hydrophobicity 87 due to a high kow log kd value sometimes ppcps show a greater affinity to get sorbed on the solid suspended particles in waste and then settle down in the form of the sewage sludge the ppcps with low kow values become resilient to microbial degradation and thus flushed with the effluent from the stp 79 this chemometric attribute further decides the fate of ppcps in effluent and sludge the conventional wastewater treatment process especially the activated sludge system cannot effectively remove the ppcps that are frequently detected in the effluents however these stps can remove the ppcps from wastewater although the effectiveness of removal varied substantially depending on the many factors that could contribute to the difference in removal effectiveness including the properties of activated sludge mixed liquid suspended solids and microbial community the content of wastewater physicochemical characteristics of compounds as well as environmental factors such as biological reactor arrangement and operational conditions sludge retention time hydraulic retention time and ph 85 88 in addition seasonal variations have been shown to impact the removal of some ppcps from stps for example an stp in greece showed slightly higher removal efficiency for paracetamol bezafibrate and ibuprofen in summer than in winter 89 which could be attributed to seasonal differences in ppcp consumption an increase in water consumption or rainfall dilution effects 90 91 to summarize conventional treatment processes are unable to eliminate ppcps from wastewater entirely instead advanced treatment techniques such as ozonation and uv oxidation break down ppcps in wastewater to protect the surface water sources physical biological and chemical approaches are the three types of advanced treatment processes for removing ppcps adsorption is the most common physical mechanism for removing trace organic pollutants from water and is also one of the primary procedures for eliminating ppcps from the environment 92 different adsorbents have been explored and developed to adsorption ppcps from aqueous solutions including activated carbon graphene and carbon nanotubes to improve the adsorption capacity for ppcps 93 96 membrane based separation methods have recently experienced unprecedented advancement and earned a respectable reputation because of the advantages of ease of operation low energy consumption easy scalability and a smaller footprint than traditional procedures 97 98 in biological degradation processes microbial degradation is the essential removal method for organic contaminants in the environment with various benefits such as low cost and easy operation microorganisms can remove pollutants by using them in their metabolic operations and in rare circumstances many microorganisms can work together to remove contaminants pure culture and mixed culture modes of microbial degradation are also possible many investigations have shown pure cultures isolated from activated sludge wastewater or sediment to eliminate the most often identified ppcps 99 on the other hand mixed cultures are easier to degrade the ppcps because obtaining a pure culture is difficult in some situations 100 apart from microorganisms the constructed wetland treatment system cwts is a nature based treatment approach based on shallow ponds beds or ditches with floating or emergent rooted wetland plants 101 photodegradation sorption aerobic anaerobic degradation and phytoremediation are some of the removal processes used in a cwts to treat wastewater efficiently 102 104 some of the advantages of cwts include that they can be used as a post treatment approach or even the only treatment method in regions where land availability is not a problem 73 105 this technology has been widely reported as a promising alternative to conventional wastewater treatment since it is a solar power driven ecologically friendly cost effective and sustainable reclamation strategy chemical oxidation technologies like ozonation and other advanced oxidation processes aops like uv h2o2 and electrochemical oxidation successfully broke down hazardous or resistant organic contaminants in an aqueous solution 106 107 the most common oxidation method for removing ppcps is ozone to remove ppcps ozone relies mainly on hydroxyl radicals potent non selective oxidizing activity 108 apart from ozone uv disinfection is also used after biological treatment and sand filtering in wastewater treatment to remove ppcps 109 3 6 general water quality parameters important wastewater ww parameters ph tss tds bod5 cod no3 and po4 2 were analyzed in influent and effluent of studied stps to see removal efficiency the variation in removing numerous water quality parameters is described in table 5 the ph in influent ranged between 6 11 and 7 49 among stps studied in most of the samples influent ph was in the acidic scale indicating the formation of organic acids during sewer transportation to stps or mixing of ww of acidic nature the high nutrient load especially no3 and po4 2 and oxygen demand bod3 and cod in influent suggest the high load of organic pollutants in these stps the bod3 at the inlet ranged between 104 and 195 mg l 1 among different stps the average bod removal was recorded as 54 29 55 12 53 22 and 55 73 in stp 1 stp 2 stp 3 and stp 4 respectively in india discharge standards for surface disposal of treated water are 30 250 10 and 5 mg l 1 for bod3 cod no3 and po4 2 respectively the bod3 in effluent ranged between 21 and 81 mg l 1 greater than the bod3 27 c limit decided by central pollution control board cpcb india for discharge into inland water bodies the variation in bod3 among stps could be due to factors like stps working loads the difference in population load served by stp connectivity of sewage system septage water and hydraulic retention time hrt the cod no3 and po4 2 among stps varied from 378 to 626 mg l 1 6 54 13 54 mg l 1 and 7 03 14 68 mg l 1 in influent and 148 301 mg l 1 4 98 9 01 mg l 1 and 5 02 11 25 mg l 1 in effluent respectively average no3 removal 22 34 stp 1 26 94 stp 2 35 95 stp 3 and 31 56 stp 4 were recorded among stps which could be attributed to the low nitrification process in the stps it is to be noted here that stp 3 stp 4 at haridwar receive a higher amount of wastewater 30 40 mld than its treatment capacity 18 27 mld respectively which could be responsible for lower removal of nutrients and biological oxygen load the nutrient load in influent meets with the indian regulatory standards for inland surface disposal it is suggested that a very high bod load 60 70 mg l in discharged effluent of a few stps especially stp 3 hrd and stp 4 hrd need to be reduced to avoid pollution in the river ganges as these stps are located nearby 100 200 m to the major stretch of river ganges and that may cause serious pollution level in river ganges 4 conclusions this study provides an opportunity to estimate the total load of ppcps in four stps located in two major cities of upper ganges bank india the significant concentration in influent of all stps suggests the excess use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in this region a spatial variation in ppcps concentration among cities was observed results suggested significant differences among all the four stps for the load of individual ppcps in influent effluent and settled sludges the average total removal of ppcps ranged from 183 17 to 64 70 with a mean value of 21 06 the maximum removal was observed in ciprofloxacin followed by caffeine ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin among different stps the removal efficiency was comparatively higher in stp 2 followed by stp 3 stp 4 and stp 1 this study suggests that the stps located at the upper ganges stretch are directly contributing to a load of emerging pollutants in the local environment which can cause severe threats to the ecosystem of the holy river ganges declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13299,aerobic granular sludge ags has the advantages of high biomass and compact structure for withstanding the shocks and toxins in this study the removal behaviors of two typical endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs 17β estradiol e2 and 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 by ags were investigated 93 5 of e2 and 84 8 of ee2 were removed at a concentration of 10 μg l during 120 d operation with the removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and tp reaching the same level as those in the control group batch experimental results showed that the biodegradation was the dominant mechanism of e2 removal while ee2 was more bio refractory and mainly removed via adsorption the adsorption of e2 and ee2 followed heterogeneous multilayer and chemical processes owing to the active adsorption sites provided by amides carboxylic groups hydroxyl groups and polysaccharides on ags at the same time zoogloea sphingomonas pseudomonas and brevundinomas were highly enriched under the pressure of estrogens which assisted in the stability of ags reactors by eps secretion and estrogens degradation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aerobic granular sludge estrogens adsorption biodegradation microbial community 1 introduction endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are mainly released into the environment through the excretion of human and animals which have attracted great concern due to their endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic biological activities at ng l level 1 5 steroidal estrogens exhibit the estrogenic potency of 102 to 103 times higher than other edcs including natural estrogens that mainly refer to estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 and synthetic estrogens like 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 6 9 among them ee2 and e2 are considered to be the most potently estrogenic compounds followed by e1 and e3 10 13 the discharge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps is responsible for the major source of edcs into receiving water bodies thus the occurrence and fate of these compounds in wwtps have been widely followed 14 18 the concentrations of e2 and ee2 in crude sewage are typically at tens of ng l and a few ng l respectively 5 14 19 the global average removal of e2 in wwtps accounts for 75 9 while time consuming and much lower ee2 removal is observed 5 biological treatments have been widely applied for the removal of estrogens and the corresponding performance of conventional activated sludge treatment anaerobic anoxic oxic process oxidation ditch membrane bioreactors and biofilm systems were broadly studied 13 20 25 however the objectives of current wwtps mainly focus on the nutrients removal leaving high residual rates of micropollutants like edcs aerobic granular sludge ags provides a new option for removing both micropollutants and nutrients due to its high biomass retention and compact granular structure 26 29 the limitation of oxygen and mass transfer in ags created multiple niches for microbes which ensures high diversity of microbial species and metabolic functions 30 32 as the advantages above ags can not only achieve simultaneous nutrients conversions cod nitrogen and phosphate but also tolerate shock loading and remove toxic micropollutants 27 33 36 despite the applicability of ags to various wastewater the removal of edcs by ags still remains unclearly understood therefore to explore the application potential of ags in treating estrogens containing wastewater systematic experiments focused on the removal performance of ags on two typical estrogens e2 and ee2 were conducted in this study the adsorption behaviors and the relative contributions of adsorption and degradation in the estrogens removal were determined through batch experiments furthermore sequencing batch reactors sbrs were built to evaluate the effects of selected estrogens on the reactor performance and physicochemical properties of aerobic granules finally possible removal mechanisms were proposed based on the functional groups eps and microbial communities of ags 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and sbr operation the activated sludge was sampled from hangzhou qige sewage treatment plant china the ags used in the batch experiments was collected from a laboratory scale sbr operated stably for 100 days the detailed properties of as and ags were shown in table s1 the working volume of the sbr was 4 l with a height to diameter h d ratio of 4 1 and the volume exchange ratio was 50 the running cycle was 4 h in total including feeding 10 min decanting 3 min with shortened settling time from 10 to 5 min and prolonged aeration from 217 to 222 min during the first 16 d operation the sludge retention time srt was naturally controlled by the discharged sludge with effluent the superficial gas velocity was 2 4 cm s and the hydraulic retention time hrt was about 8 h the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater containing cod tn nh4 n and tp of 550 30 60 3 27 3 and 10 1 mg l respectively detailed components in table s2 the ph of influent fluctuated from 6 7 to 7 5 and the ambient temperature remained at 25 2 c to explore the operation performance of ags reactor in the presence of estrogens two lab scale sbrs were built namely the target sbr r1 and the blank sbr r2 in the first 40 days the r1 and r2 reactor were operated under the same conditions as mentioned above from day 40 on the influent of r1 reactor was replaced by estrogens containing wastewater with 10 μg l e2 and 10 μg l ee2 while the r2 reactor was absence of estrogens during the whole operation of 120 days stock solutions of e2 and ee2 were both prepared with meoh to an initial concentration of 50 mg l and then diluted with milli q water for specific experiments the adverse effect of meoh on microbes in the reactor could be approximately negligible due to the high dilution ratio 2 2 batch experiments the activated sludge and ags were inactivated before batch sorption experiments by adding 0 3 w v sodium azide nan3 to eliminate the effects of biodegradation 37 38 mixed liquor of 150 ml estrogen solution and 1000 mg l of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were added into the flasks to determine the adsorption equilibrium time the initial concentrations of e2 and ee2 were 1 mg l and samples were collected at 0 0 25 0 5 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h to determine the adsorption isotherms the initial concentrations of e2 and ee2 were set at 0 25 0 5 1 2 and 4 mg l and samples were collected at 10 20 40 120 and 240 min the langmuir and freundlich isotherm model were used to analyze the adsorption processes the intra particle diffusion model first order pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic were used to fit the adsorption kinetics details in text s1 to investigate the effects of sludge concentration temperature and ph on the adsorption the initial concentrations of e2 ee2 were kept as 1 mg l the mlss effect was studied with mlss of 1000 52 2000 75 3000 80 and 4000 83 mg l the temperature effect was examined under temperature of 15 25 and 35 c and the ph effect was conducted at ph of 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 to evaluate the relative contributions of adsorption and degradation to estrogens removal batch removal experiments were further conducted mixed liquor of 200 ml with 4 mg l estrogen solution and 2000 mg l of mlss were added into the flasks samples were collected at 5 min 0 25 0 5 1 3 5 10 18 24 and 48

acetate 5 ml methanol and 10 ml ultrapure water were used to activate the spe column in order then the acidified sample ph 2 3 flowed through the column at a rate of 5 ml min and was drained for 30 min to remove the residual liquid 10 ml 10 methanol and 2 ml pure methanol were used for elution the collected eluent was concentrated with nitrogen diluted in methanol and filtrated for subsequent determination estrogen quantification was performed using hplc waters 1525 usa with a sample volume of 20 μl the column agilent eclipse xdb c18 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm was used and the column temperature was 25 c the mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile and ultrapure water 1 1 v v at a flow rate of 1 0ml min ultraviolet detection was 280 nm and the retention time was 8 min 2 4 analysis of eps components eps in the sludge samples were extracted according to a heating method with some modifications 40 the sludge was washed three times with deionized water and homogenized prior to eps extraction the washed sludge was resuspended in 0 05 nacl and heated at 65 c for 1 h the supernatant was harvested as eps after centrifuged at 20 000 rpm 4 c for 20 min and filtrated through 0 45 μm cellulose membrane filter the protein pn content in eps was further determined by a modified lowry colorimetric method with bovine albumin serum as the standards 41 the polysaccharide ps content was analyzed by the phenol sulfuric acid method using glucose as the standards 42 2 5 morphology of ags the granular size distribution was analyzed with wet dynamic image analyzer qicpic lixell germany

dehydrated with gradient concentration 15 35 55 75 85 and 95 of ethanol for 15 min twice the samples were further dried and sprayed with gold for sem observation 2 6 ftir spectroscopic analysis lyophilized ags was mixed with kbr at a mass ratio of 1 100 and the functional groups on the surface of ags were determined using ftir 8900 shimadzu japan all spectra involved 32 scans from 4000 to 400 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 2 7 analysis of microbial community the microbial community of aerobic granules was analyzed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 20 ml sludge samples were collected from the r1 and r2 reactors at day 0 40 80 120 respectively and the power soil dna extraction kit mo bio laboratories inc was used for dna extraction cetin et al 2018 the extracted dna was determined for its concentration and purity by 0 8 w v agarose gel electrophoresis and was stored at 80 c until analysis the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna for bacteria was amplified with universal primers 338f 5

significance was determined by one way analysis of variance anova and student s t test using spss version 22 0 and the data with p 0 05 were considered to be significantly different the correlations between environmental factors and the top 20 genera were analyzed by redundancy analysis rda using the vegan package of r software version 3 4 0 http vegan r forge r project org 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch sorption experiments 3 1 1 adsorption equilibrium the adsorption of estrogens on as and ags proceeded rapidly and showed similar variation trends fig s1 in all the groups the adsorbed amount of estrogens within 15 min accounted for more than 70 of the total absorbed amount and reached the equilibrium in 2 h however ags showed greater adsorption capacity on both estrogens than as for the removal efficiencies of e2 and ee2 on as were 46 5 2 2 and 51 6 2 7 and those of e2 and ee2 on ags were 55 4 2 8 and 62 8 1 1 respectively 3 1 2 isothermal adsorption process two distinctive phases were observed in the adsorption isotherms fig 1 the quick adsorption occurred within the first 10 min due to the high concentration and rapid diffusion of estrogens in aqueous phase the surface adsorption dominated by functional groups on the sludge did not require high activation energy thus the adsorption amount in this stage occupied most of the total amount with estrogens entering the pores of sludge mass transfer resistance increased and the number of effective adsorption sites decreased which led to a decrease of adsorption rate all the adsorption tests reached the equilibrium within 40 min and ags exhibited higher adsorption capacities of e2 and ee2 than as furthermore the adsorption capacity of ee2 was always greater than that of e2 under the same condition which could be attribute to the difference between the octanol water partition coefficient k ow of two estrogens the adsorption of estrogens on sludge are considered as distribution equilibrium processes of organic chemicals from aqueous phase to organic phase 46 the tendency of the process can be roughly reflected by log k ow value for chemicals with log k ow 1 are quite hydrophilic and possess low adsorption coefficients while those with log k ow 4 have high hydrophobicity and adsorption tendency 47 48 the larger log k ow of ee2 4 01 than e2 3 67 explains for the easier adsorption trend of ee2 on sludge 8 49 the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were employed to fit the adsorption isotherms which were mainly used to describe monolayer adsorption on uniform surfaces and multilayer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces respectively 50 as shown in table 1 and fig 2 both models had high correlation coefficients r 2 with the experimental data indicating the adsorption were likely to involve multiple mechanisms the freundlich model r 2 of 0 949 0 975 was found to better describe the isothermal adsorption than langmuir model r 2 of 0 924 0 959 thus the adsorption of estrogens on sludge were mainly directed by heterogeneous multilayer processes 51 kf and n in the freundlich model are indicators of affinity coefficient and linear index respectively the larger kf indicates the faster initial adsorption rate and high 1 n value reflects the nonlinear relationship of adsorption 52 53 the fitting 1 n values of all the groups ranged from 0 5 to 1 suggesting that both sludge had moderate adsorption capacities on e2 and ee2 the estrogens adsorption on ags showed larger kf and n value than those of as which indicates that both estrogens were more favorably absorbed by ags with regard to the adsorption capacity and rate 3 1 3 adsorption kinetics four models were employed to further investigate the adsorption kinetics of estrogens on ags it can be seen that the experimental data did not agree very well with the intra particle diffusion first order and pseudo first order model r 2 0 71 fig s2 and table s3 the fitting curves of the intra particle diffusion model failed to pass through the origin point indicating the existence of other rate limiting steps like boundary layer diffusion which closely related to the properties specific surface area and concentration of sludge 54 the well fitted adsorption kinetics by the pseudo second order model r 2 0 992 suggested the chemisorption of estrogens on ags 55 3 2 factors affecting adsorption of estrogens 3 2 1 effects of mlss the effects of mlss on estrogens adsorption by ags were investigated fig 3 a the adsorption efficiencies of estrogens constantly rose with mlss increasing from 1000 to 5000 mg l while the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe of e2 and ee2 decreased from 0 56 0 03 to 0 15 0 01 mg g and 0 49 0 02 to 0 13 0 01 mg g respectively it was assumed that more reactive adsorption sites were available at a higher sludge concentration leading to the increase of total adsorption amount however the adsorption capacity per unit mass sludge was reduced due to the intensified competition among the sufficient reactive sites in summary high biomass retention of ags provides advantages for the larger total adsorption capacity of ags over as 3 2 2 effects of ph as shown in fig 3b adsorption capacities of both estrogens changed slightly within ph below the dissociation constants pk a of e2 10 7 and ee2 10 4 the adsorption was largely contributed by the h bonding between the hydroxyl groups of estrogens and oxygen containing functional groups on sludge 56 however significant decrease was observed when ph exceeded their pk a for the h bonding was weakened due to the ionization of estrogens moreover excess oh competed with estrogen molecules for adsorption sites and the repulsive electronic forces enhanced at elevated ph both resulting in the reduction of adsorption capacities 57 58 3 2 3 effects of temperature the adsorption behaviors of ags at various temperatures 15 25 and 35 c were investigated fig 3c d and the corresponding parameters of the freundlich model were shown in table 2 the results showed that the adsorption data of e2 and ee2 both fitted well with the freundlich model r 2 0 95 the 1 n values varied under different temperatures implied some changes in adsorption mechanism the adsorption constant kf and qe decreased with the increase of temperature indicating that estrogens adsorption were exothermic processes therefore increasing temperature would lead to the desorption of estrogens from sludge 59 adsorption and degradation both actively contribute to the treatment of micropollutants like estrogens and adsorption is generally considered as the main removal mechanism at initial the degradation efficiency gradually improved with the saturation of adsorption sites and the adaptation of microbes to the pollutants exploration of the adsorption behaviors has confirmed that ags outperformed as in terms of both adsorption rate and capacity also allows for an estimated relative effectiveness between adsorption and degradation of ags in the estrogens removal thus providing insights into the significant application potential of ags system in treating estrogens containing wastewater 3 3 estrogens containing wastewater treatment by ags 3 3 1 effect of estrogens on reactor performance the sludge properties including mlss mlvss and svi in ags sbrs were shown in fig 4 a b the variations of average sludge size during the whole operation were displayed in fig s3 and sem analysis of the sludge were conducted at 35 d and 70 d fig s4 the sludge with poor settleability was discharged out of the reactors resulting in a sharp drop of mlss at start up biomass concentration and settleability of sludge gradually improved with the settling time shortened in 16 days meanwhile small granules were observed in two reactors it can be seen from fig s3 that the granulation processes were fully completed during 40 d operation reaching the average granular size of 648 27 and 723 39 μm in the r1 and r2 reactor respectively however the stability of ags in the r1 reactor deteriorated rapidly after estrogens addition from 40 d which was reflected in the significant decrease of mlss mlvss svi and granular size p 0 05 these sludge properties in the r1 reactor also exhibited the significant differences with those in the r2 reactor p 0 05 the adverse effects of estrogens lasted for around 10 days and were weakened by the adaption of microbes from 70 d on the sludge properties became stable and reached identical level with those in the r2 reactor p 0 05 after 120 days of operation mlss and svi of ags in the r1 reactor maintained at 5985 347 mg l and 33 4 mg l the granules maintained an average size of 708 33 μm with the mlvss mlss ratio of 0 84 0 08 the conversion rates of cod tn nh4 n and tp over the whole operation were assessed fig 4c f both reactors showed high cod removal efficiencies but poor removal performance of nitrogen and phosphorus at start up which were greatly improved with the processing of granulation however the presence of estrogens broke the steady state in the r1 reactor with the removal efficiencies of cod tn nh4 n and tp in the r1 reactor decreasing 7 4 0 6 9 8 1 5 10 5 1 2 and 13 1 2 6 respectively the performance of the r1 reactor recovered in 30 days which was in accord with the variations of sludge properties from 70 d till the end of the operation the average removal efficiencies of cod tn nh4 n and tp reached 92 5 2 7 75 0 1 2 98 9 1 8 and 82 0 2 3 in the r1 reactor respectively 3 3 2 removal of estrogens the concentrations of estrogens in the influent and effluent were determined over 120 d operation fig 4g h the removal efficiencies of estrogens were relatively low in the first 5 days and the adaptability of microbes in ags gradually enhanced under the presence of estrogens the removal performance of the r1 reactor remained quite stable from 90 d on with e2 and ee2 removal stabilizing at 93 5 2 4 and 84 8 1 8 on average respectively the difference between the removal of two estrogens could be mainly attributed to their physicochemical properties which would be discussed in section 3 4 3 3 4 possible removal mechanisms of estrogens by ags 3 4 1 analysis of functional groups functional groups distributed over the surface of granules can provide major adsorption sites for pollutants hence ftir analysis was performed to identify the functional groups that might involve in the estrogen adsorption as shown in fig 5 the broad peak at 3440 cm 1 shifted to 3458 cm 1 after adsorption which is attributed to nh and oh stretching vibrations of phenol carboxylic acids and carbohydrates the bands of 1647 and 1558 cm 1 also showed significant changes comparing with that before adsorption which are associated with the secondary structure of the proteins co nh2 nh cn of amide i and amide ii moreover the peaks at 1405 and 1084 cm 1 representing coo stretches of amino acids and coc of polysaccharides respectively both decreased and shifted to the longer wavenumber frequency after adsorption 60 61 all the changes indicated that amides carboxylic groups hydroxyl groups and polysaccharides of ags might act as major adsorption sites for estrogens possibly through chemical adsorption such as coordination binding and ion exchange 3 4 2 eps content of ags eps mainly consists of polysaccharides ps and proteins pn which is closely relating to the structure and functions of ags also capable of defensing environmental toxins 31 62 63 based on the above factors the variations of eps content in ags were measured during the whole operation fig s5 the pn content largely contributed to the eps content in both reactors and the increase of pn ps ratio reflected the fast granulation in 30 days the eps content and pn ps ratio in the r2 reactor continuously increased and reached the maximum at 45 d then stabilized at 238 65 mg gvss and 2 68 at 120 d respectively in contrast the pn ps ratio in the r1 reactor obviously decreased from 30 to 60 d with an significant increase of eps content to the maximum p 0 05 it was speculated that estrogens triggered the defense mechanisms of microbes hence eps mostly ps was abundantly secreted as the protective barrier by interacting with estrogens and promoting cell aggregation 64 65 the charged groups e g carboxyl hydroxyl phosphoric phenolic groups and hydrophobic regions e g highly acetylated polysaccharides or apolar groups from aromatics and aliphatics in proteins in eps are reported to contribute to the adsorption capacity of organic substances 63 66 and hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions play the crucial role in binding of organic substances to eps which partly explains for the increasing eps content as a response to estrogen addition 67 68 with the adaption to estrogens eps content in the r1 reactor slowly decreased to 226 95 mg gvss and the pn ps ratio recovered to 1 89 at 120 d 3 4 3 relative roles of adsorption and biodegradation free estrogens in the aqueous phase are removed through three main pathways which are respectively volatilization adsorption and biodegradation 3 however both e2 and ee2 have low vapor pressures 10 8 level and corresponding small henry s law constants indicating their loss through volatilization is considered to be quite limited under normal conditions 69 the established control groups in the batch experiments absence of sludge showed almost zero estrogens removal also confirmed the low volatility of estrogens the non volatile free estrogens transfer from the liquid phase to the solid phase by adsorption and to be further biodegraded the adsorption rates of estrogens were determined under the inactivation of microbes by nan3 as described in section 2 2 accordingly the relative contribution of biodegradation was calculated as the difference between total removal and adsorption fig 6 the total removal efficiency of e2 rapidly reached 84 6 3 8 by ags and 71 9 2 4 by as at 1 h and stabilized in 5 h biodegradation was calculated to be the dominant removal mechanism of e2 occupying 64 1 0 7 and 58 7 1 4 in the overall removal by ags 99 3 0 6 and as 90 2 1 2 respectively ee2 was removed rapidly in 5 min with a high proportion of adsorption the total removal efficiencies of ee2 by as and ags were 72 3 1 7 and 89 5 2 3 of which the adsorption accounted for 46 5 1 5 and 50 7 0 9 respectively the results proved ee2 was more resistant to biodegradation than e2 despite the similarity between their molecular structures this is likely related to the fact that ee2 is a synthetic estrogen with an ethinyl group on c17 which can potentially block the access to the hydroxyl group located in the same position making it more difficult to be degraded 70 73 in general e2 removal mainly depends on biodegradation while adsorption plays a leading role in the ee2 removal explaining for the difference between the removal efficiencies of two estrogens in sbrs moreover the removal performance of ags on both estrogens either adsorption or biodegradation were superior to those of as 3 4 4 dynamics of microbial community in sbrs the microbial community structure of granular sludge in the ags reactors was analyzed by high throughput sequencing to investigate the effects of estrogens on microbes the identified microbial community at the phylum level in ags samples were shown in fig 7 a proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in both reactors throughout the operation the relative abundances of proteobacteria increased from 46 3 to 65 7 and 70 4 in the r1 and r2 reactor respectively while those of bacteroidetes presented an overall downward trend in the two reactors over time the decreasing extent of bacteroidetes in the r1 reactor was less than that in the r2 reactor besides actinobacteria and firmicutes enriched more in the r1 reactor indicating their resistance to estrogens many estrogens degraders are subject to the above phyla which is in accordance with our results 49 in contrast some microbes were inhibited by estrogens the relative abundances of nitrospirae and verrucomicrobia significantly decreased in the r1 reactor from 40 days on p 0 05 as reported in previous investigations nitrospirae and verrucomicrobia presented high sensitivity to the exposure to organic pollutants and followed by significant decrease in their abundances which might be responsible for the deterioration of nitrogen removal in the sbr 74 76 gemmatimonadetes eventually disappeared in the r1 reactor while increased obviously in the r2 reactor over time p 0 05 the dynamics of the top genera in the ags samples were presented in the heatmap fig 7b zoogloea was found to be the most dominant bacteria in both reactors which enriched faster and maintained a higher relative abundance in the r1 reactor than in the r2 reactor it was reported that zoogloea could enhance the adhesion and hydrophobicity of sludge by eps secretion thereby promoting microbial aggregation and granular stability under estrogens stress 77 78 thauera known for its eps secretion and denitrifying ability enriched in both reactors for nitrogen removal and keeping granular stability 79 some species of thauera are also found to be aromatic compounds degraders 80 meanwhile sphingomonas and pseudomonas significantly enriched after addition of estrogens into the r1 reactor p 0 05 which are reported that possess the ability to convert e2 to e1 but few strains can further degrade e1 81 84 the relative abundances of rhodococcus novosphingobium and brevundinomas also increased to 2 56 3 42 and 5 27 in the r1 reactor after adding estrogens respectively estrogen degrading cultures of these genera are widely isolated from activated sludge 85 87 pseudomonas and rhodococcus belong to only eight genera that have been identified to degrade both natural and synthetic estrogens 49 the above bacteria endowed ags with high biodegradation capacity of estrogens conversely significant decline in the relative abundances of paracoccus gemmatimonas nitrospira were detected in the r1 reactor p 0 05 indicating the inhibitory effects of estrogens the responses of microbial community to estrogens pressure were attributed to multiple processes estrogens resistant microbes were selectively enriched and eps secretors also increased to protect pollutants degraders and other species in granules which help maintain the overall microbial activity of ags several functional microbes were greatly inhibited by estrogens explaining for the deterioration of reactor performance in short term redundancy analysis rda was conducted to reveal the potential relationship between the top 20 genera and physiochemical properties during operation the mlss svi the ratio of food and microorganisms f m pn and ps contents estrogens concentrations were selected as possible indicators as shown in fig 8 microbial communities were significantly dissimilar from those in r1 and r2 from 40 day on p 0 05 the comparison between r1 40 and r1 80 also reflected a dynamic shift of microbial community in ags under the continuous inflow of estrogens while the difference decreased at 120 d operation the relative abundances of the dominant genus zoogloea sphingomonas pseudomonas and brevundinomas had positive correlation with e2 and ee2 suggesting the ability of these microorganisms for withstanding high selective pressures however nitrospira was significantly decreased under the shock of estrogens p 0 05 also svi and the change of ps content were significantly associated with microbial community p 0 05 especially in r1 80 the results suggested that the deterioration of sludge settleability played a key role in shaping the relative abundances and dominant genera and the microbes capable of secreting ps reflected the superiority after estrogens addition the pn content was also studied while no statistically significant correlation was found p 0 05 the rda analysis indicated that e2 and ee2 concentrations were the most profound influencing variable of estrogens at the genus level followed by svi and ps content 4 conclusions in this study ags obtained strong resistance and adaptability to the two estrogens namely e2 and ee2 the removal performance of cod nitrogen and phosphorus recovered rapidly under estrogens pressure with the simultaneous removal efficiencies of 93 5 e2 and 84 8 ee2 adsorption and biodegradation jointly contributed to the removal of estrogens by ags however the contribution ratio of two mechanisms in total removal of e2 and ee2 differed a lot the adsorption were heterogeneous multi layer and chemical processes with carboxylic groups hydroxyl groups amides and polysaccharides on ags acting as the possible adsorption sites the functional bacteria including zoogloea sphingomonas pseudomonas and brevundinomas played important roles in resisting estrogens via

13299,aerobic granular sludge ags has the advantages of high biomass and compact structure for withstanding the shocks and toxins in this study the removal behaviors of two typical endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs 17β estradiol e2 and 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 by ags were investigated 93 5 of e2 and 84 8 of ee2 were removed at a concentration of 10 μg l during 120 d operation with the removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and tp reaching the same level as those in the control group batch experimental results showed that the biodegradation was the dominant mechanism of e2 removal while ee2 was more bio refractory and mainly removed via adsorption the adsorption of e2 and ee2 followed heterogeneous multilayer and chemical processes owing to the active adsorption sites provided by amides carboxylic groups hydroxyl groups and polysaccharides on ags at the same time zoogloea sphingomonas pseudomonas and brevundinomas were highly enriched under the pressure of estrogens which assisted in the stability of ags reactors by eps secretion and estrogens degradation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aerobic granular sludge estrogens adsorption biodegradation microbial community 1 introduction endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are mainly released into the environment through the excretion of human and animals which have attracted great concern due to their endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic biological activities at ng l level 1 5 steroidal estrogens exhibit the estrogenic potency of 102 to 103 times higher than other edcs including natural estrogens that mainly refer to estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 and synthetic estrogens like 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 6 9 among them ee2 and e2 are considered to be the most potently estrogenic compounds followed by e1 and e3 10 13 the discharge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps is responsible for the major source of edcs into receiving water bodies thus the occurrence and fate of these compounds in wwtps have been widely followed 14 18 the concentrations of e2 and ee2 in crude sewage are typically at tens of ng l and a few ng l respectively 5 14 19 the global average removal of e2 in wwtps accounts for 75 9 while time consuming and much lower ee2 removal is observed 5 biological treatments have been widely applied for the removal of estrogens and the corresponding performance of conventional activated sludge treatment anaerobic anoxic oxic process oxidation ditch membrane bioreactors and biofilm systems were broadly studied 13 20 25 however the objectives of current wwtps mainly focus on the nutrients removal leaving high residual rates of micropollutants like edcs aerobic granular sludge ags provides a new option for removing both micropollutants and nutrients due to its high biomass retention and compact granular structure 26 29 the limitation of oxygen and mass transfer in ags created multiple niches for microbes which ensures high diversity of microbial species and metabolic functions 30 32 as the advantages above ags can not only achieve simultaneous nutrients conversions cod nitrogen and phosphate but also tolerate shock loading and remove toxic micropollutants 27 33 36 despite the applicability of ags to various wastewater the removal of edcs by ags still remains unclearly understood therefore to explore the application potential of ags in treating estrogens containing wastewater systematic experiments focused on the removal performance of ags on two typical estrogens e2 and ee2 were conducted in this study the adsorption behaviors and the relative contributions of adsorption and degradation in the estrogens removal were determined through batch experiments furthermore sequencing batch reactors sbrs were built to evaluate the effects of selected estrogens on the reactor performance and physicochemical properties of aerobic granules finally possible removal mechanisms were proposed based on the functional groups eps and microbial communities of ags 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and sbr operation the activated sludge was sampled from hangzhou qige sewage treatment plant china the ags used in the batch experiments was collected from a laboratory scale sbr operated stably for 100 days the detailed properties of as and ags were shown in table s1 the working volume of the sbr was 4 l with a height to diameter h d ratio of 4 1 and the volume exchange ratio was 50 the running cycle was 4 h in total including feeding 10 min decanting 3 min with shortened settling time from 10 to 5 min and prolonged aeration from 217 to 222 min during the first 16 d operation the sludge retention time srt was naturally controlled by the discharged sludge with effluent the superficial gas velocity was 2 4 cm s and the hydraulic retention time hrt was about 8 h the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater containing cod tn nh4 n and tp of 550 30 60 3 27 3 and 10 1 mg l respectively detailed components in table s2 the ph of influent fluctuated from 6 7 to 7 5 and the ambient temperature remained at 25 2 c to explore the operation performance of ags reactor in the presence of estrogens two lab scale sbrs were built namely the target sbr r1 and the blank sbr r2 in the first 40 days the r1 and r2 reactor were operated under the same conditions as mentioned above from day 40 on the influent of r1 reactor was replaced by estrogens containing wastewater with 10 μg l e2 and 10 μg l ee2 while the r2 reactor was absence of estrogens during the whole operation of 120 days stock solutions of e2 and ee2 were both prepared with meoh to an initial concentration of 50 mg l and then diluted with milli q water for specific experiments the adverse effect of meoh on microbes in the reactor could be approximately negligible due to the high dilution ratio 2 2 batch experiments the activated sludge and ags were inactivated before batch sorption experiments by adding 0 3 w v sodium azide nan3 to eliminate the effects of biodegradation 37 38 mixed liquor of 150 ml estrogen solution and 1000 mg l of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were added into the flasks to determine the adsorption equilibrium time the initial concentrations of e2 and ee2 were 1 mg l and samples were collected at 0 0 25 0 5 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h to determine the adsorption isotherms the initial concentrations of e2 and ee2 were set at 0 25 0 5 1 2 and 4 mg l and samples were collected at 10 20 40 120 and 240 min the langmuir and freundlich isotherm model were used to analyze the adsorption processes the intra particle diffusion model first order pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic were used to fit the adsorption kinetics details in text s1 to investigate the effects of sludge concentration temperature and ph on the adsorption the initial concentrations of e2 ee2 were kept as 1 mg l the mlss effect was studied with mlss of 1000 52 2000 75 3000 80 and 4000 83 mg l the temperature effect was examined under temperature of 15 25 and 35 c and the ph effect was conducted at ph of 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 to evaluate the relative contributions of adsorption and degradation to estrogens removal batch removal

acetate 5 ml methanol and 10 ml ultrapure water were used to activate the spe column in order then the acidified sample ph 2 3 flowed through the column at a rate of 5 ml min and was drained for 30 min to remove the residual liquid 10 ml 10 methanol and 2 ml pure methanol were used for elution the collected eluent was concentrated with nitrogen diluted in methanol and filtrated for subsequent determination estrogen quantification was performed using hplc waters 1525 usa with a sample volume of 20 μl the column agilent eclipse xdb c18 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm was used and the column temperature was 25 c the mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile and ultrapure water 1 1 v v at a flow rate of 1 0ml min ultraviolet detection was 280 nm and the retention time was 8 min 2 4 analysis of eps components eps in the sludge samples were extracted according to a heating method with some modifications 40 the sludge was washed three times with deionized water and homogenized prior to eps extraction the washed sludge was resuspended in 0 05 nacl and heated at 65 c for 1 h the supernatant was harvested as eps after centrifuged at 20 000 rpm 4 c for 20 min and filtrated through 0 45 μm cellulose membrane filter the protein pn content in eps was further determined by a modified lowry colorimetric method with bovine albumin serum as the standards 41 the polysaccharide ps content was

dehydrated with gradient concentration 15 35 55 75 85 and 95 of ethanol for 15 min twice the samples were further dried and sprayed with gold for sem observation 2 6 ftir spectroscopic analysis lyophilized ags was mixed with kbr at a mass ratio of 1 100 and the functional groups on the surface of ags were determined using ftir 8900 shimadzu japan all spectra involved 32 scans from 4000 to 400 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 2 7 analysis of microbial community the microbial community of aerobic granules was analyzed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 20 ml sludge samples were collected from the r1 and r2 reactors at day 0 40 80 120 respectively and the power soil dna extraction kit mo bio laboratories inc was used for dna extraction cetin et al 2018 the extracted dna was determined for its concentration and purity by 0 8 w v agarose gel electrophoresis and was stored at 80 c until analysis the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna for bacteria was amplified with universal primers 338f 5

significance was determined by one way analysis of variance anova and student s t test using spss version 22 0 and the data with p 0 05 were considered to be significantly different the correlations between environmental factors and the top 20 genera were analyzed by redundancy analysis rda using the vegan package of r software version 3 4 0 http vegan r forge r project org 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch sorption experiments 3 1 1 adsorption equilibrium the adsorption of estrogens on as and ags proceeded rapidly and showed similar variation trends fig s1 in all the groups the adsorbed amount of estrogens within 15 min accounted for more than 70 of the total absorbed amount and reached the equilibrium in 2 h however ags showed greater adsorption capacity on both estrogens than as for the removal efficiencies of e2 and ee2 on as were 46 5 2 2 and 51 6 2 7 and those of e2 and ee2 on ags were 55 4 2 8 and 62 8 1 1 respectively 3 1 2 isothermal adsorption process two distinctive phases were observed in the adsorption isotherms fig 1 the quick adsorption occurred within the first 10 min due to the high concentration and rapid diffusion of estrogens in aqueous phase the surface adsorption dominated by functional groups on the sludge did not require high activation energy thus the adsorption amount in this stage occupied most of the total amount with estrogens entering the pores of sludge mass transfer resistance increased and the number of effective adsorption sites decreased which led to a decrease of adsorption rate all the adsorption tests reached the equilibrium within 40 min and ags exhibited higher adsorption capacities of e2 and ee2 than as furthermore the adsorption capacity of ee2 was always greater than that of e2 under the same condition which could be attribute to the difference between the octanol water partition coefficient k ow of two estrogens the adsorption of estrogens on sludge are considered as distribution equilibrium processes of organic chemicals from aqueous phase to organic phase 46 the tendency of the process can be roughly reflected by log k ow value for chemicals with log k ow 1 are quite hydrophilic and possess low adsorption coefficients while those with log k ow 4 have high hydrophobicity and adsorption tendency 47 48 the larger log k ow of ee2 4 01 than e2 3 67 explains for the easier adsorption trend of ee2 on sludge 8 49 the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were employed to fit the adsorption isotherms which were mainly used to describe monolayer adsorption on uniform surfaces and multilayer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces respectively 50 as shown in table 1 and fig 2 both models had high correlation coefficients r 2 with the experimental data indicating the adsorption were likely to involve multiple mechanisms the freundlich model r 2 of 0 949 0 975 was found to better describe the isothermal adsorption than langmuir model r 2 of 0 924 0 959 thus the adsorption of estrogens on sludge were mainly directed by heterogeneous multilayer processes 51 kf and n in the freundlich model are indicators of affinity coefficient and linear index respectively the larger kf indicates the faster initial adsorption rate and high 1 n value reflects the nonlinear relationship of adsorption 52 53 the fitting 1 n values of all the groups ranged from 0 5 to 1 suggesting that both sludge had moderate adsorption capacities on e2 and ee2 the estrogens adsorption on ags showed larger kf and n value than those of as which indicates that both estrogens were more favorably absorbed by ags with regard to the adsorption capacity and rate 3 1 3 adsorption kinetics four models were employed to further investigate the adsorption kinetics of estrogens on ags it can be seen that the experimental data did not agree very well with the intra particle diffusion first order and pseudo first order model r 2 0 71 fig s2 and table s3 the fitting curves of the intra particle diffusion model failed to pass through the origin point indicating the existence of other rate limiting steps like boundary layer diffusion which closely related to the properties specific surface area and concentration of sludge 54 the well fitted adsorption kinetics by the pseudo second order model r 2 0 992 suggested the chemisorption of estrogens on ags 55 3 2 factors affecting adsorption of estrogens 3 2 1 effects of mlss the effects of mlss on estrogens adsorption by ags were investigated fig 3 a the adsorption efficiencies of estrogens constantly rose with mlss increasing from 1000 to 5000 mg l while the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe of e2 and ee2 decreased from 0 56 0 03 to 0 15 0 01 mg g and 0 49 0 02 to 0 13 0 01 mg g respectively it was assumed that more reactive adsorption sites were available at a higher sludge concentration leading to the increase of total adsorption amount however the adsorption capacity per unit mass sludge was reduced due to the intensified competition among the sufficient reactive sites in summary high biomass retention of ags provides advantages for the larger total adsorption capacity of ags over as 3 2 2 effects of ph as shown in fig 3b adsorption capacities of both estrogens changed slightly within ph below the dissociation constants pk a of e2 10 7 and ee2 10 4 the adsorption was largely contributed by the h bonding between the hydroxyl groups of estrogens and oxygen containing functional groups on sludge 56 however significant decrease was observed when ph exceeded their pk a for the h bonding was weakened due to the ionization of estrogens moreover excess oh competed with estrogen molecules for adsorption sites and the repulsive electronic forces enhanced at elevated ph both resulting in the reduction of adsorption capacities 57 58 3 2 3 effects of temperature the adsorption behaviors of ags at various temperatures 15 25 and 35 c were investigated fig 3c d and the corresponding parameters of the freundlich model were shown in table 2 the results showed that the adsorption data of e2 and ee2 both fitted well with the freundlich model r 2 0 95 the 1 n values varied under different temperatures implied some changes in adsorption mechanism the adsorption constant kf and qe decreased with the increase of temperature indicating that estrogens adsorption were exothermic processes therefore increasing temperature would lead to the desorption of estrogens from sludge 59 adsorption and degradation both actively contribute to the treatment of micropollutants like estrogens and adsorption is generally considered as the main removal mechanism at initial the degradation efficiency gradually improved with the saturation of adsorption sites and the adaptation of microbes to the pollutants exploration of the adsorption behaviors has confirmed that ags outperformed as in terms of both adsorption rate and capacity also allows for an estimated relative effectiveness between adsorption and degradation of ags in the estrogens removal thus providing insights into the significant application potential of ags system in treating estrogens containing wastewater 3 3 estrogens containing wastewater treatment by ags 3 3 1 effect of estrogens on reactor performance the sludge properties including mlss mlvss and svi in ags sbrs were shown in fig 4 a b the variations of average sludge size during the whole operation were displayed in fig s3 and sem analysis of the sludge were conducted at 35 d and 70 d fig s4 the sludge with poor settleability was discharged out of the reactors resulting in a sharp drop of mlss at start up biomass concentration and settleability of sludge gradually improved with the settling time shortened in 16 days meanwhile small granules were observed in two reactors it can be seen from fig s3 that the granulation processes were fully completed during 40 d operation reaching the average granular size of 648 27 and 723 39 μm in the r1 and r2 reactor respectively however the stability of ags in the r1 reactor deteriorated rapidly after estrogens addition from 40 d which was reflected in the significant decrease of mlss mlvss svi and granular size p 0 05 these sludge properties in the r1 reactor also exhibited the significant differences with those in the r2 reactor p 0 05 the adverse effects of estrogens lasted for around 10 days and were weakened by the adaption of microbes from 70 d on the sludge properties became stable and reached identical level with those in the r2 reactor p 0 05 after 120 days of operation mlss and svi of ags in the r1 reactor maintained at 5985 347 mg l and 33 4 mg l the granules maintained an average size of 708 33 μm with the mlvss mlss ratio of 0 84 0 08 the conversion rates of cod tn nh4 n and tp over the whole operation were assessed fig 4c f both reactors showed high cod removal efficiencies but poor removal performance of nitrogen and phosphorus at start up which were greatly improved with the processing of granulation however the presence of estrogens broke the steady state in the r1 reactor with the removal efficiencies of cod tn nh4 n and tp in the r1 reactor decreasing 7 4 0 6 9 8 1 5 10 5 1 2 and 13 1 2 6 respectively the performance of the r1 reactor recovered in 30 days which was in accord with the variations of sludge properties from 70 d till the end of the operation the average removal efficiencies of cod tn nh4 n and tp reached 92 5 2 7 75 0 1 2 98 9 1 8 and 82 0 2 3 in the r1 reactor respectively 3 3 2 removal of estrogens the concentrations of estrogens in the influent and effluent were determined over 120 d operation fig 4g h the removal efficiencies of estrogens were relatively low in the first 5 days and the adaptability of microbes in ags gradually enhanced under the presence of estrogens the removal performance of the r1 reactor remained quite stable from 90 d on with e2 and ee2 removal stabilizing at 93 5 2 4 and 84 8 1 8 on average respectively the difference between the removal of two estrogens could be mainly attributed to their physicochemical properties which would be discussed in section 3 4 3 3 4 possible removal mechanisms of estrogens by ags 3 4 1 analysis of functional groups functional groups distributed over the surface of granules can provide major adsorption sites for pollutants hence ftir analysis was performed to identify the functional groups that might involve in the estrogen adsorption as shown in fig 5 the broad peak at 3440 cm 1 shifted to 3458 cm 1 after adsorption which is attributed to nh and oh stretching vibrations of phenol carboxylic acids and carbohydrates the bands of 1647 and 1558 cm 1 also showed significant changes comparing with that before adsorption which are associated with the secondary structure of the proteins co nh2 nh cn of amide i and amide ii moreover the peaks at 1405 and 1084 cm 1 representing coo stretches of amino acids and coc of polysaccharides respectively both decreased and shifted to the longer wavenumber frequency after adsorption 60 61 all the changes indicated that amides carboxylic groups hydroxyl groups and polysaccharides of ags might act as major adsorption sites for estrogens possibly through chemical adsorption such as coordination binding and ion exchange 3 4 2 eps content of ags eps mainly consists of polysaccharides ps and proteins pn which is closely relating to the structure and functions of ags also capable of defensing environmental toxins 31 62 63 based on the above factors the variations of eps content in ags were measured during the whole operation fig s5 the pn content largely contributed to the eps content in both reactors and the increase of pn ps ratio reflected the fast granulation in 30 days the eps content and pn ps ratio in the r2 reactor continuously increased and reached the maximum at 45 d then stabilized at 238 65 mg gvss and 2 68 at 120 d respectively in contrast the pn ps ratio in the r1 reactor obviously decreased from 30 to 60 d with an significant increase of eps content to the maximum p 0 05 it was speculated that estrogens triggered the defense mechanisms of microbes hence eps mostly ps was abundantly secreted as the protective barrier by interacting with estrogens and promoting cell aggregation 64 65 the charged groups e g carboxyl hydroxyl phosphoric phenolic groups and hydrophobic regions e g highly acetylated polysaccharides or apolar groups from aromatics and aliphatics in proteins in eps are reported to contribute to the adsorption capacity of organic substances 63 66 and hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions play the crucial role in binding of organic substances to eps which partly explains for the increasing eps content as a response to estrogen addition 67 68 with the adaption to estrogens eps content in the r1 reactor slowly decreased to 226 95 mg gvss and the pn ps ratio recovered to 1 89 at 120 d 3 4 3 relative roles of adsorption and biodegradation free estrogens in the aqueous phase are removed through three main pathways which are respectively volatilization adsorption and biodegradation 3 however both e2 and ee2 have low vapor pressures 10 8 level and corresponding small henry s law constants indicating their loss through volatilization is considered to be quite limited under normal conditions 69 the established control groups in the batch experiments absence of sludge showed almost zero estrogens removal also confirmed the low volatility of estrogens the non volatile free estrogens transfer from the liquid phase to the solid phase by adsorption and to be further biodegraded the adsorption rates of estrogens were determined under the inactivation of microbes by nan3 as described in section 2 2 accordingly the relative contribution of biodegradation was calculated as the difference between total removal and adsorption fig 6 the total removal efficiency of e2 rapidly reached 84 6 3 8 by ags and 71 9 2 4 by as at 1 h and stabilized in 5 h biodegradation was calculated to be the dominant removal mechanism of e2 occupying 64 1 0 7 and 58 7 1 4 in the overall removal by ags 99 3 0 6 and as 90 2 1 2 respectively ee2 was removed rapidly in 5 min with a high proportion of adsorption the total removal efficiencies of ee2 by as and ags were 72 3 1 7 and 89 5 2 3 of which the adsorption accounted for 46 5 1 5 and 50 7 0 9 respectively the results proved ee2 was more resistant to biodegradation than e2 despite the similarity between their molecular structures this is likely related to the fact that ee2 is a synthetic estrogen with an ethinyl group on c17 which can potentially block the access to the hydroxyl group located in the same position making it more difficult to be degraded 70 73 in general e2 removal mainly depends on biodegradation while adsorption plays a leading role in the ee2 removal explaining for the difference between the removal efficiencies of two estrogens in sbrs moreover the removal performance of ags on both estrogens either adsorption or biodegradation were superior to those of as 3 4 4 dynamics of microbial community in sbrs the microbial community structure of granular sludge in the ags reactors was analyzed by high throughput sequencing to investigate the effects of estrogens on microbes the identified microbial community at the phylum level in ags samples were shown in fig 7 a proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in both reactors throughout the operation the relative abundances of proteobacteria increased from 46 3 to 65 7 and 70 4 in the r1 and r2 reactor respectively while those of bacteroidetes presented an overall downward trend in the two reactors over time the decreasing extent of bacteroidetes in the r1 reactor was less than that in the r2 reactor besides actinobacteria and firmicutes enriched more in the r1 reactor indicating their resistance to estrogens many estrogens degraders are subject to the above phyla which is in accordance with our results 49 in contrast some microbes were inhibited by estrogens the relative abundances of nitrospirae and verrucomicrobia significantly decreased in the r1 reactor from 40 days on p 0 05 as reported in previous investigations nitrospirae and verrucomicrobia presented high sensitivity to the exposure to organic pollutants and followed by significant decrease in their abundances which might be responsible for the deterioration of nitrogen removal in the sbr 74 76 gemmatimonadetes eventually disappeared in the r1 reactor while increased obviously in the r2 reactor over time p 0 05 the dynamics of the top genera in the ags samples were presented in the heatmap fig 7b zoogloea was found to be the most dominant bacteria in both reactors which enriched faster and maintained a higher relative abundance in the r1 reactor than in the r2 reactor it was reported that zoogloea could enhance the adhesion and hydrophobicity of sludge by eps secretion thereby promoting microbial aggregation and granular stability under estrogens stress 77 78 thauera known for its eps secretion and denitrifying ability enriched in both reactors for nitrogen removal and keeping granular stability 79 some species of thauera are also found to be aromatic compounds degraders 80 meanwhile sphingomonas and pseudomonas significantly enriched after addition of estrogens into the r1 reactor p 0 05 which are reported that possess the ability to convert e2 to e1 but few strains can further degrade e1 81 84 the relative abundances of rhodococcus novosphingobium and brevundinomas also increased to 2 56 3 42 and 5 27 in the r1 reactor after adding estrogens respectively estrogen degrading cultures of these genera are widely isolated from activated sludge 85 87 pseudomonas and rhodococcus belong to only eight genera that have been identified to degrade both natural and synthetic estrogens 49 the above bacteria endowed ags with high biodegradation capacity of estrogens conversely significant decline in the relative abundances of paracoccus gemmatimonas nitrospira were detected in the r1 reactor p 0 05 indicating the inhibitory effects of estrogens the responses of microbial community to estrogens pressure were attributed to multiple processes estrogens resistant microbes were selectively enriched and eps secretors also increased to protect pollutants degraders and other species in granules which help maintain the overall microbial activity of ags several functional microbes were greatly inhibited by estrogens explaining for the deterioration of reactor performance in short term redundancy analysis rda was conducted to reveal the potential relationship between the top 20 genera and physiochemical properties during operation the mlss svi the ratio of food and microorganisms f m pn and ps contents estrogens concentrations were selected as possible indicators as shown in fig 8 microbial communities were significantly dissimilar from those in r1 and r2 from 40 day on p 0 05 the comparison between r1 40 and r1 80 also reflected a dynamic shift of microbial community in ags under the continuous inflow of estrogens while the difference decreased at 120 d operation the relative abundances of the dominant genus zoogloea sphingomonas pseudomonas and brevundinomas had positive correlation with e2 and ee2 suggesting the ability of these microorganisms for withstanding high selective pressures however nitrospira was significantly decreased under the shock of estrogens p 0 05 also svi and the change of ps content were significantly associated with microbial community p 0 05 especially in r1 80 the results suggested that the deterioration of sludge settleability played a key role in shaping the relative abundances and dominant genera and the microbes capable of secreting ps reflected the superiority after estrogens addition the pn content was also studied while no statistically significant correlation was found p 0 05 the rda analysis indicated that e2 and ee2 concentrations were the most profound influencing variable of estrogens at the genus level followed by svi and ps content 4 conclusions in this study ags obtained strong resistance and adaptability to the two estrogens namely e2 and ee2 the removal performance of cod nitrogen and phosphorus recovered rapidly under estrogens pressure with the simultaneous removal efficiencies of 93 5 e2 and 84 8 ee2 adsorption and biodegradation jointly contributed to the removal of estrogens by ags however the contribution ratio of two mechanisms in total removal of e2 and ee2 differed a lot the adsorption were heterogeneous multi layer and chemical processes with carboxylic groups hydroxyl groups amides and polysaccharides on ags acting as the possible adsorption sites the functional bacteria including zoogloea sphingomonas pseudomonas and brevundinomas played important roles in resisting estrogens via biodegradation and eps secretion the results provide prospects for the potential of ags to efficiently remove both nutrients and micropollutants like estrogens declaration of competing interest the
